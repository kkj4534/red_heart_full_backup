      "title": "AITA for lying to my mother because I didn't think she'd react well to the truth?",
      "description": "I (18M) have known I was gay since I was ~11 or 12 years old, and I kinda realised I'd never fancied a girl or woman in my life. I had the expected struggle with coming to grips with it but it honestly wasn't that difficult for me to come to terms with myself. \n\nHowever. For all of my life it's been just my mum and I at home, as I'm an only child and my dad passed away before I was born. Mum has never been overtly homophobic, per se. Like, she isn't the type of person to bang on about how gay is disgusting and homos are gonna burn in hell and it's all sick and perverse etc. But she *is* the type of person who makes comments about how she \"doesn't see the point\" of Pride and claims she doesn't get why marriage equality is \"such a big deal\". Also, when my cousin came out as lesbian and started bringing her girlfriend to family events, Mum semi-frequently complained about her \"shoving her sexuality down everyone's throats\" and how she \"doesn't mind, just doesn't see why [COUSIN] is so 'in your face' about it\". (To clarify, cousin is very much *not* into PDAs so it's not like she and her girlfriend are constantly making out in public or w/e, they just hang out, dance together, etc.) All this to say, I don't believe my mother actively hates gay people or wishes any kind of harm or ill will upon any of us, but she's made it clear in the past she doesn't particularly *like* gay people very much either. \n\nBecause of this, I've kept my sexuality from her. I convinced myself that coming out while under her roof could get real awkward for me. I didn't think she'd be angry but I guessed she'd be uncomfortable, a la how she feels about my cousin, and I couldn't take that level of awkwardness in my own living situation. I'm going to uni in September and will be moving ~1.5hr drive from my hometown for it. My plan was to come out after I moved out so that, even if there was some discomfort there, at least I wouldn't be around it constantly. Suffice to say, this didn't happen. \n\nBasically, I lent her my laptop to send some emails for work while hers was broken and I guess I left my Facebook open and she say some messages between me and this boy I've been sort of seeing. She confronted me about it and I told her because what's the sense in denying it? She *flipped* - not because I'm gay, but because I'd been lying to her all this time (I have explicitly told her I'm straight and brought girls home in the past). I tried to explain that I wasn't comfortable coming out yet, she took offence and kicked me out. I'm currently staying with my grandparents and I don't know if I'm ever gonna go back to my mum's. \n\nI feel kinda shitty. Not because I'm gay, obviously I know I'm NTA for that. But maybe mum's right, maybe lying to her was a sucky thing to do. Like I could've dodged questions about sexuality/not brought girls home - more so avoided the truth than outright lying. I love my mum and I don't want to lose her over this. AITA?",

      "description": "Ok so I didnt know this subreddit existed until today and I made this account just for this story.\nThis is pretty long so I'll put a tldr at the bottom.\n\nSo my mom has had this friend she met in church for as long as I can remember. We'll call her Karen for the sake of the meme. \nMy mom and Karen used to be best of friends as I was growing up, so naturally my sister and i would play with her kids. Karen had 2 daughters, OS &amp; LS (older sister &amp; little sister.)\nNow the daughters could not be any more different. OS is your stereotype blond airhead, while LS is more quiet and reserved.\nNow the sisters really didnt like spending time together so OS would come bother me while our sisters played. \n\nAll of this is important to understanding the situation.\n\nSo as I was growing up naturally me and OS got to be close friends, I even had a massive crush on her several years ago (which will forever be one of my most hated memories.)\nDue to this I would almost instantly take her side on pretty much anything. Karen liked to brag to other people in the church about how LS was such a troubled child when in reality she was just different. Looking back it's quite sad she had to grow up like that.\nAnyway, as I got older things I hadn't noticed before began to appear about Karen and OS.\nKaren had a tendency to cause drama for no particular reason. Once my sister told OS that her shirt didnt match her shoes and Karen got PISSED. She started to yell at my mom on the phone about this all the time. They didnt talk at all for nearly a month.\nI have two instances of when Karen would send me angry texts about something I did that pissed her off. Keep in mind I was a child when those happened.\nAs for OS, as we grew up I noticed something about her that I hadn't before. Ever conversation we had would always be about her, and nothing but her. Even if I tried to take the conversation another way she would just wait for me to finish my sentence then drive it back to her.\nAs of late I've been avoiding them both. One of the instances with Karen I mentioned before is actually about me avoiding them. \nI'm sure the whole situation isnt done, not until I move away anyway.\nIf you've gotten this far, thanks for reading and please tell me, am I the asshole? I've been wondering if my decision is right or not.\n\nTLDR; Childhood friends, Karen and her daughter became toxic and undesirable to be around so I cut off contact with them.\n",

      "description": "I started work at a Big 4 public accounting (biggest in our city) firm 3 weeks ago as a Year 1 tax staff, in a relatively small (but still busy) office in the Midwest.  I also just moved here in late Dec to be with my bf, and am also studying for the CPA exam, with BEC scheduled for March 2nd. It's my first full-time job, and I'm getting situated to the long hours and work lifestyle of public accounting. \n\nThe hours haven't been crazy yet, but as expected my schedule is packed for all of March - about 60 hrs/week, which probably translates to 70-ish hours actually spent working, since I'm new (so that's Monday-Saturday, with some Sundays).  My work won't die down until early April when returns are due, and I've let my family and bf know months in advance that I will most likely be too busy to do much more than work and sleep. \n\nMy dad and I have a pretty good relationship; he called me earlier today, to let me know that he's expecting to bring my grandpa's ashes back from China in early March, and asked me to fly down in mid-March for the burial of his ashes.  Grandpa had passed away in April last year, and my dad has wanted to bring him back for a proper burial since then so I know this weighs heavily on him. \n\nMy dad really values family, and loves me and my siblings like crazy.  He tried to encourage me by saying my brother and sister already have plans to fly in, but my brother is in law school and sister works for a Silicon Valley company, so they both have much more flexibility than I do.  \n\nI pretty much told him flat-out that it's really unlikely I'll be able to take a few days off (fly in Friday, leave and go back on Saturday) to come down for his burial.  He asked me to bring it up with my seniors but I am reluctant to do so - it's my first busy season, and it's widely understood you shouldn't take time off during busy hours. \n\nAITA for not wanting to go back home for my grandpa's burial? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I approached him and said “I have these chicken tenders for you if you’d like them.” I extended them to him and as he took them, and as he was taking them said, “I want lasagna, can you give me ten bucks so I can go buy a lasagna?” \n\nI responded and said “all I have are these, you can have them if you’d like.” He put them next to him and said “Can’t you just give me money for a lasagna?” \n\nSo I picked the box of tenders back up and said “sorry, I’m not going to give you money for a lasagna” and began walking away. \n\nMy friend seemed to think that I was a huge asshole for doing so, but I didn’t want to waste my leftovers on someone who clearly didn’t seem to want them.

      "description": "My aunt (dad's sister) and my dad have a complicated relationship. They have been close their entire lives, and are only a couple of years apart in age (mid 70s each). My dad's on the spectrum and he often pisses people off like it's his job.\n\nHis relationship with his sister has degraded severely over the last couple of years to the point to where they're not talking any more. I find this to be a pity, but up until now they've both been in very good health, so I thought they'd eventually reconcile after some time apart. My aunt takes slights very seriously and when she decides to be furious with someone it's almost like they're dead to her. My aunt is extremely generous and kind as long as the people in her life actively appreciate the impact that she's made in theirs.\n\nYesterday I received a message from my mom (divorced from my dad) that my aunt has meningitis and is in the hospital. Also, my cousin has had to drop everything and flew a couple of states over to stay with her in the hospital. I was told explicitly not to tell my father, in all caps. I called my cousin this morning and talked to her about the severity of the situation, my aunt is falling in and out of consciousness and can't deal with a lot of stimulation at the moment, so no one can talk with her except my cousin and my Aunt's BF. When going through everything my aunt said things like, \"don't tell \"my dad\", don't even tell him if I'm dead\". My cousin tried to talk her down from that, but she was having none of that. She's basically staking this out as a final wish kind of demand and the family is taking the request with the utmost seriousness.\n\nI told my cousin that it would be extraordinarily sad if my dad was never given the option to reconcile with his little sister while she was dying. She cried, I cried, and then I told her I wouldn't tell him out of respect for my aunt.\n\nSo I spent the day struggling deeply with this knowledge. Eventually, after thinking through what kind of incredible betrayal of my father it would be for everyone else in the family to know about this except for him, and what kind of weight it would be for him to bare if she was to pass away without him even trying to reconnect, I called him. I asked him if there was anything big or new with him, and he replied like everything was great. Then told him that there may be something really big going on, I told him I couldn't give him specifics as to the who or what, but he's smart so he got enough information from me to follow a bread crumb trail that I know exists. I've already had confirmation that he's digging into it.\n\nEven if she won't take his call or my cousin won't let any notification get through to her, my dad at least deserves the opportunity to make up for past mistakes, and at the very least know in his heart his last action towards her wasn't tinted with acrimony. I believe my aunt deserves the same.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for basically defying my Aunt's dying wish?",

He has never been one to really accept charity and wouldn't really ask for help, and I wanted to help out a little.  \n\nNow, his wife happens to be a very talented artist and her and I share a love for a certain video game franchise, I wanted to get a new tattoo and I commissioned her to draw something for me that was themed around this game.  I paid everything up front, in two payments, along with a 25% tip on top of it because while definitely want what I'm paying for this whole thing to was help them out in a way that didnt make him feel like he was taking charity.  This agreement and the payment was made back in January, and I realized that she had kids to take care of etc. so I asked if could get it on Apr. 1st which gave her about 2 months to finish.\n\nCut to Apr. 1st.  She has been completely unresponsive to my attempts contact her for about two weeks by now.  Standard texts like \"Hey, how are things coming?\" and stuff like that have been totally ignored.  Finally on the 3rd, knowing that due to the way the deal went down I wouldn't have anyway to get that money back, I contacted my friend (the husband) to see what the hell was going on.  Up until this point he had no idea that any of this was going on or that I had given her money or anything.  He apparently spoke with her, I'm not sure how that went down or anything, and she did contact me shortly afterwards with an apology but I still haven't gotten the piece. \n\nAITA for bringing husband into it when it was a deal between her and I?

      "description": "For starters.  I think I am the asshole here.  \n\nI [27M] and GF [25F] have been dating for about 8 months now.  Things have been great.  She is without a doubt probably the coolest and most amazing person I have met.  Our personal and social chemistry is off the charts.  Ive never gotten along with someone of the opposite sex more.  \n\nIt has been one of the best relationships I have ever had.  Until just recently...she confessed that she did not really enjoy sex.  That it actually hurts her and is uncomfortable for her and that she gets anxiety if I attempt to initiate or partake in any sort of sexual activities with her.  \n\nI asked how long this has been going on (thinking something might be medically wrong) as we've had sex quite a bit including numerous times in an evening, etc.  \n\nWhich is when she said she has always kinda felt this way about it but just wanted to impress me and what not.  \n\nWe have not had sex in about 5 weeks now and even though I do love and care about her greatly.  I do not know if I am able to carry on or continue a relationship with a dead bedroom.  So much so that I have been playing with the thought of asking if we can break things off and that we might be better off as just friends.  ",

      "description": "I teach at an elementary school in a small town. Our day is over at 3:00, and I’m supposed to let students out of my room at 2:55. Staff leave at 3:00. I have 2 students who used to be picked up by their bus at 3:30. Our school secretary, and director would need to stay until the kids would get picked up.  \n\nOne day in December, my director made a deal with this bus driver, that instead of coming late, that he could come pick these students 10 minutes early, at 2:45. Since January, I’ve had an alarm set on my phone every day for 2:40, and every week or so, one of these kids would come tell me that if I didn’t let them out earlier, their bus driver would leave them, and come back for them at 3:30 instead. That would upset me to no end: why would he punish these kids when they walked out of my room every day 15 minutes earlier than the rest of the kids? why would I let them out even earlier?\n\nYesterday, I was giving an assessment at the end of the day. At 2:30, the afternoon bus duty teacher came into my room, and told me that these kids’ bus driver was asking for them, and that he would leave them behind if they didn’t come out now. I was shocked, and felt this was the last straw, so I asked this teacher to watch my class so I could talk to the bus driver. I ran outside and told the bus driver that I wasn’t letting those kids out until 2:40. He argued with me a bit, and I repeated myself again. My volume was raised, so I could hear myself speak (I’m completely deaf on my right side), but also because he was arguing with me, saying he needed the kids. \n\nI went back to my classroom and when it was 2:40, I let them go: no bus. I later asked the teacher on duty when the driver left, and she said he left at 2:38. \n\nI asked another driver for his boss’s phone number. I told the boss the story, explained  that this bus driver demanded kids at 2:30, and the boss asked what time school let out. I said this bus driver normally wanted them at 2:45, but that the school let out at 2:55. Boss said, the bus driver should be getting there at 2:55, and said he’d take care of it. \n\nToday the bus driver drives up at 3:30. When we talk, he said he left early because of the way I spoke to him. I said I was only telling him that I wouldn’t let them out until 2:40, and explained that I was profoundly deaf in one ear, and he waved it off. I said his boss told me he’d arrive at 2:55. He said his boss told him to get there at 2:55, and yet, there at 3:30. I continued to question why these kids were being picked up early or late and not at 2:55, and he just kept saying he could get at school at 2:30 or 3:30. He also mentioned that I wasn’t going through the right channels by talking to him directly. Lost for words, I walked away telling him that even if he blamed me for the way I spoke to him, that leaving those kids behind because of it was wrong.\n\nAITA for wanting my students picked up when school lets out?\n",

      "description": "I really just don’t like him very much. He’s just... insufferable. He’s only fun when he’s drunk (even then, debatable. He’s an alcoholic but won’t admit it.), and he gets extremely angry every time something doesn’t go his way. It’s been that way for pretty much my entire life. He’s not violent or anything, but it’s kind of annoying hearing him yell because he doesn’t understand technology when he thinks he does or whenever he loses a simple game. He literally threw away an entire Uno game because he thought we (family) were breaking the rules. (He looked it up, and we were by accident (turns out that if you have an Uno, but nobody calls it out until it’s too late, nothing is supposed to happen.), but that was AFTER he already ruined the game.)\n\nAnyway, my last real straw with him was when he messed with this LEGO minifigure frame I had in the hallway of my mom’s house. He completely changed everything about it, and actually managed to lose pieces of it after messing with it. I asked him repeatedly to stop, but he just wouldn’t. It’s petty, but combined with my feelings for him already, I flew into a rage and just decided to not talk to him at all, to the extent of blocking him on my contacts.\n\nHe’s moved out, with a good-paying job and everything, but I still think he’s an insufferable prick. I feel like maybe I’ve taken it too far, but I just... don’t like him. I’m definitely biased as I write this, but still.",

      "description": "Little backstory I’m 18, my parents broke up around three/ four years ago. It wasn’t actually that bad because they both got much better away from each other, both were happier. \n\nDuring this time me and my mum were close, (perhaps too close) she would tell me everything going on with her life, she even told me about dates she had been on as I was the only one who noticed out of my siblings that she was dating people.\n\nI was close with my dad, but not as close as I wasn’t living with him. \nI wasn’t as close as I could have been as my mum would tell me at every opportunity when he hadn’t paid child support and that we were struggling because he wasn’t helping out. \n\nFlash forward to today, both parents have respected partners and are getting married in the summer!\n\n This isn’t a “my parent has a partner that isn’t my actual parent so I don’t like them” type of situation. I love my soon-to-be stepmom, we talk all the time, she feels like a really cool friend who always calls me out on my shit, it also helps that she is only ten years older than me (but that’s not important). \n\nI really liked my stepdad at first, we have the same kind of humour, we both like marvel, that kind of thing. \n\nHowever, as the years have gone by I hated living with him and my mother, all my siblings were given chores in the house and the parents would come home from work and sit on the sofa and chat. They would ask each other about their day and hang off each others every word. It’s not hard to see that they are deeply in love. \n\nThe only attention we seem to get from them are about chores. I’m not saying we shouldn’t do chores, far from it but it’s difficult coming home from school and then having to clean an entire room of the house. \n\nIf it’s the kitchen it involves doing the dishwasher (emptying and filling) sweeping and mopping the floor, washing any dishes that can’t be put in the dishwasher, doing the cup of tea, clearing and washing the sides down and so on. \n\nIt doesn’t seem like much but when there’s six people living in the house mess adds up. \n\nWhen they get home the parents don’t seem to do anything, they sit on the sofa and talk about their day, showing funny stuff they find online, the only time they talk to us that isn’t about chores is around the dining table. \n\nIt isn’t normal talk that is relaxed and random it’s 3 questions that go around in a circle that everyone must answer. \n\n1.How are you feeling?\n2.How was your day?\n3. What are you looking forward to tomorrow?\n\nAfter these questions are done they don’t talk much but to each other. I can’t stand these questions because they feel so unnatural, it’s not normal to have a set of questions to ask at mealtimes is it?\n\nThey never talk to us one on one to see how we’re doing, my mum used to tell me everything and how I know nothing because my step dad is now the person she tells everything to. (Not that I should know EVERYTHING it’s just hard going from talking about everything to now not even talking)\n\nOn the weekend when the step kids go to their mums and we go to our dads they have what they call “mum and [stepdadsname] day of fun” where they go out and have a meal and have a walk and spend money on each other. \n\nI would have no problem for this except they never take us anywhere that requires a lick of money and are always looking for free stuff to do. (I understand the argument that you don’t need money to have a good time) They make up the excuse that they don’t have any money as everything is going towards the wedding yet new things constantly arrive in the post each week and they are going out every week without fail. \n\nA couple of weeks ago me and my mum had a falling out as I expressed some of the feelings I had. \n\nShe told me that I was calling her a bad parent\n\nI said no but you act as if you love him more than us, you hang off his every word, you can’t get enough of each other. We see how you treat him and then compare that to how you treat us. There’s nothing. \n\nShe kept telling me she wasn’t going to change her parenting style for me so I could feel more comfortable in her home. \n\nI resorted by asking her when was the last time she told me she was proud of me. \n\nShe said she says it on Facebook all the time. \n\nI said not on Facebook for the world to see,  when was the last time you said it to my face. \n\nShe didn’t say anything. \n\nWhenever I go to my mum about these things (problems which I feel I should be able bring to my mum) She always gets angry and defensive and tells my step dad. \n\nIt’s always a text from him telling me that I’ve made my mum cry and that I should just apologise to make her feel better even if I don’t mean it. He tells me she thinks I don’t love her and that I’m trying to get my siblings to gang up on them when I tell her they feel the same. He tells me I’m childish and I need to be mature to apologise to her but I feel like I shouldn’t apologise for feeling upset and telling them about this. \n\nI would break down constantly because I realised how much my mum would constantly show affection to my stepdad and not anyone else, she has changed and she can’t see that. \n\nAnyway, I probably did not make a bit of sense. \n\nAm I just an asshole brat who is making everything a bigger deal than needs be or is there justification in telling her how I feel? \n\n\n",

      "description": "First off I wanna say that this is a throwaway account so that I dont get real hate on my regular account on reddit. Anonymity is the great thing about reddit, but even then there is a limit to what people believe is socially acceptable. Also, I understand that alot of people may not believe this as a true post, but rest assured, it is or at least treat it as such when you make your judgements. \n\nOk so I have been dating and having sex for years now as I am in my mid 30s, but only recently I have become very aware of reading the situation when a woman is either calling out for help from her relationship or unsatisfied. Usually they are people who have been together for a long time or got married at a young age, etc. Because I am semi attractive (a 5-6 by my own standards, although I may be harsher on myself than others are) and I have learned the things that women like to hear and how to make them have a good time, I find it easy to bed them. I don't hit em and quit em, I have sometimes a drawn out affair or a remain friends with benefits. \n\nSo personally, I know I am an asshole, but something about having sex with another man's girl is very hot and gives me an ego boost. That being the case, I do not feel bad about doing it and I do not believe I am the only asshole here for several reasons.\n\n1) It is the girl's responsibility to keep her vows true to her bf/husband. I did not make any vow to be faithful for them, nor do I believe in the sanctity of someone's marriage if both partners are not interested anymore.\n\n2) These women have already checked out of the relationship and do not love their SOs anymore. The old adage is true, men cheat for sex and women cheat for \"love\" although I hesitate to use love as I do not believe in it and I feel this is a time of misandrist statement. Women cheat for partner change, if it wasn't me, they would be fucking someone else and leaving.\n\n3) Most of these guys are either neglectful, cheating themselves, or not treating their women with the love and respect they deserve. If they were, I would not be able to fuck their women.\n\nSo I know I am the asshole, but am I the only asshole? Please do not downvote the post because you hate my actions. I will add a comment that you can obliterate with downvotes.",

      "description": "Context: My Dad has been with his wife for about 22 years. She and I have not gotten along for probably the last 20 years (I am a 30F). \n\nMy husband (32M) and I have been together for 11 years. He is amazing and supportive and really believes I can have a relationship with my Dad sans his wife.\n\nThings are always up and down with she and I but usually down. Like clockwork, at least once a year for the last 10+ years, there is a fight between the two of us, usually right before a family event or holiday when my Dad has asked that we 'work it out'. It causes me so much anxiety and makes me physically sick to my stomach when things start to go south. The thing is, my Dad (65M) A) doesn't want to get involved and B) isn't 'allowed' to know what his wife (60F) and I talk about. If I tell him then I'm 'tattling' on her.\n\nMy husband and I had a beautiful daughter last year and I really don't want her to go through what I've gone through with this toxic relationship. After yet another blow up at Christmas I asked if my Dad's wife would go to therapy with me. I've suggested it to my Dad in the past but he said she wouldn't go. Surprise, surprise she said no. I decided that enough was enough and that if my Dad was unwilling, if she was unwilling then I would be unwilling to work on it anymore. \n\nNeedless to say my Dad was upset. I should also add that my brother(33M), who my Dad's wife likes and gets along with, also decided he didn't want to spend time with her anymore either. My Dad said he understood my decision and would respect it and in time he was 'sure' we'd figure things out. Now I was probably a little blunt but it has been 20 years and I shot that down really quickly. What we're doing isn't fixing anything and this fighting is so so toxic. If she's not willing to talk to a professional (she also prides herself as being a self help type of person) then I don't want her in my life. \n\nWell she accepted that a bit more wholeheartedly than I expected but whatever (said it's what she wanted all along and didn't understand why I wanted a relationship with her in the first place). She did however say that she would miss my daughter who was only 9 months at the time and asked if she could still be in her life as her \"Bonus Grandma\". I said no. That she did not take so well and responded with \"well this is why I kept my boys (now 31 and 34) away from you all this time.... One I only see at family holidays and the other lives half way across the world ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nAnywho, we're coming up to my daughter's first birthday and I just know my Dad is going to bring it up and how his wife feels 'left out' (he's used that excuse before) AITA for not wanting this toxic relationship in my life and to protect my daughter from it as well?",

      "title": "WIBTA for informing the employer of two guys who started a fight at a pub at their work?",
      "description": "tldr: Two guys started a brawl at my local pub and really violently attacked my boyfriend just for trying to break it up while wearing their company’s logo and at the marina where they work. WIBTA if I told their employer about it?\n\nHere’s the story: Was at the pub last night with my boyfriend and a friend of a friend. It’s a pretty casual place, the local pub near a marina, we were playing that phone head game with our servers and having a few drinks. We were sitting at the bar and two guys who work for a company at the marina, who are known for being notorious assholes, were sitting at a table sorta close to us. They were yelling shit and being obnoxious and super rude throughout the whole night. Making fun of us for the game and whatever. It doesn’t really bother me, I don’t care what they think, but I can tell the friend of a friend is getting annoyed. \n\nA little bit later the guys start yelling more shit to the friend of a friend, making fun of what he’s wearing etc. He’s sort of a hippy looking guy; he’s wearing a colourful toque. The final straw I guess was them making fun of said hat, and when they asked where he got it, he said it was his dead grandfather’s toque, at which point they say something along the lines of “good, your grandpa was probably a f*g”\n\nWell the friend of a friend loses his shit at this and stomps over to this guy and drags him to the ground. The other guy leaps up and the three of them are fighting now. The two female servers jump in and are trying to pull them apart, my boyfriend is sort of just watching trying to figure out how to help and decides to reach in to help the girls separate the guys and get them off of each other. \n\nWell, the guy my boyfriend grabbed suddenly thinks he’s trying to get in on the fight and he slams him to the ground, gets on top of him and shoves his fucking fingers in his eyes. I was staying out of it until now, but I got really scared so I leapt up and was trying to pull this guy off my boyfriend (who wasn’t even fighting back) and this guy changes from stabbing him the eyes to wrapping his hands around my boyfriend’s neck and so now I’m like totally freaking out, screaming and yanking on this guy to get him off. At the same time, the other sever gets the other two guys to break apart and I guess they see me and the other server trying to pull him off and so he like leaps on him to get him off and at that point everyone is finally stopped fighting. Me and the other girls are standing in between the guys, trying to keep it that way. The servers yell at the three guys to get out. The friend of a friend who started it goes and stands at the door, says he will leave, he just needs his hat and his phone. I hand them to him, he leaves. The other two guys are now screaming and yelling with the servers about how it’s not their fault and why should they have to leave an the servers are like “just get the fuck out!”\n\nWell, they still don’t leave. My boyfriend is trying to calm the situation, and the guy who fucking attacked him comes over and apologizes. I guess he realizes my boyfriend wasn’t trying to fight him and my boyfriend just says like “it’s fine just like, not sure why you felt it necessary to stab your fingers in my eyes”. He apologized a bunch more times and pays for our bill. We’re offering to leave too but the servers were feeling pretty scared of the two guys so they asked us to stay just as back up until they leave. But the one guy who started the whole thing is just sitting at the table staring down the servers, demanding an apology. And they are just like what the fuck.\n\nSomeone in the kitchen called the cops while this was all going on and one of the girls talks to them and then calls the manager, who says he’s on his way in. Finally the two guys leave, and the girls lock up and my boyfriend and I head home.\n\nMy boyfriend is fine, has a black eye but isn’t seriously hurt or anything, but I’m just so mad and shocked that someone would resort to something so violent. And not only that, but they were wearing company sweaters at the bar near where they work. \n\nI really, really want to contact the company and tell them what happened, and how they initiated this brawl and responded so atrociously violent. My question is, would that make me the asshole? Should I just leave it alone since no one got seriously hurt? The two guys will most likely be barred from the pub by the manager, so it’s not like we’ll see them again, and my boyfriend seems pretty over it but I’m just still feeling really shook about it.",

      "description": "My younger sister, R, will be graduating from university this May. I am extremely proud of her and would love to help her celebrate. Unfortunately, what she wants is for her graduation party is both her mom’s side and her dad’s side to attend the same party. \n\nSome background: my mom married her dad, A, when I was very young. Mom and A had my little sister, R, shortly after. A was abusive towards our mom, as was his family. The step children (myself and my two older sisters) were tormented by R’s older half brother (A’s first child). R has been shielded by much of what her dad has done, and has a good relationship with him. My mom believes it’s not okay to bad mouth a child’s other parent and has never divulged the complete history to her, thought I know she has heard it from others and her dad has been telling her “his side”.  Side note: A adopted me when married to my mom, then “unadopted” me when they divorced so he didn’t have to pay child support on me.\n\nAs you can image the relationship between the two families has been strained and all celebrations have been separate. R blames my mom for this, at it is my mom that does want anything to do with A. She recently expressed her desire to bring the families together and have just one graduation party. My mom and I have talked about it, and she really doesn’t want to do this, but is getting guilted into it from my sister. I have let my mom know I won’t be going, but I know it will cause a lot of drama when I tell my sister. \n\nAm I being selfish for holding a grudge for more than a decade and putting it before my sisters accomplishments? If my mom is going am I being an asshole for not? \n",

So one day over text I asked her to the movies. She said yes and we went a week or two later. The date went good ( I think), but after it was over she said she only wanted to be friends.

I realize that she didn’t really want to be friends anymore, and sent an emoji of a guy boxing as a joke. That was on a Friday. The next school day I got called into the VP’s office.

We had just ordered January's grocery stock online on the 3rd.  Since initially I was going only for 17 days, I didn't say anything and was going to pay for everything. The stay later got extended to 24 days, and towards the end of the 20th day, it again got extended to 45 days (so I'm returning on the night of 19th of Feb).\n\nMeanwhile, my flatmates had been adding me in all the monthly expenses (both for January and recently ordered new stock for February) - groceries, veggies, gas cylinders, eveything; and since I am not there, they've been consuming everything. I was already going to pay for the essentials, namely rent, cook, cleaning, wifi, electricity etc, but when I said I wouldn't pay for this month's groceries because I simply am not using them, out of nowhere they started behaving really rudely, and told me not to enter the kitchen when I return, or even touch any of the stuff, and that they'd 'see me if they ever caught me using any of it'. They said a lot of other mean hurtful stuff that made me decide to leave the apartment.   \n\nAm I the asshole for denying to pay for one month out of two when I'll be home only for 15 out of 59 days? And also when I'm agreeing to pay for one month anyway. Should I leave the place, or try to make it work?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, I'm a first time poster. Came across this thanks to vids on YouTube. A little backstory. We are 4 people renting and living in a 4 bedroom house. We had a set of rules that were agreed on when we move in together. But the ones discussed here are the \" guests\" rule. We agreed that guests were allowed one but for overnight stays, everyone must agree to it and can only be on weekends unless it's an emergency. ( We are fairly young and all of us have had some experience with shitty people). \nEverything is ok untill one of my roommates started bringing his girlfriend over on the weekends. We didn't mind at first, but she's here from Saturday to Monday and then back again on Wed. \nShe always ends up doing her laundry and doing alot of cooking, which I don't mind since is a domestic thing once in a while. But every, fucking, weekend. And then when she's over, the \" volume or loud noise\" rule goes out the window. Which if it's a  weekend, I don't mind but on a Sunday when we all need to be up and out by 5:30, is a bit annoying. It's been 2 years and I feel she should be contributing since she's here 4 days a week. She doesn't really help with cleaning or even just helping take out the trash ( trash days are Mondays). I just feel like the one time in the week I do get to relax, is the time of the week I need to work around another person. It's not fair that she is here every weekend.",

      "description": "warning: long wall of text coming\n\nMy fiance has a daughter from a previous relationship, let's call her E. They were not been very 'close' because she lived with her mom in another state. When E was 14, her mother relinquished her parental rights but E didnt want to move here, so she moved with her grandmother (my MIL). Two years ago, E finished high school and she decided to move in with us so she could go to college here in the city.\n\nSix months living here, fiance and E started constant fights about teenage behaviour: rude, inconsiderate, disrespectful. I understand it's normal but the bad attitude has been escalating. I never try to act like her mom because I'm not but I constantly try to give her emotional support though she rarely accepts my help. The rules here are very clear and we have spoken with her a million times about unacceptable behaviour and she had been warned that the constant escalating 'will result in her not being welcome here anymore'.\n\nThis happened last week:\n\nFriday, fiance called E at 11:30 pm because she knows she needs to ask for permission before going out with friends, especially if she will be out until late or staying over at a friend's house. He sent her a message asking her whereabouts and so. She just said 'We'll talk tomorrow' then stopped responding. This was not the first time but other times she would apologize and recognize she did wrong. When she came back saturday morning fiance started saying that what she did was wrong but she started to blame everything on us (?). That day she continously disrespected both me and my fiance with plain rude remarks. \n\nSunday: discussion regarding an important document she lost escalated quickly to her telling fiance to 'fuck off' and screaming, to which he (wrongly) reacted screaming louder and throwing her out of the house (she is not a minor). I calmly asked her to leave because fiance was (wrongly) acting crazy and told her to \"stay with her boyfriend, where she had been staying when she didnt come home\" and she left. My intention was making her stop a growing conflict, a crazy situation.\n\nI was aware she was not 'staying in the street'. She did go to her bf's house but it seems wednesday she drove 2 hours to nearest relative's house at midnight, next day she called demanding child support. Saturday  they made up when she asked to come back home. \n\nFiance and I spoke and I told him I was worried about this toxic environment and the fact that their discussions were dragging me into constant anxiety. I told him that he was the main asshole, but that's another story.\n\nE is back home, she apologized to her dad (and he apologized too) but I have not spoken to her because I work funny hours so I haven't seen her. We seriously discussed asking her to live somewhere else, give her child support so she can pay for a room to stay near her university\n\nAITA for feeling relieved if this happens?",

My wife worked for the first seven years of our marriage, and when our oldest was four, she quit her job to be a SAHP.  She said it was because after paying for daycare, that she felt she was making too little money to continue working.   This implied to me after our kids were older (and not in need of daycare), that she would be returning to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do most of the home upkeep myself and also fold laundry, wash dishes, some of the cooking.   I do the yardwork myself after repeated hassles with our sons about cutting the yard or raking leaves that I do these chores myself.  My wife feels like I should be paying our sons to cut the yard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen our oldest was a senior in high school, my wife said that she would be finding a job.  I expressed my concerns about money, wanting to be able to continue saving for retirement, to have money for going on a vacation, to have money to have the house remodeled.  We have a nice house, two older cars, are able to go out to dinner when we want, but do not go on expensive vacations or otherwise indulge ourselves.  It would be very helpful to have the additional income\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree years later, my wife has not found a job.  She finally has told me that she does not want to work, and that since I make so much money, that she does not need to work.   During the last two years, we have spent over $20,000 on our oldest's college; we have stopped saving.  Our middle child is graduating from high school this spring, our youngest is also in high school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife says that she has to stay home to take care of the kids.  My day consists of leaving for work around 7am and returning around 6:30.  Some nights I come home to dirty dishes and leftovers, some nights I come home to my wife saying she does not know what to have for dinner.   As far as I can tell, my wife does very little during the day, sometimes she makes dinner.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife feels like I am being too hard on our oldest, I have told him that he needs to look for a summer job.  Last summer, he found a job only after he had been home for seven weeks.  And the job was only part time, so he did not earn that much.  My wife says that our oldest has to deal with the consequences of not working, and all I can think is about spending $10,000 on a really nice vacation or buying a used Miata instead of paying his tuition next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for wanting my wife to work?",

      "description": "Gf and I have been together for almost a year.  Before and during our dating she never mentioned being attracted to women.  \n\nLast week she told me that she thought maybe she was bisexual and wanted to try out a threesome with another girl.  I’m not into the idea at all and told her I really wasn’t comfortable with it.  It turned into a fight.  She told me it’s every man’s fantasy and really didn’t get why I was uncomfortable.  It’s not my fantasy.  \n \n\nLast night she brought it up again.  Now she wants to have a free pass.  Where she can have sex with a girl without me even being involved.   She said I could have a free pass too, but only with guys to “be fair”.  This is a bullshit free pass.  I’m not attracted to men at all.  I told her no and it got tense.  \n\nI can understand her wanting to try and see if it’s for her, but it’s just not a fair situation to me.  She basically just wants to cheat on me and for it to be ok. It would be fair if my free pass was with a girl.  And as ugly as that situation feels I might agree to that.  ",

I do shows like this completely voluntarily as a member of the crew and I really enjoy designing and participating in these shows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy experience on the light and sound board has prompted many people to ask me to host the tech for various on-campus events, things like alumni events, guest speaker events, and outside group events. These events take a decent chunk of time out of my day, and I have to focus my full attention on the event, so I can't do school work while I'm working these events, which will sometime run as late as 8-8:30 (we get out of school at 3:30 for context).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, a friend of mine (also a senior) was paid for constructing a platform for the DJ at a school hosted dance. He was paid a lesser amount than what it would cost to rent a platform, but he was paid for his efforts. This is what really got me to consider asking for payment for the school events that I don't do for fun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this is less Am I the Asshole and more a Would I be the Asshole situation.

      "title": "AITA because I can't be around my recovering addict friend",
      "description": "Needed to vent because I *feel* like the asshole, but I can't do it, i just can't. Also, sorry for the length. \n\nTLDR: My friend goes through phases where he's around constantly and is the biggest part of my life, followed by periods where he nearly overdoses on drugs and isolates himself. This pattern is breaking my heart, and I don't think I can be there for him when he gets out of inpatient this time. \n\nFriend and I have grown up together, our parents were close friends and we lived in the same town. We went to all the same schools, and the same church. Every weekend for almost a year and a half, we volunteered at a food kitchen together. He was my first crush, my first kiss, and my first valentine. We'd gone through so much together. \n\nOur first year of high school, he completely dropped off the map. He started hanging around some new kids, and I had a pretty structured group of friends. I would invite him to things, but most of the time he would decline. I kind of shrugged it off and wondered if maybe his new friends were pressuring him to \"date\" me or something, as most young high schoolers were doing that kind of thing. We still hung out, but it was pretty much only between classes at school.\n\nThe summer before 10th grade his mom had a talk with mine, who then relayed it to me. His mom took him to the doctors one day because he was acting really strange and shaky and had the sweats, wondering if he had the flu or something. It was heroin withdrawal. \n\nI remember being so shocked. I was a sheltered kid, it was a small town, and we were barely *fifteen* for Christ's sakes. At the time, I had never seen pot, much less used heroin. I remember my mom asking me, more like begging me, to tell her if I knew anything about it, anything at all. I mentioned his new friends to her, but that information wasn't anything new to my friend's parents. They knew who he'd been hanging out with, but apparently they didn't know they were kids who had access to those kinds of drugs. \n\nHis family checked him into rehab, and they kind of broke down around that time. They tried to hide it from him, but I think it was pretty obvious to everyone, especially because it was such a small town. His parents separated for a bit, his older brother partially cut himself off from the family, and his younger brother just seemed so lost. I think they were all so shocked by this. When I've talked to my mom about it, she recalls his parents confiding that they just didn't understand. They felt they had done everything right as parents, taught him right from wrong, gave him just a little bit of freedom. She thought they talked openly about things like drugs and alcohol, and she just didn't understand how it had gotten so bad so quickly, and he was so young. We both were. \n\nHe was a part of inpatient rehab for a long, long time, and he never came back to school after that. Our junior year, once he was out, he elected to do nontraditional schooling (sorry, this was a long time ago and I don't remember what it's really called) where he was still technically a high school student, but was taking all of his classes at the local community college. His plan was to graduate with both his high school diploma and his associates degree. \n\nHe wasn't allowed to hang out with his old friends when he got out, the group who had introduced him to drugs in the first place, for obvious reasons, so he and I started to hang out a lot more. I was a flat-out dork, but we had a lot of the same interests. We both loved stand-up comedy and The Sims, so a lot of the time when we hung out we did that kind of stuff. A lot of the stuff we did was either at my house or his house, because his parents were really protective at that point. Our friendship continued smoothly until halfway through senior year.\n\nIn spite of everything, he still managed to get into it again. No matter how hard I pushed, he was withdrawing from me and my group of friends. I said something to both his and my parents, but they just brushed it off as him becoming more introverted; they never saw him act suspiciously in any way. \n\nHe had his own car at this point and his parents rarely used it. One morning really early, his dad was going to work and walked past his son's car, glancing inside. There was a dime bag on the floor. Upon further investigation, his dad found needles inside. He was using again. \n\nI couldn't be there for him as much this time because everything else in my life was moving so fast. I was graduating high school, I was preparing for college. I moved away for school, but only a five hour drive. To my understanding, my friend was doing okay and was in inpatient care again; he couldn't have non-family visitors, so I left for college without saying goodbye. \n\nWe lost touch and so did our parents. His were seeking advice and help from families who had gotten through this thing before, and mine were coping with having me moved out while managing my younger siblings. Just like my friend and I were going through different things, so were they. \n\nWe were friends on Facebook so I could see that he was doing okay. He'd been clean since our senior year, so about five years, a little less. About three months ago, this friend messaged me on Facebook. I'm currently a grad student at XYZ University, and he had just been accepted there to finish up his bachelors. He wanted to reconnect, and I was so excited about this.\n\nFor three months, we were inseparable. We shopped together, took exercise classes together, I introduced him to all of my friends and he became very close with my fiance as well. From the beginning there were things that struck me as weird about his sobriety. He could still drink - and he did, often heavily - and he bought medical marijuana. I brushed these off because every person in recovery is different, and I also wasn't very educated on the subject. I brought it up to my parents during a phone call, and they said pretty much the same thing; after all, it had been five years since we had any knowledge of him doing drugs, maybe things were really different now.\n\nHis mom called me last week. My friend apparently called her and was freaking out - she didn't know if he'd taken something, was having a schizophrenic attack, had hurt himself or if someone had hurt him. She drove the five hours, found him alone in his car outside his apartment, threw him in the back of her van and drove him to the nearest hospital. \n\nAt the hospital, they found crystal meth in his system. She was calling me to tell me all of this, and asked me to bring home some things from his apartment when I came back for Thanksgiving this year. He's in inpatient again, this time at a supposedly better place in Texas.\n\nWhen he gets out this time, I don't think I can be his friend.\n\nI understand that addiction is a disease and that it can do so much damage to families and relationships, but it just hurts so much to be around someone who had so much potential and so much going for him and just see him throw this away again and again. It truly does break my heart. He was my best friend for so long, and I hate that I can't be there for him this time, or maybe ever again. I don't know what I would do if I lost him, but I just can't have him be such a large part of my life anymore. I love him, but I can't watch him do this to himself. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My wife and I were taking an early morning flight out for a mini vacation.  As we were about to sit at our assigned seats, we saw a service member in uniform sitting in my wife’s window seat (I had the middle).  Since it was the first flight out, we wanted to get a little sleep, but my wife really can’t sleep on a plan unless she’s at the window.  Plus, we paid around $600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we approached our seats, he was already snuggled in the seat as if he was also going to get some sleep as well.  When I asked if he was in the correct seat (even though I knew he wasn’t), he said, “Do you mind if I just sit here?” with a very smug look on his face.  It was as if he assumed I would say yes.  I kindly said no.  He then replied, “Are you sure? You can have the aisle.”  I turned to my wife to see what she thought, and she shook her head to say no.  So again, I said no thanks.  After that I heard a couple of other passengers say to just let him sit there.  He just stared at me after that and still didn’t move.  Maybe he was expecting that I would give in after hearing those comments.  I then sternly asked him to please sit in his assigned seat.  He finally complied but was obviously annoyed.  I overhead those other passengers saying I should’ve let him sit there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel as if he was using the fact that he was in the military to his advantage by the way he responded.  I can only assumed he has done this before since he was so smug.  However, maybe he was finally coming home after some time away from home and was tired.  I felt a little guilty, but also couldn’t forget how smug he was.  Also, I fly quite a bit for work and have never had anyone defend someone else who was sitting in the wrong seat.  I assume it was because he was in the military.  Anyway, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Throughout the night we’re friendly until she pulls me aside and asks if I have a problem with her being friends with my boyfriend. At this point I honestly did not. Then we play a game and she makes her players name my boyfriends name loves her name. At this point I’m pissed. She asked me if I had a problem bc she noticed I was being quiet and then I felt she caused a problem. She was also making small jokes with my boyfriend. At this point I removed myself from the game and went to bed for the night. My boyfriend thinks I’m the asshole for being over dramatic. But I feel that if the girl really thought I had a problem with her at first why would she make her name like that in the game knowing it would cause a problem. Am I the asshole for leaving the game? \n\nAlso my boyfriend later talked to me and said they’ve been friends since they were kids (10+ years) and she’s really into his friend. I just feel like for the first time meeting me she would be more respectful to my relationship. ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot here, we'll skip the intro and start with me finding out that my college roommate, D, had cheated on his longterm girlfriend, L, for over a year. I eventually reached a breaking point and told L everything I knew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nL calls D shortly after, and D asks me to leave the room for some privacy. When he lets me back in, I go straight to bed (it was well after midnight). The next morning, I get up, do my morning stuff, and D is still in bed. This is really unusual because he has earlier classes than I do. When I leave for my first class, he still hasn't moved, and has missed his first class of the day already. Around 1:00, I come back from my early classes, and he's still in bed. At this point I'm a little worried, but had a busy day and had to keep moving. He's gone from the room when I get back around 5:00, but I knew he had missed most of his classes that day. Later that evening, he comes back, and I get a text from L. Basically, she decided not to believe anything I sent her, and that she had told D that I was the one who had told her about all of this. She proceeded to block me, and I was left with an extremely awkward silence in the room. Eventually D turns to me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD: Do you know what I do all day?\n\nMe: not really\n\nD: I lift weights. Do you know why I lift weights?\n\nMe: ...\n\nD: Lifting weights is the only thing that stops me from kil\\*ing myself. But today fucked me up real bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then begins to scream at me about how I ruined his entire day, how he missed assignment deadlines and classes because of me, and how horrible of a person I was for doing any of this. He then goes on to talk about \"I was in a really dark place all day today\" and \"if I didn't have L I wouldn't want to live anymore\". I tell him that if he's actually being serious, then he needs to get some psychological help, and that I didn't feel comfortable with him basically using this as a guilt trip. I also told him that I would call our on-campus therapy hotline if he kept going on about it. He keeps screaming at me, telling me \"you have no idea how it feels\" and that saying things like that \"could push him over the edge\". These comments really upset me, and I pulled out my phone and called the hotline. I'll admit that although I was legitimately worried about him, I knew he could be manipulative at times, and did this at least partially as \"calling his bluff\". He stormed out after that, and I didn't see him for the next two weeks (long story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had to attend therapy for the rest of the semester. I moved out a few months later into a different dorm. So, reddit, AITA?",

I paid for me and my bf to have takeaway and said we should do something together like watch a film, play our Nintendo Switch, anything just to make the evening a bit more positive. \n\nI got home from work and he was doing some portfolio work - granted, he has just finished his uni dissertation the other day and he spent all day during the evening when he finished that playing games and talking to his friends which was cool, I understand how stressful it can be so I didn’t really mind. I asked him if he had much left to do just as I wanted to chill with him soon but no pressure if he had work to do. He then sort of looked at me in a disgusted way and said ‘I’m playing games after.. I’m not spending the whole night with you.’ and it just really hurt me. I don’t want to be selfish as I know he can get stressed and gaming is a way to unwind for him usually, but this day for me is really important and he has a bit of a record of putting other things before me (that’s not uni work lmao, I mean more-so like gaming. He was with me an hour on the anniversary of my dads death and ended up going to his friends after we ate and left me the evening.). \n\nI can’t tell if I’m just being selfish and can’t see his side to it? AITA in this situation where I should be letting him chill after his uni stuff? ",

      "description": "Hear me out.\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend (25M) and I (23F) are currently in a long-distance relationship. We’ve been together for four years, but for the past year I had to move to another state to finish my final year of college while he works at his full-time job. It’s been alright so far as I see him every few months, but as with any LTR it’s difficult. \n\n\n\nI recently went home to catch up with friends and family, and of course my boyfriend (let’s call him John). It was my first time home in about three months. John has a few friends who are also my friends by relation, and all of us often hang out and play video games on weekends while I’m away. I’ve known them for as long as I’ve known John, and we’re all pretty close. When I went home, I suggested we all hit the town for a night out since the weather was great and I wanted to celebrate coming home. A couple of John’s friends were interested while the rest of them said they had things going on and couldn’t make it. John didn’t seem keen on the idea either. Eventually the plans fizzled out, and John and I stayed at home to watch a movie instead. This didn’t bother me at all, and I was in fact happy that I got to spend some quality time with my boyfriend.\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple of months. One of John’s friends returns home after being away for a couple of weeks, and I got a call from John saying that they found a new bar that I would really like. I didn’t hear much from him for the rest of the night, but John later told me that everyone showed up and they all got plastered (we’re a bunch of college kids who love drinking). It seemed odd since they all went out directly after picking up John’s friend from the airport, and it was a Tuesday night. \n\n\n\nI feel really left out here. I don’t have many friends in my new town, and my friends back home know this. I haven’t done anything except work and study since moving and I feel like I’m suffocating. I just wanted to celebrate going home, but no one else did; but when someone else comes home everyone goes crazy on a Tuesday. Am I the asshole for feeling upset at the situation? I’m not being outwardly upset to John about the scenario because I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but he can definitely sense that something is up. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I moved interstate to finish college. When I visited home I wanted to party with my bf and friends, but no one was interested. When I left, a friend returned home after a couple of weeks and they all went out and got drunk on a Tuesday to celebrate. AITA for feeling left out? \n",

She stated that she wants the government money that having kids brings. C has cerebral palsy but still functions okay so she gets disability and has not had a job for years. Just collecting that government money. She still has no job 4-5 years later... \n\nI told her immediately that she should not have more kids just to have the government pay for it and told her she needs to get a job and start supporting them on her own. I don’t remember what C said back if she even said anything. But C did become a little distant after that.\n\nI went to the bathroom and came back. We left pretty much soon after. C left but I went to Ks house for a bit and K told me that when I went to the bathroom C said how different and rude I had become and that she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. I was taken aback because C didn’t tell me my comment bothered her. I was simply stating that having kids to get a government check was wrong and she shouldn’t have a kid unless she can financially support it on her own. I wasn’t using a condescending tone or anything. Really just stating my opinion like friends do with each other\n\nC did start texting me the next day like nothing happened and I sure wasn’t going to bring it back up. \n\nSo was I TA by telling her she shouldn’t have kids just to get some extra government money?\nA year after the incident C did indeed get pregnant and now has 3 kids instead of 2... \n\nTLDR: friend wants another baby to get more government money. I tell her she needs to get a job and not have a kid just for the government to pay. Friend gets mad. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "One of my long time friends bill (not his real name) all the sudden begins smoking pot and drinking, which is fine, IMO that stuff is harmless in the long term. But as time goes on, weed turns in to opioids, LSD, adderall, lean, all of this stuff. Now you may ask where is his parents through all this? They don’t care. It’s sad and it’s not really fair considering bill is an only child. For example, one weekend his parents left him home alone and he took LSD and got so fucked up that he started freaking out and ran into his neighbors house and told them to call the police. Another time he was FaceTime, with one of my friends Rob ( not his real name) and he took LSD again, started talking about how he was gonna kill himself and Rob called 911, bill and rob aren’t friends anymore. Now don’t get me wrong, Bill is a cool guy, everyone at school and outside of school enjoy him and he’s a good guy, but this final accident really changed my opinion about him. One day he took LSD (again) and jumped out of a window, started screaming “n******” and got arrested. He’s a minor and rich so no consequences and he was in a coma for 2 days. Crazy enough, almost no one knows at our school and community. Me and a few other people know but that’s it. He came back to school and told everyone he got hit by a car, but it’s fucked up stuff. Even after that I still talked to him and tried to let him know that this stuff is fucked up. Fast forward 6 months later, I started getting fed up with his shit.  Scamming me out of money and just stupid little stuff. He’s also getting back into the heavy shit again and I don’t wanna deal with his bullshit anymore. I didn’t mention this earlier but we used to FaceTime a lot and he would tell me about the drug he told and his experiences with them and I would just tell him it’s fucked up and he should stop. About 2 weeks ago, he and I were in the hallway arguing about the 20 bucks he owed me and he started getting heated and tried pushing  me. after that I was walking out of class to go to the bathroom and he walked passed me and I called him a Pussy, and he turned around and starting trying to push me and said don’t talk to me like that. As he walked away from me I told him I was gonna expose his window story and he will regret it, which was wrong. Apparently one of my friends saw him leave early crying after school that day. Next morning, my parents get a call him his parents telling my parents that bill is missing school today and that they were scared I would share personal info about him. I felt bad for saying that shit about his LSD and messaged him his secret was safe with me. 2 weeks later (now), he has missed basically everyday because he’s been “sick” and I’m starting to think he’s depressed or something worse. I was a good friend to him for a long time, and this happens, for the best I’m gonna keep going down my path. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys. First time posting here. I’m also on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors. \n\n\nI got home about an hour ago from a club in my city. It was my friend’s 19th birthday (the legal age in my country) and a bunch of friends and myself were all going to go out to a club to celebrate. My boyfriend basically lives at my house, which I was throwing the pre party at, so he was invited too.\n\nPre drinking went great and everyone was having a good time. It took my boyfriend about 3 minutes to get his coat and shoes on to get into the Uber. That is when I noticed that he may be a bit too drunk. He’s been that way before, so I decided to roll with it and see where it goes, as long as he gets into the club. \n\nIn the lineup for the club, he kept bumping into people and acting out, so I told him to chill and act normal and I’d get him water once he got into the club. He said fine. He kept dancing around and hopping into strangers, who gave him dirty looks, the whole time. Upon showing his ID to the bouncer, the bouncer said one more drink and he won’t be alright to go in. The only reason they allowed him in was because I worked there previously. I felt uneasy but since all of my other friends were having a good time, I went in. I knew I was making a bad decision. \n\nOnce we entered and got settled, we took a bathroom trip and I got him water and myself and the birthday girl a drink. In that time (about 20 mins) he’d fallen on his ass, ran into multiple people, tried groping me in front of my friends, and argued with me about why I seemed upset. \n\nAfter all of that I decided it was time for us to leave. I told my friends (who were so understanding. I thank them so much) and he refused. I went outside for a cigarette to try and think and my friend brought him to me and said it’d probably be best if we did go. \n\nWhile waiting for the cab, a girl and her friend told us that it was good that someone stuck up for his well-being like I did but he still argued. In the cab, the driver noted that he was too drunk and asked me how I was okay. I said I’m a bartender and am kind of used to babysitting. \n\nOnce home, he noted that I was still in the wrong and really looked like he’d done nothing wrong. He’s now asleep as I write this. I know he’s very drunk, but am I the asshole here? I love him very much and don’t want him to get into any trouble. It ruined my night (but hopefully not my friend’s) but I’d rather be home with a safe boyfriend than with one that’s been in any sort of trouble, whether it be physical like a fight or a simple ban from a club. \n\n(Sorry if this seems stupid. Idk, I’ve just been in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past and I really feel bad for ruining his night. I hope I made the right decision) ",

      "description": "  \n\nSo first things first I’ve been dating my amazing boyfriend since November of last year but we didn’t make it official up until January of this year.\n\nWe had a rocky start and I even posted in r/relationships about it, lol.\n\nI’m glad to say that we’ve been going strong ever since!\n\nNow, my friends found my previous reddit post and said that I should once again consult the wise people of the interwebs with this imo small issue. \n\nSo a few days ago my boyfriend told me that he loves me. A bit flabbergasted I responded with “Thanks”. We had a laugh about it and he told me that he just had to get it of his chest and wasn’t sure if I’d be ready to say it too. Evidently, I am not. I have never before told someone that I loved them and even though I care deeply for my bf, I really don’t know if I’m ready for the three big words.\n\nSo thinking of it as a funny story, I told some friends about it and they did not think of it as funny. One said that it must've hurt my bfs feelings and I should have just said it back. Also, that my response was really insensitive and that I should find a way to make it up to him. One of my more “hopeless romantic” friends straight up called me a bit of a prick. (thanks again for that, Julie)\n\nNow I’m a bit thrown off. Is it really that big of a deal? My bf seemed not that bothered and we usually communicate our feelings well. Should I bring the subject up again with him? AITA for not being ready for the whole “I love you” thing?\n\nPass thy judgement on me reddit to once again feast on my inability to do the relationships™ properly. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We get along great, support each other, and love each other. Our relationship is perfect in every aspect but sexual. \n\nI did not know I was asexual when we started dating, I just thought I was a late bloomer. My boyfriend was patiently waiting for me to make the first move sexually and I was completely oblivious. We didn’t discuss the issue until well over a year or two into the relationship and it soon became incredibly frustrating for both of us. We almost broke up multiple times, but by that time we both loved each other and couldn’t go through with it. \n\nNow I’ve finally figured out my sexual identity (or lack thereof) for the most part and we compromise and things are better. My boyfriend has a very high libido and I have the opposite. I’m not interested in doing anything sexual and it’s all a little nasty to me. However, I frequently give in and we do sexual things (the whole gamut, I wont specify) as a compromise. However, neither of us can ever really be satisfied by this situation because it’s more than I want and less than he wants. (I do want to clarify that I consent to everything we do though.)\n\nHe’s incredibly patient and understanding with me but it’s obvious that he’s unhappy with the sexual aspect of our relationship. He is also very against the idea of an open relationship. Am I an asshole for holding him back when he could find someone potentially better suited? Am I being selfish for wanting to stay with a good guy even though I can never fully satisfy his needs? If things keep going the way they are we could realistically get married in a few more years, and I can’t help but wonder if that would be a bad idea for both parties involved.",

I'm a normal Mexican girl, and like most Mexicans I have a mixed ethnicity, mostly Spanish and Native American and something more I guess because I'm light skinned.\n\nWe have tried to have kids since we married, we've tried for three years, almost four... but we have a good relationship, not having kids is not an issue and my husband has always said that we should just relax and let things happen.  \n\nDuring November I found out I was pregnant and we have been so happy ever since... until a few days ago... my GYNOB was concerned about the Thalassemia so she requested a thalassemia screening test for me, turns out I have the trait to the same type of anemia my husband has, I don't have the disease but I carry the gene. The doctor told us there's a 75% chance our baby will present the disease with 50% being moderate and a 25% chance the baby will present the severe form. The doctor also explained that if he carries the moderate and severe Thalassemia he will need transfusions twice a month for the rest of his life and he will eventually need transplants. We freaked out, my husband started telling me we should interrupt my pregnancy right now that he's little (9 weeks), that we should just stop trying and adopt instead. We cannot not if the baby has the disease until he is a few weeks older and here in Mexico City abortion is legal up to 12 weeks so my husband is desperate. But I don't want to interrupt my pregnancy, I have always wanted to be a mother, I love him and I want to meet him and take care of him if it is needed, I don't care if he's sick, I just want my baby. My husband doesn't get it, I have no one to talk about this besides him, nobody knows I'm pregnant except us. He is upset with me, he says I'm being selfish, that bring a sick person into this world doesn't make sense and that if it turns out the baby has the severe disease he will never forget himself because he would be the main cause and he will never forget me because I want to have him. We argued last night and we both cried, I love my husband so much, but I love my baby too. \n\nI can tell my husband is really hurt, and he's making me feel like an asshole. Am I one? Am I being a selfish bitch? Is it better to just interrupt the pregnancy? I haven't slept at all. I want my baby to be healthy and I can't stop thinking there's a little chance he will have a mild form of the anemia. I'm not against abortion but I want to have him. I don't know where else to post this... \n",

He really acts very gay, not even just in personality. I remember in 8th grade there was an incident where he kissed a substitute teacher who was male. So, I've generally for most of our friendship, saw him as gay. It's not like I rubbed it in his face or told other people. I just always thought that he was homosexual. We're in the same college right now and we requested to be roommates. So, we live together. He invited this girl over and she kissed him and told him that she liked him, I was astounded. He said that he'll think about it and I asked him about it. He was extremely offended and hurt when I told him that I thought he was gay. He told me that he's straight and I was just blank. It's been extremely awkward between us and I just don't know what to tell him. I feel like an asshole. ",

      "description": "So today one of my friends (25m) was doing a triathalon and it was his first one. My boyfriend and I went to the race to support him at the finish line. \n\nUpon us walking in, I said in half-jest to my boyfriend that our friend would be pissed he was coming in behind women participants. I said this cause our friend can be a bit of an ego maniac, and because he labels himself as a feminist but his behavior often contradicts that.\n\nSo simple joke, race ends, we head to brunch. And my friend literally said “some primal part of me started running the race and was like ‘fuck I can’t let a bunch of girls beat me’ but then by the end I couldn’t catch them”. \n\nI didn’t know what to say at the time, but it bothers me that 1) my suspicions of him being latently prejudiced were confirmed, 2) he didn’t address the fact that what he said was sexist, just that he ultimately wasn’t able to keep their pace.\n\nI dunno, I don’t want to nag him cause clearly he knows it’s a fucked up thing to think, but I also see it as an opportunity to point out to him some of the other stuff he does that is sexist to me. He’s really shit with boundaries and I do get a little upset when he goes around calling himself a feminist to get himself some v. It reminded me a little bit of the recent Liam Neeson controversy where he said something fucked up and apologized but missed the bigger picture. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I tried to broach on this topic to demonstrate some of the other offensive behaviors he exhibits?\n\n**TL;DR**: friend made iffy comment, see it as window to a larger much needed discussion, but also want to avoid shaming him since he did admit it wasn’t right",

      "description": "Posting on a throwaway so I don't get called an SJW lol. This happened a couple years ago, wondering about it now. So, I was in a long-distance open relationship with who we'll call Taylor (they're non-binary so going with a gender neutral name). It didn't work out and honestly I don't really remember why, we just stopped talking. Some months later, we started talking again. They had a girlfriend, who we'll call Sarah, at this point who, honestly, I really really didn't like. There wasn't any particular reason for me to dislike her, I just got bad vibes from her. I asked Taylor privately if their relationship was open (because our relationship was open and we're both generally polyamarous people) and they said not for romance but yes for sex. So we sexted and did erotic roleplay for months. And, well, I started falling for them again. So I told them that I loved them. Their response was confusing, they said they loved me too but not in a romantic way. They said that if they weren't dating Sarah, they'd date me. And they said that we could still have a relationship together, just not a romance. That seemed off-putting to me. So I decided to tell Sarah about it. Turns out, she didn't even know about the sex part of it. And she wasn't okay with it. She freaked the fuck out and told Taylor that if they wanted to still be with her, they had to block me, so they did. AITA here? ",

Second, my inlaws are rather judgmental and have already criticized our spending in the past even when they didn't know we were having any financial problems. I don't want to be in debt to them and such a situation would be extremely uncomfortable for me.\n\nI have pretty much decided to borrow from the bank.

      "title": "AITA if I walk out of a family Christmas party because my mother's new abusive husband (who I was told would not be present) showed up?",
      "description": "Some brief backstory for context: my mom divorced her ex-husband for being emotionally abusive. She remarried this guy, who turned out to be this *super* paranoid and psychologically abusive / controlling conspiracy theorist who has worked very hard to cut her off from our entire family over the last few years. My mom met him while she was working for him, they both got fired for dating each other while he was her superior, he decided the best thing to do would be to start a trucking business so they could be on the road together, alone, all the time, with nobody else in contact. I see her maybe once every 6-8 months and every time I see her it's like I'm talking to a different person - she used to be very hyperactive, self-aware and attentive (she was a healthcare worker for ~10 years), but now she struggles to hold focus for even a few minutes at a time, becomes confused very easily, has trouble following objects with her eyes, etc. We know for a fact they use some light drugs (mostly marijuana) and we suspect there might be more (for reasons of which I won't go into great detail for the sake of brevity), but are unable to confirm at this time. I lived with them for a short time after we all lost our jobs (I was in between jobs myself, I came into work one day and was told the branch was closing that day and to go home because we were all out of jobs), during this time he assaulted me physically on multiple occasions, and attempted to assault my wife on two occasions (both situations in which she said nothing and had nothing whatsoever to do with beforehand, she just happened to be in the room while he and I were arguing), to the point where my wife will not enter a room or attend an event if he's present (and I feel the same way). I got a job shortly after that and moved out with my wife, and ever since, all attempts to redress grievances with him have ended in physical violence, to the point where my wife and I have both deemed it a lost cause and cut him out of our lives. I've told my mother that I am happy to stay in touch but wherever he is, I won't be. We keep in touch but less so than before, and she still occasionally tries to guilt us into hanging out with them (she can't seem to divorce the fact that I *do* still care about her, and I tell her so every time we talk, from the fact that I don't want anything to do with her husband because he is a danger to those around him). She has also tried to trick us into hanging out with him - when I got my first promotion, I planned to meet her and my wife for dinner, and she showed up with her husband after explicitly telling me he wouldn't be there; when I asked her why she lied, I expected her to just say she forgot because that's what she usually claims, but this time she said something to the effect of, 'I just think you guys could hash it out and get along if you'd just talk to each other.' To which I responded, we've tried that, and this is the result. Take it or leave it. We ended up having a huge fight, he stormed out and she was crying, and it was a bad day for everyone involved. This sort of thing happened off and on for awhile.\n\n**Ok, now for what actually happened:** my mom told me she was getting the family together (mostly immediate relatives, since we live all over the country all spread out) for a sort of lightweight Christmas party on the morning of (I already had plans for dinner at my wife's family's house so we were splitting the day up), and I specifically asked if the husband would be there. She told me he was going to be at his parents' house that day so not to worry because he *definitely* wouldn't be there this time. I spoke with my wife about it and we decided in advance that if my mother lied to us again (or 'forgot') about him being there, we were just going to leave without saying a word. I didn't say exactly that to my mother, but we'd spoken on the subject of this man multiple times since the original incidents and I was always very clear that I did not intend to remain anywhere if he was there. So we show up the day of, and lo and behold, a few minutes later in walks the husband, greeting me and my wife like he wasn't even aware that I was told he'd be gone. I looked over at my mom, she just smirked at me as if daring me to walk out. So I took my wife's hand and we got up and walked out. My mom acted surprised and said, \"Where are you going? Aren't you going to eat anything?\" and I told her \"You know where I'm going,\" I thanked her for inviting us and for the food and we left. \n\nTwo days later I find out that she's gone to everyone in my extended family and told them that we \"ruined Christmas\" for her and she feels like we don't love her anymore and we're ungrateful, etc. How do I find this out? Because we get a call from my grandmother bitching us out and *demanding* that we go apologize to her and buy her a special Christmas present, and how dare we treat her this way, etc. etc. I ended up having it out with my mom via text, she tried to draw all these false equivalencies between my wife and her husband, directly attacking her in some cases (\"I wouldn't have chosen her as your wife either, but I respect your life choices, why can't you respect mine?\"). I told her that my wife has never assaulted her and I don't appreciate the comparison. After essentially backing herself into a corner with four or five more such unabashedly hypocritical accusations blowing up in her face, she says, \"Fine, I just won't ever have a family event again.\" And I told her, \"Ok. If you change your mind let me know.\" And that's the last time I've spoken to her since.\n\nI love my mom, I really do. She was my rock through a lot of an emotionally abusive childhood and I learned a lot of my work ethic from her, and I still respect her for that. But it's getting to the point where she's making me choose between her and my own (and my wife's) safety, by continuously lying and misrepresenting situations to try and get us to hang out with her and her husband who has a very long history of violence, with us as well as with others. I felt bad for walking out during Christmas (especially because the rest of my immediate family doesn't know the entire story of what happened, my older sister thought I walked out because she was there, we haven't spoken in awhile and used to fight a lot but we're pretty even now, or we were before this). But I feel like I had to draw a line *somewhere* because this keeps happening despite every attempt I make to get it through to her that he is not welcome around us. I haven't placed any ultimatums on her to compel her to not see him, or force them to not hang out. I've told her it's her life and she's free to live it, and I'm not cutting her out of my life or making her choose between me and him. I just don't want to be in the same room as him as all because I'm sick of every single encounter escalating to violence, and she can't accept that. \n\nI mostly just want to know how in or out of touch I am on this line of reasoning, according to random people online who will probably see this from a different perspective. I don't intend to argue at length with any commenters here unless questions need answering / straightforward clarifications need to be made. So am I the asshole here? Or am I justified in my decision? Thanks in advance for reading / consideration.",

      "description": "I (26m) met a cool girl (24f) and things were going great. So I have a history of attracting damaged women. One of my exes was a side chick for a year and the other stayed with a guy for two years who she constantly caught cheating, both ended horribly and I was miserable. I honestly am trying to avoid girls who have this kind of baggage or damage. The girl I’m dating let some guy move in after 2 months because he got kicked out. He ended up staying for 2 years I guess and the whole time he was cheating on her, he also lived off her and she would always give him money. She was loyal the whole time and he was also physically abusive. To me this is a turn off because in my opinion it shows a lack of self respect and basically letting someone completely use you in every way possible. From my experience you lose something in these situations and I don’t want another potentially low effort or shady relationship. AITA for thinking this way? \n\nTldr: met a girl who let her ex completely walk all over her, AITA for thinking this is a huge turn off?",

I'm now 20 and still refuse to have my picture taken (I'm better now and can have my photo taken on occasion)\n\nThis is where the issue starts, mum had this idea to started digital album of photos of me and my sister. She calls up asking if I have any photos of me as a child cos she can't find them, I tell her that I have none and she would have them, she then remembered my hate for taking photos and is now super mad that she cant look back on memories. \n\nmy thing is that mum and dad saw these tantrums and did nothing about it and are now pissed at me, I'm now feeling like a asshole even tho I was a kid back then.

Finally the pressure, and frankly the slight embarrassment of this continued conversation / confrontation got the best of me and I gave in.\n\nI was pretty steamed the whole ride, and when I got home I called the airline and complained about the situation and about the steward, by name.\n\nIn retrospect I feel a bit bad.  What I should have done was just said stood my ground and stuck with the \"no\" or just been gracious and swapped with the other guy.  (He was about 6'6\" and I'm a bit under 6'.)\n\nFor sure I could have been nicer in the situation, but AITA?",

But something happened and I have felt so bad about it ever since... \n\nSo in math class we were split up in pairs (or buddies as they said) and all was well... for half a lesson. The guy I was put with had no drive to study for himself, and often just expected me to answer questions so he could copy. It got to the point where I couldn't work because he would constantly say: \"what is the answer to this?\", expecting me to drop all my things to help him. My grade seriously dropped that semester, to a new level of low for me, because I couldn't focus.\n\n And honestly, I should have been fine with this..  Mayne this was his way of asking for help? And I usually NEVER snap or act mean to people jut I don't know what happened, I just told him to get his stuff together and at least try and not leech off of my work. \n\nWe aren't math buddies anymore, as the class got split into higher and standard maths, but even though it's been about 2 months since I snapped, I still feel so mean about what I did. I don't know much about him, but I just heard recently that he has depression (or has struggled with it before) and idk I feel like I should have been a kinder person. Is there any other way I could have done this? Am I the asshole for wanting to focus on my own schoolwork?

      "description": "**TLDR: I made a bad joke over text that sounded like I was depressed and about to do something serious. I tried to clear it up. My best friend thought I had a plan in place anyways and called my housemate. I haven't spoken to him since, and now I don't know if I can be friends with him.**\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I was texting a really good friend of mine. He was going on about long lasting anticoagulants and I had a laugh because they're medicines designed to help with heart problems by thinning out blood. I thought it was ironic that we'd have to wait for them to kick in. I jokingly texted him that we should all just die instead and he taken aback.\n\nHere's where I fucked up. When he asked me what I meant I was like I'm just tired and I want to sleep, idk what I'm saying. He said he thought I was planning to do something serious, and I reassured him I had never been happier. I realised I sounded very depressed and spent a good hour awake afterwards to make sure he understood I was ok, and then I went to sleep.\n\nThe next day after I came home from work, my housemates asked to speak to me. He called one of them and expressed concern. She freaked out and then got my other housemate, and they decided to knock on my door and check on me. (My housemates and I are trusting of each other so we tend to keep our doors unlocked when we're home.)\n\nNeedless to say I got pissed at him. I thought it wasn't right of him to call my housemates because I spent ages clearing it up. Even if I was that depressed, to tell others is such a break of trust. He's done it before. He told some friends that I wasn't responding to some drugs when I was first diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disorder. We had a long talk then about making sure to ask me before spreading intimate conversations we've had. Frankly I feel betrayed he's done it again.\n\nBut at the same time I understand where he's coming from. I have a long history of depression; I'm a former victim of domestic abuse and I have PTSD. I used to be on antidepressants. I've also only recently been diagnosed with said chronic illness. I understand he didn't have ill intentions when he called.\n\nI just can't talk to him though. I feel we'll have to go through the same conversation we went through previously. I'm only just coming out with my story of abuse, having only recently celebrated a year apart from my abusers. I have had a hard time trusting people. He's apologised to me profusely but I don't know if I can trust him again, especially because this is the second time he's told our friends something when I didn't want him to.\n\nAITA for not wanting to speak to him and for ignoring him in the first place? And WIBTA if I chose not to remain friends with him after this? I feel so morally conflicted. Sometimes I feel it's justified and other times I have to remind myself it wasn't ill intention.",

      "description": "My dad is an honest, hardworking guy, but has always been financially unstable, running his own business with employees. I'm 27 (only child) and he has never asked me for help until now.\n\nLast week he called me very upset and told me that he only had $300 in his account and needed help to pay bills. (He also has no CC because of his credit, so this is his only money). He asked for $2000–$3000. With that little in his account obviously I wanted him to pay his bills and also be able to eat, get gas, etc. I sent him a check for $2500 and figured after this hurdle was out of the way, we could figure out a long term plan.\n\nTonight we spoke again and he told me he went to his CPA and realized he actually has $4500. He seemed to think now everything is ok, but still needed my check to pay his employees and get more established. I asked him, if he has access to his bank account, how did he not realize this was the case? He said that his administrative employee told him he only had $300 and wouldn't be able to pay his employees, just to be mean to him.\n\nYou'll have to take my word that he's an honest guy, just clueless and naive. I don't think he was trying to trick me, but I feel that the situation is unfair to me because I gave him that money under the belief that he wouldn't be able to pay his mortgage or eat without it. With the money that he has, I could provide a smaller amount or help him figure out a better long-term plan.\n\nThe check is still in the mail to him. WIBTA I asked him not to cash the check and canceled it? I would obviously give him a heads up about it first.",

      "description": "So this is my first time posting on this sub-reddit, or any sub-reddit in general, so sorry if this hasn't been done correctly. If this doesn't belong on this sub-reddit please tell me and I'll take it down. I also have a feeling that this may come off as one-sided as I'm not the best at being neutral but I'll try my best.\n\nThis incident seems pretty minor compared to the other stuff I've seen on this sub-reddit but I thought this would be the best place to post it.\n\nFor some context, I am an Indian teenage male and when most people talk about race at my school they call me black. I think that black is meant to describe those of African descendant but I think the kids at my school call me this as it is fairly rural and white-dominated area with around 6 South-Asians (Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka etc...) and around 4 African people at my school so they just label us as one group. I try to tell them that I'm not actually black but they just ignore me and continue but that's a topic for another day.\n\nOn to the actual post, my friend is quite a committed Christian and takes her religion seriously and gets very upset when people make jokes about Christianity and tells people not to make them, even when there is no malicious intent meant by the jokes, which I think is fair enough. I used to make offensive Christian jokes but after seeing her get upset at them I try not to but I have to admit that I end up laughing sometimes when people make Christian jokes because I can't help but find them funny. I don't normally get offended when people make jokes about my race.\n\nSo we were hanging around and chatting in our group of friends and she asks me if she can take a photo of me so that she can turn me into a goth in facetune as she'd done it with other people so I obliged. We were all talking and then someone brings up the time that one of my friends jokingly took a picture and tried to turn me white. Someone brings up the picture on their phone and my friend sees it and says 'You turned him yellow, not white. I could do a much better job,' and so she takes the photo that she took to turn me into a goth and starts editing it to make me white. She says things like 'This is much better' while she's making it and I find it funny at first but then it starts to kinda piss me off as I find it hypocritical of her to get offended by Christian jokes and tell people not to make them but then go around and think it's perfectly fine to make racist jokes like this. I try to play my annoyance off as a joke.\n\nThe next day, I try messing up her glue stick with my fingers as a laugh and she says, 'No! You're rubbing black all over my glue' as a joke, and I say, after still being slightly annoyed because of yesterday, half-jokingly, 'What's wrong with black?' and she responds 'Black is far inferior when compared to white.' She continues to make jokes to this effect throughout the day. In the afternoon when we're walking as a school group somewhere, we are talking and I don't remember how exactly but I end up bringing up her photoshopping me white the previous day. We joke about it at first but then I finally bring up how I think it seems a little unfair that she thinks it's okay to make jokes about POC but it's too far to make jokes about Christianity. She responds by saying, 'That's different. It's religion, not race.' I then respond by saying, 'What's the difference? Aren't they both equally important?' Her best friend, who is also there, joins the discussion/argument and starts to agree with me. Both her best friend and I start saying about how race and religion are both equally important and ask why it's any different and when my friend tries to respond she is lost for words and can't come up with anything. Her best friend and I are both ranting and, admittedly, sort of ganging up on her. We weren't speaking aggressively but I still think it may have come across as ganging up and mid-way through us talking, my friend speed walks away, looking upset. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like she's treating religion as something more important because it's closer to her than race is but am I just being one-sided and being too over-sensitive to things that relate to me while not being sensitive enough to issues that relate to her? Am I the one being hypocritical?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Full warning I am on mobile and from the UK so please don't expect to much as I am also a first time poster.\n \nSo background info I still go to highschool, but the one I go to is a bit rowdy because they except everyone who applies. The bully (we'll call him DB) has only one strike left before being expelled and hates me as some of his strikes come from incidents with me.\n\nSo it's a normal afternoon and I'm leaving school when a friend of mine asks if I could wait with him by the gates and so me being the kind soul I am accepted his request. We're just waiting when DB comes up and asks if he could wait with us and we obviously say he can.\n\nI am listening to music and pacing around in front of the school gates whilst friend and DB talk. All of a sudden DB gets up and jumps on my back whilst I am turned away. As you can guess I was surprised and as I could not hold his weight, I fall in some mud along with him. I am obviously angry so the exchange of words go like this: \n\nMe: WTF! Why did you do that you twat?\nDB: oh go fuck of and cry you pussy!\nMe: nah you messed up my stuff ( pointing to my muddy uniform and bag)\nDB: oi fight me then.\n\nAs I try and think of any type of excuse to leave he punches me in the stomach and I double over. Now I am really pissed and hit him who knows where. so we go at for a bit when some girls I know and tell us to quit it.\n\nI'm tired at this point and a little bruised. One of the girls go back in to the school to get a teacher all the while I'm sat opposite the road from DB whilst my friend is talking to him. Finally a teacher comes out but it is the headteacher/principal of our school.\n\nWe start explaining what happened when all of a sudden DB stars spinning a web of lies all while smirking at me saying things like \"I guess I could forgive him.\" And all that and so I have to show the headteacher proof of what he has done in the past and eye witness statements from my friend.\n\nI found out the next week that DB was expelled but people think I am the asshole for fighting him even though he started it. \n\nAm I the asshole.\n\nLeave tips and strategies for posting on Reddit in the comments.",

The doctor says that he might be lucid for a year if he's lucky and that he will start loosing memory, free movement, speech and may even forget how to eat or go to the bathroom. My grandfather does not know this because we talked to the doctor outside while he was inside the room. \n  \nMy family is working on how to keep this information from him because he has had suicidal tendencies before and they fear that he might kill himself. He has said multiple times that he'd rather die than rot in a bed unable to move or speak. \n  \nSo know comes the part where I suggest that we tell him that he's sick, that he's not gonna get better and that he should decide what he wants to do. He has always said that he'd rather die, so I mentioned that he should have that option too should he decide that he doesn't wanna fight an innescapable and horrible death. Now my family is extremely furious at me for hating my grandfather and being negative. I work in hospitals so I've seen first hand how horrible his life is going to be soon. If I was in the same position as him I would honestly choose to die too. My family is extremely religious so they believe that only god can decide when he dies.\n  \n I know that what I said was cold hearted but am I an asshole here?",

That being said, he talks to my ex husband more than he talks to me. \n\nMy ex husband and I had a very tumultuous marriage which resulted in a nasty divorce. We still have to talk to each other, but only because we have three kids together and as of right now we share custody of two of them. The divorce really put a strain on a lot of my family members because my ex husband involved everybody he could in personal matters. It sort of drove a wedge between my father and I and we haven’t been as close since. \n\nRecently, my ex husband has been throwing jabs at me about how often he talks to my Dad. The issue is I haven’t been able to see or get ahold of my Dad since Christmas. I feel like my Dad has started to pick his ex son in law over his own daughter.  My ex has informed me that my Dad is visiting my brother in the same damn city as me, but my Dad hasn’t reached out to me. I was going to go visit my brother with my kids anyhow, so I can see my Dad as well this weekend. \n\nWould I be the asshole if when I’m visiting my brother if I were to ask my Dad to stop talking to my ex husband or to cut me out of his life as his daughter?

One day, he told me how age is just a number, and I couldn't handle it and called him a pedo. He was extremely offended, which I can understand, but that's a quite a difference in age. He said, \"You wouldn't care if a 13yr old dated a 12yr old, would you\" \"Of course I wouldn't! They don't have a 5 yr age difference where one is begining puberty and ones practically done!\" He completely ignored that, and says I'm his \"best\" friend and I should respect him for finding love in the first place! I was incredibly annoyed and walked off. I know his mother, and I told her all about his relationship and how he thinks age is \"just a number\". She made him break up with her, and now he's acting really sad. He won't let me near him, for forcing him to break up with \" The love of his life\". AMITA? ",

      "description": "We've been together for almost 10 years. Both in mid 30's.\n\nWe got engaged and married right after college so we were both young, around 24.\n\nI was the main provider for 9 of these last 10 years for various reasons ( she wanted to get another Bachelor Degree, another Master, extended Maternity for almost 3 years ) and I supported her with her wishes.\n\nI stopped my pension contributions to support the household during these times so she could achieve her objectives.\n\nNow for a bit more than one year she has a well paid job thanks to her efforts and dedication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finances**\n\nAfter her first salary she came home saying \"Now I can afford to be independent and don't have to depend on you\". I was really surprised and yep, it hurt.\n\nNext few months she started to mention divorce more and more often, first as a joke and then more and more serious and I was being asked to \"make up my mind\".\n\nNow I'm being asked constantly to \"move out\" and find another place to stay. This totally kills any attraction and I really don't feel like having sex with her anymore. I have not been the one deciding everything even if I was the provider, she always had it her way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Our son**\n\nWe have a son of 5 and I've been the one spending time with him, taking him to activities and basically spending week-ends together. We have an amazing relationship ( me and him) and he confesses sometimes that he's worried if mom will be angry today. She comes with us sometimes but most of the time she's going to stay at home because she is too tired to come.\n\nHe once told me , while we were heading to one of his favourite sports that he loves I go with him, not because I help him a lot but because he's happy to know I'm there to pick him up if he falls. This meant the world to me.\n\nHis mom is rarely going to his activities, maybe 1-2 weeks a year. We have weekly and it really hurts him up to a point where he's asking her why she's not coming pretty aggressive. She's always tired, does not feel like it, has menstruation or other stuff.\n\nShe gets angry really quick, from calm towards angry in a matter of 10-20 seconds and at one point she threw toys in the house or threatens our son to throw away his toys. Bagging them in the trash bin. I explain to her that is wrong after she's calm and she agrees that was wrong but she will do this again next time. I'm walking on egg shells and so does my son.\n\nOne day she threw something across the room at me that it broke the plate I was having next to me on the sofa. On a few rare cases she hit/spit me when she got really angry. She was sorry but never apologised and she's always telling me I'm too sensitive or I'm picking out of context certain words or behaviours. I kept calm and asked her to stop otherwise I'll call the police. She stopped and berated me for \"threatening\" with police.\n\nI was never abusive, yes we raise our voice when a conflict but I never hit neither her or our son and have never checked phone, limited money or forbidden her to go out with friends. I always encouraged her to do that and also encouraged to find hobbies / favourite sports, stuff she loves and go for it.\n\nOur son is picking up on things as one day in the house he started hitting me, then in the car, while going somewhere he told me \"I only did that to make mommy happy and I knew you would not be mad at me\".\n\nHe often tells me \"Mom is too angry\", \"I wish mom would not get so angry all the time\".\n\nI'm torn because I was raised in an abusive home and I knew I don't want my kids to go through what I've been.\n\nShe would like another child, some weeks she is really nice and tells me it would be really cool, other weeks I'm told I \"fucked up\" her life and I should pack my things and leave. Sometimes when she's upset with me she'd talk alone or really express disgust about me - upper lip lifted and exactly the same expression she does at food she does not like. I pretend I don't see but I notice it. And it hurts.\n\nI suggested therapy but she's basically telling me one has to be committed and dedicated for a relationship for therapy to work and that's definitely not me. She says therapy is too expensive and we would only throw money on things she already knows.\n\nI came to believe I was the \"safe\" option when we got married as she was not financially independent and during these many years a lot of resentment has built and now as she can sustain herself she can be honest and speak her mind.\n\nWhile I am aware that a divorce will have an impact on our son, I'd rather choose that over a loveless relationship without passion and filled with hatred.\n\nWe can't even argue as whatever I say turns into a \" you misinterpreted that\" or \" you misunderstood that\" and then she goes on about how I'm the asshole here and I never get it right.\n\nWe are sleeping separately ( I sleep on the couch because she cannot stand me snoring ) and this has totally killed our sex life. I really need hugs and cuddling and it really kills me inside every evening to sleep alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Divorce**\n\nShe presses me to move out and to be the one telling our son that I was the one that wanted to leave. Because she does not be the one to \"shatter his world\". I love our son to death and I am sure that good parenting and being involved into his life will definitely trump any resentment he might have if I will be the one that left.\n\nI am going to book a therapist on my own and walk through a few sessions of what I could make to do this easier for our son.\n\nThen I will apply for divorce, move out and seek 50% custody.",

      "title": "AITA For snapping at my daughter grandmother?",
      "description": "So backstory.  The grandmother has guardianship of my daughter.  Her mother abandoned her when she was 5 and she never put me on the birth certificate so she could scam the system and get WIC. At age 7 she showed back up in her life.  Now around 3 or 4 years ago the mother tried to get custody back.  \n\n\nThe grandmother asked me to get involved so that she couldn't get custody of my daughter back.  After months of trying to work out a resolution, we established that I was the father (which I already knew).  Drafted visitation rights for me and the grandmother got to keep guardianship. (my daughter wanted to stay with her grandmother because she has been the only constant in her life.)  So I am supposed to get my daughter during the summers and rotate years between Christmas and thanksgiving.    \n\n\nNow for even more backstory.  I have been in my daughters life since she was born.  Her mother had me so mentally and physically abused that I never stood up for myself.  A few months after my daughter turned one, her mother who I was no longer with, destroyed all the photos I had of my daughter and punched me in my face.  I made a decision to leave the state.  I was either going to finally lay hands or her and go to jail or kill myself and neither would have been helpful to my daughter.  So I moved in with my parents to get my shit together.  I did.  Graduated college. Got married and have been relatively happy since.  I also pay child support, that I am not required by law to do, for my daughter because I feel its the right thing to do.  \n\n\nBack to the situation at hand.  The grandmother has not been abiding by the court orders of the visitation.  She brought her the first Christmas after court (she came as well).  Then she brought her the next summer which she attended again.  (she was abused as a child and apparently all men are rapists.  Even me, the father of my daughter is capable of this so she won't let my daughter out of her sight.)  Then she didn't send her on thanksgiving.  I went down to where they live the next summer.  She didn't send her for that Christmas or this summer.  And now they were going to come this Christmas.  At this point my daughter is 12 going on 13.  \n\n\nI speak to my daughter every two weeks just to be a constant in her life in some fashion.  I had recently asked her what server she plays on minecraft (her favorite game).  She asked why.  I said because I wanted to play with her.  I thought it would be a good way for us to connect because we both enjoy video games.  She said she didn't want to play with me.  Now this took me aback and I asked why.  She said because she didn't want to.  So we chatted on some other things and still confused I asked why she didn't want me to play with her.    \n\n\nNow this is where the grandmother, who apparently makes my daughter talk to me on speaker phone, takes the phone and starts saying I am 'pressuring' her to do something she does not want to do.  I explained I wasn't pressuring her to do anything that I was just trying to understand.  She continued to attack me and turning it into a big ordeal that I didn't consider it to be.  Now she said \"She is almost 13, you need to give her her space if you want to have a relationship with her\".  At this point I snapped and said \"How can I have a relationship if you never let me see her god dammit!\".  Lets just say this did not go over well and the conversation was ended.  Then the mother called.  Hitting me with the usual insults and threats that I have grown a custom to.  I never paid her child support (it was always paid to the grandma because she isn't allowed to have a bank account because of bank fraud).  She'd take me to court and get 12 years back pay and everything I have paid is a gift.  Calling me names and so forth.  After holding the phone away from my ear for a majority of this, I hung up the phone.  \n\n\nNow the son of the grandmother calls.  This is who the grandmother and my daughter live with.  I tell him I know what he is going to say, not to talk to his mother like that.  He tells me they are not going to be coming.  That he is not sending them somewhere where they will be uncomfortable.  He has arrested a lot of people and seen where this goes (he is a FBI agent and I still don't get how him arresting people correlates with this situation or is any of his fucking business).  If we want to try again next year then that is an option but this year isn't happening.  My daughter is upset and doesn't want to come or even want a present for Christmas from me.  At this point I was so emotionally spent that I said OK and hung up.  \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole for standing up for myself?  I know how I went about it probably wasn't the most tactful but I feel like I was being unfairly attacked for something pretty trivial and the fact that she has yet to hold up her end of the bargain in the visitation agreement after I spent thousands of dollars to make it happen doesn't sit well with me at all.  I have tiptoed around them for 12 years because I want to be in my daughters life.  Today, I was just fed up and gave her a piece of my mind.  \n\n\nTL;DR Daughter was supposed to come visit for Christmas.  Had conversation with daughter as to why she didn't want to play minecraft with me so we could have something to do together while we are apart.  Grandma got on phone and started attacking me.  I cussed at her.  Now daughter isn't coming.  \n\n\nP.S. I understand my legal rights and that I could file a motion that the grandmother isn't abiding by the visitation order.  I don't have the money to do so and I don't want to upset my daughter in trying to stick it to her grandmother for being a bitch.",

So then he shouts at me saying shit like “a fucking chicken this is why your generation is the snowflake generation you gay pussy” so I say shut up etc. He then says “let me play elite dangerous then” \n\nHe got banned on elite dangerous over a year ago and he couldn’t actually play the game so he quit it and blamed me for doing something to his game. I said “I deleted elite because it took up a lot of storage and you couldn’t even play it” he then proceeds to shout at me saying “you deleted it you fucking evil cunt” “I knew it was your fault I got banned” (which made no sense at all)\n\nThen he left the room and unplugged the whole houses power (my mother and sister where in the house, my mum was about to leave to her job as a nurse and she couldn’t get ready without power so she was stressing out). I then walk into the room and say why did you turn it off and he said “you deleted my game so I couldn’t play it so you don’t deserve WiFi” I then call him petty and insult him etc and then my mum says “turn the WiFi on *my name* didn’t do anything wrong stop being like this I need to leave for work soon” he then says to my mum “shut the fuck up he deserves it he won’t let me play on his account and he deleted my favourite game” \n\nAt this point I was fuming so I ran out saying “I fucking hate you”and went back to my room.

      "description": "I'm living in my grandfather's old house which has a large pond. I'm guessing he used to allow people to come fish on this property, but he died years ago and I don't know who any of these people are, and no one has so much as knocked on the door to ask permission to fish or even introduced themselves to me. Now that the weather is getting nice, I daydream all day at work about coming home and spending time outside only to find that I can't because people I don't know are here fishing without permission. There are people I have never seen before fishing outside right now. This makes me very angry, but my boyfriend who lives with me says it isn't a big deal. I have very bad social anxiety so confronting these people is not an option for me and I don't want to go outside if people I don't know are here. I'm also 19 and living alone for the first time, so it really scares me when people are here, especially when I am home alone. Am I wrong for being angry about this? And would it be wrong for me to close and lock my gate at all times?",

      "description": "Right now I'm bawling my eyes out so I'm sorry if this is all over the place.  It's been a weird day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family is Jewish.  My parents and I live close to each other.  Occasionally we will have dinner at their place.  It's never at my place because I'm \"too messy\" and I don't want to hear it, and also my place is hella tiny.  Dinner isn't bad, but there are other issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, my sister and my parents kind of ended up in a weird war based on my sister attempting independence and my parents making fun of her every step of the way.  This includes sniping at her during dinner when I'm around and I feel like I have to defend her.  I mean she's married for god's sake, let her be a goddamn adult!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I have mental health issues and sometimes I need to just go home and just...not do shit.  It's not a problem for most people because they understand the concept of running out of spoons mentally (I don't make a habit out of this and I try to only do this when I am really REALLY drained and I think the activity would make things worse), but for my parents it's a mortal sin.  I did this for the first time ever last week and they are calling me \"selfish\" over it.  But my body just couldn't handle it.  Hearing them bitch about my sister, about me, about their \"friends\", being ~~forced~~ asked to clean up their place while hearing about how bad my place is...I couldn't deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince they can't understand that I can't just decide when I run out of energy, I've decided I'm not eating dinner with them anymore because that way I won't be selfish.  They can't be mad about me walking out on things I never agreed to right?  This also includes a large Passover dinner coming up.  The issue is that my sister, partly due to the issues above, also said she couldn't go to this dinner and my parents just assumed I was going.  I literally have no other plans that day, but I don't want to deal with all the other bullshit on a Friday night when the food sucks balls anyway because god forbid corn syrup be the 54th ingredient on a Hershey's chocolate bar that has 54 ingredients on the label.\n\nMy dad said that Passover was a \"family tradition\" but it's kind of dead now and my sister and I are grown ups who need to make our own traditions now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents have given me the silent treatment after I told them that I wasn't coming over for dinner anymore, including for Passover but I want to know if I'm the asshole for not attending.",

      "description": "I am 19 and the girl in question is 21. We have known each other since I was 8 years old, and she used to be my best friend. \n\nI know she hasn’t had the best life and I am sympathetic on that part. Her parents were dead beat drug addicts, however her and her two sisters were adopted by their grandparents pretty early on. Their grandparents were strict, but also had some good sides from what I’ve seen. And I’ve seen both good and bad. \n\nThere was a time when she lived with my family, around my freshman year. This was after she had run away from her grandparents and gone to live with her mom three hours away. But, she got on drugs and was trying to get out of that situation. Ok. Only problem is that she used my parents hospitality and didn’t actually try to change herself. During this time she was still doing drugs and was having unprotected sex with lots of dudes because she wanted to get pregnant. She went through like 4-5 “boyfriends” within the 2 months living with us. \n\nEventually I guess she was tired of my parents trying to give her a normal life cause she moved back with her mom. She then started doing heroine and cocaine. Has been arrested multiple times. She then got pregnant with a dude she had only been dating a few months, though by the time the baby was born she had moved on to a different dude. \n\nAccording to her sister who also lives in that town, she has repeatedly left her toddler at home alone in a room while her and her boyfriends go places. She didn’t take her kid to the doctor when he got bad diaper rash or got sick. She also got pregnant again and so now she has two kids.\n\nI haven’t talked to her since she left and my mom has been guilting me the whole time. This girl has tried to send me pics of her babies or reach out to me, but I always block her. It’s not that I hate her or are mad, it’s just that I have no sympathy anymore and I don’t want to see someone ruin their life.\n\nNow my mom just got a letter from her. She’s in prison for violating her parole. For drugs. But apparently she tried to kill herself and turned herself in. Maybe she is actually trying to get help and it’s a step in the right direction, but I still have no desire to speak to her. My mom says she mentions me every time they talk. \n\nAITA for not caring?

He starts to ring up his groceries and than calls me over. I ask him what the issue is and he explains that he just filled out for our store loyalty card and his phone number isn't pulling up when he types it in. Now usually it takes a few days for all the information to process but he insists that the woman at guest services told him it would be done before he finishes shopping. So I call over the intercom for guest services to call my phone. The man starts to become agitated and he says \"I should have known something this simple would be such a arkansasans.\" And I ask him where he's from and he says he's from California and \"people there know there left foot from their right foot. Southerners piss on your back and tell you it's raining.\" So I told him to go back to California where everyone's perfect and sent him to guest services with his order. I don't think he complained about me because nobody said anything but I could tell he was agitated. Apartantly he was told to wait a few days for the information to process for his loyalty card. I'm not really sure if I took it to far. Also note that I did raise my voice a bit when I told him to go back to where he came from. ",

She had nail appointment on Friday at 6PM so she got up and went to nail appointment to get her nails done. Same night my friend asked me to if I would go to PA with him (we live in Long Island NY) to check out a motorcycle and help him buy/load/strap etc....Since I had no plans with wife and she is not really sick anymore for me to stay home and take care of her since she has energy to get to nails, I said ok to my friend and we left 8 AM came back 3 PM Saturday. \n\nMeanwhile she had hair appointment for cut and color in Brooklyn NY. It takes 1 hr one way to get to Brooklyn from our house. She she drove in traffic to hair appointment in Brooklyn spent 3 hours and drove another hour and a half in traffic to come home and complain that I did not stay with her she was sick and I choose to do fun things with my friend. I said you are not sick because you did your nails and hair for hours or else you would stay home and relax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, we argued a bit but nothing major, then we went to pick up mother in law to bring her over to our house for Saturday night to Sunday night. She comes over every weekend. We got home, dinner, tea, etc...then went to bed around 11:30PM. She was upset from our previous arguments, disagreement  and wanted to talk at 1130pm and I was really tired and told her that I dont want to talk now that we can talk later. I want to sleep now. She said no she wants to talk now because I should since I went out and had fun all day that I did not get tired etc...I ignored her and asked her to turn her back to spooning so we can just go to bed. She insisted talk but I really did not have energy. She said fine turned her back, picked up her phone and started watching netflix with sound on, no ear phones and screen is bright. I asked her to turn it off or take it to leaving room or kitchen to watch it. She told me dont tell her what to do. i got upset and since she does this to me all the time I tried to grabbed her phone to put it on my side so we can fall asleep. While this was happening she started telling and started to cry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the story. My mother in law heard her and she barged in the bedroom without knocking on the door, turned on the light and asking what's happening. I told her there is nothing important that we are just arguing and she should not get involved and she should leave. She pushed me to bed and I remember telling my wife that if she could stop crying and talk to her mother because she is being disrespectful by barging in our bedroom getting involved with our business and pushing me. She did not say anything continued to cry and this point I got up, put on my clothes and left the house at 11:45 PM to send the rest of the night at hotel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got back home Sunday evening mother in law was gone, she was ignoring me and not saying anything. I asked her if we can have a word. She said sure talk while she was combing, drying her hair putting up lotion on her face. \n\nI asked her if mom to come back to this house she owes me an apology. She started laughing and long story short she thinks I should be the one who should apologize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for asking my mother in law to apologize to me for barging in our bedroom middle of the night and pushing me off to bed during our little argument with my wife?",

      "description": "My mom got into a hit and run last night. She was fine, and there was very minor damage to her car. However, she still wanted to file a claim and wanted my help looking at her dashcam footage (she’s not very good with technology).\n\nSo, we look at the footage and with the looping mechanism of the dash cam, it seemed that the crash happened in the 10-second interval between video files. Basically, the footage we needed was just missed. Wasn’t able to see the crash or the car that hit her at all.\n\nI chuckle a little because, well, what are the odds that the exact footage we need happened to be lost in that 10-second interval? I tend to laugh in uncomfortable and unfortunate situations anyways. She goes off on me, saying that she’s really upset and I’m being insensitive. She basically tells me to get out of her office before she starts screaming at me.\n\nI realized she was really upset about the situation, but the damage is pretty minor and she took down the license plate, make, and model of the vehicle. I was trying to comfort her explaining the facts of the situation to her, i.e. how the camera works, how unlucky the situation was, and how it wasn’t her fault…but my comments and my laughing seem to have really gotten her mad.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

I honestly feel so embarrassed and there’s a little voice in my head that’s telling me I’m a whore and that it was my fault. \n\nI don’t think he’s a homophobe or that I’ll be in danger if I come out to him.

      "description": "So, to preface this let me just say that me and my brother have always been very close and he's always looked out for me which I greatly appreciate, but we just had a big fight due to my girlfriend (29/F) Nicole. I was telling my brother that nicole and I recently started doing the whole open relationship thing, and I admitted to him that I wasn't okay with it at all that I actually hated it but I am just putting up with it because I love her. My brother immediately started telling me that I'm weak, have no respect for myself and that I should tell her the truth.\n\nNow I admit I got mad, blew up and told him to mind his own fucking business. I really shouldn't have done that but I feel like he just wasn't putting himself in my shoes. I am 29 years old and this is my first ever relationship. She was my first kiss and the person I lost my virginity to. I am a very ugly guy and introverted. The truth of the matter is that if nicole left me I would be alone for a very long time once again. Having my brother put me down when I already feel inadequate made me feel like complete shit and i get even madder when i think about it and dont feel like talking to him. i would please like some opinions and advice thank you",

Well the time we all agreed on comes and goes so I send everyone a text asking where they are, I get no response so I continue to wait eventually it's about 45 minutes after the time we all agreed on and I post to our group chat; it's been 45 minutes and I've gotten no response from anyone, I'm not running the session today. After sending this I promptly got responses saying oh we can still do DnD today and things along those lines no reasons as to why they've not showed up, I respond by saying I'm not doing it anymore maybe tomorrow. Well Sunday comes around and everyone's calling me an asshole for not wanting to run it for them. So am I the asshole?",

This information is so easy to find on the internet and we did our research when we were house hunting.\n* My FIL likes to make himself and his family look superior. My siblings and I did well in high school (got high scores in the equivalent of SATs). FIL tells my parents that his children got higher scores than us. I already knew that their scores were significantly lower.\n* My in-laws like to bitch about me to their extended family and I overhear some of it at family gatherings. I told my husband and they denied everything when he confronted them. A few things they blamed entirely on my mother.\n\n\nThe first two are harmless so I didn’t say anything, to not look petty. I don’t know why they bother because you can find out the truth with very little effort.

Everything was good and we had a good time and my friend and I were laughing the whole time and he didnt know why. Fast forward to the next semester he transferred to my college and text me saying we should hang out. He's a super dope dude so when I went to meet him at starbucks he had like 5 other people there, and he introduced me as his australian friend, keep in mind that whole weekend we made a whole backstory for me. Well I thought it'd be SUPER awkward to tell him I was pretending in front of all his friends so I kept it going. Luckily I hadnt seen the people he was with since but fast forward 1.5 years me and the guy are still friends and hang out semi-regularly, and every time I have to make sure none of my other friends are with us so i can do the accent and i feel so bad about this whole situation that started as a joke",

      "description": "Ok, a bit of a backstory here. I (25M) have a female friend that I've known since highschool. In my opinion, we keep really appropriate boundaries and mainly just chitchat about music, memes, etc. I did my best to make my relationship with said female friend to my girlfriend (27F) very transparent. Showed her conversations and just tried to make her at ease about the nature of the relationship as best as possible. My female friend sometimes texted me memes at night, but it was nothing to worry about (to me). Girlfriend did not like it and said it was inappropriate, but I just didn't respond to the texts to appease her. We went home for the Christmas holiday and I took my girlfriend home to meet friends from college and hangout with my family. The last night in town, my friends and I were to all gather at house we lived at in college to grill out and just hang. My female friend and her boyfriend were invited and were the first to arrive. When we pulled up at the house my friend came over to give me a hug and said \"cocojoe93! Whats up fam!\". My girlfriend hops out of my truck and the first thing she says is \"What did you call him?\" My friend says \"I called him fam...?\"\n\nThe night goes on and seems to be going well as we're all interacting in what seems normal. I even pulled my girlfriend aside and asked if everything was ok, to which she responded \"yes, I'm just observing\". At a couple instances, I did notice whenever I tried to talk to my female friend and her boyfriend, my girlfriend would almost stop what she was doing to \"join\" the conversation. Things seemed ok as girlfriend said she tried to talk to my friend and be nice to her all night. However, towards the end of the night, shit got weird. I went to take a picture with my friend as I don't see her, ever. Girlfriend photobombs. I'm annoyed but it's whatever. When my friend and her boyfriend go to leave I give her a hug and shake his hand. My girlfriend does this weird thing where she tried to link arms and pick my friend up on her back. Then she grabbed her around the waist and picked her up and hugged her. My friend was not amused and immediately told her to put her down. When their Uber pulled up, my girlfriend walks up to my friend and says \"I'm sorry if I offended you I was only trying to be friendly\". Friend responds \"that wasn't friendly, that was you being bitchy\". And my girlfriend took offense to this and immediately attacked my friend. I ran in and pulled them apart while they screamed insults at each other. I was extremely pissed off and embarrassed. \n\nFast forward and ex-girlfriend is defending that she tried all night to be nice. She says she told my female friend where to get bath bombs (the hosts mom was passing them out), tried to make conversation, and pulled up space for my friend to sit at the crowded dinner table. I acknowledged those things she did were nice, but that she was also being passive aggressive all night. I later found out my girlfriend went up to my friend and asked her \"do you watch anime?\" Friend replies \"No\" girlfriend says \"idk why people think people who watch it don't get laid. Cocojoe93 and I watch it together and he gets pussy all the time\" I confronted her about this and she said \"I didn't think it was weird\" and claimed just to have a lack of social etiquette. Then she says I should have confronted my friend for cursing at her. \n\nWhat's up Reddit? AITA? Just trying to figure things out. \n\n",

      "description": "I've rented a 5-bedroom, 2-story house with 4 roommates since July 2018. I'm the only person on the lease and have paid for the deposit ($500 of which is a non-refundable pet deposit), in full personally. My roommates venmo rent to me each month which I then send to our landlord. Since we moved in, my cat has been a roommate like any other. His food, bed, and litter are all upstairs where my bedroom is located.\n\nLast month, my roommate's girlfriend moved in with him downstairs. She was supposed to move in in July, but personal issues delayed that move. Before moving in, she informed me that she had a cat allergy and she would like the cat kept upstairs. I agreed the cat's home would be upstairs.\n\nNow that she's moved in, she's installed a pet gate at the top of the stairs, and has said that her allergies are too severe for the cat to be downstairs where her bedroom is located. It's worth knowing that the cat is 100% disallowed from her bedroom, but is normally allowed to be in our shared spaces.\n\nAITA for being livid that she has dictated where my cat can go, and refusing to restrict him to upstairs? To me, this seems like major overstepping, but she says I've created a hostile environment for her since I was informed of her allergies. Reddit HALP! ",

      "description": "He lives with us after being kicked out from his house after he hurt his back in the army and had to go home. He doesn't pay rent but he has a job, and frequently works overtime, up to 9 or 10 hours. From what I have seen online he has a TAPHOO 80W, and he can not conceal it in his hands because it's about the size of a 8oz coke can. On his days off when me and my brother get home from school the house smells like berry, and he keeps the windows and doors open and turns the heat off, so he doesn't have to go outside. I know for a fact he does it in the bathroom because he takes it with him, and he probably shoots it out the vent. When my parents aren't home he just does it out the window. He has purposefully set off the smoke detector twice by vaping directly into it.\n\nI can tell my parents do not like confronting him, like they don't tell him to put the milk back when he leaves it out, or wash your dish if it's the only thing in the sink, or help take out the trash and recycle on Tuesdays,  they always ask me to tell him. He chipped my mom's treasured blender yesterday and didn't seem to think it was a big deal. He plays Clash Royale with my brother and sister (10F) and it affects my siblings because they are now less respectful and do not do chores or other tasks because it's a live game and they are constantly playing and waiting for new updates. \n\nThis morning my parents told me that I have to be the one to tell him to stop vaping. I have been suffering with severe asthma for more than half my life and my father quit smoking when I was young. We also have a ONE year old in the household. I don't know what he is thinking but he never tries to hide it, maybe he thinks that my immigrant parents are stupid and don't know what it is, and he casually makes comments saying, \"haha what if your parents walked in and said 'it smells good in here?'\"\n\n**My mom said that if he wants to vape he has to go out further than where our grass ends, about 20 feet, wear a jacket, leave the jacket outside, and wash his hands when he comes in. (The problem is he literally goes out every 5-10 minutes) My dad says that if I don't say anything he will have a talk with him, and my dad has never confronted him about other issues, because I always have to do it.** \n\n**WIBTA for forcing him to follow these rules or stop vaping?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We are best friends and very very close. I ended up leaving the college we met at to study at home and I live about 7 hours away depending on the drive. I announced this weekend that I'd be coming up to visit, and he has known about this for about a week, and he said he wouldn't be able to hang out with me when I visited thanks to a movie night he's running using his computer. It was a very small group of people but he said I could come along but I really wished he had at least considered recheduling it because I wanted to see him. He invited me to the movie but I wouldn't have been able to talk to him anyways because of the movie. I know he probably wouldn't go as out of his way to see me but it still frustrates me sometimes. I don't know what to do, I've been delaying my responses to him but want to know if my anger is justified (I'm already home again)\n\nThanks :)",

      "description": "I feel like an absolute retard because this is the lamest post I've ever made in my life, but my girlfriend has been hinting to me that she wants a new phone for her very first Christmas (her Iphone 5 is 6 years old and fucked).\n\nJust to preface, she's by no means gold digger, we always pay for one and other when we go out for a meal or buy something. We are both stingy people, and she has made me more conscious of my spending. \n\nAnyway, I'm happy to buy her a new phone, but she's been hinting at one of the newer model IPhones (IPhone 8, XR, w/e) which I think is a waste of money since, from my research, they aren't that different in specifications from the IPhone 6, which is far cheaper in comparison. I don't like the idea of disappointing her on Christmas but I'm not spending 800 - 1k AUD on some overvalued phone, so I implicitly said to her that the IPhone 6 is better bang for buck and than any higher model and she argued against me, saying that it was only 1 model after her phone, blah blah. \n\nHonestly the technical details of the argument are irrelevant, I just want to know how I should handle this behaviour. Am I being a stingy asshole? Am I an asshole for not wanting to buy a product I don't believe is worth it for HER? I was considering working part time for like 10 shifts just to pay for the phone XD but am I just spoiling her? Honestly if she said \"Oh a 6 would be fucken sweeeeet\" I would have done that for her but now she has pissed me off.\n\nHelp me assholes",

You were asleep so didn't want to bother you. My mother is also a qualified doctor and her thought was it's an interesting question to ask because it's what we both see family doing\nWife: find don't ask me to support you or do anything for you. Don't ask for my opinion \nMe. You do realise how silly this is? Anyways I know how ztressed you are now  so will let you rest.\nWife: you never change\nMe: At the end of the day I know you are really stressed with the pregnancy and are worried about the health issue and maybe that's why you are angry at me for a veeeeery small issue that really isn't an issue but I don't need to seek anyone's approval before I move forward. I am capable of handling things and if it's good great and if someone doesn't like it or has an issue that's fine. They can take it up with me. At the end of the day you can't please everyone and my goal isn't to get everyone's approval in what I do or make everyone like me or follow me or whatever. I'm trying everyday to be better than the day before and I appreciate all the support and pushing you do for me. But it's just an Instagram post.\n\nWife:Great. I was stupid to support u and make u do mpaeds and ffd. And keepin strong just so u dont get more stressed. You make me realise how stupid I was to support you \n\n\nSeriously am I missing something???\nShe is seriously stressing me out over this pregnancy and it's not our first child either.

      "description": "This week in school we got to chose classes for junior year. I signed up for a few AP classes because I am already in accel classes and these would be the next step in the line of the curriculum. I also ended up not signing up for drama 3, and instead, chose to have a free period to study because of my AP classes. So come this last Friday, our application slips are due for our classes, and I turned mine into my counselor. Not even a few hours later I get an email from my drama teacher, let's call her H, saying that she wanted to \"talk with me\" in class.\n\nI go to drama class and halfway through the class, once we've split up into our groups to do our scenes, H comes over to me and my partner, let's call her A.\n\nH: \"so did you yell at him yet\"\n\nA: she didn't quite understand \"uhhh, no\"\n\nH: \"he's not signing up for drama next year\"\n\nA: \"why aren't you signing up\"\n\nMe: (I'm quite awkward and shy so I suck at conversing) \"I don't know, I just have too many classes and don't have the time\"\n\nH: \"you need to sign up for drama 3, you are taking to many AP courses and are gonna be overworked. You don't want to be studying all the time, do you?\"\n\nIll give H credit here, she is right, I probably will be stressed, but I can deal with it, and I get it. \n\nH: \"A, you are going to make him write an email to his counselor and he is going to drop a course for drama. You don't need to take computer science, its a useless class and are going to be overworked.\"\n\nAt this point I'm angry, but, I don't say anything. She walks off and me and A talk about whether or not I should drop physics. She tells me how it's hard, and that's understandable, but the math class I'm taking works hand in hand with the physics one, so if I drop it and take it senior year, I may not be too well off. Additionally, I wouldn't have a science course credit which is needed to graduate.\n\nClass comes to a close, and I never got around to writing that email.\n\nI find it so annoying how H just comes all up in my business and bosses me around, and barely lets me defend myself. Also, I find it super creepy how she was able to see my class list, I don't know how that works. I'm going to email my counselor, without context n the situation, and ask how a teacher may find my class list. \n\nAlso, I probably should note, I didn't audition for the musical, for reasons unrelated, and she also emailed me a similar \"lets talk in class thing.\" Not only this, but some other kids in my class didn't sign up as well for drama, and they got the same email. I find it super creepy, rude, and intrusive.\n\nSo WIBTA if I sent an email to her saying how I felt? I don't want to fuck myself over with my counselor wither, so what should I say?

      "description": "My girlfriend has a tendency to take her emotions out on me when she has stressors outside of our relationship. It’s something that has bothered me for a long time, and we’ve had many discussions and a few fights about it. Recently she’s been extremely stressed again about returning back to school, and today is the day she leaves as she is heading back early. \n\nAll week she’s been fighting with me, over everything and anything. Today especially, she has been constantly speaking to me in an Insulting manner. I had plans with her and her parents to go get lunch before they drop her off at school. Right before i went to leave she called me twice and sent me 18 texts to make sure i wasn’t going to be late, implying that I am not able to be on time without her reminders, something she states often. I had enough of it, and told her i refused to go until she started to control her emotions better. We go to the same school, so I will see her Sunday when I head back. I love this girl, and outside of this issue we have an incredible relationship, but i felt i needed to put my foot down after going through this so many times. So AITA for blowing her off? ",

      "description": "After years of dealing with depression and self-hatred, which I still have issues with, I've come to a point in my life where I find making friends to be difficult and therefore, pointless.\n\nI do have a few friends, and one of them is where this question stems from.\n\nNow, hes friends with this girl that I...Utterly hate. I've explained to him why I don't like her and why I don't want to talk about her, but by no means am I not telling my friend that he can't be friends with her just because I don't like her. All I ask is that he doesn't bring her up. Seems fair, right?\n\nWell apparently he thinks otherwise. While its perfectly fine for him to get pissy with me for bringing up people he dislikes (which I respect and don't do), he thinks I'm being ridiculous because \"it happened in the past.\"\n\nYeah, it happened in the past, but what she did caused me to lose all my friends and caused me to hate myself. Because of her, my life just got worse. (But I do realize that its not that great now because of my own choices, I'm not here to debate that.)\n\nBecause I know people are going to ask what happened: \n\nWhen I was younger I was part of a group of friends that I finally thought I was getting along with. I was a troubled kid who switched schools a lot due to moving around and was raised by a single mom after she divorced my cheating \"dad\". I had a hard time trusting people and making friends.\n\nShe was part of that group, but she was always mad when she wasn't the center of attention. To her, that meant I had to go.\n\nShe spent weeks acting like she was scared of me, convincing our \"friends\" that I was threatening her life, while also spreading rumors about how I was supposedly sleeping with guys I didn't even know. (I'm asexual, I've never had an interest in sex, but the rumors still bothered me.)\n\nThey believed her over me, not a single one of them stood up for me or took my side. So I lost my friends, I blamed myself for it, and I spent most of high school in the library and just being alone.\n\nNow I'm 25. And this guy thinks I should forgive her for what she did and act like it never happened?\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking hes an asshole and refusing to pretend I'll get along with her just because hes friends with her?

I am a 18-year old college student and I am at my house for Spring Break and I was told by Chris that I'd have to do the dishes because I didn't cook as Seth did. I was fine with this fact as that was to be expected, however I raised the question of why doesn't Therese (Chris's nine-year-old granddaughter) have to help, and she replies in a snarky tone \"Well, Chris told you to\" and after a but of back and forth, I said \"Why do you have to be such a brat about everything\". Chris then said that he will not tolerate name-calling in this house.\n\nJust some background info, Therese doesn't have the best home life, she doesn't have a dad right now.\nI had also been dealing with her all afternoon, as she caused us a lot of exasperation in earlier events.\n\nIn addition, after being told to rinse her plate, she just puts it on the sink for me to deal with.\n\nI am having a lot of inner-conflict about this and appreciate any comments this community brings me.",

      "description": "We have broken up now. But my ex boyfriend(22) was the pickiest eater. And I mean absolutely refused to eat certain foods.\n\nFor example , he loves pesto, but he does not know what it’s made out of, because it’s green and he won’t like it after he knows what it’s made out of (basil).\n\nHe has no allergies and he is diabetic, so I would encourage him to eat healthier or atleast some vegetables. I have been at family dinners with his family and his mother would serve these amazing stuffed bell peppers . And he would only scoop the rice and eat that alone.\n\nHe doesn’t mind eating junk food all day, chicken nuggets, burgers ect.\n\nSo one night at my house , I had made lasagne (with small carrot pieces in it) and I served mine with some steamed vegetables including steamed carrots and served his as just lasagna.\n\nMid dinner I feel like he is eyeing my plate so I ask “would you like to try some of my carrots” to which he replied “nah I don’t like carrots” 🤢\n\nI had told him there is carrot in the lasagna. He pushes away the plate and says he’s finished eating (but at this point he had already had 2 servings of it, working on his 3rd)\n\nHe later told me he felt violated that I fed him carrot without his knowledge and was quite upset about it.\n\nI had just been trying so hard to deal with his pickiness, as always having to cater our dinners to his liking and everyone is entitled to have likes and dislikes but I felt it was all in his head and quite irrational.\n\nTL:DR\nex boyfriend only likes food if he doesn’t know what it’s made of.

She hates listening to my advice when I try and recommend changes to her meal plan \"mine is just as good as yours and doesnt take as long to prep\"\n    Once or twice a week she will have a cheat meal or day and I know what's coming next. The day after she is moody the entire day talking about how fat she is and hates her body. When I try to comfort her by telling her the time spent enjoying you life is why we workout so hard and how beautiful she is she just gets frustrated with me and starts copping an attitude and I'm starting to get fed up with it. \n    Quick disclaimer my wife looks like a damn fitness model.\n\nTl:dr or whatever it is. \nMy wife doesnt listen to my fitness or nutrition advice but bitches at me when she cheats her diet.",

      "description": "Me (32m) and wife (31m) got married about 8 months back. We have good enough savings if compared to our country's standards. Past two months my wife has been pestering me to buy a house and have a baby. I wasn't okay with both but thought let me at least look at some homes to get an idea. \n\nAs I started looking at apartments to buy I started to get depressed. The price is 4 times what I'll earn with my current salary. Prices of homes are just exorbitant and the loan rates are very high. I'll end up paying 30% just as principal. I suggested that we don't buy a home and live rented and plan for our kid in a few months. \n\nShe got upset with me and just walked to our room and went to sleep. She didn't open up and tell me how she feels and when I asked her she said there's nothing to speak. \n\nI don't like taking loans because I was bought up with a thinking that giving loans and taking loans is bad plus  I've been fired from my last two jobs and am now in a stable position. The thought of being tied up to a bank for the next 10 years scares the hell out of me. It's because of this I am wary of not wanting to take a loan to buy a house. But my wife says something like I have to push myself and keep on getting better. I get that argument but for me 10years loan repayment is scary. \n\nTLDR: Wife wants to buy a house and I'm scared to be stuck in repaying loans for 10 years.",

      "description": "Before the obvious answer, this has been a big debate among my friends since it happened. This happened over 10 years ago while I was in college. At a party a woman and I were talking and this is where detail is very important before passing judgment. SHE was flirting with me after about an hour of just talking. And by flirting I mean she was touching my arm and shoulder and in close proximity than normal, especially if someone is taken. \n\nIt wasnt until I had asked if she wanted to head back to my place that she told me she had a bf. Now more detail again, when she told me it wasnt a quick and assertive \"sorry I'm I'm a relationship\" response. The best way I can put it is \"well I am in a relationship\" and had a pause after well. Now, after I said ok and just kept talking to her, she still kept staying close and playfully touching my arm. \n\nNow, in my book I've always said if a woman hits on you first then it's fair game. So after 4 beers and me being a horny college kid, I ask again if she wants to go back to my place. She still hesitates and responds that shes in a relationship so I up the ante. I tell her that we can go back to my place and hangout and then that will give her an idea if she truly sees a future with her bf. She agrees and after maybe 10 minutes at my place her top is off.\n\nSo, I know it seems like I'm the asshole but honestly, AITA given the details on the events leading up to it? ",

I moved in with him so I could help pay bills and he'd have some extra money to help pay off his debt. I gave up a nice, affordable duplex that accepts pets, which is very hard to find in our area. I also gave up a 7 minute commute to work and 10 minute commute to my 24hr gym and grocery store. I feel this is significant because I work nights and keep my night hours on my days off so these 24hr amenities were very convenient for me. I now have a 30 minute drive to work, live in a completely different town, different county, where everything is closed by 9pm. Without telling me, he'd been setting aside money, instead of applying it to his debt, and used that money to buy a new gun. After purchasing all the accessories he'd spent over $1600. He already has five other guns that he rarely, occasionally uses for hunting or just target practice. I feel I've sacrificed a lot so that he can work on his debt. I pay for half the bills and most of the groceries to try to help him. I understand it's his money and I can't tell him what to do with it. But... Am I the asshole for thinking this is a purchase that could've waited till he actually has disposable income?",

      "description": "Okay so my friend (17F) has been talking to this guy (idk how old, around the same age). They’ve been subtly flirting as friends for about two months now. Recently it’s escalated and became obvious that they’ve liked each other for a while. They’ve been flirting more and it’s on a sexual side now. \n\nOne thing he said was “so you can be my sub and I can be your dom, that makes you mine”. He said this at like the beginning of them starting to flirt more sexually, so it was still new for them. She said “okay but if I’m yours does that mean I’m only yours? because if it does than that has to mean you’re only mine” Basically implying that they’d be exclusive or she doesn’t want a relationship with him, sexual or not. \n\nThen, he said “that’s where it gets tricky”. So of course she was upset thinking he didn’t even want a relationship. The next day he explains that he has more subs and she wouldn’t be the only one.. he said some manipulative stuff making her believe she would still be the most special one. I don’t doubt he said that to all of the other girls. \n\nFast for award to today, he tells her this: \n\n “Well I'm polyamorous idk if that makes any difference to you but I feel like why cant I make more than one person happy or satisfied  and i just simply feel like I would want to do that with you because it would make me even happier. And because of that the absolutely worst thing and what I definitely dont want is to hurt you so this is why communication with me is super important Idk how I would be able to explain that more but I'm not saying I feel like something is missing from my other sub it's just that I want to have you as a sub that's happy with the way things are. Idkkkk how I could exaplain it in a way that makes sense and its driving me nuts” \n\nTo me, it looks really manipulative and like he’s guilty tripping her into being okay with it. I brought that up and she said she doesn’t know what she wants. I told her how it sounds like he’s trying to justify having more than one girl at once. Especially since he doesn’t REALLY expect them to be all together at once, he really just wants to be able to talk to all of them  at the same time and the girls don’t have contact with each other. He says he wants 3-4 girls. \n\nThe reason I’m questioning my friend is because a few days earlier she told me she really liked him and might want a relationship with him, and how she doesn’t want him to be talking to other girls. \n\nBut now it seems like he’s been slowly incorporating this idea into their conversations and making her think this is what she wants. \n\nMy friend and I have been best friends since 2012. She’s been completely honest with me about this situation with him and even she is getting a feeling that it’s sketchy. But, she’s been getting defensive because she’s liked him for a while and doesn’t want to accept that he’s doing this. \n\nSo AITA for trying to make her see that he’s bullshitting her?  AITA for assuming he’s not being honest? ",

      "description": "So this happened about a year ago, but I'm still not sure who is in the wrong. \n\nFor reference, I had been with my then girlfriend for around 6 months at this point. \n\nI am a big proponent of self-reflection and I journal quite a lot. I write down whatever I am feeling at that moment, and therefore consider my journal and its contents to be very private. I find that it helps me make big decisions or simply clarify my feelings about certain situations. My girlfriend was well aware of how private I consider this journal to be. \n\nAnyways, I was telling my then girlfriend about how helpful I find journaling to be, and in the process I showed her what kind I had and therefore which drawer I kept it in. \n\nAt this point in time, we were approaching the last term of our senior year in college, and my thoughts about our long term plans were well written about. I wrote about how I wasn't confident that we would remain together due to the fact that we had already committed to living in other cities, but that my decision had not been made. I also wrote about a long time crush that I had recently seen. I never cheated, and never had the intention of cheating, but I wrote that I wondered what it would be like to date this girl. It was going through my head in that very moment, which is why I wrote it down. Not because I had the intention of following through with it. \n\nThe next morning I went to class while I let her sleep in for the rest of the morning in my bedroom. She confronted me later in the day admitting that she read my journal, and knew how I felt about continuing our relationship and about the \"other girl that I loved\". She broke up with me for it later that day. \n\nIn no way do I consider those to be my final decisions, just how I felt at the time of writing. She never asked me face to face about the continuation of our relationship. To me, it seems like she read my journal to find something she wouldn't like, and that anything she read shouldn't be considered, as those were my thoughts at the time but not my final decision. \n\nTo this day, I still don't know if I'm in the wrong for writing all that, or if she's in the wrong for reading it in the first place. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\ntl,dr - my girlfriend read my private journal and broke up with me for what I wrote about the future of our relationship.

I thought based on what she had been doing that was probably a good choice.\n\n Her husband works for the gym I attend and I needed to put my account on hold. I messaged him asking if he could put the paper work for that through and he said he could. We chatted for a bit I asked him how things were going and he said they were okay but not great- I said that his wife had told me about their break and that I was sorry that they were struggling.\n\nTHEY WERE NOT ON A BREAK. So the. He starts rapid firing questions about it and I tried to deflect as much as possible.\n\nShe texted me until 12 midnight saying that because of me they are getting a divorce.

      "description": "So I was a mod on this discord server, Which I am not going to say the name of.  There was a lot of drama but most of it didn't involve me so I really didn't care. I just doing my job and making sure that everyone follows the rules. But one time I decided to host a competition of some sort and the owner gave me permission. The competition was about the first to reach 1000 while counting gets a special role. And so I host it, for most of it it was going well. Until one day, another mod that we'll call jack starting interrupting the counting when someone had reached 900... I told them to go away and they did. But, someone had managed to reach 998. And as they typed in 999 a bot came out of nowhere and said 100. Jack comes in and starts laughing, I get really annoyed, tell him to fuck off and leave the competition alone. But they don't stop, they started spamming the image of the bot saying \"1000\" after the deleted the message. This got me really annoyed and so in a fit of rage I kicked the bot and took jack's permissions. We both had the same permissions but we could take each other's powers away for some reason. Anyways, we go to the general chat and we start arguing, after a few minutes it was my breaking point. I tell jack to fuck off because he was so annoying, and then I leave the server. But it doesn't end here. \n\nAbout a month later the owner messages me, me and the owner didn't hate each other and we were somewhat of friends. He tells me that jack has been banned and the server had changed a lot. I take his words and join the server, but I tell him if I ever see jack again I am leaving. This works out well and jack is nowhere to be found. But fast forwards again to today, and as I join the server I see that jack has joined back. I tell him \"Oh look who it is! Time to fulfill my promise!\" And I immediately leave. Even if people tell me I am the asshole or not I don't think I am going back there. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my mom to drop my friend off when she was picking me up?",
      "description": "Basically, I go to school in a major city and I come back to visit my parents like once every month or two. We don’t really get along so I don’t like to come\nback often. But some high school friends were in our hometown this weekend for a birthday and I decided to come back. \n\nI don’t drive because a. I have never needed to living in the city and b. it is very expensive and cost of living in this city is expensive as it is. So when I do go home to see my parents they have to pick me up (about 40 mins from the suburb to the city). Another reason for this is because I have a dog and obviously we have to take her with me. I could take the long distance coach bus but my dog doesn’t do well in them. \n\nMy parents live close to the suburbs but they recently moved to a new housing development that’s basically in the middle of nowhere. In order for me to get to a bus stop I have to walk about 35 minutes and because it’s the suburbs busses run on a half hour schedule and take a very long time to get anywhere. Also because it’s the suburbs there isn’t much to do and everything is pretty spread out. So the plan for my friends birthday was to meet at a mall about 20-30 mins driving but takes over an hour by bus. In the afternoon I had my\nmom drop me off at a major bus station where I took the bus to the mall. \n\nIn the evening, after we were done dinner around 9:15, we checked for bus times and it wasn’t set to come\nfor another 25 minutes. Two of my friends were taking a bus that was due to come in 5 minutes but my friend Kate and I were supposed to take the same bus back. It would take Kate over an hour and two busses to get home and frankly it’s cold and late...\n\nThe plan originally was supposed to be that I was going to go back to the city tonight, but I figured it was kind of late and I could just go back tomorrow, so I asked my mom to pick me up from and just take me back to their place. She said she would rather drop me off tonight and that she would gather my stuff and drop me off in the city. I ask her if she can drop Kate off too since she’s coming anyway, and she says “Think of your mother.” My parents live maybe a 15 minute drive from Kate. I didn’t think it was a big deal but it was late so I decided maybe it was too much to ask. So I ask what if we just dropped her off at a major bus station? They’re not far from the highway we’d have to take back to the city but it would be going the opposite way a little bit. Kate would still have to take a bus but it would probably be 20 minutes on the bus as opposed to over an hour. \n\nAnd my mom is like fine, the bus station is okay. So I tell Kate we can drop her off at a bus station. \n\nAnd I’m waiting and it’s 9:45 at this point, too late for Kate to take the bus or else she’d have to wait for another one. I text my mom where she is and she calls me freaking out like, “Why are you rushing me? You always ask so much of me.” going on and on in our language, yelling at me for asking her to drop off my friend. She complains that I can’t drive (which isnt even financially feasible for me), and she is so tired of having to drive me everywhere (even though I don’t even come back that often). She says she hasn’t even left yet.  And I feel like shit and my friend feels like shit because she can hear my mom yell at me through the phone even though she doesn’t understand what she’s saying. \n\nI text my dad asking if he can pick me up instead since obviously my mom is mad. He says no, he’s already in bed. I ask if mom left the house yet and he says he doesn’t know. I ask if he can just check, and he says she’s not there so she must have left. \n\nI text my mom again and asks her if she can please drive Kate to the bus station (an uber would’ve been expensive) and my mom is like fine but don’t ask me to drop off anyone ever again. \n\nAnyway, my mom gets here at like 10:10 pm and my friend asks if I’m sure it’s okay we can drive her. My mom asks if it’s okay if we drive me home first (40 mins to the city) and on the way back to the suburbs drive my friend. \n\nI feel like this is obviously for my moms benefit but she didn’t say this to me when I asked her. If I had known she was expecting to do this, then it would’ve saved Kate more time to just take the bus in the first place. But Kate gets in and my mom drives me back to the city and then drops Kate off. \n\nAITA here? I know it was kind of late to ask my parents to pick me up (dinner went longer than expected) but I didn’t think it would be unreasonable to assume they could drop my friend off. From the beginning she could have said no to the bus station or been more clear but she made it sound like I was asking this huge request and putting a huge burden on her. I don’t feel like I’m being unreasonable to my friend or my mom, but I feel super shitty. My mom made both of us feel really bad even though I didn’t think it was a huge deal to ask for her to drop my friend off since she was coming anyway. I get that it was kind of late and that she was probably tired and I can’t expect her to be an Uber but was it really that big of a deal?? \n\nTL;DR I don’t drive (none of my friends do—too expensive at our age 22/23) so my parents usually pick me and my dog up from the city I go to school in to their place in the outskirts of the suburbs, where there’s bad public transportation. After a birthday dinner finished kind of late (9 pm), instead of waiting 25 mins for the next bus and taking an hour bus ride home, I asked my mom to drive me and my friend. My mom wanted to drive me back to the city instead of bringing me back to their place and asked that I be more considerate of her. So I suggested we drop my friend off at the bus station (where she’d still have to take another bus but like 20 mins instead of over an hour) instead. My mom says okay, so I tell my friend, we wait in the restaurant till around 9:45 and I text my mom asking where she is and she gets very mad at me, and calls me yelling over the phone to stop rushing her and asking so much of her, and at this point she hasn’t even left yet. She doesn’t arrive till 10:10 and says we can drop my friend off but she’s driving me into the city first and then dropping my friend off because where we were dropping her off was a 15-20 minute drive in the opposite way of the city but towards the direction of where my mom lives.

About 5 days ago, my mother was given surgery to remove a vaginal cyst the size of a football, which may have been benign cancer, but there was an incision that cut across her stomach area to remove the cyst. This incision made it impossible to get up or lay down from or to a resting state without help.\n\nMy stepfather had taken a week worth of vacation time to visit her, and instructed me on how to take care of her. His vacation time ends today, and I am the only one capable of taking care of her.\n\nMy sister recently left for a friend’s house and has not come back after a dispute, so she would be the only possible candidate to take care of her if I left.\n\nI joined the Ski/Snowboard club of my school to be more active, and we needed to pay hundreds of dollars for all the equipment, rentals, and transportation.\n\nThe Ski trip is 2/7/19, and going on it means she will be alone for eight hours.\n\ntl;dr: Mother recently had surgery, cannot properly take care of herself alone, not many viable people to help, ski trip upcoming and going means she will be alone for hours on end.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I left my mother to go on a ski trip?",

      "title": "AITA for taking my roommates parking spot?",
      "description": "Okay so I’ve been living with these two friends of mine for about 3 months and we’ve had only a few issues but one of the main ones is parking.\n\nParking in our appartment complex is absolutely terrible. Every unit (except maybe one bedroom units?) Is allowed 3 parking spots. One covered and marked right by the stairway to your appartment, another compact spot off to the side, and your third spot is any spot marked visitor. \n\nI am responsible for every bill we pay, except rent which we each pay individually to our landlord. They obviously pay me their third of the bills at the end of the month, but it’s on me to have money in my account until then to make sure all the bills are paid and we don’t have any issues. Since I’m burdened with this, along with the fact that I drive the biggest car and I won’t fit in the compact spot, I suggested I be allowed the covered marked spot. They didn’t like that idea.\n\nWe ran through lots of ideas to solve the parking problem and roommate 1 suggested we just do first one home gets the covered marked spot if they want it. Of course I’m okay with this since I’m the first one off work everyday. Both roommate 2 and I agreed.\n\nAfter a few days of this roommate 1 was out late and came back to no available parking so he had to park away from the apartments. He’s told me two separate stories so I feel like it’s all a big lie, but he told me first that he got a ticket because he was illegally parked and then he told me he parked a few blocks away at the grocery store. No sure which is true, or if either are true honestly. \n\nSo because of this roommate 1 demanded a new parking rule so that never happened again. He said what we should do is first person home takes a visitor spot, second person takes the compact, and third gets the covered spot. This makes sense to me so I reluctantly agreed. \n\nThings were fine for a few weeks until one day I came home to limited parking available. As usually roommate 2 is in the marked compact spot, but roommate one was in visitor parking. I thought okay so I’ll just take the marked spot but it was taken by a car I’d never seen before. I parked all the way at the other end of the complex and furiously stormed in complaining that someone took our spot. It turns out that roommate 1 let his girlfriend take the covered spot and she was here for almost 2 whole days without moving. \n\nI let the last incident slide and for a few more weeks it was okay. I was getting good visitor spots, roommate 2 was still taking the compact spot and roommate 1 usually being the last one home would take the covered spot. I started realizing that roommate 1 was just taking the covered spot and not even following his own rules of parking visitor if he was home before us. This all came to a head when one weekend he went out of town and left his car in the covered spot the whole time. It really fucked me over 2 of those nights. I confronted him about it and he seemed unconcerned by my complaining. \n\nSo once again we made a new rule. There are 4 convenient visitors spots that I can take that are near our entrance. If they are available I will take them. If not I’m taking the covered spot. Roommate 2 still takes the compact spot which both roommate 1 and I don’t really have any issue with. \n\nThis rule worked well for a little bit, but Monday-Wednesday this week people have stayed parked in those good visitor spots. So I took the covered spot those days, as the allowed by the rules. Wednesday roommate 1 texts me and says that I keep taking the cover spot and he needs it. I told him no if you’re not here and there aren’t any good visitor spots then I’m taking that spot. He tried to tell me that he wants to go back to the old rule of first one here takes visitor and next takes covered. I called him out saying that I rarely if ever saw him taking a visitor spot and leaving the covered space for me. I’m going to paste what he said to me next here. “You’re right bro I’m wrong. You’re just being really selfish and inconsiderate. You’ve never had to park at the store before”. That pissed me off that he said I’m inconsiderate because he was out late one night and didn’t get a spot when he never ever went out of his way to leave me a spot. \n\nSo yeah I mean it’s only been a day since that happened but I’ve been taking the good open visitor spots. I don’t know what the solution is here, but that’s not why I’m here. I’m here to find out if I’m being an ass hole for doing this. Sorry for the long post! But thanks for taking the time!\n\nTL;DR: Roommate and I fight over a parking spot all the time. He wants me to take inconvenient visitor spots while he takes the covered spot simply because he likes to stay out late and doesn’t want to come back to no parking. \n\n",

He never got in trouble for it as he wasn't caught. Later on in the year, I accidentally posted my own dump of a GameCube iso to the school network, I meant to put it on my USB. My shit got confiscated. I got Saturday school.\n\nThis was all *last year*.\n\nNow this year, his computer was having hardware malfunctions. For some reason, the computer people scanned his hard drive. Since all the hacking shit happened last year, he wasn't in trouble and neither was I. They knew it was me, as I turned in my school computer for a personal laptop during the first quarter.  I wasn't expecting his parents to be told. Now they hate me. They won't let me hang out with him outside of school. If they even catch me talking to him on discord, they flip out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? I honestly dunno.",

      "description": "Hi Reddit,\n\nGoing to try to keep this as short yet detailed as possible.\n\nI have a friend of around 16 years. We had been best friends for most of that time, yet recently have kind of hit a bit of a lull. This has definitely been my fault though, as I have admittedly not made as much effort as I could have over the recent years. Regardless, we both reconnected and have been trying to stay friendly for the past 1.5 years or so.\n\nLast week she messaged me about a job opening at the organization I work for that would be perfect for her. Naturally, I told her happily to apply, as she has been having a difficult time in her current role and has been looking for a new job for quite some time now. All was well until a few days after when she messaged me asking \"how come you cant help get me into \\[my company\\]\". I explained to her that I do not know anyone in that area, but she can put me as her reference (as the application has a section for referrals from existing employees). \n\nShe then messaged me later in the day saying that this is \"important for her career and she is faced with a barrier that I can help her overcome but I am choosing not to\". She proceeded to tell me that she was \"disappointed and that there must be some internal process for referrals that I am not taking the initiative to find out more about\". (please note, I work in a government organization of over 8000 employees, there is no internal referral or incentive program)\n\nI replied with a detailed message explaining that I looked up the area she was applying for and I have no connections with anyone there, and therefore have zero credibility in that department. I went on to explain that if she were applying for a position in an area I am affiliated with, I would be able to speak to someone, or get more information (as I had done for another friend previously). Even if I were to speak to any manager, the application process for the organization is rigorous and constantly audited, there is no guarantee that I could help out. I ended the message by saying that it was unfair for her to put blame and pressure on me for her career and that I have done what I could to provide advice and support.\n\nThe reply: \"there is so much wrong with what you said, but i'm not going to pick at anything because that's not the kind of person I am. However, I expected more from you given our friendship. I guess that's my issue to have expected anything.\"\n\nI have not responded..... AITA??\n\ntl;dr - friend of 16 years applied for a position in my company and is disappointed in me for not taking the initiative to find out more about an internal referral process (which we do not have) or reaching out to the hiring manager that i have zero credibility or relationship with",

      "description": "Mouthful of a title, sorry - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy (25m) girlfriend (25f) had a brief break where she slept with her best friend (23f), who is married. This in itself is bad, and it eventually was found out whilst the two girls were drunk one night trying to convince the husband and I to have an orgy. He went ballistic, we left, it was a bad time all around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings have since been awkward, and the husband and I used to be fairly decent friends but now he avoids hanging out with my girlfriend and I like we ruined his marriage or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell anyway, my girlfriend has a history of being abused sexually and emotionally and she's been in therapy for awhile. It was super fun to find out that her best friend was moving far away, probably never to be seen again. If that were the end of it, though, there wouldn't be an issue. Instead of just leaving, she decides to hit up my girlfriend for one last \"hoorah.\" She had a plan to go to that spa and spend the day together, then rent a hotel and \"fuck all night,\" her words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend has recently had a lot of perspective put in her life, and decided to open up to me about it, but didn't really plan to do anything about it because not only is she/ was she her best friend, she was pretty much her only friend. Which of course just makes everything 100x worse.  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure that marriage is on thin ice - so do I tell the husband about his wife's plan, ruin my girlfriend's friendship, the friend's marriage, possibly put some strain on my own relationship, and possibly put a massive target on my back, or do i just let them move away and try to pretend it never happened?   \n\n\nI know if it were me, i'd want to be told... but... also this might make me the biggest asshole on the planet.",

I feel pretty left out that they didn’t invite me for dinner/pre drinks. That being said I didn't ask them on friday what they were up to.\n\nWe’re supposed to meet today to eat and chill, but no one wants to go out tonight like me because they’re hungover.  I just wanna ask them why they didn’t invite me for pre drinks.

      "description": "This happened last year, and I keep going back to it because I feel I could've handled this differently. \n\nTL;DR - Had my bucket stolen, I took this guys bucket, he got mad and wanted to fight me, we threw some punches. \n\n\nLast year I worked in concrete inspections. I have to take samples of concrete with a bucket and do my testing on them. I work at various job sites throughout the week, sometimes things go missing so I keep a stern eye on my things because workers like to take whatever they see lying around. \n\nSo I have 2 buckets, one is to collect the concrete and the other is for water for certain tests and to clean my equipment. Before the concrete truck arrived, I leave my buckets on the ground floor and I step away for a minute to talk to the general contractor. When I return I notice one of my buckets was missing. This is frustrating because I need that bucket to collect my sample, this $2 bucket is crucial. \n\nSo I decide to go look for my bucket, one of the workers informed me that he saw some of the guys take it to the 3rd floor. So I walk up there and see some guys working but I don't see my bucket. I see a bucket sitting on some plywood, it wasn't mine but I was frustrated and tired so I decided if they were going to take my bucket I'll just take theirs, no big deal right? Bucket for bucket. This bucket had some rolls of plans in them, so I take them out and set them to the side. \n\nI take this bucket back downstair, the truck arrived and I take my sample. Some time passes by when I hear this man's voice in broken English go \"Excuse me, boy, where did you get that bucket\", I told him \"I got it upstairs, one of your guys took my bucket so I took one back\"\n\nThis man go really fucking angry for no reason, I swear it was like I murdered his son. He goes \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TAKING MY SHIT, DUMP THAT SHIT OUT AND PUT IT BACK OR I'LL PUNCH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH\"\n\nAt this point I got a white flash of furry and replied \"Fuck yourself you fucking cock sucker, you're going to take one of my buckets I'll take one of yours, get any fucking closer and I'll make you swallow your balls you bald fuck\" (prime r/imabadass content)\n\nHe then proceeds to push me to ground, I imedietly got back up, kneed him in the balls, kicked his hard hat off and started punching him in the back of his head. He was able to get back up and land a few punches on me. The workers \n\nThe GC came running and saw the whole thing. He told that guy to go home and asked me if I was ok. Apparently this isn't the first fight this man has gotten into on this job site. The GC told me not to worry, I'm not in any trouble, the guy was being a prick over a stupid bucket.\n\n\nI feel I could've handled that a whole lot differently\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So my gf and I have been together for 18 months, but she has cheated on me in the past (7 months ago), and so honestly I get jealous easily. We fight about it on occasion, with her being upset that I’m still jealous after 7 months without incident and me requesting that she show compassion and love when I feel anxious and jealous. We’re in South America traveling together and I told her day one, if you dance with other guys, just make sure they’re old. I won’t feel jealous if you’re dancing the salsa, a super sexual dance, with a 60-70 year old. Welles are in Colombia and we met a couple of fellows (25ish) from here who invited us to a bar. One of them was sober enough to sustain an interesting conversation, but the other was drunk and fumbling over his words a bunch. Well the latter asked my girlfriend to dance and she obliged; after a couple songs they say back down. I tried not to fee too jealous, as he was real drunk and I want to trust my gf enough to let something like that happen. Then, they get up to dance again and as they’re getting up I say, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you” to her. They danced and not long after we left, my gf and I. Walking back to the hostel, she got mad at me for asking her not to dance with the drunk guy. Said that he was real drunk and that I should have known she wasn’t going to do anything more than dance with him, regardless of the ground rules I established or our history. Am I the asshole for being upset with her in this situation?",

      "description": "I (F) have tokophobia, a phobia which makes childbirth almost impossible for me. I have no desire to get pregnant because I’m terrified of the pregnancy process, childbirth, pain, and the effects on my body post childbirth. I’m also emotionally sensitive and am susceptible to severe depression and anxiety, which I inherit from my mother, and I know that she experienced postpartum depression after I was born.\n\nI know that if I go through pregnancy, I’m going to suffer horribly, both physically and emotionally. I’ve also attempted suicide when I was younger and I’m terrified those thoughts could spring back. I’m terrified I won’t love my baby or my life because of my hormonal mood swings and depression, and I might do something stupid.\n\nSo I don’t want to be pregnant. I would be much happier using a surrogate mother or adopting. My husband would prefer biological children, but he’s willing to support me with whatever decision I make.\n\nThe issue is that my parents (my mom specifically) are desperate for grandchildren. My older sisters haven’t had kids yet — one of my sisters is gay with marital issues, and my other (straight) sister is having trouble finding someone compatible with her lifestyle. So me, being the youngest and in a relationship with a man, are my parents best hope.\n\nI’ve brought up my fears of pregnancy before and my mother told me that I “better get pregnant”, she wants a biological grandchild (really weird to me, I can understand wanting biological kids, but why grandkids?). I know she would judge me harshly and we already have a really rocky relationship.\n\nI want to lie to her and tell her that I’m infertile and can’t get pregnant. This would be so much easier than telling her, and I feel like she would accept my future children more knowing that I had no other option.\n\nWould I be the asshole? It would be a lie about my decisions, but it wouldn’t be lying about who the child’s genetics actually belong to or where they came from. ",

This is despite the fact that N's cat can be in a cage while K's could roam around in the living room and vice versa.\n\nWhat I don't like is that the middle bedroom is small and they basically leave the cat in there all day. \n\nK's daughter is watching the cat but is usually in the living room. That cat is left alone for the most part except for water and food and cleaning the litter box when it's used up. They're always crying and pawing at the door and it crushes my heart. \n\nEveryone in my home keeps saying it's for the best with the current situation and everyone is doing the best they can but it still doesn't feel right. \n\nK's daughter is very short tempered as well, if they hear the cat crying a lot of the time they will drop what they're doing and get annoyed. They'll slam the door, throw stuff, and so on. The daughter treats the needs of the cat like some annoying chore. \n\nI've voiced concerns and my roommates don't seem to care about my opinion. Again, \"everyone is doing their best\" they say.\n\nI just don't know what to do.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA since I told my GF's friends about how they're tearing us apart?",
      "description": "Dear Redditors, am I the asshole since I told my GF's friends about how they're tearing our relationship apart?\n\nSo a little backstory which is really important. My GF, GF for short and her Ex, Ex for short used to date. Obviously. Long story short he was the asshole. No doubt about it. Her friends had been warning her about him, and nearly 2 years later it all came crashing down. Now, during this time period, her friends had hated Ex so much that they wouldn't invite them both to things for fear of him coming along with her. As a result, and as a result of the fact that she was extremely busy at the time as well, she didn't spend much time with them back then. \n\nNow, current day. I/Me short for me/I, have been dating her for about the past 6 or so months. It was all peachy at the beginning. We were able to go on occasional dates, every few weeks or so, and we'd spend time before class and during lunch together in her car. We didn't get to spend too much time together, but it was what we had and we were fine with it. During that time, GF had also been spending more time with a lot of her friends. About an equal amount of time with me and with her friends. So it was pretty good. And I'm not the jealous sort, at least not usually.\n\nBut she'd been spending more time with her friends and they were loving it. Cut to second semester and all of that has changed. We're both so busy, both with work and with a school that we haven't gone on a date in a long time. Maybe two or so months. We both spend as much time as we can together in her car(Nothing inappropriate mind you), mostly because that's the only time that we can spend together. Per week I only get to spend about 3 hours with her. \n\nNow rumors are starting to spread about her and me within our friend group. A few of our friends are starting to call her a thot and a slut, they think that we're having rampant sex 24/7. Now the problem is, she's never had sex. I've never had sex. We have no intention of having sex anytime soon. And they know this, yet they keep spouting it out. I didn't really care about it, but GF, she was getting really sad about it. \n\nSo that happens. And then we finally get to go out on a date, but then her friends pressure her into going out with them instead. Now usually I'd be fine with this. Afterall there will be another time to go on a date with this amazing woman. Except for the fact that for the next 3 or so months, just like for the past 2 or so months, we haven't had time. This was the first time. And it's not even that this was the first time that this has happened. The car time with her, when we can just talk, or lay down, or do whatever, is dependant on her not having a period after lunch and me simply not being hungry like ever. But her friends will pressure her into going out for lunch with them, further limiting the amount of time I can spend with her, and she goes with them. Even though she has no intention of eating. But she's forced to go with them because the other person's car is too small to fit everybody. So she needs to drive others. \n\nNow she recognizes that they're pressuring her into it. But to an extent, she feels guilty. After all, she didn't go to half the things that happened while she was still with Ex. And she wants to make up for lost time. But what she doesn't remember is that they purposely didn't invite her to things. And then now they use these things they didn't invite her to, to guilt her into spending more time with them.\n\nNow at this point, I'm starting to get PO'd. After all, I've only spent a net total of two hours with her this week and they've successfully made her drive and ended a date. Further reducing the amount of potential time. So the next day we're all in class. We all have one class in common, and one of them says \"You never do anything with us\" to her. Typically I would have just let this slide. After all, I know how important they are to her, and I know how important I am to her. But because of an earlier comment about her being a slut, I couldn't resist. \n\nI started laying into them about stopping. Telling them how little time we spend together, telling them about how we don't have sex. Telling them that they're constant manipulation is actually damaging our relationship and as much as I love her, they're seriously making me consider ending it all. Just so that I don't have to hear her say \"they called me a slut\" again. I must have played into them for about 15 minutes. Just refuting every claim they made. \"You spend more time with her than we do!\" \"No you all have sports with her, and other activities and spend about 2 hours a day with her. I get 2 hours a week!\" \"You guys are constantly fucking!\" \"No, we aren't. Sure we cuddle and kiss and whatnot, but that's relatively rare. It's much more likely that she's buried her head in my shoulder and is crying about some comment you arses made!\" \n\nSo, in the end, it was about 15 minutes of us shouting at each other about how little time we each got to spend with her. And they ended up pretty pissed. My GF was on my side, after all, she had forgotten(as the comment was only made in passing) that they simply didn't invite her to many of those things. It was one massive shitshow. And now they're pissed at me. One of them told me to apologize. And I pretty much told her to kindly piss off. So yeah that happened. So, am I the asshole for laying in on them for all that, or are they the asshole for perpetuating all of that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey everyone, this might be terrible in some peoples eyes, but maybe not in others, please don’t attack me if you feel strongly about what I am going to ask here, although honest opinions are very welcome. \n\nSo my girlfriend and I have two dogs, a Shitzu named Ella and a Carolina Dog named Nena. I took in Ella from my uncle after he passed, she was his dog for a few years before I got her. Now Nena I adopted from a shelter a few months ago. So if I am being completely honest, I feel more of a personal connection with my Carolina dog, she was a rescue who suffered from neglect, thank goodness she wasn’t physically abused, but she was left chained up outside for the first two years of her existence on earth. Apparently she was part of a puppy mill, at just two years old she’s already had two litters. When I adopted her she immediately fell in love with me, we do everything together! She stays by my side at all times and won’t go anywhere unless she can see me. Please don’t get me wrong, I love my shitzu to death also, but just by looking at her, she definitely prefers my girlfriend and their bond is as strong as my Carolina Dog and I. I’d like to ask if you all think this is me being the asshole, or if my situation is completely understandable. Please take this question with a grain of salt and try to understand where I’m coming from!",

My ex works 5-6 days a week, getting $800+ which Centrelink does not know about and the pay gets put into his bank without having to pay tax as well, he's also claiming disability because of \"depression\" (although he does have depression he's able to obviously work, it's just an excuse to get out of job search, he's admitted that to me in the past) so gets another $700 a fortnight. \n\nWe have a son together, Centrelink believing he isn't working he has to pay bare minimal in child support ($22 a month) so we came to the agreement that that he pays an extra $100 a week which I don't think is that much of a stretch when you're getting $2300+ a fortnight and he gets our son every weekend for 2 nights, sometimes extra nights if asked for. Sometimes chooses not to have him at all for the weekend. \n\nSince December last year in total he has given me $200. Considering I lived with him for 2 years I know what he is like so I know he doesn't plan on giving me any of the $1200 he owes me  so I'm thinking of notifying Centrelink and possibly the tax department of his fraud. \n\nWIBTA if I did this as this is my son's father and he could get in a lot of trouble. But I don't feel it's fair that he can get away with not contributing to the support of our son when he earns more than double what I earn. \n\n",

I use to be cool with this guy at a university i attend. we have the same major so we occasionally get into the same classes and would sit next to each other. He gets good grades and comes across and very successful in our field, but I know for a fact that he cheats on all of his test. He will either tuck a cheat sheet under/on his lap or just copy answers from someone when the professor isn't looking. After the last test I reported him to the professor. Nothing has been done about it yet, but he will (hopefully) be watch much closer during the next test.\n\nI feel bad about it because we used to be close and he has a wife and newborn baby, but I'm sick of seeing people who cheat making to the top while the rest of us work our asses off just to get by. I'm not sure what will happen if he gets caught on the next test, but i assume he will fail the course and reported to academic affairs.",

He was my first boyfriend after I had come out and I dealt with it because I was young and in uni and didn't know better. After we broke up it got so bad that I had almost got a restraining order because he wouldn't leave me alone. \n\nNow a decade later I'm finally in a good place. I'm months away from marrying my partner of nearly 10 years and my life is going well. Except for my mother putting my ex in the picture. He has sobered up and found Jesus. Despite my mother then never accepting our relationship she's now all over him. \n\nThey're both adults. He's 32 and although I understand that she can have whatever friends she want I do think she's being very insensitive to what he has put me through. All those years ago she has constantly put her faith over me and when we are finally reaching a point where I want to have her in my life and involved in my new life with my husband she decides to do this. \n\nShe is constantly inviting him over when I'm visiting despite us being in the middle of planning my wedding. She's bringing him up in conversations and pushing his religious rebirth on me despite knowing that I'm not interested in taking on her faith. The worst was when she invited him to Christmas dinner without any notice while my fiance was there.\n\nSo, AITA for cutting her off until she realises that she is being insensitive. I'd rather have her cut off contact with him. ",

      "description": "I used to work a corporate job, so I know standards of conduct. You don’t show weakness. You keep certain things private.\n\nComing out of a severe bout of depression that cost me my previous career, I decided not to live that way anymore. I wasn’t fooling anyone. \n\nI have serious damage to my memory, my ability to multitask is gone, and my energy isn’t enough for full-time. I’ve been working on these problems with teams of medical specialists. This is as good as it gets for now.\n\nI’m working my way off disability in a simpler, lower-paying job than the one I had before. In the job interview, I had to tell them why I was there. I was honest.\n\nAt first, I cried often and I made a lot of mistakes. I’ve been steered away from some tasks and put to use in other ways. But I didn’t ask to be given more grace than my employer could spare. Even so, my boss gave me a lot of room to grow slowly and was very understanding.\n\nA year later I am doing much better, well enough that I can pass for normal most of the time.\nSometimes people ask me about my past, my education, and then ask why I’m not working at a high-paying job anymore. If they’re polite about it and I’m comfortable, I tell them that I can’t do what I used to because of brain injuries. I skip the details and shrug it off as “life happens”. It’s the truth. I’m not ashamed. It’s not like I’m endangering anyone in my position.\n\nRecently, a person senior to me at work, L, has decided to coach me on how to present myself more professionally. She’s pushing me to lie. She tells white lies about other stuff, but always in a savvy business way. Her skill works to the company’s benefit. I’m not comfortable with it, but I’ve never seen it go badly for her/us. \n\nThe other day I was talking with a coworker in front of L. I turned down an invite as it was at the same time as my therapy. L corrected me for saying “therapy” and told me I should have said I had a different kind of appointment (make one up).\n\nI’m annoyed by this because 1. It was a private conversation in which everyone present knew my issues anyway, 2. You don’t have to be crazy to go to therapy, 3. Even if there’s stigma, I’d like to live in a way that rejects that, thereby reducing fear and 4. I used to be a respected professional, I know what the expectations are, and I’m ignoring them on purpose. We’ve talked about this. She knows that’s what I’m doing.\n\nOh, and the few times I’ve ever called in, I’ve told my boss the truth. If I have a cold, I’ll say so. If I can’t do people today, I’ll say that. It’s rare. I don’t want to change the way I do this.\n\nMy boss knows everything and hasn’t weighed in. Unless she’s pretending not to be involved and just gave L free reign instead? But I guess I could be costing us something in terms of trust or reputation just by being open? \n\nI don’t want to be ungrateful and stubborn. AITA?",

About a week after this class had started, one night I decided I would get starting and created this functional program (there was still stuff missing and I had to make it \"prettier\") but a good part of the work was done. When shown to the professor he said it was good and that we should work on a second method to treat the same problem so that afterwards we can compare both methods. As I had already done the first method I told my colleague he should do the second method, no problem.\n\nMonths went by and he didn't do any of the work on it, when I learnt about this I was kinda mad (but never expressed it) and have been trying to avoid this person for as much as possible.\n\nThe deadline is coming up and I have also started working on the report for it. I haven't told him that I started it since 1. he wouldn't be able to write anything since he doesn't how my program works as well as I do, and 2. I first want him to finish this 'second method' so that he could write about that in the report.\n\nImagine if the deadline came, he didn't finish this second method and asked me about the report (so that he could maybe write 10 sentences somewhere) , would I be the asshole for not sharing the report doc and not adding his name to the work, knowing that this could make him fail his year  ?",

I called him out that you exploit people who wants to do something good and take advantage of them. The girl also said she won't pay for alcohol/smokes but will buy groceries. She paid for his stuff and left. An hour later she came back to buy some other stuff and I told her about grifter that guy is. I know it's none of my business but while she came up with whole pack of ramen noodles, I asked her if she's student,(we have a community college and 3 uni nearby) and she said she goes to XY state. I go to same school so I understand the struggle. So when she came back I told her not to do the act of good to this assholes. She said she was upset because she didn't thought he'd put him back to $28. This guy has pulled shit like this to other people and I'm okay with the fact that his family gets something to eat, but the minute the person is out of his sight, he'd come back to store to convince me to give him alcohol in exchange of groceries.

Now, it's not that I don't like them, because they're really nice, but they talk and talk and talk, which means I can't concentrate on studying. They engage both me and Naomi in conversation, sometime for 2 hours, and that's not really the reason I'm at the library. At first they didn't ask if they could sit down, they just did, but they started to realize after a while that I save the spots for someone who's supposed to arrive just one hour after them, maybe not even that, and they don't even move then. But, when they arrive now one of them actually asks and when I'm about to say no, Naomi says yes. She likes witting with them, I get it, but I seriously cannot concentrate - I've also told her this. When I sit the the other people we actually study, probably because we're not studying the same stuff, which means we can't talk so much about out classes. I've also told the two in our class that they can sit with me and Naomi until the others arrive *(well, I did this twice)* but they **still** didn't move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, WIBTA if I told those two people that they can't sit with us?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TLDR: Two people in my class wants to sit with me at the library, but I don't want to sit with them as I can't concentrate because they talk too much, and I'm saving the seats for someone else.*",

We text and talk on the phone every day and see each other a couple of times a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday he texted me later in the day and said he was going to a concert with a friend. I told him that sounded awesome and I hoped he had fun. I finished up with work and hung out with some friends in the evening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't think much of it. I went to work today and after work I called him to see how he was doing and ask how the show went last night. He freaked out. He yelled at me for about 10 minutes for calling him, told me that I was being overbearing and that we didn't need to talk every day. I was (and am) honestly very confused. If he doesn't want to communicated on a daily basis that is fine, but up until this point, that is what we had been doing so I thought that was just normal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe overbearing comment has me feeling especially confused because I basically \"go with the flow\" with him. I only come over when he invites me, I don't usually initiate conversation. I try to give him his space and have my own space because I haven't been in a relationship in a while and I'm trying to take it at a steady pace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for calling him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’ve talked to him about why we don’t eat meat, he loves animals and agrees that animals are our friends and we don’t want to kill them when we can eat other stuff. My son is happy and healthy but of course it can be challenging sometimes when he’s around other people who have non vegan food. He sometimes stays with my parents and up until now as far as I’m aware they’ve stuck to vegan food with him, even though they don’t agree with it. \n\nI went away last week for a few days and left my son with my parents. When I got back they told me that he wanted to try cheese so they let him. I was really angry because firstly he could have reacted badly to it, and secondly they destroyed my trust with them. They told me I was overreacting and that it was unfair of me to deny him from trying things. I told them they can forget about looking after him if they’re gonna go behind my back and do stuff like this without talking to me first. \n\nThe thing is, I’m gonna let him try stuff when he gets a bit older if that’s what he wants, but at this age I’m doing what I think is best for him. My son is now begging for real cheese at home, \n\nAITA for being angry at my parents for this and not letting my son try stuff? ",

      "description": "I started a new job as IT Director for a small company (130 employees) 6 weeks ago. Going into the job, I had my projects outlined and prioritized. Priority number 1 was to get everything off of a server with a failing drive. This server hosted email and files. The server ended up crashing when I started migrating everything off of it, presumably because of the taxation I put on the drive. I kicked off a recovery of the server from backup and began moving everything off the server. For the past 2 weeks, I have been visiting each user personally and ensuring their mailboxes have all old emails as well as ensuring they can access all their files. \n\nBefore the server crashed, I had typed up my resignation, the business just wasn't a good fit for me and I was ready to move on. I haven't resigned yet because I want to make sure everything is working before I leave. I'm handing in my resignation today because everything should be working by the end of this week. \n\nMy question is, am I the asshole for leaving right after ensuring they are able to work? Do I need to keep working  until their systems are optimized, or is \"working\" an acceptable state to leave them in? These 2 weeks have been 80+ hour weeks for me and have severely impacted my home life in a negative way.",

Me and my mom both are are working and evenly split the bills which is working fine, my younger sister is still attending school and she has always been kinda the troublemaker in our family, my relationship with her was good but my sis and my mom don't get along at all in the recent time ( actually for a year), it escalated in the recent time and unfortunately this wasn't just for a stupid reason, it is something big.\n\nMy mom got together with her new BF and they're in a relationship for about 6-7 months, they've done everything together but my mom never was ready to introduce him to us, we respected that and waited for when the right time comes.\nCouple days ago I've seen my younger sister and mom's new bf in the city together, when I questioned her for what reason they've met she lied to me that he just wanted to know the family better but he didn't want to meet me yet, eventually ( I'm really trying to cut to the case) I confronted her about it and told her that I will tell our mom, She wanted me to keep it a secret at all costs, so she told me everything that happened. \n\n- My sister got in contact with the guy because according to her she loves him, she insisted on meeting him and during their first meeting she tried to get intimate with him which she eventually succeded in. They kissed and had oral sex but my sis swears that they didn't do more than that, I, as bad as it is, told my mum about it in the morning today, she is absolutely devastated and broken to say the least, she doesn't know how to process at all.\n\nWhen I finished explaining everything, my mom started crying and ran out, after that my sister came out of her room ( also crying) and repeatedly tried to justify what she did, I was so angry that I slapped her to the face.\nMy sister then spit me in the face and returned to her room. Since then we don't talk.\n\nI feel so guilty for doing it and I don't know how I should talk to someone instead of you guys here, this whole situation is tearing our family apart and I have no means to stop it.\nI first and foremost have to look after my mother, she's absolutely broken and needs the most help but apart from that I don't know what to do, on top of all that this incident made it even worse.\n\nAt the very least I managed to get this off my chest.....\n\n",

      "description": "I will try to summarize a very dramatic family fight, the kind of which has **never** occurred before. My family went out to a really nice restaurant but the food and experience ended up being a disaster. Many things were sold out, drinks were terrible, food was very very late etc. Anyways, they comp'd the entire meal, and of course we say \"alright don't forget to tip the waiters, it wasn't their fault.\" My uncle, who is quite rich, immediately disagrees. Instead of keeping my mouth shut and tipping extra, I argued with him and told him he was wrong in front of the entire family including his kids. It got heated, he had consumed at least 10 tequila shots that day (we are on vacation in Mexico) and he was getting enraged. We finally dropped it and left the restaurant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, then his son felt I think emboldened to keep running his mouth at his father in front of everyone. Calling him out of touch, up on his ivory tower, all sorts of harsh words. Finally I think his dad had enough because he ran at him, grabbed him by the collar, swung back, made a fist, and this is when I basically tackled my uncle (to be clear I'm 25, all the other nieces/nephews are kids) to stop him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family is hispanic, and my aunt basically told me i had no right to intervene, that it wasn't my business, and that he can do with his own children whatever he wants, especially when the kid was being so disrespectful. I simply felt that he was drunk, out of control, and completely unhinged. I didn't want him knocking out his kid for christ's sake. If he was going to slap him, ok, i don't agree, but not my business. But he went in with a closed fist. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I definitely contributed to my uncle becoming enraged while drunk, his 18 YO son followed my bad example, uncle snapped and went to punch his kid in the face but I physically stopped him, almost having to fight him myself before my father intervened. AITA for getting involved between him and his son? ",

I also found out that he has a sister who I once found extremely attractive, I have to admit, a portion of why I wanted to get this guy as my roommate. And Ill say that as of right here I am entirely the AssHole. \n\nHere is where I start to feel like I might not be the AssHole, there have been several times since we moved in together where I would try to do things as roommates and he would complain incessantly. And this was before his sister started dating another guy. \n\nSince then, every one of our interactions has basically been I say something and he either doesn't respond at all or takes a solid minute to respond. When we were first roommates he was really quite agreeable and as we have gone on, either my patience has waned or he has purposefully started to irritate me.\n\nThere have also been several situations where we have been playing games with our friends and he complains about doing 1v1s and the like and when we aren't doing 1v1s he uses spammy moves and the like which I would almost consider cheating, personally. It really irritates me when he does this and I will admit that I have made my snide remarks and I know I'm not perfect. \n\nI understand that I need to be more patient, but at the same time I don't think it should be soley my responsibility to try and make it a positive relationship.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL:DR\nMy roommate and I started off our relationship positively and our relationship has deteriorated",

      "description": "I have a cat who is turning three in July. I got him when he was a baby, only a few months old, by running into him on the street. He immediately seemed to decide I was his human, and refused to leave my lap for several days. \n\nWhen I got him in to a vet to get him neutered and checked out because he was not eating right, I learned he had been abused before I found him. Strangled, and traumatized. He would rarely get along with any other animal, had been in a few fights he instigated already, and was abnormally attached to me. So, I kept him to himself to prevent injury, and he has travelled with me for a couple years now.\n\nI am living with my in laws, and from the moment we arrived they have ignored my instructions on him and pretended he is theirs. He is clearly uncomfortable, and often bites them when they get near him at all, but they don't seem to understand or care that he is not okay with them getting right up next to him.\n\nI have to keep him in my room 24/7 because when we arrived, they already had two very large cats and five dogs, none of which are trained. The other animals frequently fight each other, snapping, biting and scratching while the in laws do nothing but scream at them until they are cowering. They keep insisting I am being horrible by keeping my cat seperated, but I cannot comprehend how they think this would end well. \n\nJust yesterday I had to jump out of bed despite being pregnant and very ill just to break up a fight because they chucked one of the huge cats into my room and of course my cat attacked him. Because he has been traumatized. Because he does not get along with other animals. Like I have told them time and time again to no fucking avail.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow and I am so fucking terrified that their strong opinion that I am just a moron who doesn't know anything and is set on abusing my cat will end up getting him seriously injured or worse, set for euthanization.\n\nI know he hates being trapped in this room but our only alternative rn is homelessness, and I just want to keep him safe until I can move into my own apartment, but I keep getting called an abusive monster. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Hi - sorry this is such a long story. Including a TL;DR at the end. Right now I am 31 weeks pregnant, due at the beginning of May. The apartment my husband and I live in is a three bedroom, but it is small- very small rooms and one bedroom is an office/storage space really. The apartment belonged to my grandparents, it's a rental, my husband and I lived with my grandfather for more than three years, helping to take care of him until he passed away last January. \n\nMy aunt definitely took care of my grandfather more than I did, and feels ownership over the apartment. She lived in it as a teenager with her parents and then again when my grandmother was sick. And she thinks she is the reason we get to be there. When my grandfather died she sold her apartment and her and her wife moved into my grandfather's second home near the beach. They have decided to renovate the home, but didn't want to miss the summer by the beach, so they postponed the renovations till fall. However, construction companies aren't just ready to go when you are, so things didn't get moving until late November. \n\nOriginally they were supposed to stay with us through this reno from October - January. But they didn't move in till November, saying they'd be out by March, but now the new timeline has them staying until the second week of April! I could give birth at any point in April, especially since baby is large. This leaves my husband and I with almost no time alone together, to prep and just be with one another. There has been some other drama (them preventing us from moving into the bigger bedroom because they \"deserved it\", them turning down offers to stay in someone else's currently empty home).  \n\nThey do help us, but the most helpful thing would be to have them out of our space because we are currently updating our apartment to prepare for the baby. Both have family not too far away who live in large homes, with plenty of space for them.\n\nFrom their perspective - we are my aunt's closest relatives, and they do a lot for us, they are probably most comfortable with us, and they don't want to move all their things again before being able to move into their home. Plus it is most convenient for them, near their friends, and allows my aunt's wife to continue her cleaning jobs nearby. Do my husband and I deserve some time alone or am I just being entitled and should suck it up for my family? Trying to decide what to do because we just found out the new timeline.\n\nTL;DR: my aunt and her wife were meant to stay with us till their home was renovated, but the reno has been slow going and they plan to be with us almost until my pregnancy due date. Can I ask them to leave early if they can find another option?",

      "description": "So, I work at a restaurant, and one of my coworkers (a host/cashier) is a senior in high school who is trans. Let's call him Aaron. I didn't know it at first, but he became comfortable enough with some of us to share this, and his new journey with hormone injections and the like.   \n\n\nNow, I don't know if Aaron personally told our boss about this, but it became apparent that our manager is now aware. This manager (let's call him Peter) is a shitty piece of work. I have seen him do terrible things, including attempting to groom/hitting on underage girls. More recently, I have heard him say some derogatory things to other coworkers about Aaron.  \n\nSo I was talking with some of my coworkers that I'm friends with, and they told me they have heard Peter telling customers about Aaron, saying things like \"Have you seen my 'it' that works here?\" I was horrified, and asked if they had told Aaron about this, and they said no. They didn't want to hurt him.  \n\nSo, I completely understand where they are coming from. One of them goes to school with him and has seen him be somewhat bullied, and doesn't want to drag that feeling to his work, too. Also, working at a part time job at his age, he will probably run into that sort of ignorance at a lot of minimum wage jobs, especially in our relatively conservative area.   \n\nOn the other hand, Aaron is being outed (is that the correct word?) to complete strangers, and without his permission or even knowledge. I know that could potentially be dangerous for him.  \n\nThe selfish side of it is also that I cannot afford to lose this job, and I feel my name would definitely come up if I told Aaron and he confronted Peter. Even if he didn't say my name, I would probably be the chief suspect. So I am nervous about that, too.    \n\nAlso, while I have witnessed some of the terrible things myself, I didn't actually hear Peter mentioning Aaron to customers. I believe it of him, but I don't want to accuse him without actually being sure of it myself.  \n\nSo reddit, would I be the asshole if I told Aaron about this?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I left Snapchat and a bunch of other friends due to it but I don’t regret it, it was kinda stupid, I brought the two who I actually trust with me. but they do have valid points, as the conversations weren’t super deep and it’s been a few years since I’ve seen them in real life, and obviously it’s up to them on whether or not they feel comfortable.\n\nTL;DR-Came our of the closet, supporters “didn’t know me” left almost everyone",

Especially at tax season. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf she is allowed to claim my child as her dependent, she falls within the state guidelines of income/child and keeps her state aid.  My daughter turned 18 two years ago so our court ordered divorce agreement about who can claim the child as a dependent is finished. My child and I discussed the situation and since the tax laws and mostly the tax breaks favor the person who pays for her tuition, I have claimed my child as a dependent the last few years. (Between paying for college tuition, books, food, a new car, auto insurance and health insurance the financial burden falls all on me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo because of this my ex lost her state covered medication last year and will again this year. What she doesnt realize is in a year when my child finished school that this child will no longer count for EITHER of us as a dependent but still blames me for her being poor and losing her state aid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16 years of dealing with her blaming me for her situation and financial position and putting my child in the middle of it all has left me cold and not caring that she lost her state aid and medication. AITA for not caring anymore? ",

      "description": "A year ago I got pregnant and my husband started second guessing me on things assuming all of my decisions were because I was hormonal/emotional. For example - he would ask what I want for dinner and I’d say I want Chinese. He would say “are you sure you REALLY want Chinese”. He would do it to the point I would change my mind 3 times and I’d end up eating chicken wings when I really wanted Chinese. \n\nAfter the baby was born I have told my husband several times now - I understand when I was pregnant I was emotional and you second guessed me a lot because of it. But when I say I want something it’s because I want it and I need you to stop second guessing me. \n\nWell today I was sitting on the couch holding our sleeping baby and I asked my husband if he could grab us a baby blanket because the AC vent was blowing on us and I was trying to not wake the baby. He responded with “are you sure you want a blanket?” I lost my patience and said “no I don’t want a blanket. I just asked for fun and didn’t mean it”. He looked hurt and went and got the blanket. Outright saying it bothers me didn’t work and I’m out of patience. So AITA for being snarky? ",

      "description": "two years ago, my bf and I were in a LDR. I had an IUD in place and don’t use other contraception. I visited him and when I came back home my period was late, find out I’m pregnant because the IUD has moved, I’m not ready to have a child, I get an abortion.\n\nMy parents bring me to the clinic, my boyfriend is unable to provide support in person. I am bitter that all he had to do was call and didn’t have to do anything else (I know it is out of his control given the circumstances).\n\nI am very close to my bf’s fam, but his fam are very traditional. I am also very close to my boyfriend’s brother’s now wife Megan and I was a bridesmaid at their wedding. Megan is Catholic, but not that religious. And he chose not to tell anybody because he doesn’t think it will be well-received.\n\nFast forward to megan’s bachelorette trip, I opened up to her that I’ve had an abortion, Amongst other conversations we had. I forget to inform my bf that I told her because we discussed so much that night.\n\ntoday. I’ve gotten close to my bf’s 2nd cousin who is younger. While my bf is on a trip, I invited her over for dinner. She tells me about a guy she is seeing and that he is her first bf. Asks me questions about sex etc. we end up chatting for 5 hours. A lot of topics come up. because the fam is very traditional, she discusses her mum’s reaction to her having a bf. She also talks about one of her friends that had a baby at 20 and points out how young that is and feels she shouldn’t have kept it. then further on in the conversation we chat about IUDs. I gauge her vibe and decide to tell her my experience on the IUD, my pregnancy and abortion. She doesn’t react badly, she says it makes sense etc.\n\nshe leaves, I call my bf and tell him about our chat. I inform him that I told her about the abortion. he gets very upset. He worries she might tell other members of the family and that they will refuse to speak to him if they knew that I had an abortion. He gets really annoyed. And me thinking I told him before, I mention that Megan knows too, ‘it’s not as big a deal as you think’. He gets even more upset because I never told him that I told Megan. He tells me this is something I need to discuss with him before I tell his family. \n\nI argue that it’s not his information to dictate who or whether I tell it. I also feel really annoyed because he didn’t have to experience any of it, but yet he is telling me what information I can and cannot tell? I did apologise because I wouldn’t want his family to shut him out and I didn’t know that was what I was risking. But I still don’t feel like he has the right to dictate what I say regarding this issue\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR - had abortion, bf’s fam is quite traditional, am close to two girls in his family that I disclose my abortion to, tell my bf that I told them, bf is annoyed that I told them and thinks I should have asked him before telling them, I think it’s not his say",

      "description": "Some time ago, I reconnected with a friend from high school (class of 1994) via Facebook. In the intervening years, I developed (pun not intended) an interest in photography, and started taking tentative steps to see if I had any talent, posting a few of my shots for my friends to judge. Obviously, the verdict was yes, or I'd have some other username. I posted that due to the results, I might start a website to sell my work.  \n\n\nAnyway, a few days later, I was looking at her Facebook profile and *saw one of my photos without credit.* I commented something along the lines of \"Yay! I'm flattered you like my photo, but, um, it's *my* photo, and I might want to try to sell it...would you mind taking it down, please? I hope you don't think I'm being a jerk.\" - and she sent back an angry, \"Yes, you are being a jerk. I didn't know you were going to try to sell it. I'll take it down, but not because you asked.\"  \n\n\nI thought that was that, until I found she'd edited (cropped) and reuploaded my photos to one of her FB albums. Since I felt she was so belligerent before, I reported her account on copyright grounds.  \n\n\nThen, when FB suspended her, she really got pissed, sending me an even angrier email.  \n\n\nThe way I see it, I was just looking after my intellectual property, but she insisted I was the one at fault. Note: me and the person in question no longer speak, because *she* thought I was an asshole. ...but I still wonder, so here I am.  \n\n\nWhat say you, reddit?",

M has a child and has always been hung up on one of our mutual friends (M 28) lets call him S, and has cheated on D 3 times with S. M told D about her last time cheating and she even told him that she does not see a future together but does love him. He stupidly decided to stay and work it out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of that happened about 2 months ago. M talks shit on her own boyfriend D, every single day. Saying how they haven't had sex in months, how she wants Mike, how he annoys her, how there is no spark. D on the other hand is for some reason head over heels for her and refuses to back down and give up on her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a party this past weekend and all 3 of them showed up, and it was so sad to watch. M was all over and S and D just stood there lonely. So I called M to tell her to end it with him because it is getting hard to watch and not tell him that she doesn't want him anymore. He is my friend too and its really difficult not to tell him everything that is happening. M told me they are going out of town this weekend to see his parents, so she will break up with him after that so she can get a free trip out of it??!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her she is crazy and should break up with him now so he can be with his parents this weekend instead of be alone when they leave ( They live on the opposite side of the country so he only sees his family twice a year). I told her it is cruel what she is doing and isn't fair. He is going to need his family when she breaks his heart and she just looks at it as a ticket out of town for the weekend and all meals and drinks paid for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for telling her to leave him now? She think's I am in the wrong but I am trying to be there for both people without picking sides. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: friend is not happy with boyfriend and is waiting to break up with him till after he takes her out of town this weekend.

      "description": "A little background- I am not really at all into sports and my husband's life absolutely revolves around sports. I will watch sports and even enjoy going to a game. I actually play recreational softball and that's how we met. But outside of my husband, I do not actively watch sports or talk about sports or look up sports scores. I don't hate sports, its just not something I'm passionate about and my husband very much is. \n\nWell, every year he gets me to participate in our Softball team's March Madness pool. We have a pact between us that if either of us wins the March Madness pool, we will split the money with one another. So every year, I go and ask my sports savvy brother in law who I should pick to win it all. I don't even ask my brother in law to help me pick which teams will win the beginning games, I only ask him who he thinks I should pick and I go with that one. My logic is that my husband will pick a team based on his sports savvy-ness and I will be able to bring something to the table with the help of my brother in law since I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. \n\nThe day before the March Madness brackets were to close, my husband got very upset with me when I told him I asked my brother in law who I thought would win March Madness. My husband says I should have asked him and not my brother in law. He says it wouldn't matter whether we chose the same team to win it all, which I think is ridiculous because then if we both choose the same losing team, we both come out with no chance at winning it. No matter how many times I explain to my husband why I asked my brother in law instead of him, he still thinks I should have asked him instead. I should also add that me and my husband have absolute opposite schedules, so when we do see each other, we barely have enough time to say hello to one another, let alone have an in depth March Madness pep talk. \n\nWhile this was such an utterly stupid argument, my husband is so offended by my choice to ask my brother in law for advice and I'm so dumbfounded that he would be upset about it, I have to ask reddit's opinion. I don't think it was that big of a deal and honestly after this argument, I plan on never entering a March Madness pool again. \n\nSide note- my husband has no personal issues with my brother in law whatsoever. My husband just seemed genuinely offended that I didn't ask him for March Madness advice. ",

He says that he thinks my crooked teeth are actually cute but that he’s disappointed that I have something to insult him back with so quickly. I explained that I don’t really have anything insulting and that I could ‘joke’ back with him but I thought that would not be very nice.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not wanting to joke with him about something that could be sensitive to him after he did the same to me?

      "description": "Disclaimer: Apologies for any poor grammar, I’m not to good with writing.\n\nMe and my girlfriend work in different cities, so we only see each other on weekends. For the first few months of our relationship I would see her every weekend, however she increasingly started organising to see other friends. I am completely fine with this as I understand we have lives outside of each other. My problem began a while ago. Instead of organising to see her friends in advance, she cancelled our plans hours before I was about to leave for her place. Again I understand last minute plans but this has happened a few times now and I would prefer some more notice. I told her the two previous times to try and let me know earlier, but this time I asked her not to go and stick to our plans. This upset her and she claimed I was being controlling when an argument started. AITA? I don’t want to be unfair or controlling. \n\nThanks in advance reddit!",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons. \n\nI'm 38M and I have one sibling who is 20. My sibling is my half-sibling, and we have never been particularly close, mostly due to the age gap, but I love them all the same. I live in a large city and own a condo that I used to share with my ex until we split up and she moved out 1.5 years ago. In August, my sibling transferred to a university in my city, and I offered to have them live with me at an incredibly reduced rate. The city I live in is very VERY expensive and my sibling pays maybe 1/5 of market rate. I'm in no way hurting for cash, and I planned on giving my sibling's rent back to them upon graduation to help them get started. My sibling is a good roommate, is very clean, and I generally enjoy having them live with me.\n\nI started dating \"Alex\" (33F) (not her real name, but she has a gender-neutral name that's short for a female name) about 8 months ago. Alex is a cis female, born female, and identifies as a woman, but is very masculine (for lack of a better word) in the way she dresses and presents. Like if she was a lesbian, she would be considered butch I guess (but her voice is very high-pitched). She's very androgynous, essentially. She's heterosexual, as am I, but sometimes people get confused by the way she presents. She takes it all in stride and has dressed like this for most of her life. She's not offended when people get confused. It's a little early but Alex and I have talked about marriage and having kids, which is something we both want. We plan on getting engaged sometime in 2019.\n\nMy sibling identifies as nonbinary (but was born female and identified as a girl until about 2 years ago). My sibling really likes Alex, but cannot seem to grasp the fact that Alex is a woman, regardless of how she dresses. Like, because Alex does not have long hair and doesn't wear dresses/makeup, she must be a trans man in the closet. I find it really disrespectful - Alex laughs it off but my sibling has tried to be coy and invites Alex to events for people who are questioning their gender identity and I personally think my sibling is overstepping many boundaries. I've tried to talk to my sibling about this but they just said they want Alex to be comfortable in her body (which she has...Alex is 13 years older than my sibling and is pretty secure in herself) because they care about her. I just found it really patronizing. Alex has always been polite but I can tell this is starting to get to her a bit. I've told my sibling if they don't stop this, then they'll have to find a new place to live in the spring semester because I won't allow my own girlfriend to be uncomfortable in my home. AITA?\n\nTl;dr my sibling misgenders my girlfriend and I'm tired of it",

      "description": "I'll just tell the story from the beginning.\n\nSo last year, my senior year of HS, I became pretty good friends with a guy, let's call him Tom, who had a girlfriend, let's call her Jill. The two had been dating for about a year and were really close, and I got close with Tom since he was really good friends with my best friend, so we hung out within the same friend group often throughout the school year. At the same time, I had quite a few classes with Jill, and I thought she had a great sense of humor, so I always enjoyed talking with her, cracking jokes, and playing funny. \n\nAll was fine, but after we graduated and the summer came, I kept trying to get closer with Tom, since I figured we could continue to be really good friends. He didn't reciprocate, and over time, the rift between us grew until we no longer were friends really. Him and Jill also broke it off mutually (but remain good friends), as Tom was staying home for college, Jill was going to a college a couple hours away, and I was going to a slightly further college. \n\nJill and I remained pretty good friends and we would talk over the phone and whatnot, but I thought nothing more of it, until recently she said she wanted to come down to visit me/stay with me for the whole weekend. That came, and we ended up having sex. She was already over her ex and was hooking up with dudes at her old college, but Tom was still heartbroken. At the same time, it was revealed to me that Tom secretly despised me throughout senior year because he thought I was crushing on his GF (I wasn't). \n\nSo, it's been some time since they broke up, she was obviously over it and initiated the \"friends with benefits\" stage to me, and Tom and I are no longer really friends (although my best friend is still pretty close with Tom). Did I do an asshole thing?",

More recently however we have been staying at my place exclusively because I had a falling out with one of her roommates. I can provide more details in the comments if anyone cares but essentially it ended with two of her roommates saying that I wasn’t allowed at their apartment. \n\nTo us this seems unfair because they have their boyfriends over whom she doesn’t like so why should I be excluded from coming over to their apartment? Regardless she has been sneaking me over in private for the past 5 months when she wants me to come over. I’ve put up with it for the most part because I want to respect her wishes and obviously don’t want to cause her trouble with her roommates.\n\nTonight however she invited me over and I said I would come. But then she said “Okay I don’t wanna hide you but like don’t talk too loud bc only meg and ari are here and they’re asleep.” Basically saying that she does want to hide me since they wouldn’t know I’m coming over. I said “How about I talk as loud as I want since you pay rent there?”  I ended up not coming over and this escalated to a light but reasonable argument about me respecting her wishes and whatnot. \n\nSo anyway am I the asshole? I’m sick of having to come over at 1 in the morning and wait for them to leave before I can sneak out. ",

      "description": "so I was at my friends house yesterday, chilling and enjoying a movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy friend B.. has a known tempter, getting into fights regularly at bars, storming off and generally being childish, he has a very short fuse. we generally kinda banter back and forth and give each other little remarks here and there but nothing ever physical at all. other than a big bear hug and smacking each others ass (like any guys who play sports together)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyhow, we sat at B's house and he sends me over a meme to look at on his phone, i laughed and sat his phone just out of his reach, absolutely enraging him. he got up and said \"give me back my phone or i'll spit on you\" and then proceeded to hack up all his phlegm he could and i jokingly turned my head and continued to watch the movie laughing (this all happened within about 30s) and he spat directly into my face and laughed, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI. Saw. Red.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up and we fought and he told me to never come back to his house again cause i took his phone for fractions of a minute. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy girlfriend who talked to my B's wife said that I was having an ego after i told them \"i'm cutting him off - that was a bridge too far.. i can handle a lot but directly spitting in someones face is not tolerable\" she told me that if my friendship can be so easily broken then it really upset her and i just replied with \"don't bother contacting me again then if you cant see why I won't tolerate someone spitting in my face\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now i've isolated myself from B, and broken up with my girlfriend.\n\nB's wife has done nothing wrong so I imagine i'll get my stuff ive left at their house over time and be done with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso..

But I just found out it was posted publicly on an office Outlook calendar!!! It was only up for about 2 minutes before my coworker deleted it, but I am concerned that our bosses saw it and may be offended. Am I an asshole for making a silly mistake like this? Should I talk to them about it? There’s a chance they didn’t see it at ALL so maybe I should ignore? Any advice would be appreciated!!!",

I guess without realizing it, I've always imagined that my wife and kids would be white people.\n\nI'm worried about my integration into their family, and their's into mine, because I was raised in a household where racism and making fun of other races for jokes was kind of a norm, which I take part in. I worry I would make a joke that would offend someone without realizing it because those kinds of jokes have always been lighthearted.\n\nAlso, I don't know how I would feel about raising a child that wasn't my skin color. I've always viewed black people as something that I'm in a different ballpark as, so it would be incredibly odd to be that intimately close with someone who is black/mixed.\n\nSome people have told me that I'm an asshole for this, and some have said that my preference is my own. Half of me expects to see the same here, but I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nTo make this painfully clear, I do not view any race as lesser than, or greater than, myself or other white people.",

We just like to discuss if other girls are cute and stuff.\n\nWe both chatted on facebook with her sometimes (seperately ofc) but one evening I texted with her way more, opening up a bit in a friendly way, nothing romantic at all.\n\nThe girl said that she's insecure because of her big boobs, because every girl in her dance studio got the same shirts and they were fine for them while it was thight over her tits. She was very insecure and asked not to laugh before saying it, and I didn't laugh and I didn't say anything like \"don't worry, your tits are not small\" because that wouldn't be nice from imo.\n\n\nI told my girlfriend about it, and she didn't like it very much. We got into an argument, because she was saying  that she knows this type of girls and she just wants to steal her boyfriend. I didn't agree, saying that she just told me something she's insecure about and that doesn't mean anything.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm a chill guy and gave in, didn't want to argue because the girl was not that important and not that big of a friend to argue about.\n\n\nAfter a few months, it got me thinking, was I the asshole thinking that the girl didn't want to fuck me while my gf was 100% sure about it?

      "description": "So basically I've worked at my current job for 4 years (since I was 22 years old), and within the last few months I have started to have issues: toxic pseudo-maternal relationship with my boss, constant micromanaging, and progressive loss of responsibility that led to constant boredom. In a month I also went through a serious bipolar depression episode, a family bereavement, health issues with another close family member, and my brother almost dropped out of school, so I was very stressed and not my usual self. My boss started snapping at me all the time and told me I needed to fix my attitude because she could tell I was unhappy and didn't know what my \"problem\" was, even though I had minimally confided in her that I was having a stressful time. We have patched things up since then, though things were still a bit awkward at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, long story short, I decided to start applying for other jobs because I was concerned that this was becoming a toxic work environment for me and I had just gotten my masters in December. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the jobs I applied for was a significant full-time promotion, but at the same organization that I currently work at, just at a different location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight when the job was posted internally, I told my boss about it and she asked me if I was interested in the job. I was honest and said yes, even though she cautioned me that she thought I could do better and that it didn't really fall into the same field as I did my masters in. I really wanted a change, so I applied, interviewed, and last night I found out I got the job. The person I interviewed with said not to worry about giving notice, because she would handle everything. She also said that I needed to provide 3 references, and she didn't want me to use my current boss because she got the impression that things were \"off\" between us (!!!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe person who interviewed me told my boss first before she offered me the job, out of respect. So I came into work today feeling awkward because my boss already knew that I had the new job. I decided to just play it cool and not let on that anything had changed. Then this interaction happened after I was in the office for just 2 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoss: Miss Kate, do you have something to tell me?\n\nMe: (hesitates) Yes.\n\nBoss: (looks at me expectantly)\n\nMe: (carefully) I know you already know about it.\n\nBoss: (pissed off) Well it would have been nice to hear it from you.\n\nMe: I only found out about it last night, so it's still super new.\n\nBoss: (still pissed off) Well you could have told me about it this morning!\n\nMe: (trying to be positive) Well, I'm really excited about it! What do you think?\n\nBoss: Well you haven't been happy here for a while anyway so I guess it'll be good for you. \n\nMy bright happy smile faded completely, then my boss left to go work at the other location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for accepting this job and not telling my boss about it right away?",

I mentioned that my boyfriend and I don’t have it often and that he doesn’t give oral because he doesn’t like it. I didn’t bash him for either, I had just mentioned it. One of the girls I was talking to told my boyfriend yesterday that she feels bad for me since we don’t have sex very often and my boyfriend got pissed that I talk about intimate things with them and said it’s none of their business and is now wondering what kind of things I tell my closer friends. The thing is, I do tell my close friends about my relationship including my sex life and even sometimes telling them about a fight we got in or something. Also, I have been there when he has said something about our sex life to one of his friends, but maybe I just do it to a more intimate degree or more often. He’s now pissed and says he can’t trust me anymore and is telling me that if it’s that big of deal then I should find someone else. I always thought this kind of conversation with friends was normal and healthy considering I’m not degrading him or telling his “secrets” or something to them. Maybe I’m wrong.

It's an East coastal town that rhymes with harleston. My mom said no that it was fine she would take care of it. Fast forward to dinner, I order fish and two glasses of champagne.

So, on the way to take my grandmother and sister to the airport they both said I was so wrong for ordering the \"most expensive\" dish and TWO glasses of champagne. I was being extremely inconsiderate to my mother and didn't think of anyone but myself. I defended myself by saying I offered to pay. It didn't matter to them.

      "description": "Little backstory... My boyfriend and I have been in a rocky relationship since we started dating (together 1 year this month). Some really disturbing things happened in our relationship last week, to where I was so depressed I couldn’t leave the house. So honestly this has me wondering if I am just being a huge b*tch. \n\nToday I was converted as a full time employee at my company. I’ve been working there as a developer for 6 months and today was my very first day as an “official” employee of the company and no longer a contractor. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have lunch together every day, even if we just hang out. We’ve done this the entire year we’ve been dating. During lunch, I communicate with him that I am sad, and that’s why I am so quiet today. Around the end of the lunch he tells me that he was going to buy flowers for me as a gift, but could not afford $75 for flowers. So he was going to do something else. \n\nOur financial situation is not the best right now because of the holidays. We are trying to give our kids the best Christmas we both can, and have both been working extra to get them the things on their lists. So when he told me that, I felt extremely guilty about getting any type of gift. \n\nLater on I text him and tell him that since he couldn’t afford flowers to please not buy anything, and I will get myself some yarn as a gift from both of us ( I crochet). This turns into a fight, because I will now feel guilty about anything he buys for me and it will be hard to enjoy it and he says he was only dropping subtle hints and wanted me to get excited about what he got me.\n\nI don’t want him spending money that he doesn’t has, or needs to spend elsewhere, and he is hurt that I told him to return the gift. I feel like if he really wanted to genuinely surprise me or get me a gift, he never would have mentioned money as I am well aware of our financial situation ( we live together and share bills ) and he wouldn’t want me to worry or think about the cost of a gift. In my eyes, he never should have mentioned money.. Just got me a gift that he could actually afford which I would have LOVED. Even if it was homemade, I could obviously appreciate that and even prefer homemade gifts since I make them myself frequently, etc. \n\nAITA???",

      "description": "There's a woman my age (young adult) Samantha who I met through a hobby we both shared, over time I learnt she was in a bad relationship (not abusive- but toxic and co-dependent). I encouraged Samantha to separate as it was affecting her mental health.\n\nThey split and she moved out, she's been suffering since; through less support (financial and emotional) and I've been there as a friend as much as I could be.\n\nSamantha is attractive, I like her as a person and we both have a lot in common, but for whatever reason - over time, I don't feel we're a good fit. So despite us hooking up a couple of times I've resisted attempts to get us together on a more serious/exclusive basis.\n\nI've let Samantha know that I'm not ready for exclusive (I'm dating other people and she knew this) - since she's just come out of a long relationship I've told her that she's not likely ready for exclusive either. She wants to keep doing what we're doing (casual hanging out and hooking up), but I've been worried she wants something more.\n\nRecently I had tell Samantha that we shouldn't fool around anymore and it really hurt her, as I knew it would- but my thoughts are it's better to hurt her a little now rather than hurt her more later. She'd been expressing more admiration and affection for me lately and it'd been making me feel more uncomfortable that I've been leading her on.\n\nI'm worried she's really really hurt and alone right now, and I don't know how to help.\n\nTLDW- convinced an acquaintance to end a bad relationships, we became friends, it moved into casual dating and now it's over after I realized I'm not ready/she was into me more than I was her.\n\n",

      "description": "I go to a state college which charges a lot of money for tuition. So much money, in fact, that my (pretty large) family would not be able to afford the full price of attendance. Luckily, I was able to earn two scholarships that, when combined, amount to around half the price of tuition. \nHere's the thing though-about one third of that scholarship money comes from a scholarship meant for minorities. \nIn terms of heritage, I identify as white. Percentage wise, I am half ethnically Jewish, which doesn't count for anything, and about half assorted European or just plain white. But I am also 1/16 Native American. My family doesn't know the exact percentage though, since the DNA tests we've taken have given vastly different results each time. But the heritage is definitely there-I own a tribal card and so does my dad and other siblings. There are pictures of my great gramma, who lived on a reservation, in full tribal attire. On the form for college application, I put \"Native American\" and \"White\" for the ethnicity column, because technically I fit the bill.\nI personally think that you should take any money you can get from a college, especially because I have two younger, college bound siblings and I want them to be able to afford college as well. \nMy older sister, who goes to the same school as me and has the same scholarship, thinks otherwise. She constantly reminds me that we are undeserving of the money, that we're taking money from real minorities who deserve it more, and that we're impostors and liars. She also thinks that if you don't live the \"minority experience\", you don't deserve the money. She's even told me that she wants to pay back all the money she earned from the scholarship to the tribe we have heritage from, to \"make it up to them\".\nI disagree, because I think the amount that my school charges for tuition is insane, and I'd rather not drive my family into debt because of some white guilt. \nBut maybe my sister is right. Maybe I'm stealing from people who deserve it more. \nI'm not sure. \nThis has been eating away at me for a while, and I'd really appreciate any feedback on the situation. ",

      "description": " I LOVE this dog. We have had her for over a decade and I love her to bits. I’ve always been willing to take care of her, but she has also always been extremely anxious and it’s only worsening with age. (she’s turning 11 this year) Back in the days, I could watch over her for as long as needed and she would be more than fine with it but the last time I did, it was PURE. NIGHTMARE. Sleep was impossible and I was going to school everyday. I was bored to death whenever I was home because I don’t live here anymore and all of my stuff was gone. These two weeks have been EXTREMELY difficult for both her and I.\n\nWhen they got back, my father was upset because I did as I have always done when watching over her : sleeping with her in my own bed in my old room, and I’m totally convinced that letting her alone in her cage next room to theirs like he suggested would have made her cry for the WHOLE night, as she did when I tried years prior – and that’s why I didn’t even try that time.\n\nI’m still BOILING over this one. I spent two monstrous weeks over to help them out, I regretted every minute of it, I would have NEVER accepted had I knew what it would really be like and he thanked me by deciding that all this shit have been my fault. What the hell.\n\nNow, fast forward a year, my dad is planning another trip during the summer. I used to be the only one willing to take care of her in her own home (and she’s too much of a problem to have her stay elsewhere), but that last time changed the deal quite a lot. There’s NO WAY I’m going back there and I think that it shouldn’t be expected of me to literally move out of my own home to go again and live there for a week. I’m still feeling tremendously bad about this : the dog is suffering because of my refusal and I’m heartbroken for her. It’s also a problem for my father, whom I was greatly helping by watching over his dog. \n\nPlus, I will be off work during that time, but I’m not willing to destroy part of my precious holidays by living out of my own home and away from my boyfriend, even only for a week. Plus, they could take the dog with them as they will be travelling by car this time.\n\nOn the other hand, I think they should avoid going away without their aging dog. Their dog is their responsibility, I’m a bit upset that they didn’t ever do anything for her anxiety issues and now, it’s only getting worse. They should aknowledge their pet’s extreme suffering (everytime she sees them packing up their suitcases, she spends the next night spreading diarrhea all over the place and there’s blood in it. It’s that bad.)  and I shouldn’t be the one responsible for her wellbeing : they shouldn’t leave. Period. She only has a couple years left. If they want to leave, they can chose a destination where she can go with them or they could have asked professional help when it was time to “heal” her separation anxiety.",

During the months he didn't want to talk me, his girlfriend texted me and made me promise that nothing would happen (romantically/etc) between us. My friend and I had dated for about a week before I chickened out (I didn't want to ruin our friendship). Nevertheless, any romantic feelings between us were over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my friend told me that he had cut me off for his girlfriend's sake, I told him about the conversation I had with her. I expressed that I didn't think that her behavior was healthy, but I wouldn't make him choose between her and me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the next few days, my friend and I talk to each other about the situation. Multiple times, he blocks me, and I have to communicate my feelings over email. A lot of what he says clues me in to his unhealthy behavior (such as the belief that he needs to fix everything/he can't fix anything) and his girlfriend's unhealthy behavior (he's tried to tell her that I'm a good person but he can't do so without making her cry/she knows that what she is doing is wrong but does it anyway). I try to talk him through it as best as I can giving the options of communication I'm given. I tell him to take his time and to perhaps spend time away from both of us before further action. (He and his girlfriend go to school together, so perhaps this wasn't the best advice.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, he texts me to say that he and his girlfriend are talking about the situation with his therapist. (He has depression, and she has trust and jealousy issues, according to him.) Only a few hours later, he texts me to say that he's feeling like he's being torn apart and he's cutting me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cry about it and then I move on as best as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeeks later, he texts me to say he's sorry (I'm over him at this point).

The Uber driver dropped me off and I got out thinking everything was fine, however since I'd never been to the house before I mapped it only to see I was still a good 12 minute walk away. So because the driver had failed to do the only thing I'd requested (take me to the right location) I rated him one star.\n\nWhen I was telling my friend about it later, she said \"I hope you gave him 3 stars\". I told her I'd actually given him 1 and she proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't have done that and pretty much called me an asshole because it has a lot of consequences for the driver (lowers there rating significantly / limits the number of \"high\" rated passengers etc).\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "My best friend (T) and I have been friends for over ten years. In that time I have lost both of my parents, most recently  my mom very unexpectedly. \n\nI also experienced a serious head trauma which took me about 18 months to recover. I am currently in an IOP for depression because the depression was made worse from the head injury. \n\nDuring this time I missed her engagement party and a trip we had planned to Chicago. I live furtherest from the group of friends so I do most of the traveling to see them. I did see them at thanksgiving this year and for the Fourth of July. I had two days of migraines after those trips. When I missed Chicago she did call me and tell me that she felt I wasn’t putting enough effort into our friendship. I have been working on this and been involved in the planning for her bachelorette and texting our group chat everyday. \n\nFast forward to this weekend. On Friday I had one of my “I’m going to need to go to the hospital headaches”. I was supposed to fly at 5 pm I warned her I wouldn’t make it down then slept for roughly 26 hours. Today I received an email about the fitting. It had little information about the dresses (there is a store near me I can try them on) and a very long lecture about how the friendship is one sided. \n\nShe is offering that I come as a guest insist of her wedding party. I responded and told her I would rather not be there at all if I wasn’t going to part of her wedding party. I will feel to ashamed to go as a guest. \n\nIn the email she also stated she had discussed with her finance and the other girls in the wedding party. One the other girls is very close to me and we have a trip planned to Africa this year. Now I feel like I can not trust any of them for speaking ill of me behind my back and for no one standing up for me. \n\nAITA for not wanting for go to her wedding? I also do not want to associate with this group of groups anymore since they make me feel like I have to earn their friendship back. \nWIBTA for cancelling the trip to Africa? We have full trip insurance? \n\nThanks for reading this. ",

      "description": "A bit of background: my girlfriend is a university student who gives private lessons to support herself and make a bit of money. For various reasons, she failed some exams and now she needs to catch up. She really wants to be done by the end of September, but she needs to take a lot of exams, and after that she wants to travel for a bit, so she has been giving more and more lessons per week to save up, and on top of that she has university lectures, so she is busy about 8 hours a day which, as you might imagine, doesn't give her all that much time to study for the exams that are coming up. Also, we live far away from each other so the whole conversation was through text. \n\nYesterday I was texting my girlfriend and she was telling me for the 100th time about how tired she was and how she did not study enough, but I also knew that she had just finished a two hour lesson with one of her \"students\", and that she had already done at least 10-12 hours this week.\n\nI decided to be upfront with her and tell her that she could not go on this way, and that she was turning her side gig into an actual part time job, and that now she needs to focus on her exams because that is the important thing, and because she has already put aside enough money, so she is just burning herself out. \n\nI knew this was a very touchy subject because she isn't really well off (but she definitely has enough to sustain herself), and she had already told me that she did not want me to tell her that she is working too much, but I hate seeing her this tired, and at the same time not studying enough. I am really worried that she might hurt herself and not pass all the exams that she has to take, and decided to tell her what I though even though it would hurt her.\n\nAs I expected, she was hurt by my comment and told me that she needed time alone, and that she would text me later. She still hasn't texted me and I'm getting nervous, so was I the asshole for telling her what I thought? ",

      "title": "AITAH for expecting my brother's teacher to reimburse him for a hoodie she confiscated and lost?",
      "description": "This happened 3 weeks ago, but I barely talked to the teacher today because of several reasons: 1) My brother hesitated on telling me because he was told he could get it back that same Friday. 2) I can only go Mondays and Wednesdays. 3) She was absent last Monday I went. And 4) We had spring break.\nSo my middle-schooler brother was wearing a black \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\" hoodie he had just bought a week prior. The hoodie was out of dress code for the color and the logo. He insisted on taking it to school because other kids wore all kinds of stuff and they didn't get in trouble. I know that just because other people do it, it doesn't make it right.\nAnyway, this teacher saw him in the hallway and asked him to give it over. He did. Well, this lady left the hoodie on a cubby by the door. Mind you, when I went today, I had to wait about 10 minutes in her classroom because she was out and about somewhere. Obviously, she is careless about what goes on in her classroom.\nWhen she finally decided to come back, I presented myself and reminded her of my brother and the hoodie. I then asked her what she's going to do about the situation. She told me \"I told him to look in the lost and found.\" *Turns to my brother* \"DiD yOu LoOk In ThE lOsT aNd FoUnD?\"\nThat's when she made me mad. Like okay ogre-looking-ass, you really expect a middle schooler who stole a hoodie to return the hoodie to the lost and found?\nMy brother then tells her that he looked multiple times and she looks at me with a ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ look. I then say, Thank you, I'm going to take it to (insert principal's name). *I *personally *know *the *principal, *although *she *might *not *remember *me *because *she *was *an *administrator *at \"my *high *school *a *few *years *ago.\nI go down to the office, and ask if I can speak to (insert principal's name) for an issue with a teacher. They tell me I have to speak to administration first, and I need to get a written note from my parents to do so since I'm not the legal guardian.\nI guess I have to mention now that my dad works past the time the school closes and my mom is recovering from a surgery which she had 2 weeks ago. That's why I am doing all of this.\nAnyway, AITAH for expecting the teacher to pay for what she took and lost? The hoodie was only $20 because my brother had it made. It's not like it's a big deal for her or I to get it made again. I just think it's unfair for my brother. If this was a cellphone we're talking about, and she lost it, I think it would be just as big of a deal. Why couldn't she just tell him to put it in his locker or bag or just carry it. It's her fault it's lost, so she should be responsible for paying for it.",

      "description": "First time poster here, English is my second language, I hope I'll be able to explain the situation correctly! It's a long story, so here i go!   \n\n\nBackground : I (20M) am living with four other room-mates at my old mother's house. Since she wasn't able to sell it, she rented it to me and my friends (one guy and two girls). Note that we did not sign a lease, since it was a friendly agreement. At first, the rent was a bit expensive for only four people, so one of the girl brought her friend (26F) in September. It wasn't sure how many months she was supposed to stay, but we were pretty happy about it. When I met her, I immediately knew that she was the anxious kind of person, and I felt for her. But I didn't know what was to come.\n\n&gt;Her presence alone changed the dynamic in the house. She decided to buy a cat (to help reduce her anxiety), even thought the first floor was supposed to be cat-less because there is one girl that is allergic. I had cats that stayed in the basement and they had fights with the new cat, which she indirectly blamed me for. Every time I encountered her in the house, I tried to have a friendly chat with her, but I felt some weird tension. When I asked her for simple services, such as a little bit of olive oil, it always seemed to disturb her and she often declined with what seemed a lack of empathy. Often, I put that on the account of her anxiety disorder (she eventually told me she had one) and let it go. But then, she also started complaining about the housework in a backdoor way. For example, she left a list on the fridge on the 'steps not to forget when cleaning the kitchen' and notes such as «Parasites are at our door!». Me and the other guy knew that it concerned us, we just didn't understand why she didn't told us about her discontent first. We did not felt good about it. Also, whenever she wrote in our house group chat, it was only to complain and express her discomfort about something.  \n\nAs you can see, I had my load of anxiety living with her and I considered many times having a talk about the situation, to explain how and why we feel uneasy, and also to understand why she acted that way. I never did, since I knew she would not be at ease and would start to either blame herself of reject the blame. Months passed and it was going fine, until she started worrying about what was going to happen in July 2019 (we were in January, btw). Since I did not want to live with her another year (and since the other girls were moving out of town next summer), I told her she'd have to look for another place to stay in July. Then, one week ago, she told me she had found a new place to stay and that she would leave at the end of the month. I was kind of shocked. I asked her if she would at least pay her rent for March, which resulted in a categorical refusal. I told her that usually, when leaving a housing, you need to notify one month in advance, therefore that she had to pay for next month also. Big anxious no. I asked again. Still refusing, saying that she won't pay for two rents at once, that she already signed the lease at the other place and that anyway, she hadn't signed any lease with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I lost it. I got really pissed off, I raised my voice and started ineffectively asking again and again. I was boiling. She repeated that there was no lease. I shouted «Well if there is no lease, we could just kick you anytime we want and you'd have no right to stay here!» \\[Still refusing\\] «Don't expect to stay the whole month here». I then left the house for the rest of the day. When I came back, she was gone. She took all her things and left. \n\nI had talked about this with my friend and he agreed with me that she was a toxic person. But the girls were on her side, even thought we never talked about it. I know it wasn't right to burst in anger and shout at her, but I feel that it was justified. Am I the asshole? Should I have acted differently?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA For Not Sharing The Wifi",
      "description": "Backstory: Not sure what is relevant so I'll try and provide as much information as possible. I live with my girlfriend in a modified 2-story house. We live in the upstairs area and we have a couple gents living below us. Our landlord is my gf's grandma. The guy we lived above previously to the new tenants was an big asshole. I had to get our own router and modem because it just wasn't working. No issue there, just a pain to get it set up. Oh also noting that both my gf and me split the internet bill 50/50\n\nNow the new guys, great guys, I have no problem with them at all. They've been living there for a few months, they went to school with my gf, they work for her dad, they're fine. That being said they have been having Wifi issues for since they moved in.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nMy Girlfriend was asked by the guys if we could share the wifi password with them.\n\nI said no\n\nFor a number of reasons. For one I think it's a security issue giving out the password. Our stuff could get malware. We are responsible for the sites they go on. Who knows if they are pirating movies and stuff like I totally would never ever think about doing...\n\nAnother issue is our bandwidth. We have top of the line internet because I game regularly and have picked up streaming ([twitch.tv/fullman\\_](https://twitch.tv/fullman_) shame plug) but I don't know how many devices they plan on using.\n\nAlso I just am a little paranoid about sharing my wifi.\n\nAITA For Not Sharing The Password?\n\nBONUS! This argument is monthly. For some reason the guys just can't seem to manage to get their internet working with the landlord. So once a month they ask my GF, she asks me, I say no, and then it spirals.\n\nThe main issue I have is that she doesn't seem to respect my choice. I tell her my reasoning and explain the points above and she will reply that I'm being controlling. I get we don't have to agree on this buy at least respect that my decision. So it makes me feel like I'm being peer pressured and I've explained that to her. Honestly I feel as though i can be as controlling as I want with this information.\n\nWhich brings me to today. The guys asked to use our internet, and they asked her to use it for a month. I said hell no and compromised maybe I can give it to them for a day or two. My GF didn't feel that was enough. After hours of back and forth my girlfriend and I had decided to agree to disagree, where after I finally caved and gave them the password. But I feel like I regret it completely.\n\nTo be honest I feel like I was peer pressured again, Granted I did this after we had agreed to disagree, but the comments she made about me being controlling just kept repeating in my head.\n\nI don't want to have this argument ever again. I let her know if she doesn't at least respect my decision, whether she agreed or disagreed, I will pay for the Wifi completely and give out the password to her at me leisure. Or she can get her own router/modem and set it up.\n\nAITA for proposing this fairly extreme solution?",

We are having a relatively small bridal party of 5 bridesmaids/groomsmen each. For my bridesmaids, I chose two of my best friends, my two sisters, and fiancé’s sister, Sarah* (21, f). I only asked Sarah basically just to be nice, but also I felt it was expected, and when I asked her, my future MIL said “oh thank god, there would have been trouble if you didn’t!”. It was a joke but still felt weird. Over the 4 years of my relationship, me and Sarah have always been okay but very different - she’s very entitled, I am very gritty-working class; she can be very blunt and rude about things, I generally try to keep negative opinions to myself around his family. Recently, her mother and I argued (all better now, but basically MIL kept making jokes at my expense when they had company over and I was feeling a little bullied so confronted her about it) and Sarah has taken this very much to heart and has started being VERY rude. As in literally ignoring me when I directly talking to her and slamming doors in my face, I created a bridesmaids group chat (including one of the “groomsmen” who is a girl) and Sarah has never once replied to anything or posted in the chat. Basically it feels like at this point, on my wedding day, I’ll be surrounded by my sisters and best friends and then this girl who can’t stand me and makes sure I know it. I’ve spoken to my fiancé about this, and he said it’s up to me.\n\nSo... WIBTA for basically saying to her “look, I’m not sure if I want you to be my bridesmaid anymore?”",

      "description": "So a bit of Background my girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 years and within the recent year have been in sort of a rough patch. We broke up because I thought she was too controlling and she was adding too much to my stress while being a hypocritical about the whole thing and I was growing bitter towards her.  We got back together because I really missed her and she promised to change and to be fair she has in some aspects the fist three months of getting back together were rocky but recently it’s slightly better.\n\nFast forward to today, she has recently been becoming an extremely jealous type like I can look at someone for a split second and she automatically assumes I’m checking them out and she’ll just go quiet and give me attitude the whole day and not tell me why until she says something along the lines of “hope you and that girl have fun”. It irritates me. Today I liked a tweet and it was quoted tweet it said “middle eastern beauty hits differently” (my girl and I are Latino)  and the picture was a middle eastern girl. All I did was like it because I thought now that I think about it I do see a lot of attractive middle easterns men and women. I told her this but she’s still mad and I hate this jealousy. So am I really the asshole for liking this tweet?\n\n",

We’re both in our late 20s and have been living together for a couple of months. \n\nI’ve always imaged having a dog once I’ve had my own place, that’s always been my plan. I had a dog as a child/ teen and loved it to death. I haven’t been able to have a dog because of space/ time/ financial reasons. But in the near future I really want to adopt. My point is, this is very important to me.\n\nMy SO however does not want a dog. Ever. They have been wish-y wash-y about the idea since we started dating. But I figured “who could hate dogs? I’ll convince them”. Nope. We pet sat a mutual friends dog this weekend and my SO was not having it. Definitely confirmed they never want a dog. And I was honestly really turned off at how my SO even didn’t want to even pet it.\n\nI know this seems petty, and I probably shouldn’t have assumed that I could change my SO’s mind about dogs. But I just can’t imagine my future without a dog. Is this dramatic?\n\nTL;DR I love dogs and want one in the future. SO hates dogs and refused to ever have one.

      "title": "AITA for reporting a student cheating of my college math exam?",
      "description": "TL:DR at the bottom. \n\nOkay, so it’s my first year of college and I was an engineering student (engineering classes are hard as shit) and I was really freaking out about finals. I mean, full mental breakdowns after classes, getting 3 hours of sleep a night, the whole stressed-out-college-student fiasco.\n\nMy GPA was too low for me to keep my scholarship, and my final exam grades were the only thing that was going to save me, I wouldn’t be able to go to school the next year without it. I was really losing my shit.\n\nI studied my ASS of for this exam. I studied 6 hours every day the week before the final, and crammed 14 hours the day before, skipped all my classes that day. I only slept 4 hours that night so the math would be fresh in my brain for my morning final. I had so many equations running through my head, I practically couldn’t speak English anymore. I really needed this good grade, a 97%.\n\nI was literally so stressed out I started praying three times a day, sometimes more. I was almost convinced that God was the only thing that was gonna make me pass this test and save my GPA.\n\nSo, I walk into the classroom and sit down to myself. The only person near me was a really smart kid sitting a chair away. I’m getting my things out, getting ready for the test. This girl come in, and sits directly in between me and this smart boy. I think it’s kind of weird because there plenty of other seats for her to sit in by herself, and she didn’t know either one of us besides our work in class. I just let it go, I was really focused on the test.\n\nWe have to put our ID facing the front of the classroom before the test starts. It’s to check to make sure we’re all there. This comes in handy later. \n\nSo, the test starts. I’m really, really focused on it. I tune out all other noises for about a quarter of the test. I feel like I’m getting a lot of them right, and I feel great about it.\n\nThen, I flip my page, and hear the girl next to me flip her page over a couple seconds after mine. I don’t think anything of it. I start to work on the next question and start sorting out the equation, and I hear her scribble at the same time. I look over, and sure enough, she’s looking at my paper and copying line for line what I was doing.\n\nI saw this and it shocked me a little bit. Cheating is a really big deal in college, especially on a final exam. They’ll kick you out for that. So, I say to her, “hey, stop doing that. You’re gonna get us both in trouble.”\n\nShe looks a little shocked I caught her, but shies away for a while.\n\nThis rattled me and completely broke my focus. I felt I was doing so well, but this girl cheating off me started to make me feel frustrated. The professor checks the tests afterwards to see if there was any cheating, and I was scared he would take us both down if our tests matched too much.\n\nI still continue on and don’t say anything. I get to the end of the multiple choice and go to the fill-in-the-blanks. One of them is a graph, a hard one. I had specifically studied these types of graphs for 4 hours the night before because they were so difficult for me. \n\nI see the equation and recognize the shape it’s supposed to be, YES! I’m so excited that I recognize the shape because that alone will get me a few points. I sketch the shape on the top of my paper, and lo and behold, the girl next to me looks over, and copies the exact same shape.\n\nI’m pissed off at this point. “Stop it. I’m going to tell the professor if you don’t stop. Fuck off.” She gets really wide-eyed and kind of says sorry to me and turns back to her test. The professor saw us talking and told the class to be quiet. This freaks me out because I’m afraid the professor will check our tests out and think we cheated.\n\nThe girl finishes before me and leaves. I take the full time on my test even though I’m finished because, again, I really needed this good grade. So I go back and start triple-checking everything, wondering what I should do about this cheating.\n\nI don’t want to go up to the professor in front of all my classmates because that’s embarrassing. No one likes a snitch, hell, I don’t like a snitch either, but if the professor thought we were cheating, I could get kicked out of college too. I don’t know what to do, so I literally ask GOD what I should do.\n\nAnd there it was, like she left it there on purpose, her ID. She didn’t pick it up when she left. The damn thing was even facing me. I say to myself, “well, there’s a sign if you need one.” This way, I wouldn’t have to go up there and say, “oh yeah, I sat here, she sat there, here’s what she looked like, she cheated, etc.” I don’t know why, but that seemed like a lot to me. If I could just hand over her college ID and say, “this person cheated off me,” it’s a lot easier.\n\nSo, I wait for the buzzer to go off signaling the end of the test. I go up and turn my test in, and then the girls ID. I say, “she was cheating off me the whole time. I asked her to stop twice and that’s why you saw us talking, and that’s why our tests might  match.” The other students gave me a dirty look, but I just left.\n\nI started to feel really guilty about reporting this girl. What if I just got her kicked out of college? What if I just ruined her life? And then I thought, “but she could’ve just ruined my life by doing that, the professor saw us talking and was gonna check the tests out for sure, right?” And I mean, I busted my ASS to get a good grade on that test. I literally lost my mind and was losing hair over this test. Why should she profit off my hard work like that? I didn’t even know her. I mean, she literally sat in between two kids who she knew were smart/studied, and intended to cheat. She obviously didn’t study for this test. But still, getting kicked out of college is a hell of a consequence, and I didn’t want to do that to somebody. I probably would have walked out without saying anything if she didn’t leave her ID like that.\n\nI told some of my friends about what happened. Their consensus was pretty much, “wow, so you’re that bitch, huh?” And they laughed about it. It made me feel really bad about what I did.\n\nThe professor emailed me the next day asking if I was the girl who reported the cheating, and I felt so bad, I didn’t ever reply. I never saw that professor or the girl again, I don’t know what happened to her.\n\nBut, good news is, I got the grade I needed on that test and saved me GPA! So happy ending for me I guess. This happened a while back but the guilt of possibly getting a girl I didn’t know kicked out of college is weighing on me. So... AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I studied really hard for a math exam. A girl came in with the intention to cheat and I asked her to stop twice. She left her ID and that gave me enough reason to report her. I felt really bad and didn’t follow through. AITA?",

      "description": "So I (m17) had a brief discussion with my girlfriend (f18) about college and how she has opportunities to go to a different college than me.\n\nWe're really close and have been together for quite some time and I believe we are extremely involved in eachothers lives. \n\nI am restricted financially and going to a local college would be the best option for me and I don't really think that leaving would be a good choice for me. She got accepted into a college that she really likes, but it's quite expensive. \n\nShe asked me if I would be okay with her leaving and I just said I would be okay with whatever she did if it made her happy. \n\nShe now thinks I don't care about her or love her enough to be selfish and tell her that I don't want her to leave. I don't want to restrict her from opportunities in life. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

But I see him as a more brother figure, or just a best friend. He is really attracted to me even though I'm a lesbian and I have a girlfriend. \n\nThat being said, he doesn't mind showing his attraction to me a lot. He calls me things such as \"cutie\", \"beautiful\", \"babe\", and things like that. It makes me really uncomfortable, and I'm a bit scared to confront him about it because things like that give me bad anxiety.\n\nAnyways, sometimes he makes comments about how hot I am. I really dont like it, and I have to just stop talking to him for a few hours just to get over feeling unsettled (I may have used that word in the wrong context.)  But I remember one time he said that he could make me orgasm and turn me straight. Which I think is totally not okay, especially when I have a girlfriend. \n\nSo, to sum it up, I ghost one of my guy friends because he makes me uncomfortable with his comments. Am I the asshole for doing that? \n\n(Apologies again for formatting and grammar)",

Turns out it was the guy that was texting her that I night I was with her at 2am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I asked her about the messages and she lies. She doesn't tell me exactly what they say to each other.

      "description": "Hi everyone, first post so I'm sorry if I violate any rules.\n\nThis past weekend, my girlfriend and I planned to spend the weekend together at my mom's house in NJ until Sunday when we would both go back to Brooklyn, NY together. I'm on vacation from my job so I came to NJ earlier on in the week to get some errands out of the way, i.e. change car brakes, clean up and organize my mom's house, spend time with a friend I don't see often since we live in different states. I even had my gf pack some bags, and I loaded them into my car so she wouldn't have to carry them here herself. She still had work through out the week and the plan was for her to take the train from NY to NJ where I would pick her up from the train station. All the sudden, we had a pretty bad snow storm on the Thursday before and that made a mess of the roads as well as public transportation in NY. She decided not to take the train to NJ because after a long week of work, she was tired and didn't want to deal with the mess that was the trains. I said okay, although I was upset and figured I can leave early Sunday morning and head back to NY to spend some time with her and come back to NJ later on in the week. What the issue is, is that she got angry that since she couldn't take the train, I didn't offer to drive back and forth to NY to pick her up and bring her to NJ either Friday night or Saturday morning, and then of course, drive her back to NY sometime Sunday since she still has work before Thanksgiving. I'm still on vacation and had to come back to NJ at some point after I took her back. I told her she jumped the gun, because although she did take off from her job on Saturday to come to NJ, I was planning to come back early Sunday to be with her and spend a few nights together. She understands that but still insists that I am not a true gentleman because I think it's a bit out of the way to drive back and forth, 2x in a weekend, to pick her up, bring her to NJ and then take her back to NY. She claims I am the only man she has ever known that thinks that's a bit much when compared to my alternative of just heading back to NY early to be with her. AITA here?",

My friend reveals that he does still like her and gets really upset with me. I don’t really know what I can do. But I try to talk to him about how I didn’t actually mean to try to steal the girl he likes. And that I would never mean to hurt him. We reconcile, or so I thought. Me and the girl date for about 2 months and my friend is still upset with me turns out. Me and him are with a bunch of other friends and we have an hour and a half conversation about it and it goes really well. We both reconcile and and hug it out.  Then another time about 2 weeks after I broke up with the girl he started messaging her and asked me for advice on how to get her nudes. I tell him I’m of course not going to do that. He then texts me about 3 months after we had the hour long conversation saying he hated me for what I did with the girl and that I didn’t apologize. Which isn’t true. I do feel bad and I really didn’t think he liked her anymore. I’ve said sorry several times and he doesn’t seem to really care. My other friend liked her before him too and he tried to get her while my other friend liked her before him. Which is ironic bc that’s what he’s mad at me for. So yeah maybe I am a dick for this, I really don’t know. He seems really mad at me for it and I might just not be self aware and an ass. AITA?",

I haven’t met the new guy but he wants to meet me next week.

      "description": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI have a friend (mid 30s) who recently was engaged. I consider her a close friend and recently she told me that she would need to have her implants (she got them in her 20s) removed due to a complication. I'm the one closest enough to her that she is willing to share this with/ask for support during this time. Without hesitation, I said I absolutely would support her (ex. through an airfare ticket to see the original doctor, a short (less than 5 d) stay in a hotel, staying with her for the first few days post-surgery). I asked if she would just be getting her implants removed and a bit of a lift for the loose skin. Her plan is to get her old implants out and new implants in so her finance doesn't realize that she had implants to begin with.   \n\n\nThat's when I mentally hit the breaks. Her fiance doesn't know about the implants (or maybe he noticed on his own but they never actually talked about it). I told her she needs to tell him. She said it would be too embarrassing. I told her that keeping secrets about health/medical situations when you're about to get married is a really bad precedent to set. Presumably one day you will rely on your spouse to care for you when you are ill. There's no sense in being embarrassed. Additionally, she is not in good shape financially (over 20k in debt...I think it might even be 30k+) and she will be using a loan to cover the expense of the surgery. I didn't ask, but if she's not explaining to her finace why she's getting this surgery and getting it immediately, she is probably not being forthcoming regarding the finances either.   \n\n\nShe said she would want to stay in the other city for 2 weeks post procedure (I did set down a boundary with that saying that I do not have enough PTO accrued at work to stay with her for 2 weeks.)  \n\n\nWould I be the asshole to withdraw my support if she does not tell her finance about her medical (and financial) issue? Any other situational-ethics I should consider with this?",

      "description": "So, I am back, and again drugs are mentioned.\n\nThis new guy moved into our apartment a while ago. He seemed really reclusive which I didnt mind at first. Then he very OBVIOUSLY started smoking weed in his room. Not just a little. Daily. Multiple times. It wasnt an issue at first because when the weather was nice he would leave his room window open. However, it's gotten a lot colder and he still smokes. A ton. Every day when I come home the entire apartment reeks of weed. And I mean STINK. I've tried on multiple occasions to get a hold of this guy: knocking on his door, texting him, calling him, leaving notes. Every time its met with silence. \nThe last time I saw him he was talking about beating the shit out of someone with a tire iron because he lost his job. Me, not wanting to cause problems, decided it may not be the best time to mention it. That was the last time I saw him. It was 3 weeks ago. He ignores me anytime i try to talk to him and I've tried to be discrete and respectful.\nI woke up at 3 AM this morning to the smell of that same stink. But this time my mouth is dry as fuck and I felt high. (I have smoked before but quit 2.5 years ago. I know what it's like to be high.)\nThis fucker smoked so much weed he hotboxed the entire 4 bedroom apartment. I live literally the furthest from him in the hall. Literally high against my own will while writing this. \nI skipped trying to talk to him and reported his ass to the complex as soon as they opened. The apartment itself is strictly non smoking, and he never asked if we were okay with weed. \nI talked to my friend about it. She thinks I'm an asshole because I didnt try hard enough. She said if I couldn't get a hold of someone I was living with then I was \"in a skewed mindset\". \n\nTL;DR, recluse roomate puts me on read and hot boxes the entire apartment. I reported him to complex. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nWhat would you have done if you woke up to this? \n\nUpdate: \nAfter the letter came in, roomate reached out to me. \nHe said \"If my smoking bothers you, tell me, dont report me.\"\n\nDude. Seriously? \n\nHe continued to smoke. We just had property wide inspections last week. He just received another notice AND a letter from an attorney. YIKES.  \n",

      "description": " \n\nThis all happened less than an hour ago.\n\nI was at a bar I frequent and talking to some people I know, suddenly I feel someone from behind me hugging and starting to grind against me. I know a lot of people at the bar, and assume it's a friend of mine, but when I look down at the shoes I do not recognize them. I look back and I see a dude I do not know, nor have I ever seen. He looks back at me, with horror in his eyes, because I'm a dude too... I feel an urge of rage inside me and shove him in the chest with my elbow so I can get away.\n\nHe goes to his table and I go back to mine. I was with my roommate and his girlfriend. They asked what happened and I told them, then I see the guy who hugged me looking around for me. Him and two of his friends come up to us and he says:  \n\"I just wanted to apologize, I thought you were someone else.\"\n\nI respond, \"I understand, just check before you hug people. Now, please fuck off\"\n\nHe repeats his last statement, so do I. This happens one more time and at this point his friends have surrounded me, my roommate is on his feet and I have left my beer at the table. His friend goes in my face and says.  \n\"He just wanted to apologize, you really shouldn't be yelling at us\" and starts waiving his finger at me.\n\nWe are at a rock bar, it's loud, I was speaking louder just to be sure I am heard.\n\nThe manager knows me so he comes asking me what happened. I explain the situation and he speaks with them then he tells me.  \n\"They want to say sorry, can you guys shake hand?\"\n\n\"Yeah sure, I just want them to leave me alone.\"  \nHonestly I didn't even want to touch the guy, but whatever. We shake hands and they go away.\n\nMe and my roommate look at their table and there's no one that looks anything like me. So, reddit, did I overreact? Am I The Asshole here?",

      "description": "It was my (23F) birthday on the 7th of March. My boyfriend (27M) and I have previously had a serious argument over Christmas. He didn't get me a gift and I got him one and I ended up feeling a little frustrated that we hadn't communicated to each other what we expected on Christmas. We resolved that argument however and that led to January where I sat down with him and had a chat about my upcoming birthday. I expressed to him that I do not expect a gift if he can't afford one, but I (childishly) like to be spoiled with attention on my birthday and if he can't afford a gift then a card or breakfast in bed or even just a little bit of birthday sexy time would be nice.\n\nI fucking love birthdays. On his birthday I organised a dinner at a really nice restaurant, bought him some candles I knew he loved and bought him a bottle of scotch. This is my pleasure to do and I don't expect people to go out and spend as much money or any money at all on me, I just enjoy celebrating the day.\n\nOn my birthday I woke up with a migraine and was incapacitated. He brought me some painkillers, said happy birthday then jumped back on his computer and continued working. \n\nWe had dinner with my family later. My dad paid and then my boyfriend drove me back to his house. On the way I suggested we drop into a local bar that I knew a couple of my friends were at. He just sat while I danced with some friends. When the time came to go home, a couple of girls that were mutual friends of ours asked for a lift home. I was sitting with another girl who was drunk crying so I told him to drop them off and come back and pick me up as the girls only lived a couple of minutes away. An hour later he wasn't back. I rang him and he said they had wrangled him into taking them to McDonalds. The bar had closed at this point so I ended up having to walk back to a friends house to wait for him. He was out with them for about an hour and a half before he showed up.\n\nWe headed back to his house where he promptly passed out. The next day he was in a foul mood over some work he had to do and pretty much ignored me all day. A couple of days later I expressed to him that I felt a little let down with how he had behaved on my birthday, and that it would have been nice if he had got me a card or even just written happy birthday on Facebook. I was frustrated because I feel like I told him what I had expected on my birthday and he really made minimal effort to make me feel special or to acknowledge it. His reasoning is that he was too overwhelmed by the beginning of his university course to think about my birthday, and he got really pissed off with me for being upset. He has hardly talked to me at all this week and I don't know if I'm being petty or not. He did buy me those games a few weeks ago but I just really look forward to my birthday and was really looking forward to spending it with him and I feel like I wasn't even spared a thought?\n\nSorry for the wall of text but AITA here?",

      "description": "So last night my father passed away. He had been put into a care home for dementia but he passed away suddenly from congestive heart failure. As soon as I got the news I dropped everything and flew home. I never left the home when I got here and was with him when we passed.\n\nWhen he was put in a nursing home I asked my mother and sister if I should move home. They said no because:\n\nMy job is highly specific and only available in two places in the country.\n\n- My hometown is a rural pit where the only available jobs are government, healthcare, or service industry.  So I would've had to bartend or serve tables and put my career on hold.\n\n- We didn't know when he would pass and thought it might be up to even 6 years.\n\n- When lucid he told us all multiple times not to put our life's on hold for him because life is short and he wants us to live it.\n\nSo my sister (who was already planning on moving back because she and her husband worked for the state and didn't want to raise her new baby in the city) moved home and offered to help where sho could.\n\nI called home everyday and came home 5 or 6 times a year to help as much as I could. \n\nLet me stress how I constant brought up to my sister how guilty I felt for not being home and thought about it moving back multiple times, her response was always \"no nature_andthe_woods, dad would've never you wanted to put your life on hold, he would be proud of what you do. Don't ruin your life to come home when you might be stuck bartending for 6 years.\"\n\nTonight her and I got in a small argument about nothing which turned into her screaming at me for not being here. She told me she resented me for not moving back and I let dad down.\n\nI told her that you and Mom both told me not to move back and her response was \"I was lying to make you feel better and you should've known to come home. The fact that you feel guilty means I'm right.\"\n\nI left to go for a walk and clear my head but I am devastated my only sibling resents me and feel so guilty I wasn't here more.\n\nAdditionally, he died of congestive heart failure not the dementia so this was very sudden. He had been in the home 7 months but we thought he might be there for upwards of 6.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for not moving home and being there more? ",

      "description": "This happened last summer but I just found out about this sub so I am just posting it now. So a friend of mine who I am not really that close to, more of a friend of a friend asked me to pitch in the championship game of his adult baseball league.\n\nFor whatever reason this league allows a ringer for the championship game and since I am a pitcher who just retired from MLB they asked me to be their ringer. I had nothing better to do so I agreed. Figured it might be fun to fuck around and I know I will get plenty of free beers out of it so why not. \n\nCouple days before the game I find out that this dude made a HUGE bet with a guy on the other team (figured he had an ace in the whole and couldn't lose). I really didn't want to be apart of all that shit. I just wanted to go fuck around so I backed out. \n\nHe then told me that he didn't have the money to pay off the bet if he lost, I told him that, that was his problem not mine and that he shouldn't have made the bet.\n\nWell he couldn't find a replacement ringer and ended up losing. He ended up being forced to sell his motorcycle to pay off his debt. This pretty much fractured out friend circle. Even about 6 months later we still don't really all hang out like we used to. So am I the asshole here for not bailing him out of his bet?",

      "description": "So before all this happened, my friend , Taylor, and her boyfriend, John, were a part of my friend group and we were all very close to each other.  Then about six months ago, John started staying up really late to call us and play games with us while also ignoring Taylor.  Sometimes when we played it would just be him and I and when that happened I always told him to go talk to her, because I could tell their relationship was strained, but he always ignored me.  \n\nThen, a month later, he started making really sexual comments about me but I kind of just laughed it off, thinking it wasn’t serious and not wanting to cause trouble.  He would also get into my personal space a lot, but again, I never said anything because I didn’t want to cause trouble.  After a month or two of this, he started getting drunk really often late at night and would always text me, asking if he could come over.  One time, he told me to call him if I was ever horny and implied it was okay to cheat because my relationship with my boyfriend wasn’t that important anyway.  I told him that saying those kinds of things wasn’t okay and that it was inappropriate.  He stopped saying those kinds of things and never brought it up again.  \n\nA couple months later, our friend group went out, but this time my boyfriend wasn’t there.  We were dropping people off and after we dropped Taylor off, only John and I were left in the back seat.  As soon as she got out of the car, he scooted closer to me and kept touching my head.  I scooted away but he kept leaning in closer.  Then, he put his hand on my thigh and I froze up and he put his hand further up and underneath my shirt.  Then I grabbed his hand and he tried to keep going but I wouldn’t let him.  For some reason, at the time, I was too scared to say anything and I just got out as soon as I could.\n\nI told Taylor after it happened and she was torn up about it, but a day after, she texted me and told me that it didn’t mean anything and that she understood if I was uncomfortable being around him, but that she was staying with him.  My friends didn’t talk to him for a while because of it but lately they have been inviting him to everything, so I told them that if he goes, I don’t go.  Now they are saying that I’m being selfish and bitter and that I need to get over it.  AITA?",

I didn't even know this was happening, so I got removed from the suspect list pretty quickly. \n\nHowever, another female was found to be in a relationship with the Chief manager of competitor company. She lied about it during the questioning, and then got really, really offended when it was brought up and claimed she might have dropped the info by mistake.\n\nShe quit immediately because the interrogation had 'defiled her' and that everyone was taking out their personal grudges. \n\nI concur, the bosses did make some nasty implications (sleeping to the top, is what I think she inferred from it). Though having talked to my bosses, they weren't even considering it, nor did they explicitly mention anything of the sort during the questioning.\n\nI know her though, and I'm pretty sure she didn't do anything like this to undermine the company on purpose.\n\nAfter the resigning, however, she started saying nasty shit. We work with a lot of young teenagers and have pretty close relationships with a lot of them. She started calling us [REDACTED] on social media, and it's been creating a false PR nightmare. (Take a guess, your guess will be right).\n\nI do think she was probably wrongly accused in a defamatory manner, but her reaction to those accusations is making me rethink about fighting for her name to be cleared.\n\nSo Reddit, would I be the asshole in not taking a stand one way or the other?",

      "description": "So when I was a kid, there was this balloon artist in my town that I adored and would see him at every Chinese New Year street festival making these fantastic balloon animals. When I was 8 I cried so hard when the whale I got deflated and my mom said we had to throw it away. We took a picture of it with precious film so I would still remember it. \n\nI grew up, moved away and then moved back. Last Chinese New Year he was at a carnival. Couldn't believe it was him and took a card saying I wanted him at my 30th birthday next year even thought it was 11 months away. \n\nI sent him an email that week to say how excited I was and that I would be reaching out later in the year. (I did that in case I lost the business card too). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to late November, I asked if he was available for a January party. No response.   \n\n\nEmailed in early December and got a reply saying he was available for the date in January. I didn't get an answer to follow up emails like \"What are your rates?\" etc. I emailed in mid December twice when he didn't follow up.   \nEventually I just said \"are you still interested in this at all?\" To which I get the reply \"yes call this number\". Not 24 hours later there's a follow up to say \"you need to book now cause someone else is looking at this date\"  \n\nI did the booking and locked him down for the time and date.   \n\n\nToday I get a phone call from his customer service rep saying he double booked and the party that starts before mine had booked before I did...which I think is not my fault because I had been trying to get him since the beginning of the previous month.  \n\nMy options are to have him come later (which doesn't work) or have another rep (his daughter)  from the company come instead. I told them I would think about it but didn't get into the whole \"I have been a fan since I was a kid\" thing.   \n\n\nI was really looking forward to this and I know it's extremely silly that a 30 year old to have balloon animals. I don't normally throw huge birthday parties and I've been saving up for the big 3-0 for a while. \n\n I mean the replacement is his daughter but I'm disappointed and annoyed that this is happening. \n\nWIBTA if I pushed back saying I wanted this particular balloon artist and it was the lack of communication on their end that made me the \"later booking\"? Should I demand a refund? Or should I give the apprentice daughter a chance? I worry if I demand it is him, he might loose business and hate coming to my event. ",

      "description": "We work in production where our old office is located right next to the manufacturing rooms, therefore it's very convenient. About 8 months ago, me and a few people joined that manufacturing department (I just changed departments, was already in the company for a year) and the manager organized a new room for our office to relocate (which was quite further away from the manufacturing rooms but wasn't that inconvenient). Just so you know, the room that was supposed to be our new office was a storage room for another department and me and another guy helped clear that place up, put all the new furniture in, get all the electronic equipment set up etc etc. Since we didn't have space for new people in the old office me and 2 other dudes set up our places in the new office. Whenever we didn't have to work in production we'd work on documentation and other stuff alone in the new office. We've been going like that for about 4-5 months.\n\nFast forward to today, turns out the old office is gonna be converted to a QC lab and all the people are gonna be transferred to the new office. And this F(25) coworker of mine comes in one day saying that the place I'm sitting in is the place she reserved when the manager sent the entire department the layout of the office. I told her \"that's not cool, you just walk here like nothing happened and just kick me out of my space\", but all she could tell was that \"she reserved\" so I just ignored her. I dug all over my mailbox, couldn't find any mail where she'd mention reserving one of the places but I did find my manager sending the layout so that means I was already hired when the layout was presented.\n\nSome info: she is not a long time worker. Basically she was in the department approximately 1 year longer than me, is constantly bossy, always talks back even when she messes up, blames the equipment when stuff doesn't work out even though other people work with the same equipment and everything's fine for them, always tries to be right and forces her opinion to be right, and \"the classic\": I should get a promotion because I'm more experienced than other people.\n\nNow the reason I told all her negative traits is that I've considered taking the high road and just letting her have that place and move all my stuff elsewhere in the office, but I really really want to put her in her place, just plainly tell her that I'm not moving and I don't care whether she reserved or whatnot and see what she's gonna do about it. The problem is I don't want to seem like an ass in front of my other colleagues who are really nice and good people.\n\nWITBA if I tell her \"tough luck\" when she mentions again about taking the place?",

      "description": "So basically on Sunday we went to my fiancé’s parents to celebrate his sister’s birthday. The whole time we were there she mocked me in various ways(my religion, the holidays I take and our car) and no one said a word to make her stop. \n\nI was very hurt by it but kept my cool until we got home where I explained to my fiancé exactly why I was hurt and he offered to talk to his parents to see what was wrong as she has never acted like this before(which I agreed was fair). \n\nHe spoke to his mother and asked her what was up with his sister and was told basically in their church(different branch of the same tree to my religion) there had been some women who had celebrations happening soon and she hadn’t been invited to any of them and had felt left out. \n\nAITA for when I found out having no sympathy for it. I feel it wasn’t my fault they cut her out and it wasn’t fair for her to take her anger out on me? I feel like my fiancé wants to forget it but I feel I am owed an apology especially as this was nothing to do with me. \n\nHalf of me thinks she may not have been invited as she doesn’t have a job that pays well and she may have not been invited as they knew she wouldn’t be able to afford it and they didn’t want to either make her feel bad (or more likely in my opinion) have to deal with her bile about things costing too much. (On Boxing Day she made many comments to her family about how people spending over £50 per person on a hen night was obscene and that when she goes to weddings she doesn’t buy them anything not even a card which I find disgusting as these people have paid money for you to come for you to not even buy a card to thank them) \n\nAm I the Asshole in this situation or are we both in the wrong?

      "description": "Kinda long, TLDR at the end.\n\nA little previous context, I'm 25 now, but when I was 17 I dated a 24 year old who mentally abused me horribly. I'm still affected by some of the things he did to me, which included locking me out of the bedroom in winter without a blanket or the heat on. I shivered to sleep several nights out of the year and he would do this to me over completely stupid stuff, like daring to say another man's name anywhere near him. He made me scared to cook or play video games around other people because he would make fun of how I did it and make me feel like a complete idiot if I didn't do it how he liked it. There's a ton more to unpack here, but I won't get into it.\n\nSo cut to yesterday. A close friend of mine who is in his 50s is in a local play and he's been posting excitedly about it on Facebook for weeks. He made a post to praise his co-actors and who's name do I see there right next to a raving review of what a wonderful person he is? Yeah. So I messaged my friend to tell him, because honestly I would want to know if I was acting alongside someone who hurt any of my friends like how this guy hurt me. I didn't ask him to quit the play, I didn't tell him outright not to hang out with this person, I literally just told him what he did to me, because I would want to know if I was in his position.\n\nThe response I received was something to the effect of \"you just selfishly tainted my view on this person. He's an amazing actor and is in a happy relationship. Now I have to get through this shit on opening night in three days because you did this to me\"\n\nAITA here? I really didn't think I did anything wrong by telling him and I feel incredibly hurt that his response was so mean and selfish when I thought that my friend would be a little more understanding. He's been abused before too, so I thought he would understand and be more sympathetic. We aren't friends anymore and I don't think that this friendship will recover. I just want to know if other people think that I was wrong for telling him this.\n\nTLDR: I told a friend that he was in a play with my abusive ex, his response is to call me selfish for tainting his view of this supposedly amazing actor.",

At one point my ex did have my password but I changed it after she blew up after a misunderstanding and refused to accept my apologies for multiple days afterwards despite admitting she knew I did nothing wrong. The misunderstanding was her accusing me of cheating after she saw me calling a female friend gorgeous. I reasoned with her saying it makes no sense for her to keep me from complimenting friends platonically (even female) considering she was bisexual and also complimented her friends. She agreed with this logic and I suggested until she minds that less maybe she should stay off my Facebook. I triple checked this was OK with her and she continued to agree. After this she continuously attempted to look over my shoulder or get my password in other ways; I continued to tell her all she had to do was ask for it back. I figured if we wanted to avoid drama she should wait until she's honest about herself being OK with me giving platonic compliments towards friends. She could've asked to look at my phone or even for my password any time she wanted and I would've let her at that second. I don't/didn't have shit to hide; I just knew it would cause drama if anything threw her off. AITA?  ",

      "title": "AITA for taking my nephew to a prostitute behind his parents’ back?",
      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my 19 year old nephew is back from his sophomore year of college. He’s a great guy and I could sing praises about his character all day. He’s everything I would wish for if I had a kid of my own. We’ve generally been close as uncle-nephew. We text each other once a week or so, we play games together, I speak to him in Korean because he wants to learn our family’s native language better (we all live in America), and he has always seen me as an older brother. \n\nIn August, he called me to ask me for advice about women, which is not a topic that has not come up very often but it’s something I’m comfortable discussing with him. He told me that he’s having no luck with girls in college, no hookups, a couple of unsuccessful dates, and that he’s a virgin. None of this seemed strange to me, some people are just late bloomers and I don’t see a problem with that. But he confessed to me that these things really weigh on him, and that he knows even though he shouldn’t measure himself by his success in fucking, he can’t help but feel like society pressures him to be that way. Then he dropped the real reason for the call, he was wondering if I could help him get a prostitute so he knows what sex is like and won’t be so nervous for when he does find a girl who genuinely likes him. Now for a little bit of cultural context, purchasing sex in South Korea is more common than you’d think, but rarely is it ever spoken about publicly. And my nephew knows that people I know in the Korean American community would be able to find him a girl here in America who would be willing to undergo STD testing before meeting up with him (so long as we pay for it). \n\nI told him that while I’m not against seeing a hooker, I know that his parents would kill me if I helped him and that going to see a hooker is something that’s going to follow him for the rest of his life. Either he has to lie about it when he does find an appropriate long term partner, or he’ll have to hope she accepts that about him. Sometime around the beginning of November, he tells me that he has decided to go through with the hooker if I could find him one. He even tells me he could pay the full cost with the money he has earned through his part time job\n\nSo I contact my friend and we found him a sex worker who lives about an hour away from his house. The girl is also a Korean American and she’s going to college just as my nephew is, she just needs some extra money on the side. My nephew sent me money through Venmo to pay for her to get tested at Planned Parenthood, and after the results came back we make plans for him and her to meet up yesterday. I got him a hotel room near her house with a whole box of Trojans and some lube, and my nephew went and saw her. After the two hours, he came out and thanked me, he said it was super awkward and strange for him to be naked in front of a girl, but that he didn’t regret it. He admitted that he was totally spent after 40 minutes and just spent the rest of the time cuddling and talking to her about each other’s lives (which he said was almost as awesome as the sex itself). \n\nThen my nephew, ever the considerate guy, asked me how I was feeling knowing that this was strange for me too. I told him I was fine, but I asked him if he was ever going to tell this to his parents, or anyone for that matter. He told me that there is no chance he would ever tell his parents about this, he’s fairly close to his parents and they’re not very conservative, but they are church going Christians nonetheless. \n\nA part of me feels like an asshole, but my nephew is a legal adult and the girl we hired was not some trafficked woman.",

So her closest female friend had messaged me a few days earlier saying she didnt really like any of the girls in our class (which included my best friend), i felt really really bad about her not knowing about this, so i decided i'd tell her, i sent her a screenshot of the messages, and she said that she was going to cry, i started saying that i shouldnt have showed her because its making her cry, and she kept telling me she was only crying from stress but i think thats a lie and she blames me but idk, so am i the asshole i feel like yes  \n\n\nPS: sorry if this is sloppily written im stressed rn.",

      "title": "AITA For Slapping A Boy After He Took My Phone?",
      "description": "Important things about me: \n1. I have terrible anxiety from people taking my things (expensive things *like phones* are even worse), \n2.I’m a high school girl so there are many classes in the day and everyone’s schedule is different (this is important)\n3. The only time i will allow someone to use my phone is when i trust them to take care of my most precious belonging \n\nIn my algebra class, there is a group of mischievous boys who often take people’s phones without asking and take hundreds (sometimes about 1000) pictures on other people’s phones.  Sometimes they use my phone but it is returned to me before i know it was missing. Today was not the case. A boy (let’s call him B) walked past my desk to turn in his test (and i guess that’s when they took my phone?) while i was still taking it. After I finished the test, I wanted to scroll through instagram quietly for the rest of my class time but my phone couldn’t be found. I patted my pockets and checked my bag frantically. Nothing. I turned to B and said “come on, i know you have my phone give it back”. This is where he would usually give my phone back with a groan, but today he said “calm down, i don’t have it”. This terrified me. What would happen if i really lost it? My dad would kill me. Sure, he wouldn’t hit me but he would shout at me for being irresponsible. I squeaked out a “sorry” to B and plopped back into my chair. My mind was racing. Where could I have put it. My friend saw me looking and asked if i wanted her to call my phone for me. I quickly said yes and we waited for the phone to ring. Since this side of my school had terrible service, my phone didn’t ring. We would have to get a better signal to try again. The class was dismissed and i took one more look around the empty classroom to see if i saw my phone. I was almost late for my next class so i sadly walked away empty handed. The next class was Biology. Our teacher wouldn’t mind if i put on Find My IPhone from my computer just to see the location. It was in the History room. I hadn’t been in History yet. My anxiety was through the roof at this point. Who had it? Why would they take it for this long? Were they planning to make off with it? I asked my friend to text my phone. “I swear to god B if you have my phone all hell will break loose”. No reply. People who were in my algebra class told  me that B really did take it. They couldn’t do anything about it then because they still were taking the test. I was fuming. How dare he, a person I didn’t even like take my phone without asking me. Lucky for everyone, my next class was English, a class that me and B shared. Biology was dismissed and I stormed to the English room. I stood in the doorway looking at B’s smug face before I did the only thing i could think of. I took off my shoe and threw it directly at him with all of my strength, hitting him in the chest. “WHAT THE HELL?” he yelled at me. “THATS WHAT I WANT TO ASK! WHY’D YOU TAKE MY PHONE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY DID YOU LIE AND SAY YOU DIDN’T HAVE IT?” this kind of argument went forth until a teacher intervened “anyway, I want my phone back” i said, holding back tears of anger and frustration. “Oh, I don’t have it. The History teacher saw me playing with it and took it” at this point i was pushed off the edge. When a teacher confiscates something, it’s usually for a long time. My tears leaked out of my eyes and soon I was bawling in the middle of the classroom. Some of the other girls came over to console me “Wow you made her cry. What will you do now?” they taunted him. The English teacher had listened to the conversation and started to intensely scold B for taking someone else’s belongings. Especially something as important as a phone and that I could have charged him for theft. I’m the type that cannot stop crying once i start so i was just sitting there for the rest of class with tears running down my cheeks. At the end of class, the English teacher accompanied me and B to get my phone back from the History teacher. And now i have it back. I do feel bad for going as far as slapping him though.\n\nTLDR:\nA boy takes an anxious girl’s phone for two 60 minute class periods without saying anything to her and she slaps him with a shoe for causing her so much stress.\n\nSo Reddit: Am I The Asshole?",

So I [20F] and my girlfriend [18F] are in a long-distance relationship, with me living in America and her in New Zealand. She's in her first year of pre-med at university so of course, she's busy. I totally understand that going to class and studying takes priority. But yesterday she told me that she went clubbing the night before. She didn't give me any indication that she was going to be busy and thus, she left in the middle of conversation. She never initiates our conversations, no matter how long I wait for her to. So is this her being really busy and having fun with her friends and I'd be TA for calling her out on it or is she not giving me the attention I deserve and she's TA? ",

I now work in a different field but still stay in the political loop.\n\nIt is election seasons in my city and mayor is one of them.  Personally, I can’t stand the current mayor and know who I am voting for already.  My candidate has been very helpful with my neighborhood and she’s a friend due to her helpfulness.  Books are closed on the decision.\n\nMy husband, who didn’t grow up political or with most the benefits I did, really likes her too and wants to support her. Great.  So I come home two days ago and he asks if I want to go to the televised debate.  No - my mind is made up and I know how uninteresting this debate will be to me personally.  He says, well I told her yes and we have two tickets for it Wednesday night.\n\nUGH. I hate wednesdays. And this doesn’t help.  Not to mention as I’ve gotten older, I want to be home and in bed.  And on Thursday we have a slammed evening of socializing too.\n\nSo now, it’s cold out, I don’t really have a warm outfit proper for this event (I don’t even have a heavy coat because.... Florida), and I am going to have to fight traffic for an hour to get there, sit bored out of my\nmind for two hours and get home late. And I gotta wash my hair.\n\nIf we don’t go, it looks bad.

      "description": "I live with a female friend who I consider close like a cousin. She's a lot more open about her emotions than I am, and I don't mind listening to her talk, so we have a good dynamic. She has talked to me about her period in the past and it's always made me a little uncomfortable but I've never said anything because I don't want her and my friends to think I'm immature. I never really have a response to hearing about how people are on their periods besides 'oh' or '..that sucks'. \n\nI know it's 2018 and men are apparently not allowed to be grossed out by periods anymore. But I'm trans and the female reproductive system makes me hella dysphoric. I've wanted to have my reproductive organs removed since I was young and I've always been disgusted by the idea of pregnancy and childbirth. Now that I live fully as male I want 0% of anything to do with it.\n\nI have been spending a lot of time with another friend who is going to move into town. They are trans non-binary but have been talking to me a lot about their period and it's making me way more uncomfortable than when my female friend did it. They seem unbothered by the association of something pretty explicitly female like the functions of the female reproductive system, and don't feel the need to hide it from me. Not just mentioning it in passing, but talking about it multiple times a day and about detailed stuff like their cramps and being worried about leaking. \n\nI honestly don't know what they want me to say about it. Why do they want to talk to me about their bodily fluids? It's way to personal. I don't talk to anyone about the way I poop, why would I want to hear about your uterus wall lining shedding and discharging? The only reason I can think of that they feel the need to talk about it to me is that they think that I can understand and sympathize because I'm trans, and expect me to show empathy from experience. That is what really makes me uncomfortable. I stopped menstruating when I transitioned to male and I'm not interested in revisiting those experiences ever again. I don't want to be part of this female bonding ritual of empathizing about your periods. I feel like they are not granting me the same respect they would other men, by expecting me to understand and be ok with it, they aren't seeing me as a 'real man', but as some sort of man-lite or safe/non-toxic man because of my trans status. Or are my friends just letting off steam because they are frustrated and in pain, and they trust me enough to tell me about it? Am I being immature for not wanting to hear about it?\n\nI haven't done anything yet, but I'm considering asking them point blank to just don't talk about their periods to me. I might do this next time they barrage me with private information about their body that I didn't ask for. \n\nWIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking about their periods to me now, after I've given little indication that I'm uncomfortable with it?",

I could get the paid version to get rid of false positives, but I make a matter of principle to not pay for apps. \n\nI live in Mexico City, which was hit by two strong earthquakes in late 2017. After that, most people got at least a bit traumatized. Every time we get an earthquake warning we get almost triggered because... well, earthquakes. \n\nNow, a couple months ago I downloaded an app that is linked to a seismograph network and gives you a warning one or two minutes in advance of an earthquake so you can get to a safe place. \n\nThe problem is that the app has two levels of warnings: One for earthquakes in general, and another for earthquakes strong enough to cause damage. \n\nOf course, the first ones are a lot more common. Once or twice a month my cellphone will go off with a loud warning of \"Earthquake detected, low intensity\". In a year or so, I've never had a warning of an earthquake that poses actual danger. \n\nThat means everytime the alarm goes off me and my coworkers (if I'm at work) get a bit of a scare until the \"low intensity\" part comes through. Again, this happens around once or twice a month. \n\nI personally think it's better to have a lot of false positives than a single false negative, so I put up with that. However, some of my coworkers think the scares are not worth it. And the city has an earthquake warning system throug high volume speakers that, in theory, gives you a similar level of warning than the app. I just want the extra level of security here. \n\nNow, there is an option: The paid version of the app allows you to only receive warnings about earthquakes that are actually dangerous. But first of all, I don't like getting apps I have to pay for, as a matter of principle. And second, I think Google already has enough of my information to give them my finnancial information as well. So, I am entirely against paying for the app. \n\nSo... is it wrong if I'm willing to put up with some false positive but my coworkers are not so okay with that? Should I do without the app or pay for it?\n\n\nTL;DR: I got an earthquake warning app that sometimes gives false positives, which scare some of my coworkers. I could get the paid version to get rid of false positives, but I make a matter of principle to not pay for apps. ",

      "description": "So my extended family recently moved and are now basically neighbors with us, they used to live in another country. And now they and they're two kids, which I'll just give age ranges for anonymity sakes. (5-6 y/o boy, and 9-10 y/o Girl) The older girl is fairly well tempered and just occasionally gets a little annoying, to be expected, don't really mind her, she's cool. The other fucking kid though. This kid will SCREAM over anything, Has no respect for my space, even if I specifically tell him not go in my room, he doesn't give a shit, he's a whiney spoilt little shit, Entitled as fuck, lies, throws a tantrum when things don't go his way, I know I'm literally describing a 5 year old boy, but he's just so manipulative that just his presence irks me a little. I can't REALLY expect him to be different I guess, but the issue starts where they're here, EVERY-FUCKING-DAY. And I get back home from classes at like 7pm ish. And I don't wanna come home to screaming little shits, with the house in chaos with toys everywhere. I'm 18 years old for full context, I try to be mature and just let it slide and ignore it, but every now and then I lose it a little, and get a little pissy with them. I also feels it's on the parents a little bit for not taking into account how it affects me or my own parents. AITA For getting tilted with how often I see my cousins?",

I'm going to add a line to my dad's family plan and pay him per month because it is a lost cheaper than getting an individual plan. The phone company had a special for the past few weeks, where if you add a new line you can get a brand new 128gb iPhone 7 for $150 ($50 up front for taxes and then $4.16/month for 24 months because they give you the $21 credit/month). I would own the phone full and clear after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was going to buy the phone a week ago and then my dad tells me to wait because they are going to switch carriers. Long story short, today he tells me they aren't switching. Now the deal is gone and the same iPhone 7 would cost $18/month ($600). He tells me not to worry because he is going to upgrade to the iPhone XS. Right now there is a deal where if you upgrade a line and add a line (my line) you there is a buy one get one free deal with the iPhone XS (they give you a $31 credit/month to pay for it so it is free). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then tells me that his wife is going to take the free phone (which they are only eligible for because of the line I will start paying for) and I can pay her the trade in value to take her 2 year old iPhone 7 32gb. She owes $163 on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got frustrated. No yelling or anything like that. I just told him that it is annoying because I'd asked him about this for 2 weeks and they procrastinated and now they want me to pay them more money for a 2 year old phone with nearly 100gb less space than I would have for the brand new phone. Also, they are getting a free $1000 phone because I am paying for a new line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling entitled to either getting the used iPhone 7 for free or feel entitled to the XS phone?",

I said sure, since all my clubs (FBLA, Investing Club, DECA) ended a few weeks ago. It's not too serious as of now, and is more of just a fun thing, I guess. For example, a lot of guys are just wearing normal swim trunks, and a lot of girls are just wearing bikinis, even though that's not the official uniform.\n\nAnd that's where the problem comes in. Sarah is a bit insecure of this, and doesn't like that I'm spending every day after school playing water polo with a bunch of fit, half-naked girls. \n\nSo she asked me to quit. I just said I'm not going to, for a few reasons:\n\n1) Water polo is really fun \n\n2) I need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.\n\n3) Her demands are ridiculous and I don't think she should control what I can or can't do because of her jealousy. I don't tell her, for example, not to hang out with her guy friends. So I don't see why should be able to order me around. \n\nI feel like both of us just can't see the other side's logic, so aita?",

      "description": "So background on this: \nI have dated this person twice in the past. The first time was 2 years ago and then again from September to January. Neither time was very long, but we do have a connection that I havent really found with anyone else. He also lives on the other side of the country so we rarely see each other in person and because of that he seems pretty attached to me in texts. I also started at a new college this semester and he started school this semster too. \n\nOkay, so it was Feb. 14th and school had just started getting super busy and we had been broken up for over a month at this point. I was struggling to balance my school work and making new friends here and I had not talked to him in about 24 hours. At this point he sent me a paragraph saying that he was upset that I had not messaged him for a day and that I was not being considerate of his needs. I got irritated and told him that I didn't have time to deal with the issues right then, which set him off to write several more paragraphs about how I was going to move on with some other guy and never talk to him. Now I was very frustrated because this is something that he had done a lot while we were dating, and I had to turn off my location so he wouldn't get upset when I was not in my dorm. I snapped and told him I couldn't deal with him anymore and this was my busiest week of the semester so far and blocked him on snapchat. An hour later he called, and when I didn't pick up, texted me saying he just wanted to talk for a minute. I did not respond, and then he continued to dm me on Instagram, discord, and call me on skype over the course of the next few weeks. He has also reached out to my friend to try to figure out . He has been sending me  multiple dms on Instagram about 4 times a week and is saying I am dead to him for hurting him like this and then begging me to talk to him again. He has been counting the days since I've talked to him and saying that hes having awful nightmares because of what I did, and that I never cared about him and I've been endlessly lying. \n\nI have not responded to any of his messages or calls since I blocked him, and i feel like it would be petty to block him on everything, but mean to just keep ignoring him like I am. Thoughts?",

      "description": "Me and my usually gaming group were playing terraforming mars. For those that don’t know what that is the basic goal is to terraform mars and end with as many victory points as possible. Part of the gameplay includes things called generations where everyone takes turns going in a circle playing cards and using abilities. You go around as many times as you can until everyone passes and then the next generation begins. This was a bad game for me. Early on i drew basically only late game cards and mid game i drew cards that didnt do anything for me. About half way through the game i knew i had lost but i kept playing anyway. Then when the last generation started there was only two things i could do which were to build a city and a greenery. At this point I was upwards of 20vp behind everyone else and figured that there was not too much of a point in playing those two things so i passed my turn and let them finish up the game and went to play with the hosts cat since at that point i would have just been watching them play. When i did this i was scolded for being “that person” who quits the game when he knows that he has lost and everyone got really pissy with me. AITA for not staying at the table and finishing that last bit of the game? ",

      "description": "Hi, guys! I find myself in a pretty shitty situation and I'm not entirely sure if I am being an asshole or not. Here's the situation I find myself in.\n\nFirst a little backstory...\n\nI met my ex-boyfriend at my then thirteen year old sister's summer soccer league tournament (she turned fourteen in November). He was a few months from turning eighteen and was becoming a high school senior. I was just starting high school toward the end of August and had just turned fifteen a couple of weeks before. His game ended an hour before I met him and my sister's team took the field. He came over and introduced himself. He said about his sister playing on the same team as my sister and we struck up a friendship right there while watching our younger siblings play. We ended up seeing each other on a regular basis after that. We started the school year in August and we really didn't see bunches of each other besides at lunch when we'd sit at a table together but we'd get together after our respective practices (his being soccer and me for cheerleading and softball on the weekend).\n\nWe kept this up for the next four months where we'd do stuff together and be boyfriend/girlfriend. Eventually I'd lose my virginity to him thinking he was such a great guy. Granted we would fight...but it was nothing too serious and any issues we did have would be resolved pretty quickly.\n\nThat would change around Christmastime...\n\nA few days before Christmas break, we were sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch when he said to me about having to go to another city in our state to visit family for Christmas. I told him that it was fine and that we were having family over from out of state and out of the country (Japan) for Christmas. We agreed to do our gift exchange on Friday night and I'd sleepover at his place. We did the exchange Saturday morning before they left to head north. I got him the game Pro Evolution Soccer for his PS4 because he had said about wanting to play that since he's played so much FIFA and he wanted to try PES. He got me a couple of cheaper necklaces and a bunch of cheaper bracelets and anklets (some of which I wear on a pretty regular basis) which I thought was so cute. I left his place about an hour and a half before they were supposed to leave. We texted when he got to where he was going later in the day and we texted and talked on other social media clear up to Christmas evening. The 26th we didn't get to talk because we were busy with other family and I was busy talking with my cousins that I never met before from Japan. The girls and I were up until 3 in the morning talking and drinking 7up and sparkling grape juice in the spa. The morning of the 27th, I didn't wake up until 10 in the morning which is late for me. My texts had blown up asking me if I had seen what was going on, on facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. I didn't know what they were talking about. So I looked at my socials...and my now ex broke up with me over social media. Not only did he break up with me...he blocked me on all the social medias I had him friended on. I texted him and he told me that he didn't want to hook up with me anymore and wanted to hook up with a new sophomore cheerleader on the varsity squad. I was devestated. I cried and was sad for several days. I finally started feeling better around New Year's Eve and even went for a shopping spree with my cousins and sisters and I even got dreadlocks! January 2nd rolled around and we had to go back to school. I was glad to see my friends from school and just wanted to get back into the swing of school. My ex tried to talk to me several times but I kept ignoring him on the advice of some of my closest friends and my eldest sister. Finally, Friday, he decided to confront me asking me what my fucking problem was and why I was being such a bitch and not talking to him. I told him that I didn't want to be associated with someone who only decides to break up with someone over the internet instead of doing it face-to-face. He called me a bitch and an asshole. I continued to not talk to him for the rest of the day.\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to him after how he broke up with me?",

      "description": "Background: I (male) am good friends with both parties here. I’ve been friends with my buddy since Elementary school, and have been friends with his now-Wife for the last 6 or so years they’ve been together. \n\nThey got married last year. During the Bachelorette party and festivities surrounding it, some potential emotional infidelity came to light concerning the bride-to-be, as reported by my two sisters (who are also fairly well in our friend group and who were at said festivities). The bride-to-be had friends visiting from out of town, and her sister – all of them are close, open with each other. It came out that the bride-to-be has been seeing a guy friend she met from an indoor soccer league far more than anyone really knew. She had mentioned it, but the extent it went to was not known – hanging out multiple times a week (alone), talking on the phone for hours, etc. Then, everyone went out dancing at the clubs one night, guy friend was present, and some intense dancing with/ kissing of Mr. Guy Friend commenced. \n\nI should note a few things: 1. My buddy and his now-wife are very independent. They give each other space to kind of just let each other do their own things, be out with friends, etc. without checking in too often. They spend a lot of time together as well. IMO it’s a very healthy relationship and I believe strongly they love each other and wouldn’t jeopardize that. 2. His wife is very flirty, open sexually, and even a mild exhibitionist. Husband is not, but he is fine with her behavior. We all are used to it. \n\nAfter Kissing Night happened, my sisters told me everything, and said I needed to let my buddy know. They were not close enough to him to tell him themselves. They seemed convinced that she had cheated (beyond emotional infidelity), though didn’t have any “proof”. They know the bride-to-be’s sister was uncomfortable with everything that was going on, which was a red flag. My mom got involved too, she has known my buddy for years. I resisted initially – I lean heavily on the side of keeping people’s secrets. Plus, I don’t know what arrangement the two of them had. Who am I to judge a “hall pass” situation, or anything of the like? My family was strongly convinced though that this was not right, and that my buddy didn’t know, and the bride-to-be was uncharacteristically shy about detailing anything about Mr. Guy Friend. \n\nI ultimately decided to tell my buddy. Potential cheating or the behavior that could lead to it in the future was worth telling someone before marriage. But, AITA for not bringing it up to the bride-to-be first? She was also my friend… but for some reason I told my buddy first. He was aware of Mr. Guy Friend, but barely, and only strictly as a friend. I told him everything I knew, noting that IMO a lot of it was speculation, but was still worth him knowing. He didn’t seem surprised per se, or honestly much else other than calm, and asked that I keep it on the DL, lest the wedding be in jeopardy. I asked him if I could talk to the bride-to-be and let her know I told him, but he insisted he did not want me to talk to her, that he would talk to her about it and that was how he wanted it handled. So that was that. They got married, and things have been peachy ever since.\n\nExcept recently it came up that the now-wife, my friend, has been secretly holding a grudge against my sisters and I for this, and specifically for not coming to her first. I am considering telling her everything, that this wasn’t my idea, but especially that I was specifically asked not to talk to her about it. I guess… I’m feeling a little guilty for violating her trust. \n\n**So Reddit – Would you tell her, and… AITA?**\n\nTL;DR – Potential emotional (or beyond) infidelity comes to light during bachelorette party. I am recruited to tell the husband-to-be. Things blow over, life goes on as normal, but recently it comes up the wife, also my friend, has been holding a grudge against me for telling her husband. ",

I make enough money for us to live comfortably and he money goes 100% to whatever she wants.  \n\nShe was approached by an old client of hers,whom she used to babysit her kids before we got married and had a child of our own, to babysit from Monday starting at 2 til Tuesday 9 pm. It would involve spending the night because they will be out of town. \n\nNow I work 11 hours a day including commute, sometimes more depending on what’s going on at work. We talked about it and I was adamant on her turning down the job because we don’t need the money and it would involve having her family babysit for an extended amount of time both Monday and Tuesday and my daughter will be sleeping with just me which she has never done before. She’s 1 btw. \n\nAITA for not letting her work?",

      "description": "Setting: New Year’s Day, greasy little diner that serves breakfast and lunch\n\nPlayers: me, my boyfriend, our two friends\n\nWe walk in around 11:40-11:45 and are directed to seats by staff (this is important). The waitress (W) comes over, literally drops menus onto the table, and starts to walk away without saying a word. My friend asks her for coffees as W is turning away, and she just says, “Ok.” We thought that was rude, but whatever. We decide what we want quickly and, when W brings the coffee and my friend says we’re ready to order, W says, “Good.” Nothing else. Takes our orders in silence, takes our menus, no smile, no words, and walks away. We all can’t believe how unfriendly she’s being.\n\nIt’s 11:45-11:50 now. Someone else comes in and we hear staff (not W) say sorry, but they’re closing early for the holiday, and the new person leaves. Now W’s attitude makes more sense. We didn’t know we were coming in 20 minutes before closing, and we wouldn’t have stayed if we had known. If the staff who had welcomed us had told us, we would have found some other place to eat.\n\nOur food came—again accompanied by sullen silence—and we ate as fast as possible and got out of there. We left about 12:10-12:15. The original staff person saw us out. We apologized for keeping them late, and she smiled and waved it off.\n\nHere’s the question: Should we have left when we found out they were closing early? We already had coffee. Our food had been ordered but only just, so it wasn’t being prepared yet. Should we have cancelled the food, paid for the coffee, and left?",

      "description": "We've been very close for more than 2 years now. A few months back we started living in the same city after being apart for a year, and I was super excited and made all sorts of plans for the (8ish) months that our time here would overlap. We live around an hour from each other so weekends are the only time we can meet. During the first few months he was extremely busy and needed to be near his college even on weekends. So, I would usually travel there to spend time with him instead of vice versa. Not every weekend but usually twice a month. Once the hectic semester was done I expected him to come over to my place more often. But there was always some reason or the other that he could not make it. I'm nearing the end of my semester and I will leave the city soon so I consider each time together very important. Last weekend he said he'd come but completely forgot about it on the day. I was hurt and cried a lot on the phone with him because I'm really sad about leaving the city in general, I loved my life here and I'm going to miss everything, and I don't know if him and I will be living in the same city again in the near future. \nSo he promised he'd come the next day. \nHe forgot again. \nHe is generally a forgetful person and he had been having a rough few days. \nI called and told him how hurt I was and he said that our friendship is something that he wants for a lifetime and that I shouldn't base my closeness with him on the basis of this event, and that if only I'd reminded him in the morning he'd have come for sure. \nThis weekend he came down with the flu and couldn't make it. \nWe'd probably get one more weekend together before I leave, given how busy my end semester will be, I'm not sure when and how. \nI just feel really sad and I expressed that but now I've just let it go and I'm talking normally to him.\n\nAITA for feeling like he doesn't care about me?

I am also actively being spoken down-to publicly for mistakes (at lab meeting), while being denied private meetings to discuss them.   I put in my notice 2wks ago and my boss refused to accept it, citing that I \"was needed\".   1 week ago (during lab meeting) I was given a public dressing down that included phrases such as, \"if you have to ask this question, you don't belong here\" and told that I am still in training.  I have been with this job for 8 months. 3:40 am.  I am actively sitting in my office, prepping for today's Hell (lab meeting) and debating just packing up and going the fuck home.  AITA?\n",

He'd offer me gifts and money, and being young an naive I accepted. We were friends on Facebook- I've since deactivated- which is how I learnt he and his **wife** got **married in Disney land** while we were talking, and that she was **trying for a baby with IVF**. I found this especially shitty, as his wife (and I imagine him) dont have unlimited money and IVF is expensive. She could have spent several thousand trying for a baby with this man. \nAgain, being naive and admittedly an asshole I continued the exchange. Eventually last year aged 19 I cut him off, but not after sending him photos/videos  for money. \nI have email evidence he agreed to pay me for nude videos while I was an adult, but because I deleted facebook and the site I met him on since that's all I have.\nI also have PayPal statements going back to when i was a minor that are undeniably from him.\n\nIt's now been months, and I've entered my own relationship and realise his wife deserves to know. I dont know if she's still on IVF or if they've managed to conceive yet. I dont even know if she'd believe me. It would definately take a huge toll on their marriage and I own up to my share of the guilt for continuing it after finding this out.\nIf it makes a difference what he's sent me has to total nearly $500, and he never pressured me into anything or held it above my head.\n\nWIBTA if I made Facebook again to tell/show her evidence of her husband's financial/cyber affair?",

      "description": "  So, my friend (17F) has problems with depression. She's cutting herself for I don't know how long. She never been like this, it all started when she met a girl who taught her to do drugs (she smoked pot before, but now I'm not sure what else she's into.) I live far from her, so there is not much I could do for her on daily basis, but I got really scared when she started to talk about suicide. \n\nI'm not sure if she means it, it was always her kind of humor, but now? I sometimes hang out with her, many people do, so she's not alone, she can see that people care, but actually.. I don't know if they all really do. She spent her whole life in a small town, most of the problems began in the city, with those new friends, and I can't do anything about it. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she told me that she must correct some grades but she did not learn, because she \"doesn't really care.\" \nWell, yesterday we were texting and she was really angry about the fact that she didn't pass. She told me that it's making her feel even more like a piece of shit, and how she wants to just jump under the train, so I told her \"So how about actually learning, everybody would feel this way if they would be so lazy.\" She did not respond. I know that I shouldn't have said that, I was never depressed so I don't know what she's going through, but I just think that there is always a limit.\n\n\n\nPS: Now that I'm reading it, sorry, it's terribly written, all the \"she\" is giving me a headache but I don't know what can I use instead of it, my English is not that good.",

      "description": "So I’m deaf in one ear, and sometimes I’ll find myself waking up sleeping on my one good ear, so I won’t be able to hear my alarm. So in order to fight this, I set 3 alarms in case I don’t wake up to the ones before it. I have class at 9:15am so I set the alarms for 8:30-8:45. The problem is when they go off, my roommate will call my cellphone and hang up immediately to put the phone into snooze mode. He does this with every alarm that rings and today I missed my class because of it (I also woke up and eventually found my phone in my desk drawer). And it isn’t that he needs sleep and needs to wake up later, because he has class the same time as me. I could ask him to wake me up when he gets up but that would make me feel like a burden. When I confronted him about him making me miss class he went silent, told me to stfu and that I move when the alarm goes off (he thinks that I’m awake and that I ignore the alarm? Which I have no recollection of because if I was awake I would turn it off) and he left the room. Do I need to sleep earlier so I don’t require an alarm in the morning? Or just set a singular alarm? Though he would just end up turning that one off, and I’d have nothing to wake up to.  Am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "I was having coffee with a Mom gal pal of mine. Her husband and my guy both work as chefs at the same business. It's one of those members-only club dealios. One of the servers has been there for 30+ years. He's established a shit ton of rapport with the guests after so many decades. The guests also like to give gifts whenever the mood strikes. \n\n\nMy Mom friend thinks it's unfair that he's always getting attention and gifts from the members. For example, a common gift will be tickets to an event, sport game, etc...\n\nShe feels upset because he'll share the tickets with his family instead of dispersing them among other employees, i.e. her husband. Her words were something along the lines of, \"everyone else shares their gifts with the other employees, but He always just takes them for him and his family\n I think it's just selfish.\" \n\nNow, she is right that most of the other employees will share their gifts with other employees. However, usually when back of the house gets gifts its rarely ever to anyone in specific and just given to whomever hasn't enjoyed a perk yet. Also, most of the people she's referencing that shares their \"gifts\" are relatively new employees. I'm talking under 2 years. She also mentioned something along the lines of, \"It's not fair because He works where he can talk directly to the members and (her husband) is always in the back.\"\n\nNow, my responses to her have been things like, \"first off, your husband is an executive sous chef. Even though the server has been there 30 years, your husband was hired on making a hefty salary, a lot more than that server. And that's the price of being a chef, you work back of house. Kinda hard to do your job if ya ain't in the kitchen. I could be wrong though. Also, if I was working there or anywhere for 30+ years, I would absolutely be sharing with my family. Instead of constantly sharing everything with employees who come and go. Our guys have only been there a year and a half at this point. Aaaand, we still get unexpected tickets to things. I think after 3 decades, he should be able to enjoy himself without having to explain anything.\"\n\nI dont know. I've always been a firm believer that when there's any kind of gift giving from a customer to an employee, that entitlement really needs to take a back seat. I could be wrong. I just dont see why anyone would waste their time getting huffy over preferential treatment if you get to enjoy things sometimes too. \n\nI dont know. Critique me, maybe I'm biased or ignorant or something *shrug*",

I don't know &amp; I am not going to kick anyone out of the guild for that...keep in mind when &lt;Paul&gt; did &lt;bad action&gt; to &lt;former Guild A founder/Susan&gt; &amp; you being an officer no one moved a finger...and you are chastising me for not kicking someone that Your guild made angry...? I don't think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: if that's how you want your guild to be represented, sure - I'm not chastising you &amp; I'm saying \"you\" in reference to &lt;Guild B&gt; not you personally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: - I link the rules specifically stated in the &lt;Guild B&gt; Charter: - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe warned this is  not &lt;Guild A&gt; so shall not speak of them in this guild, we are not a part of them anymore and we shall not try to dare talk bad about them either keep in mind this is just a game, if any of their members try to badmouth you or this guild, report it to an Officer or Lowcat and we will take care of the situation, for the people with friends there its fine they are your friends\n\nGuild Rules\n\n1.)

Just as you told me when &lt;Susan&gt; thingy happened... Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: except I have a detailed history, with screenshots of the \"&lt;Susan&gt; situation\"\n\nand the interpretation of the situation might be a difference of opinion\n\nbut record exists that can be cited.\n\n\"&lt;Me&gt; bullied me out of the guild\"\n\nis hearsay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: Maybe in his opinion you did.

      "description": "I know there’s a debate on whether FEELING something makes one the asshole, but I plan on going into therapy when I get older and I’m probably going to hear a lot of crazy and unreasonable stuff. It’s just that I don’t want to make this behavior okay in the present when it will not be in the future. So, do I need to change my way of thinking, or allow myself to feel whatever I want to feel?\n\nSo, I’m in a group of friends (4 Fs) on campus. Recently we added another member (M) to our group. One of the old members (let’s call her Laura) has a crush on the new guy (Matt). It’s obvious Matt likes her back. They have a lot in common, they’ve taken to teasing/play-fighting with each other pretty quickly, and they stay up all the time talking to each other. They have both discreetly admitted that they’re too afraid to do/say something. \n\nLaura has been expressing to the rest of us that she’s too stressed for a relationship (her first one) and might want to have a go with Matt in a few months. But she interprets the group’s encouragement as peer pressure which adds to her stress. I have so so so so so so so so SO many times told her that she can move at her own pace, no one is SERIOUSLY forcing her to make a move. It’s getting to the point where I’m ignoring her “whines” when she vents to us ladies over text. Tonight my phone kept going off while I was driving with her cries of help. Apparently instead of waiting like she said she wanted to do, Laura texted Matt her feelings. I think it’s great that she did that so Matt’s not hanging, but why did it take 50 messages for me to receive this information? OR, why didn’t she just wait until she was ready, or for Matt to say something (he has also never been in a relationship), instead of piling up her stress? \n\nI am pretty sure I can hold back my irritation with some humor, but should I be irritated in the first place?

      "description": "I'm a junior in college, my sister is a senior in high school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got home from school for winter break on Sunday. My sister was out when I got home, so I didn't see her, and I ended up going to bed before she got back. Monday, she left for school before I woke up, so I didn't see her then either, nor did I see her that evening because she was working (note that I have not left my house since I got here). During this time, I didn't hear from her at all - the last meaningful communication I had with her was a couple weeks ago, when she texted asking if my boyfriend would buy weed for her friend group. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this afternoon. I am at home alone (entire family is at work/school) when I hear someone *pounding* on the window of our front door. It's my sister and her boyfriend, who just pulled up after leaving school early. This is the first time I have seen her since I got home. I let them in and say, \"Dude, where's your house key? You freaked me out.\" My sister responds aggressively, \"I *left* it in my *room.*\" I try to make some half-assed joke about her driving around with out a house key on her key ring, which prompts her to yell \"*SUCK MY FUCKING DICK, OKAY?*\" immediately before going upstairs to her room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, I have been in a bit of a shit mood since then, as it really hurt my feelings that my little sister does not apparently care at all about seeing me for the first time in months. She asked me why I seemed so \"grumpy\" as I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, and I explained to her that I was mad that she has either been ignoring me or actively being mean to me. She responded by going off on me for not being understanding of her busy schedule, saying that I could not have possibly expected her to say hi to me last night when she got home from work because she needed to go to bed (she got home at 9:30 PM and, while I do not know exactly what happened, I really doubt that she went straight to bed). I rolled my eyes at that, but said okay, and she once again immediately stormed off to her room after yelling, \"You can roll your eyes all you want but you're still a dick!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for calling her out and saying that she upset me? Or for my reaction to her excuse? Or for not saying hi to her when I first opened the door? She's clearly pissed at me but I really feel like she has zero reason to be mad, especially when it seems to me that she was the dick in the first place. Enlighten me, please!",

      "description": "My girlfriend (25 year old female) and I (23 year old male) got in a bit of a fight last night. It was a Friday night and she worked the next day so she had decided to stay in for the night after 9 and I had plans with some friends. We live together and I try not to leave her alone on these nights because she also has trouble falling asleep alone. On this particular night I had called her to check if she wanted to come out for a bit and she said no because of work but said she understood it was a Friday and that she wouldn’t expect me home and that we could spend tomorrow together. This is usually how approach Fridays unless she really needs me to stay in or is feeling anxious. Anyways later in the night around midnight she texted me asking where I was. I was in the middle of deciding whether to stay out or come home and I was leaning towards just coming home and texted her saying I’d be home in 30 minutes. I realize I shouldn’t have said something like that before I was sure that was my plan. within 1 minute I sent a text saying she should try to go to bed and that I may stay out for a bit longer than 30 minutes. She had texted me immediately after my first text saying she was glad because she had watched a scary movie and that she wanted me home, but after seeing my follow up text thought I was just throwing her to the side for something else that came up. She called me and as I explained I was just going to be out for a little longer she got angry and hung up. I tried to call her back and felt bad so I was trying to just tell her I would come home in 30 minutes but she ignored both my calls so I basically said fuck it and stayed out for an hour. A full hour and 15 minutes after our original conversation at the bar I was home and she was frustrated feeling I had tossed her to the side to stay out and she said I should post it on reddit so here we are. My question isn’t should I have communicated better I definitly shouldn’t have told her 30 minute .My question is Am I the Asshole for texting her back trying to correct it and staying out for an hour when our original plan was for me to be out all night? \n\nShe is an amazing person and I love her not looking for anything bad about her really just want to know if I’m being an Asshole.

      "description": "First off I’m on mobile so sorry if there’s any formatting errors or anything like that. Secondly I’m sorry for the long read, tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI dated my ex for two years, through junior and senior years of high school and then a little into college. We had a great relationship. Minimal arguments and the ones we had were solved in mature ways, healthy time spent together and not trying to get in the way of each other’s friendships, understanding that time had to be spent with other people, great memories made etc.\n\nAfter we got to college the distance really affected us. We’re both collegiate athletes, and with sports, classes, social lives, and time zone differences, it became really hard to get the time to talk that we wanted. We lost a fair bit of communication, and it really did take a toll on the relationship. \n\nEventually she started doing things that I thought were counterproductive to her being successful (I know, this sounds like something an asshole would say, but we both took our schooling and athletics seriously and liked to keep each other accountable). She would stay out super late partying on the nights she had big tests, she picked up cigarettes, and she started having guys that she would let crash in her dorm after nights of drinking. This made me uncomfortable and I did get angry but we were able to talk through it. Even though I wasn’t happy about it I trusted her.\n\nOne night, after the distance had really brought us to a breaking point, I called her and she was out partying the night of a midterm. I said she didn’t seem like the person I knew and she just said “I guess I’ve changed.” I ended it right there. About a week later, one of my good friends, who attends the same school as her, had told me she was already sleeping with other guys. A month later she started dating another guy and was making posts talking about how much she loved him and things like that.\n\nA year and half went by and out of nowhere I get a text from her asking if I wanted to talk about things. She said she didn’t like the way it ended and was scared she’d have a panic attack if we saw each other in person during any of our school breaks (our hometown isn’t small but we have a lot of mutual friends and we frequent the same places).\n\nI wasn’t too keen on the idea. I didn’t have any hard feelings about the breakup itself, I knew it had to happen, but the way she moved on and how fast she had done it, coupled with the person she had become, had made me a little bitter towards her. I told her that there had been plenty of opportunities for us to bump into each other and it had never been a problem before so why was she worried about it now? I then called her out for how quickly she moved on and how shitty of a person she had just seemed to become.\n\nI never contacted her again and she hasn’t tried to contact me yet, but I get this feeling that I should have tried to be a better person and meet with her to talk about it. AITA for not doing that?\n\ntl;dr Broke up with girlfriend of two years after we couldn’t handle long distance and she changed from the person I used to know. She started sleeping around immediately and moved on very quickly. She tried to contact me a year and a half later to talk about it and I refused, being kind of a dick about it.",

I started dating my boyfriend in 2017 and the first year together I became flakey when playing.  Well now that we live together and I’m used to his company I’ve gone back to playing every Thursday.  I’ve been playing with these same mates for years and we like to have a couple pitchers and food after our games and shoot the shit.  My boyfriend suddenly got Thursdays off and has been coming to my games.  Yet when I score a goal or look at him at any point he isn’t paying attention usually on his phone or drawing.  Then we go out afterward and he will make comments such as “do we have to go” and “ok but we need to leave by ___” and while we are there he will seem very bored which distracts me from having a good time.  Am I wrong for wanting to ask him to sit out for these games and outings?  I feel like it is my me time and only time out without him.  If I felt he was there for support I think it would be different but I sometimes feel like he wants to babysit me when out with my team.  ",

      "description": "For context I’m a 22 year old female and I would consider myself decently attractive-ish? As a result I regularly have guys come up to me in all kinds of bars and clubs offering me drinks, which I’m totally okay with as long as I watch the bartender make it and it goes straight to me to avoid any tampering.\n\nWell I recently let it slip to my mom and she got upset with me, saying that I was taking advantage of them. I never thought of it that way because:\n\na) I’m not going out of my way to demand drinks from them.\n\nb) I am always aware that there is a risk of them slipping something into the drink- it isn’t an ‘innocent’ gift!\n\nc) I am already being grabbed by them &amp; propositioned, so might as well get something for my troubles aha.\n\nSo am I really an ass like my mom says for accepting drinks from guys and not giving them my number/sexual favours etc.?",

      "description": "I’m 21 years old and I work as a direct support professional in a single staff group home for people with developmental disabilities. Being single staff means you’re on your own to get everything done. My typical work schedule is:\n\nSunday 7am - 9:30pm\nMonday 2:30pm - 9:30pm\nTuesday 8am - 9-30pm\nThursday 8am - 1pm\n\nBecause of a massive snowstorm, I got stuck yesterday at work and am still here. I didn’t get to sleep and I’m still working till someone gets out here at 9:30am. I’ve been working straight since 7am yesterday. There’s a policy when stuff like this happens stating that there need to be an 8hr gap before I come back. My manager asked if I would come back at 5:30pm and stay till 9:30pm. I told her no because I live half an hour away and have things I need to get done today even though I’m so exhausted. \n\nI won’t see my manager face to face till Tuesday. Because I had to go out and shovel snow multiple times yesterday and today at 3am, I’m already not feeling all too good. I’m willing to do my Tuesday shift but think I might call out on Thursday.\n\nMe calling out on Tuesday isn’t really ample time for her to find someone to cover my short shift on Thursday. The home I work in is up a mountain and most people live in town the weather on Thursday is also going to be cold but at least there won’t be more snow. \n\nWould I be an asshole for calling out on a short shift after working an over 24 hour awake shift? \n\nHonestly I’m kind of worried about driving home since I’m so tired but I can’t wait to leave",

      "description": "Looking for some sort of confirmation regarding my in-laws.\n\nFirst off, my so is on the same page. Her family live about 50 mins away from us. We don't regularly visit because in general we don't feel welcome. We value hosting, serving people drinks and food when they come over and conversing.\n\nMy in-laws are nothing like this. They will just hang at the tv, not talking and just not caring for us being there.\n\nA breakdown of how her family lives right now:\n\nDad - Hard worker, not really involved but not a bad person at heart.\n\nMom - Quite a spiteful person. Making bad remarks about my gf's weight a lot (she isn't even overweight). Doesn't give 2 sh*ts about what's going on with her daughter's personal life and most of the time tries to emotionally blackmail us into coming over more. We don't oblige often because we think it's a waste of time because of said disinterest.\n\nSister - Spends a lot of time at our place. Bit of a 50/50 of wether she's in a good mood or not. Tends to agree with their mother on a lot of subjects that involve us.\n\nBrother - Like father, not overly involved but may sometimes make a weird remark.\n\nBrother's GF - Now this is were the sh*t hits the fan. She has been living with them for 2 years now, absolutely leeching off of them like a parasite. The family doesn't have a lot of money so they ask for 50 euro's a month to help cover expenses. She never pays on time, of she even pays at all while she bought a car last week for over a 1000 euro's. She's never in a good mood, always nags and apart from the occasional joke is not a fun person to be around.\n\nAll in all this frustrates us to the point were I made a point of going NC. I have taken care of myself since I was 16 and seeing a family so disfunctional and being leeched off of while I'm getting talked back to for not wanting to participate in big family happenings has drawn a wedge between us and her family.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I did not force my opinion on my SO. She has the same standing based on her being with me.\n\nTl;dr SO has disfunctional family which annoys me to the point of not wanting to have contact. Am I (or are we) the asshole?",

But I had always looked up to her and wanted to hang out with her and seen her as a role model because she’s really smart and motivated and genuinely a good person. \nBut about 5 or 6 years ago now (i think I can’t remember) she started seeing this guy I never liked. He was here illegally and was clearly using her at the beginning and had a severe drinking problem and 0 personality and she was practically running his business for him (getting him clients, taking calls, setting things up for him.) She would constantly argue with him about his drinking and would cry on the phone with him if she was over because he wasn’t putting in the effort to keep his business alive and was generally taking advantage of how much she was willing to baby him. As if all of this wasn’t enough the came home to her one night and strangled her so hard she thought her life was in danger so she ran out of the house and called my dad sobbing, so we went to pick her up. She had bruise marks on her neck and was clearly shaken and stayed with us for weeks before she went back to him because they went to church and prayed together. My attitude immediately soured and I started to realize things I didn’t like about her. I felt hurt, and frustrated but I was only 17 at the time so I was in no position to tell someone that was almost 30 what to do with her life but I couldn’t help but feel betrayed in a weird way. As time went on I realized she was just making excuses for him, would make backhanded homophobic comments and both her and her now husband would be standoffish at best with me or downright rude with me if i was at my parents house the same time as them.\nMy parents think I’m an asshole for not wanting anything to do with them and for leaving the house if they’re coming over with their kids, but I’m still angry at him for ever laying hands on her no matter how long ago it was and with her for staying in an abusive relationship. Am I in the right here or should I try to mend this.",

      "description": "(Sorry about format in advance)\nSo this is something that just happened and is weighing on me. I am the closing manager where I work and we have a front lobby and delivery. My lobby closes an hour earlier than delivery. Tonight I got an order for pick up about ten minutes before my lobby closes. The promise time for them to be here to get it was five minutes after close. (So if they placed it at 11:50 and we close at 12, the computer told them to be here by 12:05) which is no big deal just annoying. So when the time rolls around when they're supposed to be here they haven't shown up. I decide to give benefit of the doubt thinking maybe they're running late and keep my door open just ten more minutes. It is now 15 minutes after my lobby is supposed to be closed and they still aren't there. I decided to give them a call to check in and see if they still wanted their order, were down the road, etc. I got sent straight to voicemail and couldn't leave a message since their inbox was full. I decided to lock my front door. They then show up 30 minutes after close, about 15 minutes after I tried calling, and start banging on the door. I mime to him that we're closed and he needs to call. I now notice he has two very young children with him. He tells me he has an order for my store which I let him know the whole deal about calling him and staying open late and whatnot. I also inform him I'm not allowed to unlock my door after it's locked per company policy. He's now very upset (understandably) and I tell him I could switch his order to a delivery since I still have it. He asks if I can just \"deliver\" it to my location and I told him I'm not allowed to do that (in the past my big boss has told me we aren't allowed to do that after a similar situation). So he agrees and I switch it for him and tell him it will be sent out as soon as my driver gets back from a delivery he is already on. The man proceeds to sit in his car for about 10 minutes until my driver got back and tried to ask my driver if he would hand it out the door to which I told the driver no we aren't allowed to do that. And my driver ended up taking it to the guys house. \nSo I just want to know if anyone else who works in food/customer service or managers think aita. I know as just a human this is super shitty to do, but as an employee is this justified. Would it be more or less justifiable if he didn't have young children with him? I'm really torn between my morals and company rules. \nTl;dr I didn't let a man get his food after we were closed even though I had it because it was against the rules.",

Averaging 2 years a house. Ive had to deal with their fuck ups. Ive had to cash in my bonds for them. Im stressed about having to move every year. I was put on the back burner. Which i was fine with because the less shit they have to worry about the better. But the second i want something, im told it cant happen. I need a new SSC. Can't find the time to do so. New shoes? Can't find the time to do so. Ask for more healthy food instead of seeing cookies everytime they come back from the store. Nope. Ive seen their bank account because i have my own sub account for my money in their. Their is definitely enough for a pair of sketchers. Im accounting money for rent or unforseen medical bills and such.\n\nAm i the asshole for wanting a life? ",

      "description": "So a little back story on this. Recently became single and reached out to some old friends to try to rebuild my social life. One of these is an ex, we’ll call her Ashley, of mine that we’ve managed to stay good friends over the years. She introduces me to a friend of her’s, we’ll call her Sara, to basically knock the rust off of my single game. Sara and I end up talking a little bit but I quickly realized she wasn’t my type and moved on. Well after this she became extremely two face and bitchy towards me and Ashley. So I completely cut her out and my ex does what she can but it’s complicated. \n\nFast forward to last night. I get a text from Ashley asking me to call her. Call her up to see what’s wrong because normally she would just call me without worrying about texting. She starts a long story on how Sara is screwing up. She basically disappeared for 3 days and left her kid with her ex’s parents, that she lives with, to go party at the coast with her new boyfriend. Well her ex’s parents have kicked her out but is letting her kid stay with them. Ashley asks me is Sara could stay with me while she figures everything out since I have an extra bedroom. I flat out say no. She understands but still has to deal Sara for several reasons and is having a hard time not being nice about it. \n\nSo now I’ve had time to think about it and while I’m not changing my mind, I also don’t know what to do outside of her staying with me. \n\nTL;DR. Friend ask me if another friend could stay at my place for a few weeks with they figure shit out. I said no",

      "description": "First post here so hopefully it's not the wrong format etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about 2 years now. We see each other every month or so during a weekend. Because we're both in college and usually have busy schedules with classes and homework etc., we set up scheduled call times, shorter ones on Tuesday and Thursday, and longer ones on Friday and Saturday nights. We said we would call at 8/9 on Friday/Saturday Nights. We agreed that these were to be nights for just us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, starting from last Friday, I got really sick, and only today (Thursday) I'm starting to feel better. So, my girlfriend and I decided that it would be good if we didn't call on Friday and Saturday, and I just rested to feel better. During the period while I was sick, I still gave my best effort to call and ask about my girlfriends activities, classes, etc., but it was a bit less than if I wasn't sick. Most of the time I was just in bed feeling crappy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the main part of the AITA is that I'd been planning a get together with friends, and the only time that all of them could get together was this Friday, during the night (and thus during our scheduled calling time). I have depression and Hashimoto's, so I thought this would be a good chance to break out of that (I haven't been hanging out with people lately). The last time I asked my girlfriend whether it was ok if I did something during our call time, she got furious with me. So, this time, I was feeling quite anxious about asking her, yet today I did (another reason why I didn't ask her earlier is because I thought I might not even go, since I was feeling very sick).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I asked her was the following: Would it be ok if I hung out with friends during Friday night, but to make up for it, called more today (thursday), and earlier on Friday, as well as later in the night on Friday, around 10. And if those didn't work, another later time that worked for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I asked her, she got extremely upset and furious. She started telling me that I hadn't been texting the past last week a lot, and that I am putting hanging out with friends above her. To this, I said that I wasn't putting it over her, just that this is the only time they could meet, and that I was trying to make up for it by calling more today (thursday) and at different times on Friday. She was adamant that since Friday was scheduled, it's scheduled no matter what, and extremely pissed off, berating me and saying \" i cant tell you what you can or cannot do so do whatever you want\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for asking to hang out with friends during a scheduled calling time? (Let me know if you need more Info).",

      "description": "I posted before on here with a lost throwaway account, btw this is also a throwaway account because I think some of my friends are Redditors as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so context, my group and I have been playing together for almost 2 years this April or May over discord and the website Roll20. About six months ago we had one player leave for various reasons, we had spoken with this player multiple times to correct his behavior before we booted him. We ended up replacing him with a friend of mine from another game. \n\nCast\n\nMe=Me\n\nBF=Best friend who was here since the beginning\n\nNP=New Player\n\nF1= Friend 1\n\nF2=Froend 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so while I was doing something else other than hanging out on Discord BF, NP, F1, and F2 were hanging out on discord together. This story is second hand so I'll only be telling the consistent details from everyone's accounts. So BF was talking about some game or anime he was watching or playing when NP said, \"That's gay.\" F1, who is bi, calls him out for it as homophobic, rightfully so I might add. NP said \"Get a sense of humor it was just a joke.\" Not the best defense and one I was definitely critical of. When F1 told me about it I offered to talk to NP about it, but F1 told me to just leave it. So I respected F1's wishes and told him I would just watch for it in the future, it never happened again. Cut to a month later and we're discussing a one shot around a piece of kids media, BF, NP, and I share a couple of old jokes about it when F1 comes in with a moral crusade about how we shouldn't make fun of the Kids media and that NP is basically the devil for it, even though BF and I were in on the jokes. Then there was the time F1 picked a fight with NP over how he was calculating his dice rolls, it basically ended up being the same but because it was different than how the book said to do it he accused NP of cheating, even though he should have gotten my attention since I was in the discord chat but working on another project at the time so I had tuned them out since they were getting along before I got to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's what led up to the event of the evening. F1 had contacted me about how he and F2 were not getting along with NP. I had spoken with F2 before about this and she had told me she was fine with him, about a month before the event and 5 months after the start of the feud. I checked with F2. She confirmed that since NP made that gay joke SIX MONTHS ago she felt uncomfortable around him but didn't want to say anything since he was my friend. I begrudgingly accepted that if they both felt this way I would boot NP. Then when I joined NP's game after booting him I found out from BF that F1 had tried to corner him over text in DMs and used him to gauge my own response so he can tailor his message to something I could appreciate. I saw red at how he used my friend and kept that conversation out of my sight. A few more details about this incident but character limit. You may want to ask for INFO.",

Overall, she's a nice person and I don't wish any bad on her at all.\n\nFor the past 2 months, my gf has been starting to go out more frequently with her (female) friends. It would be a \"girls night\" so I never got to tag along. I never had an issue with it since she had been doing that since we met, but she also started to dress a lot more differently. \n\nShe went from modest clothing to more revealing stuff. It first started with an extra deep cleavage, short thight jeans etc. I told her this made me uncomfortable but she started getting defensive, accused me of not trusting her, telling me \"a bit of skin\" (that was more then a bit imo) is alright and that I have no right to object against her way of clothing. A week or something later, she went more daring as in her underwear visible, sideboob etc. At that point I told her I'm not going to force her to change, she has indeed the right to chose  her clothings. But I also have the right to choose. I told her I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone wearing that publicly. She got mad at first, then started crying as I left and later got hateful messages of her friends that I was too controling. (I believe I gave her all the freedom I could at this point since it wasn't my business anymore)\n\nTl;Dr. Gf wears more revealing clothing with sideboob, see through skirts etc. As I don't want to force her to change, but neither want to be with someone who dresses like that, I broke up with her.

The one who can’t get along is pretty bossy and wants things done her way even though we are all adults and can make our own decisions.\n\nSo my friend always talked about how she wanted to get married and start a family first before any of us. We all are in pretty serious relationships except for her. She jumps around a lot and doesn’t really commit to one person. So my boyfriend and I got engaged and everyone was so happy except for my friend. She goes on a meltdown about how I’m rude for getting engaged first and how she was supposed to get this moment before us. So we plan our wedding and ask our friends to be in the wedding party and everyone says yes except for her. So because she was acting like that I took her off the invite list and didn’t invite her. She became so mad and didn’t speak to me for months. \n\nSo one of my other friends get engaged and we all go out to celebrate including her and she’s ticked at me the whole time. Her current relationship and her had just called it quits and she was the only single one. So because it was an engagement dinner, one thing we wanted to do was look at her ring. They then asked to look at mine to just compare for fun and she gets so mad about this. She starts making comments about how ugly it is and how I don’t deserve it. Since then I’ve pretty much cut her out of my life. I still see her at events with my friends but that’s about it. Am I in the wrong for this? Should I not wear my ring around her to not hurt her feelings? I can’t do that. I love my ring too much and it’s too important. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm 22, and I recently got a DWI. I'm now(or maybe not) living with my dad, and my stepmom. I no longer have my car, I have to figure out how to make money, and move forward. I've had a job 3 YEARS, and he want's to kick me out because I want to go back to work. I have a ride there and back, he has to do nothing to help me get there. It affects him in no way.\n\nI have been given set rules, be home by 12 ect.. I follow them. A rule was get a job, I've got ALOT of court fees coming up. I HAVE a job. I have HAD IT 3 YEARS, and I make GOOD money, and these people are my family. My manager has worked with me these past two weeks since the event, keeping my name on schedule, and open to ANY shifts I can make it too. She wants to help me no matter what and has left my name up, even when I went to jail for 3 days, she simply told me she's glad I'm okay. My grandma wants to bring me to work in the morning, and I will always have a ride back. This is only Tuesday and Wednesday. Two days a week from 9:30 to 5. Any other job, and I am getting a second one here like he wants, is going to be a bus commute and me asking for rides and figuring out what to do, and waiting to be hired and I'm okay with that.\n\nBUT. This job is solid, and I'm guaranteed to start working immediately and have income. My dad is saying he will kick me out if I choose to work here. He claims it's his rules and to my grandma he is \"helping her, and she needs to be humble follow my rules and listen too me.\" There's no real reason.They aren't home then. They don't have to take me. It affects them in no way. My own grandma is against him in this, her son. Helping me would be letting me go to work, not taking away a job I've had three years. My attorney even said I should maintain this job.\n\nI had to call my manager tonight, to tell her I can't go in tomorow because of this, and he SCREAMED AT ME in the background, she heard, and she was just trying to go to bed. It was awful. I told her I'll call her tomorow. I told him earlier in the day I was going to work, and he didn't say I couldn't. He didn't act this against it, UNTIL my step mom stepped in. Then threatened him. She took the kids away this evening over it. She also lied about me screaming at her, I have video evidence proving otherwise. She began this entire situation and can't be told anything she doesn't like. She's awful. She told me have a job, by the end of the week. I had this in a day. This job has nothing to do with the trouble I got in. That was in two entirely different cities, ACROSS a ferry system. This is a different place, I would go straight to work and back. Yet he wants to kick me out over it. I'm kinda prepared to let him no matter how hard things will be on me. I'm currently at my grandmas, thinking about what to do. I told him he was wrong and kick me out over it, but we are both talking to him tomorow.\n\nI'm trying my best. I don't understand. So reddit.. am I really wrong? AITA?",

      "description": "I (20F) live with 2 families in one plot( main house and a separate entrance to another smaller house at the back).\nI personally don't mind this because we live relatively peaceful but I am not happy here. \n\nI am the first of my family to go for a degree(1 and a half years left) and my mother is basically pushing for me to become the breadwinner once I graduate. I also wouldn't have minded this but I have been living in what seems like a prison since my stepdad has stayed with us. He pays all our bills and has paid for my education but he has this absolutely infuriating outlook on life that whatever he says is right. If I have friends over it is a problem and as such I hardly have anyone over, and any guys I do know is just out to be in my pants according to him. If I go out to the movies or anywhere really my curfew is so early that sometimes it doesn't even feel worth it. I appreciate what he has done for me and my family but I cannot keep living like this.\n\nIt does not help that our religion is really against allowing a woman to do anything for herself (Islam, but it could be a society/cultural thing). \nI have been in a long distance relationship for about 2 years now and I have decided that I want to stay with him because my boyfriend is genuinely the only place I get my happiness from these days and he does all he can to keep me happy. I feel like I have too much pressures on me and I just want to be able to start over and actually live and my boyfriend is my ticket to freedom.\n\nI am feeling guilty for wanting to do this because my mom is sick with an unstable heart and stresses really easily, and my family is not very wealthy at all. It is really overwhelming because my country is also developing into a shit show.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I leave in the near future?",

      "description": "So a woman and I have been dating for the last 4 weeks. Valentines is always the toughest holiday to navigate for a new relationship. So last weekend we had a date where she drove up to me and we went out to one of my favorite restaurants. She was a little hangry but things settled down once we ate and had a little bit to drink. \n\nThat night as we were heading to bed (she fell asleep on my lap) she got a text that apparently an ex of hers had died of a drug related overdose. She tells me about their relationship and how he was engaged and got married during the two years they were together. It all seemed like an odd thing to disclose but I tried to be open minded as it was in the past. About an hour later she said she wanted to go home because she couldn’t sleep, so off she went. Because it all seemed odd, I had the intuition to check the app we met in and low and behold she had checked it during our date. That bothered me. By early the next morning I checked again in case I dreamt it, and she had checked again back in her town. \n\nSo here I am feeling pretty down about myself about all of this, but by the Monday I asked her pretty casually that if she was free l would want to take her out on Thursday if she was ok with it being sorta late as I have an obligation every Thursday til about 8. \n\nAs I was wrapping up, I messaged her if she would be ok meeting up at the place for 9 and she freaks. Apparently I’m weird for wanting to meet her there versus pick her up. My thinking was that I’d rather spend as much time as possible in the bar with her versus navigating traffic etc. but when she pointed it out I felt bad as I clearly wasn’t thinking fully about it and I realized I f’d up. She said she’d rather just wait till Saturday to do something. So I hadn’t heard from her Friday or Saturday, so I reached out about 4:00 to see if she wanted to meet up still and she said she wanted more time. \n\nSo AITA or is there more going on and should just cut my losses.

      "description": "So, to explain what’s happening.\n\nWhen I let my GF, she was overweight but was working hard at losing it.\n\nWe became friends, and one thing led to another, became fuck buddies and before I knew it we were dating. She is about 8 year older than me (note that she hide her age from me, but I found out).\n\nMy housemate left, so I invited her to take his room, knowing she would sleep in mine anyway.\n\nI always had a bit if an issue with her behavior. She is very nice to me but can get quite annoying « Karen Style » with other people. For example she was pissed at a taxi driver one time because he didn’t knew where was the place we were looking for.\n\nAh, and sometimes she would be annoying as well when she gets her periods, in that case I wouldn’t be spared. But she is not like this every time... I guess other factor weight in.\n\nOne time she used my visa card to order a few things. She ordered more than she was supposed to, but I let it go.\n\nLater I found she received her order, but then claimed she did not received it in order to get a refund... (this happen about 13 months ago)\n\nThat’s when I started to really wonder if I can build a futur with her.\n\nAt this point we were 3 years together. She had taken all the weight she had lost back, and more. She is now morbidly obese, or so I think. She can hurt me when she is on top when we have sex, if she press with her hands on my chest or shoulder for example.\n\nI confronted her about all this, about 11 months ago.\n\nI told her she needed to lose weight again, as she wants kids and that seemed impossible.\nI told her that I was pissed off about what she did with that order. I could have got in trouble with that.\n\nShe took it seriously at first and started dieting again, and going to the gym.\nThen less and less...\n\nI reminded her a few times, but over time she went less and less. I hurt my foot at the gym, and couldn’t go myself anymore for some times.\n\nLast December she asked me where were going, if I wanted to be in this flat forever, etc.\nI told her that I gave her a guideline about what to do, that if she wanted to move in a house, have kids, etc. she needed to fix her weight first, and keep working on her behavior. Save money as well, houses are not becoming cheap...\n\nShe went back to the gym once. Just once. Christmas came, she didn’t eat too much, or at least not in front of me. January came, I asked her about her weight and going to the gym, she said she needed a few days. That was 12 days ago. She is eating sweets and cakes. I don’t see her losing weight.\n\nWe’re almost 4 years together now, I’ve fallen out of love. I read myself here and I have this feeling it’s all on her, but I still feel like an asshole for thinking about breaking up. Also I still care about her, she is still my friend, I don’t want to hurt her. I have the feeling I might be her last chance at having kids, because she might not find anyone else after me, or if she does it might be too late for her to have kids.\n",

I was born/raised in UK but my parents are from India.\n\nLucy is very good looking but that's not the only reason I went for her. She's got a very outgoing and bubbly personality, one of those positive people you don't come across so that's why I went for her. Also she's not a golddigger or anything, we both have the same job/similar salary (solicitors).\n\nBut I'm not seriously considering ever marrying her, I don't think. My parents wouldn't accept nor would my family. So really, I think I wouldn't ever considering marrying any white girl but I have been with them before sexually. I don't think this is particuarly racist because I'm brown and she's white so even though it's not fully ok it's not racist, but I'm not sure if Lucy is aiming for marriage. She hasn't spoken about it, but she said ''I love you once'' to me. AITA?",

      "description": "This is a long one so im sorry for the read.\n\nWe were hanging out at her apartment and she was playing a game ive already beaten. She slept more than me last night so I was still pretty sleepy this morning and she suggested I go sleep. I wanted to spend time with her so I refused but at the same time she had just showered and was naked and had a cover on her but regardless I was turned on. This is important because while i didnt really want to bother her my boner started bothering me, so i went to the bedroom to deal with it. \n\nWe had previously discussed in our relationship that porn was ok as long as it didnt mean anything and you were trying to bust a nut (she doesnt watch it because she says im the only thing she needs to think about but she has masturbated before to deal with her horniness without telling me as well and i was ok with it). So i started going at it and ironically she walked in as soon as i started and i was startled but ultimately just sat there and chatted with her as she walked across the room and got her phone charger and then left. I asked her if she wanted to help or join and she declined and seemed chill about it. So i finished and then waited a couple minutes so i could pee and then went back to where she was playing games. She was now watching netflix and as soon as i walked in she asked if i was done and i said yeah. \n\nShe immediately turned everything off and rushed to the bedroom saying “cool, cause i want to take a nap” but again she got more sleep than me so i got confused and asked her if she was ok and she said yes but her tone and attitude was different from before and she said she wanted to be alone. Now i knew something was up and i followed her to the room to watch her cover up and put the cover over her head and slowly start crying. \n\nWhen this happened i immediately sat on the bed and tried to ask her what was wrong and she refused ti talk to me and when i kept asking she got up and locked herself in the bathroom for awhile. When she came out she got back in bed and was just quiet and still is as I type this.\n\nSo, i know that she probably was upset at the whole masturbating thing and how that can make someone feel unwanted but in past arguments we have had she gets enraged when I assume how she feels, but she refuses to tell me how she feels. The only reason this is ok is because shes had a rough past and is bad at and is recovering from trust issues and communication issues. But regardless, its hard for me to communicate and try to understand her when she locks me out and pushes me away and i dont know what to do, id leave her alone but the last time i did that she develops her own negative emotions and builds up walls around her so she can’t get hurt again. \n\nSo AITA and how do i help her because i love her and want her to be happy ",

      "description": "So I'm on a weekend holiday with what I thought was my best mate in Montreal. We go to a karaoke bar and meet a couple chicks at the bar. One of them is really drunk and her friend accompanies her outside to help her. I join them and just start chatting. Then a group of 3 guys approaches us and ask me for a light. I give them my lighter and one of them steals one of the chicks phone. I was also pretty drunk so I didn't even realize it till she told me her phone was missing even though I saw one of them take it. So I go with her to the bar that we saw them enter and they disappeared. I call my mate to come over and then he starts telling me that the cops are on the way and that we need to go back to the hostel. I tell him that I'm trying to help this chick get her phone back and he tells me that they are not our problem. I pretty much told him to fuck off and that, yeah they may not be our problem but if it were me in a foreign country I'd hope someone would do the same for me. So he just left me alone and walked back to the hostel. The chick never found her phone that also had all her cards in it. I will probably never see either of them again but I thought I'd try to help them. Anyways now I'm sitting at the hostel waiting for my friend to arrive back, because I will not sleep well till I know he made it back alright. ",

      "description": "Long story short, my family had an argument today about my gf. This has been a heated topic since dating her (about 2 years) and we get in a lot of fights over it. Yesterday we got in a fight over something stupid I started but she made it worse and blew it up, insulting my relationship with her and stating we bond over arguing and hating my family (my mom thinks my gf is out to separate me from my family and enjoys “manipulating” my relationship). We had a long argument and eventually worked it out but I vented to my gf about it during via text.\n\nNext day I wake up and she tells me she READ my texts to her on my phone and insults me, saying I backstabbed the family by venting to her. Arguments happened and eventually my sister hopped on and starting insulting me, my relationship, and my gf. After telling them they had no right to go through my phone and saying the texts weren’t in any way insulting my family but being frustrated over the argument and stress, they continued being my gfs family into it, insulted me and her, and eventually said they will never trust me. I got so angry I walked out of the apartment and haven’t been back since. On top of that she wants to cut off contact with me because of this “badmouthing” about my family to my gf.\n\nSo AITA for walking out without talking? Also any advice?",

A few weeks ago, a few friends and I were in the library, I asked my friend if she was going to our church and she said no and so I kinda just went, \"Mhm...\" I didnt mean it rude or anything but the friend perceived it that way. Skip to today, I was casually standing with a few girls on the basketball court and another friend, Reese, comes up in the middle of my back and slaps me really hard. I get mad, as anyone would, and started chasing her. We started you know, play fighting, but I accidentally slapped her in the face, ACCIDENTALLY! We patched things up in legit two seconds lol but a coach made us go to the principals office. We were already friends again but she got in any more trouble than I. We were let back to the class and everyone was saying I started it. The friend from the library spread most of those rumours. She got mad at me for being mad at her for saying she said the euniurs when everyone knows she did, now everyone is calling me the bitch who slapped Reese.",

      "description": "So a few years back my wife (GF at the time) and I met up with some friends for a birthday dinner. We were introduced some new people, including a newly married couple. \n\nAnyway, after dinner, we were all invited to go hang out at the Married Couples apartment. They had just moved there, and wanted to show off the place.\n\nWhile hanging out, they very nicely offered refreshments, and we sat around while they talked about how they had just used all their savings to move in and buy all brand new furniture, including the rug under my feet.\n\nWell, I looked down, and I just couldn’t help noticing something odd about it. The pattern in the rug was sort of, window/box like. But upon further inspection, it was plain to see. Nazi Swastikas symbols were accidentally all over the pattern. \n\nIt was one of those, once you see it, you can’t unsee it.\n\nIf I had a picture of the rug, I’d have put it on the crappydesign subreddit immediately. But this was a few years ago, and this story just came to mind now.\n\nAnyway, I thought about it for a few minutes whether I should tell them about the pattern in the rug, or just let them live blissfully without ever knowing.\n\nBut deep down I just felt bad, and especially since they were a nice Jewish couple. I’m half Jewish, so I know I’d wanna know.\n\nSo I told them. I had just met these people, and now they knew they had a secret Nazi rug that they just spent a lot of money on.\n\nI never spoke or saw them ever again. But I’m going to assume they got rid of the rug and bought a new one.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling them, resulting in them most likely having re-purchase another expensive rug?",

I was off for a month on personal leave, and they were awesome in coordinating that. However, I've been pretty ill since ive started working there. Various upper respiratory symptoms, painful headaches, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and generally feeling awful. Symptoms subside within a week or so of being off ( we had a Christmas shutdown, in addition to my leave during which I recovered), so I know it's from this work, and I believe it's allergic. I told them about  it and was directed to their health and safety person, but with my wife going into early labor I never got a chance to talk to him. I emailed hr to unofficially give two weeks, but before I started my first shift back from my leave I called them and told them I would not be able to come back, in reference to the health issues. Looking back on those few months, I felt terrible and got very little worthwhile sleep. I was more sleep deprived then than I am now with an infant. But I feel like an asshole for not going in anyways, and offering a professional workplace a professional leave. Aita?",

      "title": "AITA for not respecting the parent’s wishes, as a babysitter?",
      "description": "I (18,F) occasionally babysit two twin boys (6) for a nice, Christian family. They often have me read from a kid’s bible and say prayers with them before bed.\nI was raised Catholic but am agnostic now and I’m not big on the whole religion thing, but I have no problem doing this. I respect that it’s their religion and they have a right to raise their kids this way. Besides even though religion isn’t for me I still can appreciate its good qualities and recognize that prayer and faith in something bigger can be a beautiful thing.\n\nHowever, last night the parents said they had left the kid’s bible at their church last week and asked me to read from a Ken Ham kid’s book instead. It was called the Answers Book for Kids. I told them I would, not knowing what was inside. I didn’t know who Ken Ham was but I looked it up after reading some of the book- he’s the guy who thinks not only was there a literal flood that covered the earth but Noah actually took dinosaurs in the ark lmao. He built a giant ark in Kentucky and argued with Bill Nye and stuff.\n\nI started reading from a page in the book about where we came from. I was shocked how how the book misconstrued the theory of evolution and blatantly made things up. For example, the book said something along the lines of, “Some people want you to believe that we evolved from monkeys-how silly does that sound?” No. Just no. The theory proposes that humans and apes shared a common ancestor, NOT that we evolved from monkeys, and when you put it that way, it sounds just as silly as a giant guy up in the sky. I tried flipping through the pages to find a page suitable for children but all of them said some shit like how the earth was only 10000 years old, carbon dating is wrong, and dinosaurs existed with people. What 6 year old even knows what carbon dating is anyway. If you don’t believe me I think you can get a preview of the book on google books.\n\nAnyway, after flipping around the book a little I told the boys they could pick out a different picture book and we’d read that instead. I didn’t feel comfortable spreading harmful ideas into impressionable minds. Like I said I do not mind helping the boys pray or reading bible stories but this was just obvious propaganda and willful ignorance. \n\nWhen the parents got home they asked me if the boys said their prayers and read their book and I respectfully told them that I didn’t feel comfortable reading the book. Awkward silence ensued. I couldn’t tell if it was because they were pissed, or they were confused because they didn’t know what was in the book (which I thought might be the case since they seem like nice, intelligent people and I can’t imagine them teaching their kids those things.)\n\nI still feel really weird about it and maybe I should have just followed the parent’s instructions. After all, they are paying me to take care of their kids. So, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry if this is a lot!! So basically my friend vented to me that a girl she knows and is kind of friends with has 52 pets. It was like 20 small pets (like four dogs, a few cats I think, and small exotic reptiles etc) but recently she got WAY MORE. Like a lot more. I saw pictures of at least 15 different animals in the past few days but she has admitted openly to 52 within the past two days.\n\nShe provides what I believe may be the minimal amount of care (she feeds them and takes them to the vet) but from what I’ve been told it’s gross in her house. Her parents bankroll the house this girl lives in and she CAN afford it all but it’s...52 animals! On top of that, she wants MORE because some of her animals need “friends” for mental health purposes. In a way I’m glad she’s thinking of specific animals that probably need companions so they aren’t depressed being alone (like some animals really do live better in packs) but that number is excessive and I’m fairly sure it’s illegal here. I can’t find any specifics on how many of each specific animal is illegal in a house hold or if there is even a specific law regarding a person having that many animals if they provide decent care but I don’t believe she is if it’s as gross as what people say cleanliness wise. \n\nNow on top of all of that my friend is scared that she can’t get her pet snake that was being fostered by this girl back. She didn’t have near this many animals when she started fostering my friends snake but now that it’s 52 she wants her snake, who has respiratory issues, back but hoarder girl has refused and also blocked her. She’s scared she can’t get her pet back if she calls it in but I’m about to if she can’t regardless.",

      "description": "My cousin has lived her entire life in the western world, and, like many westerners, she has become interested in eastern philosophy and begun to believe in a fetishized, idealistic version of it. The other day she was talking to me and discussed how she wanted to convert to Buddhism and accordingly adopt its practices, including meditation, and I was concerned and told her that meditation is usually only practicable by low IQ individuals as high IQ minds require constant enrichment and are always seeking new ways to apply themselves and therefore cannot be satisfied sitting idly for prolonged periods focusing on literally nothing, but warned that, like drug use, mediation can be appealing to high IQ people by causing momentary stress relief (usually) at the cost of their IQ, leaving practitioners permanently crippled intellectually without the ability to apply themselves in ways that even those with average IQs can. My cousin became very upset when I said this - apparently taking it as a personal insult because she is interested in mediation - and did not calm down when I explained that I was only concerned for her wellbeing.",

      "description": "I go to a pretty good school, and for this year they decided to move me down to a different set since I had done god awful in my mock exams. \n\nI got stuck with this kid and his friends, and all of them are literally so braindead and annoying that it was already making me mad. Some of them are ok and are genuinely nice people, but that's 2 out of 15. \n\nOne of the kids, the \"ringleader\" of the group, if you would, does his best to out me and embarrass me in front of literally everyone. He'll shout my name with all his friends, act stupid around me, and make the loudest noises possible only around me because he knows I have sensory issues.\n\nI started telling them to \"fuck off\" at times, and it would come out without me thinking. I even told the teacher to tell that to them once because I was that done. \n\nWe used to have example questions for Science second period on a Monday, and as per the usual, I was stuck with him for Science. He sat right behind me, and kept kicking my leg. He was also kicking my chair and making the same stupid noises. Eventually, near the end of the lesson, I got sick of his shit and gave him a hard punch to the gut. \n\nThis not only ended up bad with the teachers, but also for me. Because after this, he used this as a way to start outing me more. \n\nI'm sick of his shit and I'd honestly throw him out a window if I had a choice.\n\nI constantly tell him to fuck off, ignore him if i'm not already pissed off, and I just can't take this anymore.   \n\n\nOh and apparently teachers can't do shit otherwise they'd have to kick me out for hitting him. So I just have to put up with this for 4 more months.\n\nAITA",

      "description": "There was a time when me, my friend, and someone (Person C) were all friends. However, I noticed that Person C had some odd tendencies\n\n* He would speak to his family members rudely\n* He would complain his girlfriend was overweight\n* He would take the bus without paying\n* He would talk about my friend's date's race (African-American) as if it was Taboo\n* He would bail on plans last minute and make up excuses such as \"breaking his finger\"\n\nEventually, I noticed that this individual was not pretty on the inside but I did nothing. One day Person C and I got into a conflict and Person C cut off all communication with me. At this point, I realized that if Person C was able to cut off all communication with me, then our friendship was not as strong as I thought it was. As such, I extended an olive branch out of courtesy which was not accepted so I never pursued trying to fix that friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI explained the situation to my friend. My friend and I are very close. She calls me her closest friend in the city  we reside within. The nature of relationship between my friend and Person C also changed in that Person C was more distant to my friend. However, they still talked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my friend wanted to go to an event with me and I said we could go together but I didn't want anyone else with us. We both wanted to network together with others rather than \"hang out\" at this event. Unknowing to me, Person C was also attending. The night before the event, Person C contacted my friend and asked if he could go with her. My friend accepted and notified me of her decision. I tried to convince my friend to tell Person C to attend with a mutual acquaintance of ours. It did not work. At this point, I felt upset with my friend since I had specifically agreed to go with her on the condition that no one else would be coming with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the morning, another friend (Person E) wanted to attend with me so I agreed that we would all go together and split up once we got at the event. I would go with Person E and Person C would go with my friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the way there I asked Person C asked Person E why she did not go with her normal group of friends. I asked Person C why he didn't go with his usual group of friends. He said they weren't going. Clearly my friend was the \"last choice\" for Person C. The entire 5 minute walk was uncomfortable to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm torn with my feelings. I want to tell my friend I think it was unsavory of her to renege on our agreement but at the same time she should be free to go with anyone. I am unsure of the way forward. I would like to know if AITA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because some friends follow my Reddit and I really don't want this to get out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so I am having this LDR with a girl. It is not as far as one could expect, we're in the same country (which is fairly small to begin with) just in different towns. We have made our relationship official back in October-November.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work a full-time job and she is in her senior year of high school (I'm 20 and she's 19), therefore the only reasonable time we could meet up would be during the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can say that we are both attracted to each other: we are often flirting with each other and she likes my other work as well (some silly youtube videos of mine and recordings of the times I went to perform stand-up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, she is pretty shy. VERY. ^(Either that or I am an idiot and being catfished without me even realizing.) She told me that her phone loses connection to wi-fi if she enters in a video call on instagram (which is the only way to contact her), I can rarely call her because she claims the reception in her town is bad and her laptop has been broken ever since we have met ^(Again, maybe I am being fooled here.) She very rarely even sends pictures of herself because she considers herself to be ugly. I try to comfort her and that she is very beautiful to me, but I still have just 2 pictures of her saved on my phone.\n\nNow, of course, because of the reasons above, I believed that we could have a face-to-face date, to make sure that the chemistry remains the same. I have started suggesting her we meet up for a date during the holidays back in late November and at first she really seemed to be into the idea. But as the date drew near she wouldn't want to plan this any further and she would answer DMs very slowly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have confronted her about it and she gave me a the following motive: because she is very shy, she very rarely answers DMs and she thought she was not ready. I have respected that and told her that I will have some more patience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am starting to suggest to her to meet up for my birthday (my birthday is very close to St. Valentine's as well, so it would be great timing) and, again, at first she seemed to be a lot into the idea. But lately, when I asked her more on these plans, she tells me that \"she doesn't know how\" we should meet up, even though I have given her only two choices that, in my opinion, would be very easy to choose from: \n\na. she comes to my hometown \n\nb. I come to hers.\n\nShe also has gastroparesis and says that she can't meet me because of her illness. Again, totally understandable, she even sent me a short video zooming up on a bag with IV fluid in the hospital.\n\nNow, in a few months it will be 1 year since we would have met each other, in August. I really want us to meet face-to-face so we can establish enough of a connection to go on holiday together by that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had other LDRs before and they all have ended because the two of us wouldn't meet due to other circumstances. I have gotten into this one, seeing that now I have the possibility to travel to another town. The only thing remaining would be for her to be on board with all of this and it would be a date. But I fear that my patience is starting to run thin and I believe that if we do not meet up during this year, I will break up with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I did that, considering that she's shy and sick, but that we have also planned this for months?",

      "description": "To set the stage, I have been dating this girl for a little over four years. So about two months ago my girlfriend, who is just 18, joined a MLM. She was recruited by this woman who is 26, and who is married to a 27 year old guy. I'll use the name Mary in place of my girlfriend's real name, and Emily in place of the girl who brought her into this MLM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two weeks ago Mary came and told me she was going to go to this conference in Las Vegas with the woman who got her into this business. I thought that was really strange, considering she didn't know who this girl was at the start of 2019. And then she mentioned that Emily's husband was also going. That was too strange for me. She is going to the other side of the country with two people who are close to a decade olde than her, and they are all sharing the same hotel room together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, there are three big issues:\n\n1. She is going to Las Vegas with people she barely knows, she's probably met them 4 times in her life. She says she knows Emily and her husband but there's no way she can get to know someone that well, that quick.\n\nB. They're sharing the same hotel room. This is where I'm curious if I am just being an asshole boyfriend, but I hate the idea of a 27 year old sharing the same room as my girlfriend. I feel like any guy that age who would spend the night in the same hotel room with a girl that young is probably a guy who can't be trusted.\n\nD. I am very concerned about her safety. Emily and her husband will probably want to go out for drinks when they're not at the conference, and I'm concerned about my girl. If they go out for drinks or something I doubt they'll keep a strong eye on my girl. I am very afraid of her literally getting snatched off the street.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have gotten into several arguments about it; every time it is brought up I get frustrated. Am I in the right to be concerned or am I just being an overprotective asshole? Am I just being a dick who is getting upset over what could be a fun vacation? I lose sleep over it because it makes me so worried. Any advice you have would also be welcome. Thank you for taking your time and reading my post.",

      "title": "AITA for rejecting a $200 dollars ring from my mom?",
      "description": "(Non-native English speaker, so please excuse any mistakes)\n\nMy sister just graduated from university, and my mom got her (what in my countries currency amounts to) a $200 dollar ring. It was a surprise for her, but she had already told me she planned to buy it. It’s a thick white band with a row of zirconia on each side.\n\nMorning of the day we will celebrate the graduation we (my mom and I) are in the car together talking about the party and the ring. Not really wanting to make it about me, but also wanting to warn her as soon as possible, I tell her when I graduate (one year from today) she shouldn’t get me a ring because I don’t want one, and we changed the subject.\n\nMy reasons for not wanting one:\n\n1) I hate expensive things (unless it’s a tool, and the price is directly proportional to how much easier it’s going to make my life)\n\n2) I suck at wearing jewelry. There’s boxes and boxes of bracelets, rings and necklaces I NEVER wear.\n\n3) The few times I do wear rings I’m cursed to lose them. It’s insane, it can be cheap, expensive, my favourite thing ever, and I’m still going to lose it. The one time I let her buy me a $20 ring I lost it the first time wearing it. If you made a list with possible candidates to carry the One Ring to Mount Doom, my name would come *after* Gollum.\n\nThat evening the party is going super smoothly, and she suddenly asks me to talk in her room. Oh no. She takes a small bag that looks exactly like my sister’s and tells me she had already bought me a ring. She asks me to open it and it’s the exact same ring as my sister, only instead of white, the thick band is pink.\n\nI tell her she should take it back to the store, and that it’s super nice of her but that my decision is final. Here’s the part that makes me feel like an asshole: she tells me it’s ok it just keep it in the box, that she wants to make us a special gift, and that we can just look at the ring and remember the occasion. And I tell her that’s not smart, why waste that amount of money on something I’m not even going to use? She tells me she chose it specifically with my taste in mind, because it’s PINK! Not really true since I only wear thin and small rings, but whatever. “If you don’t like it we can go back to the store and change it”, but the thing is *I don’t want a ring, and I’ve already told her*. To make matters worse, she told me she can’t take the ring back, only change it for something else. \n\nWhat’s the point of having something I’m not even going to use? If the idea is to have a memory, a video will do the job. This morning I completed a one week long deep cleanse of my room, and got disgusted by how much unused stuff I own. If the idea is to wear it and think of her, then it’s only going to break my heart when I lose it.\n\nAm I being an asshole by not accepting her feelings, and just keeping the ring in a box?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm gonna try to make the story short. If you want more details, feel free to check my post history. So basically me and my friends planned a trip and we had some female friends who was gonna come and my sister and her husband was gonna come to and I thought it would be correct to invite my wife. The trip is planned for next month but my female friends change their minds and wanted to go to another destination instead of the one we planned to go to and my sister and her husband decided to go somewhere else to so it ended up just being me and the boys so that resulted in me inviting my wife and in result, she got mad at me. But she should not be mad because I thought it would be weird for her to be with guys only. I certainly wouldn't want to be with my wife and her female friends only. She is mad at me for that but it's totally unreasonable for her to be mad. Even after promising her that I will take her on another trip when I come back from the boys trip to make up, she is still mad ? I'm I an asshole? Because i don't believe I am. ",

      "description": "I (F18) was hanging out with my best friend (17F) earlier tonight and we decided we wanted to go check out one of my favorite venues for local bands. \n\nWe are both still in high school and live with our parents, for context.\n\nAnyways, we’re planning out our night, when she mentions that it is starting to get late and her parents wouldn’t want her out tonight anyways. I say fine, let’s just go have a girl’s night in at your place and we can maybe go tomorrow or the next weekend.\n\nShe starts saying that her parents wouldn’t say yes anyways but she really wanted to go and was generally frustrated with her parents for the lack of freedom. Hold on girl, in less than a few months you’ll be deemed a “legal adult” and free to make your own decisions. As if a few months difference is going to signify any increase in maturity. I digress.\n\nWe go downstairs for dinner and sit down with her parents. As conversation gets going I casually bring up the venue, trying to make it sound like a really nice and not sketchy place. (It really is not, but I knew her parents would be hesitant about it because “local music” and “teenagers” apparently do not go well together.) \n\nHer mom immediately shoots my best friend down, and excuses me to go upstairs. I stay for a minute in order to try and defend her, myself, and the venue for fuck’s sake, but eventually I let in and go to her room. I can hear her mom scolding her and comparing her to her brother. I feel bad and consider going home at this point, as I’m sort of uncomfortable.\n\nBest friend comes up after a while, shuts the door and starts crying to me about how I shouldn’t have said anything, that she knew her parents would get mad and I should’ve known that too. She says it’s my fault she got yelled at. I didn’t know what to say other than, “How was I supposed to know they’d react that way? It’s not MY fault THEY yelled.”\n\n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR brought up going to a local concert venue to my best friend’s parents, they yelled at her for even considering it, best friend blamed it on me ",

      "description": "Ok this was a while ago, but its always bothered me.  Ive been aetheistic for a while, and while I havent been as adamant about it now (not actively pondering about and that)  I really was in middle school.  \n\nBasically my lead teacher (who was really cool btw) decided we should do debates.  Everyone was doing normal shit like debating whether school should start earlier or something.  But I thought I should debate wether there was a God.  Now the two people who paired up against me said that was fine.  So we went ahead and did it.  \n\nNow keep in mind that I live in Pennsylvania.  And people were even more religous than usual.  One kid even thought we shouldnt debate because it was offensive or something.  Which I thought was stupid.  So debate finally happens and they brought really dumb arguements like why are planets round and giving evidence from movies that are \"based on a true story\" and dumb shit like that. While I brought up alot of points that they wouldnt even respond to.  \n\nSo it ends and of course almost the whole class votes against me because of course.  Now this really fucked me up because alot of people would actually resent me after that and I felt terrible.  \n\nSorry that was such a long story its just been stuck in my head for a while and I was womdering what you guys think.\n\nP.S If you're religous that's totally ok Im cool with that but if you want to debate me or something please P.M me I dont want to turn this post into one huge debate.\n",

      "description": "Two nights ago I was going to a quick drink before dinner organized by a friend of mine who I hadn’t seen or heard from in a long time; we used to be very close, but then she got engaged and started building on her career and I had to focus on mine.\nSo I was pleased to know she was planning something for the evening for our group of friends and decided to attend.\nUnfortunately, due to a few work related issues I had to call in and tell them I was gonna be around 25 minutes late.\nThankfully, another friend of mine was late as well and offered to drive me to the place.\nAs we’re driving to the location we receive several audio messages from our friend, saying she wasn’t happy at all of us being late and that since there weren’t any seats to the pub, “they” had decided to have dinner to a nearby Chinese restaurant, out of nowhere.\nI only had 10€ as I had forgot to withdraw, enough for a drink but too little for a full dinner, and since we were already late I decided to go to the restaurant anyway and order only a few small courses.\nWhen we got to the place, neither me or the friend who had driven me were happy for the last minute change, but since we were 20 minutes late we decided to just go with it, since we didn’t want to piss her off anymore.\nAs we enter the restaurant we discovered that our friend had brought with herself her fiancée (generally a nice guy but can get pretty tiring and obnoxious with his usual array of sexist and lame jokes) and a friend of her fiancée, a guy who I recognized from a previous night out and whose antics are much worse than those of the fiancée.\nMy other two friends, who had got there on time, seemed to just be going on with it and try to have a good time, despite not being fans of that particular individual.\nMy jaw locked (this wasn’t the first time she had invited him to our nights out without telling anything to anyone, despite criticizing others in the past who brought their SOs with them) and i tried my best not to look uncomfortable, despite one lame “joke” from the fiancée that was something like “5 minutes more and I would have beaten you to a pulp” which really isn’t a kind of humor I appreciate and felt more like a passive aggressive stance to prove I don’t know what. But again, we were late so we just laughed and took our seats.\nI sat near one of the other two friends and since one of them had been left by his fiancée the day before I tried to ignore the Fiancée and Friend and focus on how he was doing.\nHowever, as expected, they soon started to act in a most despicable manner. \nThey started speaking loudly, calling the waiters with subtle racial slurs and cursing out loud.\nThey weren’t particularly offensive but just plain vulgar while the cursing itself was just too much, in a restaurant with full tables.\nI tried to look for my friend, the girl who had organized the night out, on the other part of the table but she just smiled at me as if everything was going fine.\nShe knew perfectly well that his fiancée was more than welcomed to join us in our night outs (despite calling her, in front of everyone during the dinner, “a shovelful of shit” something I already pointed out to her in the past, despite her seemingly not caring beyond wearing a distressed look on her face), but that guy was certainly not, from past situations.\nShe used to be a pretty smart woman and when we previously pointed out her friend’s behavior she just apologized but kept inviting him to our nights out. \nSince everyone seemed to just roll with it I just decided to continue ignoring them and focus on a friend of mine who was cracking up subtle jokes about them.\nOne of these jokes made me laugh a bit and apparently the girl who had organized the night noticed it.\nThe evening kept getting worse; the friend of mine who had driven me there got nervous from the guys’ behavior and we ended up fighting for a frivolous and unrelated issue.\nLater, when I tried to pay my order (below the 10€) the waiter informed me she was gonna split the bill between us, reaching 16€ each, as they didn’t accept payments per order.\nI told the girl I only had those 10€ and she berated me in front of everyone saying “we always split, but DON’T WORRY we’ll PAY your part”.\nI got so angry at that point that I just yelled “Whatever, AU REVOIR SHOSHANNA” and left the restaurant cause I just couldn’t care less about leaving a good impression after all that had happened.\nI later called the friend I had argued with (she apologized for her behavior and blamed the overall uncomfortableness of the evening for making her nervous) and told me our Friend was angry at me for laughing at those subtle jokes about her fiancée’s guy saying I was very rude and “the only one who wasn’t having a good time”.\nNow, I decided I’m not ever participating to another evening organized by her. I’m more than happy to see her in other situations or things organized by other people in our group, but if I’m ever seeing that guy again I’m gonna turn around and leave, maybe without quoting fictional nazi generals this time.\nI’m not even planning on texting her or ask her to talk about what happened; she is already aware of our feelings on that awful guy, but it seems like she has more of a selective memory/perception when things about her fiancée or his friends are discussed even privately with her and frankly I have better things to do than trying to fix the behavior of grown men.\n\nMy other friends told me it would be a bit harsh for me to actively avoid nights out organized by her but at this point, I really just don’t care.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not caring about making a good impression with her vulgar friend? Should I have been more upfront and confront them again? \n\nTL;DR Friend of mine invited a well known trashy friend of her fiancée to a gathering of my group of friends, despite knowing our feelings about him, I ended up looking like the only one who couldn’t stand him and left the restaurant we were eating in, quoting a Christoph Waltz character.",

      "description": "I’ve always assumed I was a major asshole for doing this, but my friends beg to differ, I’d love to get Reddit’s thoughts.\n\nWhen I was a freshman in college I was in the basement of my dorm attempting to do laundry when I saw a girl that needed help with her washer. I don’t remember exactly what the problem was but neither of us could get her washer to work so we put in a work order and I told her to come back in 30 minutes and use my washer when I’m done with it. I noticed she had her laundry in a distinct laundry bag, this will come into play later.\n\nWell, as the saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished. I came back to my washer the millisecond my timer was up and I found all of my laundry lying on the floor, and it looked particularly soaked, as if someone had taken it out early. I was trying to figure out who the laundry dick could be when I noticed the empty bag that belonged to the girl from before sitting directly on top of the washer and the girls clothes were still in the washer. Acting impulsively I decided to hurl her bag behind the stack of dryers in such a way it would be a real pain for her to get out. I was fully aware it was petty but I was pretty annoyed, the floors in the dorm are nasty and now I’d need to rewash all my clothes. The only weird part of this story is that the washers generally lock while they are in the middle of a cycle so I have no idea how she would have gotten my clothes out. I did see some maintenance guys in there so I’m wondering if they turned the power off to the washers and she was able to take my clothes out, but I’ll never really know.\n\nTl;dr girl I help with laundry takes my wet clothes out early and throws them on the floor so I throw her laundry bag behind a dryer \n\nAnyways, am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok. First things first: I'm just the GF of the house owner. I don't pay anything here. We've lived together for a year.\n\nMany old roommates have wanted this guy kicked out. For a many reason. He fought for an entire week or more to try and have the other (new) roommate walk down two flights of stairs to use the basement bathroom because he didn't want to share. And the upstairs bathroom isn't even connected to his room. It's not private; he's not paying for a private bathroom. **That's just** ***one*** **example.**\n\nMy BF won't rent the upstairs room next to him because he knows the conflict that will come with doing so.\n\nWe're giving him *two months* notice. And my BF wanted to kick him out last week. I stopped it from happening. I have defended him, a plenty. Not that he's ever right, more so that I feel bad for him: this is the first place he's stayed at for more than a year ever since his mom kicked him out when he was 14. He re-traumatizes himself every time he moves, as he's said it's never been peaceful, he's always been an jerk about it, etc. But he's a 40-year-old man-child who is paying rent at almost half the amount the room could be worth. My boyfriend never gave him notice, much because of me. My BF has also lost roommates because of him. Anyway...\n\nThis guy and I would have civil conversations about the dishes, and things would get better, until things reverted back to his mess. Because this guy talks back, turns tables, derails the conversation, etc, the issue of dishes has finally caused me to yell during the past few conversations. So, I decided to take myself out of the equation. I decided to do mine and my BF's by hand. Easy peasy. We have two of everything in the dish strainer. They're always clean and available to use. Etc.\n\nThing is, for the first time *ever* the roommate decides to touch the dishes in the strainer. Even when they *were* his containers, finishing drying from small pools of water that collected from the dish washer, the roommate never touched anything in the strainer. Even when his stuff would sit there for a week or more until I took care of it. \n\nAnd then when I started doing dishes by hand, he started using our *two* plates. Because he dirtied the four other ones!\n\nI know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but that means I have to wash his dishes if my boyfriend and I want to have a meal. It means he doesn't respect boundaries, and he doesn't care if we don't have dishes available. It means he's ok with letting me clean for him, but not turning on the friggin' dish washer!\n\nSo. For the millionth time I approached him about the dishes. I asked him if he could not use the ones in the strainer, and explained it's so my BF and I would have a plate available for when we want to eat, that I don't want to have to clean his in order to be able to eat, etc. He started mocking me, laughing at me, arguing. I started yelling, etc. I told him I defended him just last week when my boyfriend wanted to kick him out. And then just as loudly, I told my boyfriend to go ahead and print off the notice. And now he has two months to find a new place.\n\n***Important:*** Just to be clear, my boyfriend is awesome and does a lot for me. I try to give back. We don't shoot for conventional, it's just what works in our lives right now.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend gave roommate notice because I was fed up with the way our roommate treats me. I have defended this roommate a lot, otherwise. He has not been kicked out previously because of me.",

      "description": "So let me explain I work from 7 am to 4:30 pm Monday - Friday. I take 10 minutes breaks during the day and usually at bathrooms breaks. \nThis happen yesterday and now I’m getting told by my friends that I was an asshole for the incident.\n\nYesterday I was in a bathroom break minding my bussines usually checking Facebook or reddit. I honestly didn’t hear anyone enter the restroom or talking I was really entertained reading a choosing beggars story. I finish did my thing and flush the toilet. This toilets are not like the ones at home this are Industrial type of things when you flush is really really loud and they last a really long time. I buckle up and open my stall and this girl starts yelling at me. \nIt took me a second to realize with this girl was bashee screaming at me.\n\nI told her to back off in a really angry tone. \nShe starts telling me how much of an asshole I am and how much I embarrassed her by flushing the toilet! How could I not hear that she was on her phone with her crush. I humiliated her by the guy finding out that she was talking to him and using the restroom. \n\nI wanted to laugh but I move to the sink and told her that I didn’t embarrassed her, that she put her self in that position by going to the bathroom while talking to her crush! If she had any respect for the person she should of said hey I will call you in 5 or something like that. I also said that she can not expect to go in a bathroom and no one to be there or that no one to flush. That next time have some common sense and take her calls in the break room or out side. \n\nShe started again screaming that I should have waited cause I clearly heard her going in the bathroom and talking on the phone.\n\nI cut her off and said that it wasn’t any of my bussines and that I didn’t hear her enter. I started to move to the exit and she was almost at tears by this point and she just screamed at me that I was a bitch! \nI left and went to my desk told my co worker and he was laughing with me. \n\nBut today some other people found out and told me that I was in fact an asshole by doing it on purpose and then not apologizing to her.\n\nSo Reddit AITA?? \n",

      "description": "Some context: My family runs a mattress business, and I am a minor. I have two paid siblings, and four unpaid siblings within the business.\n\nThis business keeps a roof over my head, food in my mouth, and clothes on my back. For this, I am grateful. My mother and father are co-owners, and I have been working unpaid for them my entire life, but again, food and shelter, so I feel that that is payment enough.\n\nHowever, something that has bothered me ever since I've reached my late teens is that we have absolutely no schedule organization. When one of my siblings or I are called in, we must drop whatever we're doing and come in to help, as long as it isn't sports or public school-related. (Online doesn't count, you might understand what kind of effect that has on my grades...)\n\nI obviously oppose this, and have asked, on multiple occasions, if we could get some sort of schedule. I am not against working in the business as long as I can structure my schedule around it. I have to balance online school, sports, and a social life on top of the business, so I favor being able to plan out my days.\n\nThis being said, I recently was called in to dump the garbage. I was grossly cramming schoolwork at the time, but picking up the garbage isn't that time-consuming, so I drove up and collected the garbage to drive to a second location. Halfway there, I get a call from my (paid) sister to come back, because she wants an extra set of hands. I tell her I really don't have the time to spare, but I'll come do it anyways. I drive back, park, and come in, to find out she needs an entire floor-to-ceiling mattress stack done. We get through three of the mattresses when I look at the clock and panic, because I really, really do not have the time. I let my sister know that I have to go, and she calls our mother to try and force me to stay. I tell her to go fuck herself, and that I can't keep dropping study time for the business, and leave.\n\nI feel like this all could have been solved with a weekly schedule for the whole family, and not just the paid siblings. I have no idea at what time each day I will have for studying or relaxation, and my grades are already falling behind because of it. However, I was needlesslesy mean to my sister, who probably really did need help. AITA?",

I'm gonna tell two stories about her  that made me think this way\n.\n\n1) I was 16. My best friend at the time was gonna throw a pyjama party (idk if its the right term sorry) for me. So i was VERY excited. The conversation was something like this:\nMe: can i go to (friends name) house?\nMom: no. I dont like her \nMe : oh, please mom! She's gonna throw a pyjama party for me!\nMom: i said no\n.\nSo little me, heartbroken said to my friend that i couldn't go. The weekend of the party come and my mom says\n.\nMom: are you ready to the party? \nMe:???????????? You said i couldn't go!\nMom: i never said that. You need to listen what other people say.\nMe: you said i couldn't go!!!!\nMom: (annoyed and being sarcastic) YES. iam the bad mother who didnt let you go to your best friends house. You didnt listen to me and now you lost your chance to go! (My friend had invited someone else)\n\nI was pissed at this. And then i realize that she do this all the time. She'd say something, when i confronted her, she's denied saying that or she'd be dramatic and says something like \"yes of course. I did this because i wanna to cause you trouble. I am a horrible person yes\".\n.\n\n2) everything NEEDS to be about her. So i was talking with my grandparents about my interview on a internship of a big company in my country (very big, big opportunity). I was talking that i was excited and my mom cuts my conversation and says:\n.\nMom: oh yes, when i did the interview on this company, they were pretty difficult to please! I was one of the last candidates and (famous reporter of this channel) was my competitor!\nMe: excuse me, mom. I was talking about-\nMom: (very loudly)  SHHHHHHHHHHHH. I'm talking\n\nAnd then she talked for 20 min about the 30+ year old interview. She always does this \"shh\" very loudly and rude, cutting everyone's conversation so SHE can talk.\n\nI've been calling her bullshit for years, saying that she's rude for doing this, for not being true with her words and lying to make us doubt ourselves (she do that to me and my brother). My brother says i should stop because its no use and i end up being The angry ungrateful daughter, but her actions piss me off so much. I still haven't stopped, but am i the asshole to call her out?

Both girl A and boy B are my close friends who just came to know each other recently, and girl A is dating boy C, though they are a fairly open-minded couple. Boy B fell hard in love with girl A, confessed to her approx 2 weeks ago and was rejected. He is still struggling to mend his broken heart now and has cut off most contact with A.\n\nRegarding the threesome, girl A actually gave me a similar offer a few months ago, but because I was in a relationship then I declined and we laughed it off. Recently I became single, so she renewed her invitation. I was enthusiastic and accepted it right away, because I am fairly attracted to both girl A and boy C, and we set a time and date. Only just now that it dawned on me that this can potentially hurt boy B a lot, and can count as a major betrayal. \n\nBut even so I still want and am likely to keep my plans because I have been thinking about this threesome for a while, and I did not think this chance will come again. My stubborn thinking goes along the lines of \"he's trying not to have anything to do with her and there's not much relation between the two incidents so it's fine\".

      "description": "My BF and I have been dating for 3 years and live in a flatshare. We have separate leases and separate finances - he has had his for his room for a few years now, and I have had mine for two smaller rooms in the apartment for a few months. Because I mostly stay in his room, our plan was to rent out the smallest room on AirBNB. \n\nIt's been about two months and it's gone quite well so far. The only issue we have is about the money we make from it. To attach some numbers, let's say his rent is $400, mine is $500, and the amount we make when the room is rented out 85% of the month is $1000. I think we should use the money we make to cover our rent first. \n\nMy BF is currently taking it all for himself because he does most of the work for it. I won't dispute that he does. He generally lets the guests in, and before and after they're here he changes or washes the sheets and vacuums in the room. It takes maybe 10 minutes. I help him out with it when I'm around, but more often than not the guests come and go when I'm at work. \n\nI work a 9-5 job. I don't make a lot, but it's enough for me to survive and enjoy life. My BF is a student. He doesn't have any classes and rarely studies. He works about one day a week. He actually makes more money than me a month because he gets significant contributions from his parents. However, he has not been very responsible and is often out of money by the end of the month, whereas I usually still manage to save a fair amount of my income.\n\nI haven't seen a cent of the AirBNB money yet. My BF says it's because he hasn't managed his funds well the last few months but that he has a budget now and it'll be better. However, he still doesn't think I should get the equivalent of my rent covered from the AirBNB funds. That would be a 50/50 split (we both get $500, so I get my rent covered and he gets rent covered +$100). He thinks he deserves more because he does more for it.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting a 50/50 split on the AirBNB funds so we both can cover our rent? I see his perspective that he does more for it, but at the same time I'm technically leasing the room we're renting, plus I do help out whenever I can. ",

The store manager and another manager are angry that I'm leaving and now wont speak to me or even say hello.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto the actual story, my manager scheduled me for a day when I'm not available. When I started I told them I could only work one day on the weekend because I needed time to do homework on one of the days. Anyways I worked on Saturday and then he scheduled me for Sunday. I told him I couldn't work because I had homework to do for school and he said he expected me to help him out because my last day is on Tuesday. I told him sorry and that I couldn't. He then told me that I was the only one available and he seemed like he was trying to guilt me into saying I would.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I would have at least compromised and said maybe I could work part of the shift but because of the way they have been acting I decided I wouldn't. AITA for saying that I couldn't work a shift that I was scheduled for when I'm not available?",

      "description": "I know from just reading the title, everybody is going to say “Of course!  She’s obviously extremely busy”.  And that’s 100% true.  Here’s the full story.  \n\nI’m getting older, almost 30.  I’ve been divorced, I’ve shacked up with a long term girlfriend, I’ve dated women of different moral values, and now I’ve finally met someone with similar views, who is awesome, and sweet, and I’m attracted to her.  The new part, is that she’s a single mother.  This was always a no-go for me in the past because it was just luggage I wasn’t willing to take on in my life but I’ve accepted that at this stage, a lot of women have had kids and I just love this girl.  \n\nAnyway, we only get to see each other maybe once a week and usually her son is with us.  If the dad takes him, then we might have 3 or 4 hours together and it’s often just chilling out and catching up from a busy school/work week.  The same is true when we go on camping trips, or road trips, or theme park visits. \n\nI’ve really had to adjust to not seeing my girlfriend every day or 2.  It’s been tough not being able to spend the night with each other or plan to spend every weekend together, but I’ve learned because I’m playing the long game for this girl.  \n\nLast week, she had some time to come over in the middle of the day and she was totally alone.  We had been texting recently about how we had not had sex in several weeks and we were both looking forward to our next chance in the beginning of December.  With this visit, I brought it up and mentioned that we could fool around a little bit.  She jokes that she likes the idea but it’s not going to happen because my house is too bright.  She is insecure about her body and sex must always happen at night in pitch black.  I constantly tel her how beautiful I think she is and that I am attracted to her but it’s just one of her hang ups.  \n\nLong story short, she cane over and we sat around and talked for a few hours until she had to get back to the grind.  \n\nMy thoughts were initially that I have made so many concessions for her and been so supportive and understanding of her tough schedule that maybe she would be supportive of the one time I bring up an interest in sex with her.  I usually feel guilty bringing up sex, like it’s asking somebody for money or something.  I know I’m not entitled to sex.  I’m not owed sex.  But it was something that we had discussed, we enjoy doing with eachother, we wish we could do more, and we wasted a perfectly good and exceedingly rare opportunity.  \n\nI don’t dare discuss this with her because the last thing she needs is to be stressed out with my stupid brain baggage on top of her full plate.  \n\nAre my feelings wrong?   Should I discuss it with her in the future?   Looking for validation one or the other.  Thanks for any help you guys can provide!",

      "description": "I(26m) decided that I was going to go on one more spring break vacation with my boys and that was during the last spring break I went on, which was in 2018. The vacation was set to be a full week which I told her about since the beginning of our relationship. So it has been set in stone for awhile. Me and my SO have been together since November of 2018 which is not that long but long enough for us to be getting pretty serious. We don’t live together but she comes over often. I would say on average 4 times a week. \n\nBefore I left I would tell her to come over to my house every day, instead of the usual of other day or so, but  I  get off a  late from work a lot and most of the time we would get together by 9ish at night and I would be going to sleep pretty soon after that because I wake up at 6am, and the longer day wipes me out. Even then I would stay up with her until about 1030 to 11ish, because I wanted to spend more time with her before I left. \n\nI left on Saturday and on Friday we were hanging out from the time I got out of work until about 1030 that night. This is when one of my best friends, pretty much my brother, wanted to come over because he wasn’t going to going to go on the  trip with me and my other best friend. All of us are basically family. \n\nNow this is were it went bad because I hung out with them all night and we got drunk. I ended up drinking something bad or my stomach just wasn’t feeling right and I got sick and felt like throwing up in the middle of us having sex. She didn’t seem to be mad at me about this and was trying to be consulting about it but I felt like a POS after that happened. Then I woke up late the next morning because of the drinking. She wanted me to have sex with her again to make up for what I had done the night before  but I had to leave to get to where me and my fiend were going for spring break which was about an 8hr drive so I told her that all I could really do was have a quickie and she made it seem like by saying that she was just some side chick or something like that. \n\nI never really thought that it was that big a deal when I said it but I do see her point. In my mind I just wanted to get to where me and my friend had to go and spend one more night with my brother before I left for the week because I rarely get to see him now, maybe once a month, because he is with a girl that is really controlling of him. I feel like I do see her point but also that I really didn’t do a thing wrong because I’ll be coming hack relatively soon. ",

      "description": "Hello, long time lurker, first time posting, but only because I'm starting to question if it's me being completely unreasonable in my marriage. \nBackground: I've known my husband for 6 years now and we've been married for 2 years. I would consider him my best friend and hanging out with him is fun, BUT! It's starting to feel like that is all we are. \nMy husband is 27, loves to play magic the gathering, league of legends, and loves to download hentai. It's become a bit of a problem within the past year because that's ALL he wants to do. If I want to go skating, he'll want to stay home and play league with his friends or play MTG Arena. If I say we take our dogs to the dog park, he'll say that I can just do it by myself or bail last minute. We haven't been intimate in months, though I've initiated several times. He just wants to play league. (Yes, I know this is borderline r/deadbedrooms) \nThe problem: Today is Valentines Day and also our anniversary of when we first met. We don't celebrate our wedding anniversary. For the past few years, we weren't able to be together for our anniversary because of work and long distance. This year, I told him that because we haven't been really intimate lately and I feel like the romance and intimacy between us is dying, so let's go on a date. I told him that I don't expect much, but I would like some flowers or a card. We could go to dinner, and I will pay since I'm picking the restaurant. I just didn't want him to treat me like a friend for today. He agreed and said he would try to be romantic. I've reminded him several days ahead that our anniversary is coming up and then today is the big day. As soon as we wake up, he wants to get the oil changed on our cars. I'm not too happy because he has been off for 5 days and now decides to do it today? Whatever. I do my makeup and get ready for our date. He can tell I'm not too happy and asks why I'm upset. I tell him why and he says that getting the oil changed isn't going to take long, so why am I making it a big deal? I let it go and we drop off the car and go to dinner. At the restaurant, I tell him that we should just put both our phones away and just focus on each other. He agrees. Then he makes a face and says that he crapped his pants. I think he's joking and I don't really believe him. He says he did and asks if I want a picture of it. He eventually heads to the bathroom and comes back to tell me that he did crap his pants a little bit. At this point, I've gotten my food and I'm eating. I got a bit frustrated with him because I just wanted a nice dinner with him and I asked him why he was forcing farts when we are out eating dinner? If he really needed to pass gas, why not do it in the bathroom? Why tell me now while I'm eating? He gets upset at me and tells me that he's tired of me being upset and being rude. I try to talk to him and explain why I'm upset (I'm eating my food and I don't want to talk about poop) but he says that I've been upset since the oil change and that he's tired of dealing with me. Then he pulls out his phone and despite my attempts to talk to him, he gives me the silent treatment. I gave up on talking to him and we just ate our food silently, then picked up our car and came home. I haven't spoken to him since the restaurant. \nI'm very disappointed overall because my husband and I barely have time for each other due to work. I thought today would be a nice change and we could enjoy each other's company, but now I'm wondering if I am the asshole for having these expectations of romance and being frustrated about him crapping his pants today. \n\nTLDR: Today is our 2 year anniversary; Husband bails on the romance but delivers with some unwanted #2 during dinner. \n",

The walls are EXTREMELY thin, so we all can hear each other all the time. Since my lease started in August, I’ve noticed that I hear the sound of vomiting every morning and every afternoon. It is very obviously vomiting and it happens multiple times a day, every day, without fail. Although it’s a bit disruptive and gross to hear, I’ve never said anything because like, obviously the guy is having a rough enough time as is; I’m sure he doesn’t want to be puking just as much as I don’t want to hear it. \n\nLately though, as it’s begun to heat up, my bedroom has begun to smell like puke. You know that smell after you clean up puke but it still lingers? Like that. I figure it’s coming from his bathroom that is probably directly below me. \n\nWould I be an asshole for calling the leasing office about this? I’m honestly not even sure what they could do besides notify him about the fact that others can hear/smell it. ",

      "description": "I really feel like I have no say in this relationship whatsoever. I wanted him to cut down on weed, he wouldn’t do it.  (he’s high literally 24/7) we have 2 cats who fight to the death. We have no choice but to give one of them away. I’m giving mine up to my mom in 2 weeks and it breaks my heart. She lives in NY, we’re in FL so I can’t visit him that much. I already had to give up many pets to move in with my bf. My snake, fish, bunny, chinchilla, dog. (My mom kept the dog.) I ask for head, I don’t get it. I wanna play a video game, he changes the tv to hulu instead. \n\nNow his dad is a growing issue. A little backstory: His dad moved to FL with him and was allowed to stay with him until he saved up for a place under the condition that he stayed sober and kept a job. He ended up being a nightmare and got the cops called on him multiple times. He ended up homeless. We used to live in a 2 bedroom apt so I was totally cool with his dad living with us. Now we live in a studio apt. One fucking room. And his dad spends the night OFTEN. It’s gotten to the point where he won’t even ASK! Tonight, he came over to shower at like 8pm and ended up staying until 2am just expecting us to let him crash here. My boyfriend and I exchanged looks because we can’t even talk privately, we have one fucking room. He asked his dad how much longer he was planning on staying and he said “I was actually just gonna stay the night.” Jesus fucking christ I am livid. I help with bills and I cover all other expenses and I don’t even feel like this is my fucking house. I’m not even on the lease ffs because my boyfriend doesn’t want us to have to pay an extra 25 a month. I payed more than half to get us in here and I covered HIS cat fee. I get no fucking say even though this IS my house. I’m so incredibly frustrated right now because I feel so sick tonight and I’m literally on the verge of a fucking panic attack. The only privacy I can get is if I isolate myself in the shower for a few hours and I can’t even do that because his dad smoked god knows how many cigarettes in our tiny studio apartment bathroom and the smell makes me sick. I smoke too but not in the bathroom because it’s such a small space and I hate the smoke smell when I’m nauseous which I very much am right now. And I KNOW I won’t get any sleep tonight because his dad needs the TV on and will eventually snore loud as fuck. I want to rip my fucking hair out. I’m shaking with anger. I’m not normally this bitchy over his dad staying the night but tonight I feel like absolute shit I just wanna be alone in my house with my boyfriend and his dad didn’t even ask. didn’t even fucking ask. I can’t. \n\nI really don’t know if I’m the asshole here or not. I feel bad kicking his dad out on the street but I can’t do this either I just fucking can’t it’s so insanely frustrating especially on top of all the other things I feel like I have no say over.

      "description": "\nMy husband wants to teach me about music and how to play it. I have never been musically inclined or that interested in music. He played guitar growing up and was in a band in college.  I  bought a ukelele and learned how to play one simple song on it a few years ago for his birthday - that's the extent of my musical career.  He has really been pushing me lately to learn more.  \n\n\nHe sort of cornered me into a lesson about a week ago.  I felt really uncomfortable about it at the time and he seemed to be upset and frustrated that I wasn't as interested as he wanted me to be.  I didn't like that he didn't ask me ahead of time if I wanted to do this or had the time to do it then.  I let him know that next time we should schedule a time and have a start and stop. \n\n\n We never really set a time except to say during my 2 days off this week. Both days went by and it wasn't mentioned again. My shift started this afternoon so I had the morning to relax a bit and he really pushed until I relented and reluctantly accepted the lesson. He was asking me to count beats in a measure in a way that I just felt really put on the spot and not comfortable about. I felt a lot of pressure to perform and I sort of mentally shut down... like it felt like I was there but just watching myself freeze up. He was being really nice and encouraging but I just felt really withdrawn.\n \n\nWe moved into his room and he was trying to figure out the chords to a song, and I checked my facebook while he was figuring stuff out. He got really upset and called me a jerk and left the house. \n\n\n I know that music is really important to him and he's upset because he felt like I was being disrespectful by being withdrawn. I fully agree that it was disrespectful of me to be on my phone.  I feel like he overreacted by storming out.  I want to want to learn about it but in the moment I feel a lot of pressure and it makes me withdraw - I think part of the pressure comes from his expectation that I should be happy and grateful for the lessons he is springing on me.  AITA here? I don't really understand my emotional reaction to this. I can see why he would be upset at my behavior, but at the same time I never asked for this and he cajoled me into it.  ",

      "title": "AITA for being angry about the way my father has divided his will?",
      "description": "I (37F) am a woman who lives with her partner (37M). Recently my father passed away, and me and my sister (32F) have been organising his affairs only to find out that he has split his things roughly 75% to her and 25% to me. In a letter that was left for us (he was terminally ill) he has explained this as being because my sister has two children and I have none (had a hysterectomy). So in his eyes this was 25% to me, 25% to her and 25% to each of her sons.   \n\n\nI am very hurt and angry. I think I would feel different if the way my dad had divided up his assets was different. What he did prior to death was sell off the vast majority of what he owned to make it easier for us (his house was almost empty when we visited it), so there are essentially two things left for us which are a cash sum he had collected and the house. He worked out the value of the house which is about £400k, which he has given to my sister alongside additional cash funds of £200k, and then I am getting about £200k myself (not exact figures but rough enough).   \n\n\nMy sister, however, already has a mortgage on her own house, which my father paid a 20k deposit on a few years back when she got pregnant with her first child. Her plan is to sell her old house and move into my father's, which is a lot bigger and in a nicer area, so she is really getting the extra money from selling her property too. The way my father saw it, the house is 'for the kids' and the money is 'for her'. I have not discussed it with my sister at all because she is very excited to be able to take her family there and have a better life. She has all sorts of plans. The house has a garden, she can spend more time with her sons, they'll be able to attend better schools, etc. etc. It doesn't seem fair to rain on her parade.  \n\n\nI discussed it with my partner who is sympathetic, but pointed out that this is not the first time my father gave greater benefits to my sister and prioritised her over me even before she had babies and I did not. I mentioned that he essentially bought her a house. Well I was living in a dingy one bed flat at the time, privately renting with almost no spare income. The option of buying me property never surfaced. I moved out relatively young. My mother once commented that the reason she felt my father often 'forgot' about me was because I do so well on my own that 'he's never worried about you'. So my partner has told me that this is just the last incident in a long line of incidents where I have been practically non visible. He agrees that it sucks, but has assured me that it's no reflection on me and that does make me feel a little better, but I am still very, very angry.  \n\n\nI don't know Reddit, am I being an asshole for feeling this way? There is nothing I can do about this I think but I feel bitter and resentful. Am I justified and do you think these feelings will go away after time?",

We have always been in correspondence, not every single day but really just over the years. \n\nI am going on a four-day spring break trip with a large group of friends to San Diego, where she goes to school. I mentioned this to her and she’s absolutely ecstatic, saying she wants to hangout everyday I’m there etc. \n\nI really didn’t know what to say because it was supposed to be a trip with my friends who are graduating this semester and my boyfriend. I get pretty bad social anxiety about certain things and I just felt anxious about her and my other friends meeting. And I don’t want to sacrifice my entire trip to getting reacquainted with her because it’d be pretty overwhelming  and I’d rather it be kind of more personable between just her and I as opposed to me just being there with other friends and having to divide my attention. \n\nI told her we could hangout on Friday after she gets off work in the afternoon and she agreed but I feel like she’ll be really wanting to hangout out more and I just don’t want to. \n\nPlease help, am I the asshole for not wanting my time there over spring break to be about reuniting with her?

      "description": "Two close friends of mine want to hang out every weekend and some weekdays. And nine times out of ten it's never a quiet evening; it always turns into a long night (2am or later). We have an ongoing FB group chat. Like clockwork, they're messaging every weekend or every day I have off about \"so here's the plan tonight.\" I work for one of their family members and so they know my days off before I even tell them. But it's not about that. I feel fine usually. Maybe very tired because I work full-time... but mostly I'm just... I'm in my late 20s. I think it's time to SLOW DOWN. Am I weird for not wanting to hang out every weekend? I don't like it being always *expected*... and I value my alone/down time. I know they are getting fed up with me and maybe even think I'm purposely trying to lose touch with them. Sometimes they really put on the pressure/guilt (\"why are you being that way\", \"you're always tired\", \"whatever... you have three days off\" etc.) I'm honestly fed up with it. I have a bad habit of pushing people away, being distant, not answering texts promptly, etc... but I don't think this is an example of that. I think they are taking things too far, and should respect my boundaries without taking offense to it. Maybe I'm weird, because other people recharge with companionship, and I recharge with being alone... but I'm not an asshole. Right?",

I'm working late in fact. On 13th Feb I've bought her a present and ask if I can see her in the morning before I start work the following day. I text her asking if she has any favourite chocolates or treats and she replies with \"I don't want you to get me anything, I haven't got you anything\" so I was nervous about it too begin with but now I'm thinking she really doesn't want to do anything big for Valentines day, which is fine with me because it's much less pressure.\n\nThe morning of I find out she thinks we're only seeing each other for about 45 minutes even though I specifically say I'm free until 12. So we go for a McDonald's and she is clearly in a bad mood, I ask if it's me and she replies \"Why would I be mad at you?\" so we go back to finishing our breakfast in near silence,after which I take her home then take myself to work. \n\nOnce I've finished my shift I text her asking how her day had been which she ignores while posting Anti-Valentines day posts to various social medias and this morning (15th) I say good morning which she ignores too but again is active on various social medias.\n\nSo now I'm just struggling to understand the situation.",

But you got a degree in English. So how is your title 'Engineer'?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I do engineering work. Technically you'd call me a technician. I didn't take the test or get the degree, but the only thing is that I just can't sign off on anything. I still do the same work, so I just say I'm an engineer.\"\n\n\n\nHe's a very carefree individual and he seemed to take my question in stride. But later, when we were hanging out, he seemed a little upset. Nothing else happened to bother him, and the more I thought about it, I started to feel bad. \n\n\n\nI can see it from his POV. He works hard and calls himself based on what he does. He doesn't pidgeonhole people based on qualifications or titles.\n\n\n\n It's not my place to knock people down a notch, but I didn't want my friend to mislabel himself.

      "description": " I had a falling out with my husbands brother who had said some nasty things about me behind my back to his dad (my father-in-law) I found out and confronted him and he played it off as a joke and never apologized. After i learned that him and his GF had not liked me for quite awhile and had pretty much been acting fake towards me for years i decided they were no longer in my life and told them both any chance of a friendship was ruined for now. The GF and my husband never became close or developed a friendship (if they had i wouldn't of asked her of this!), but she had this habit of speaking for the brother and asking my husband random things out of no where inviting him when the brother should be, I became uncomfortable with this because I knew she did not like me but for some reason was trying to get to my husband and alway acting as the brothers spokeperson. I told her I did not trust her BF (the brother) so in turn did not trust her (birds of a feather right?). She continued messaging and even inviting my husband to go tank floating with her, I told my husband she was over stepping boundaries and not respecting my wish. He stopped responding to her. after about 2 weeks she asked him why he stopped responding and if it was something she had done? I called her and reminded her that I had asked her stop messaging him unless it was an emergency, and that husband was just respecting me and our marriage. She called me controlling and that she was only trying to build a relationship with her BIL. I don't believe it and It was making me uncomfortable.  AITA?????",

      "description": "Before anyone calls this bullshit, I wanna say that I am actually confused about this whole situation and I really need an opinion from outside of the story. Emotions are still flowing, so if I let anything out I'll edit the post.\n\nSo, for context, I used to have my own PC, but it stopped working recently, and it's on repair. So I either don't use a PC at all or use my dad's notebook, which usually is not an option because my 5yo sister (I'll call her \"Sam\") is using it ALL THE TIME. Whenever I ask it from her to use for a while she either yells \"NO\" or cries for my parents' attention, and they never did anything about it. Eventually I gave up and stopped asking.\n\nOk, so today my mom went out with her, and I had the notebook for myself the whole afternoon. My mom gets back, we talk about college for a while, and then I let Sam use the notebook for a few hours. \n\nWhen Sam went to her bed, I was about to get back to the notebook again when my mom asks for it so my sister could use, cause she didn't want to sleep. I got mad and asked my mom why, cause they always let her use it and I never get the chance to do anything. She basically got mad too and started calling me names and answered my question by saying \"because I want to\".\n\nThings escalated quickly and she started pushing me against the wall while still calling me names (I can't say I stayed calm either, I was trying to defend myself/minimize the pain by pushing back a little bit, I had no intentions in hurting her and I'm pretty sure I didn't).\n\nWhen she released me I kinda felt bad and decided to give her the notebook and guess what? My mom didn't accept it anymore, got really pissed and tried to tell my father what happened. She said that \"I no longer existed to her\", and tried to justify that with her version of the truth (that I was the one trying to hurt her, that I \"grabbed her arm\", while completely ignoring what she did to me.) I called her out and added the details she \"forgot\" and my dad actually stayed on my side for once and said we would talk about that tomorrow.\n\nSo, basically, AITA for not wanting to give Sam the computer or should I give it to her even though she already uses it all the time? Honestly I think my parents are going too soft on Sam and have been going for a while (this time just my mom, dad actually stayed on my side for once), but whenever I say something they ignore me, since \"they are the parents, they decide what's best for their children\".",

      "description": "I will call my female friend Jenny and her boyfriend Frank (all early 20's). I've been close with Jenny for 2 or 3 years, but met Frank only once. I unfortunately don't know that much about him, because he was extremely quiet and we did not have a deep conversation.\n\nSo, here is the problem. I went to a casino with my dad and uncle to have some fun night this weekend. I was playing blackjack by myself then a dude who looks awfully familiar sat on the same table. After glancing at him for 5 seconds, I had a good feeling that it is probably Frank. I am still pretty confident that he was Frank because I saw Frank's face several times via Jenny's social media and his voice and height were almost identical to Frank's.\n\n He had like 3000-4000 dollar worth of chips on his table, which is a little bit odd considering his age. He was constantly betting 100-300 dollars and was keep shouting \"m\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*f\\*\\*\\*ers\" or \"a\\*\\*\\*oles\" whenever he lost his money. Most people do yell when they lose money at a casino, but this dude was very loud and obnoxious. In addition, he was chain smoking 4 or 5 cigarettes until the lady jokingly asked him to smoke less. \n\nIt took like 30 minutes for Frank to leave. He lost 50-70% of his chips and I never saw him again. \n\nI was pretty surprised because the reason why Jenny dates Frank is because he is a nice, intellectual dude who spends his time and money wisely. But the \"Frank\" who sat next to me was very far from the explanations that Jenny gave me. \n\nSo WIBTA if I tell Jenny that I saw Frank at a casino and explain what I saw? ",

      "description": "\n\nHere's a little backstory. My 29 y/o stepson (SS) was released from prison this fall after serving 12 years. His mom left him and DH when he was a baby and DH raised him. When SS was 14, he decided he wanted to be with his mom and took off for the East coast. Mom was a dopehead, which DH or SS didn't know, and she had SS commit a robbery to feed her dope habit.  SS was caught and given adult straight time. Mom walked and basically ignored SS after that. We live in the Midwest backwoods and SS was raised here.  SS is and was a good kid.  His mother's manipulation landed him where he was. This is important.\n\nA few months before SS was released he met a gal (B) who worked at the facility and they became \"friendly\".  As a result, she was fired and he got transferred.  All of this happened about 6 weeks before SS's release date.  He was supposed to come home, here, until he met B.  When SS was released, he moved in with B and now they're engaged to be matried in June 2019.\n\n B comes from money, definitely upper upper middle class at least.  SS is was raised in the backwoods until age 14 and spent the next 12 years in prison.  Polar opposites but they make it work. I'm happy for him, really, but neither DH or I care much for B.  She's too uppity.\n\nSS has put me in the position of getting to DH to their wedding.  DH is really butt hurt over SS's decision to stay with B and wants nothing to do with her.  I've told DH he needs to suck it up and be there for his son.  I can convince DH to go but I'm having second thoughts now.\n\nB and her people are way out of our league. We would stand out like a shit stain on a white sheet and from what we've seen from B so far, it would be pointed out to us. DH is a complete backwoods redneck with no filter. I just don't see this turning out good so WIBTA for not going to the wedding?\n\n",

      "description": "Hello, first time poster here.\n\nSome context: I \\[21F\\] made a friend \\[23M\\] via Tinder during my travels, never met up; however, because of the distance we never really started anything or move beyond flirting and sexual talking in the beginning. He used to tell me all of the time how in love with one of his close friends he was and we have since remained very good friends who are into separate people. \n\nRecently, said friend has gone back to being very flirtatious and sexual with me (approx. a year later). For example, he likes to ask me for photos and/or ask if I want him to send me any photos. He also makes frequent allusions to our old sexual conversations and expands on them. After telling him that I would prefer it if the sexual conversation stopped and that it's not something I wish to engage with with him any longer, he acknowledged it and apologized soon after so I thought it was sufficiently over. Cue him once again making sexual comments and sending photos that are less-than-ideal. I got a little bit more aggressive with him by this point, telling him very explicitly how uncomfortable his advancements were making me and that I wanted them to stop. Again, he got very sad about upsetting me and promised it would stop.\n\nCue today. He decides to take it upon himself to tell me all of the details about a sex dream he had about the two of us, framing it as something silly and weird that I would like to be told. To which I responded very minutely and have been distancing myself since. \n\nI understand that because we used to talk in a particular way, he might think it is still okay all this time later. However, after expressing how uncomfortable it makes me, I would like to be able to expect a little bit of respect towards my feelings from someone I consider a great friend. I honestly don't think he is malicious at the end of the day, but he really isn't making any honest attempts to stop this behaviour. So, AITA for wanting to keep my distance and maybe not have this friendship continue? ",

      "description": "So currently I live with my ex best friends and we said we could be civil but then they started being petty and inconsiderate. Such as they keep fighting with me over the heat- I want it on cause it's cold and you're supposed to have it on so that way the pipes don't freeze and the landlord said they would fine us if they found out that we didn't through a surprise inspection, being obnoxiously loud after I go to bed- slamming doors, cupboards, cooking food at 2 am, playing videos/ TV, etc. They've also decided to take the Chromecast from the living room TV so I can't use since I like to use it inbetween two of classes when I come home to eat lunch and chill. They don't need it for their room cause they have an Xbox that they use and are constantly using the Ethernet cord to make it run better. On the other hand, I haven't joined in their pettiness because there's no point but I'm not gonna wait for them to keep it up and even maybe ramp it up as they have damaged personal property. \n\nAnyway, because of their pettiness and the fact that one has damaged personal property when upset ( keyed the car of the other roomie and his gf because of a fight, broke the door of their last apartment because of another fight) I have decided I can no longer live here for another semester because I have school to focus on, their petty games and  I do not want them to ramp it up. \n\nSo I found a subleaser pretty quickly, and am in the process of getting her approved but will most likely move out this weekend or beginning of next weekend. However, I am obviously going to take myself stuff such as the plate/ dinner sets which will leave them without one for about two weeks. Also, I have bought stuff, like the shower liner, the tissues that have not been used/ opened, soap dispenser and refill soap, body wash that also has not been opened/ is sitting in the closet, toothbrush holder and so on. I have paid for this stuff mostly with my parents credit card as they buy my necesities\nso I see it as mine and will need it for my next place so I don't want to leave it and have to make my parents spend more on buying the stuff again. Which some stuff is small but it all adds up and I don't like to take advantage of my parents money as I realize that they don't have to be so generous with it and help me out now as I am in college and don't have a good paying job and they see college as my job. However, I also don't want to be seen as petty, and don't want them to throw a fit and have them be argue with me that it's all of ours and my parents can buy me more stuff as I am the \"rich\" one in the group. Plus this kinda forces them to run out and buy the stuff I take as they will need it right away. \n\nFurthermore, when my sister left the year befoe they moved in, she left stuff such as a shoe holder, rugs, garbage cans, desk and other stuff that she said we could find a use for or throw out, we ended up using some of the stuff and I want to take it with me (excluding the desk cause I have my own and have no need for 2) but would I be able to claim those as mine too and take them?\n\nSo WIBTA for taking the stuff that my parents bought me, even the cheaper little things, or the stuff my sister left behind for us to use?

      "description": "I work with a national gig economy type place teaching art to people in local restaurants and bars. I moved from to another state where it was run like a well oiled machine to a state where it’s a slop shop.\n\nWhen I moved, I started teaching at a restaurant that’s a god awful mess due to previous classes. I was originally trained to clean up after each class, so this took me by surprise. Everyone who teaches these classes has a kinda “home” restaurant they teach at.\n\nThe restaurant manager was pretty pissed even though I didn’t make the mess, so I let them know that I could slowly clean up the old mess, while I clean up anything new after each class and over the course of a year it would slowly get cleaned up. It looks a lot better but it’s a long slow process.\n\nNo one has helped me and the original mess was not mine. I buy and pay for all the cleaning supplies. I am not paid for extra time cleaning. I get paid per class. There is another person, for the same company who teaches at this same restaurant who has never once helped me. I know for a fact, doesn’t clean after events. \n\nAnother restaurant that’s not my “home” spot has recently complained about the mess in their restaurant. I’ve been there and have seen it, and it’s bad. \n\nMy boss wants me to go and help the two people who teach at this place clean it up. They want me to buy supplies (says they will reimburse me, but never has for anything else), teach them how to clean up and spend my time and energy cleaning up a mess that is not mine, nor my responsibility as it’s not my home restaurant. \n\nAm I the asshole here for not wanting to do this? I feel like I’m getting taken advantage of. \n\nAlso.. they didn’t ask!! Everyone just assumed I’d do this.. plus.. there are like six other artists who teach in the area, yet I’m the only one who’s expected to go “help”. \n\nI already told them what supplies to use and how to go about it. I feel like they are just being lazy and want to put their work on me.. and that irks me pretty badly and makes me want to refuse out of principal.  \n\nI have already said I was “to busy” to take this on, but it seems like that’s not a good enough excuse as I was asked again when I could do this and that it was urgent. \n\nI hate being forced to tell someone that I’m pissed at their actions particularly when I feel like they should know better.\n\nI obvsly need some clarity.. anyone want to weigh in? I’d appreciate it.",

      "description": "I am a senior at a rural Kentucky high school, and one of my classes is beginning piano. Before the school year started, I decided I would try my best to learn an instrument. This class has been great so far, but today was a real struggle for me. We are getting into more complex music, complex for me anyway, and the deadline for playing is looming. I decided I would play today, but I stopped after I realized that my piano teacher wanted me to play on a piano that I had never used before. Even worse, the piano did not make sounds on certain keys. I said, \"I am sorry for being so, you know.\" My teacher said, \"Picky?” \n\nI felt awful, but I really did not want to play on a piano that was subpar and that made me more anxious than I was already. My grade depended on that performance, and I did not want to ruin it. I love learning, but the reality is that a love for learning does not always correlate with getting a good grade. Sad, but true. \n\nSo, AITA, or do you guys/gals think I had a right to be anxious and say no? ",

      "description": "So I’ll start by saying at no point was I hostile. I work in an automotive repair shop and had a mother come in for just a regular oil change, I had no problem with that. She didn’t have an appointment so I couldn’t get her in immediately but she was okay with about an hour wait. The entire time she waited she had her 6 kids (5 of which were between what seemed to be 3 and 7) running around and screaming. I didn’t mention anything because it was the least of my worries but after having come in and out of the waiting room for other customers I noticed there was more and more trash, more than I knew the others had made. I noted how many times she got up to buy more snacks and how the same wrappers were sitting on random chairs. By the time I knew her car would almost be done I let her know and give her the benefit of the doubt just to see if she’d clean up, which she didn’t. She got up, packed up her backpack, got her stroller ready and told all her kids they were leaving. When she was up to pay I took care of her and at the end of the transaction I asked her if she could please clean up  what trash she had since we do our best to take care of her. My exact wording was “ma’am I’m sorry but if it isn’t too much trouble could you please make sure your food trash makes it’s way into the trash been before you head out?”. After I said that she gave me a face of disgust and said “sure, I guess we can clean up the cups the other people left and put it in your full trash can” . The trash can wasn’t full at all either. I was actually pretty take back by the response but I guess I’d be defensive give the context. What surprises me is that my mechanics and co workers said I was an asshole for telling her that. They said the was rude on my part and that the hope she doesn’t come in tomorrow to complain. Am I really the asshole? I felt like I went about it pretty tame and respectfully. I can see that she’s a full time mother with her arms full but I don’t think that makes my request insane.",

      "description": "First post, sorry for any formatting errors.\n\nSome context: we've been dating for two years, I trust her completely and love her to death. I knew nothing sketchy would happen if she went, at least from her. However, it's a different story with the guy. He's a daily visitor in her suite in college and he spent the majority of a semester trying to sleep with another girl in the suite who is also in a committed relationship. From the couple times I've seen him he just seems like a douche only interested in sex. Granted, I hardly know him and I could be wrong, but the first words I heard out of his mouth were about the other girl's p\\*\\*\\*y, to her face, loud enough for the whole room to hear, so I don't think my judgement is unwarranted.\n\nHe lives somewhat close to my girlfriend so over break he asked her if she wanted to go get dinner with him. She asked me if I could go, and not wanting to be controlling, I said yes. But I didn't understand why she'd want to get dinner with a guy like that (who she's repeatedly told me she doesn't like). When I asked her, she just told me she wanted to get to know him better and get some food out of it.\n\nThey went, she had a good time, that was that. I just found it weird, and I'm still kind of surprised we went. I asked a few family members if they found it weird as well, which they did. When she brought it up after, I was found myself surprised to realize that I didn't like that she went, even though I told her she could go. Apparently she talked to her friends as well and none of them found it weird. Is it weird? I know it was the right thing to say yes to her going but AITA for wanting to say no?\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend got dinner with guy from college, kinda wish she hadn't",

      "description": "In our neighborhood the homes that do have driveways are single car driveways and garages for the most part.  My next door neighbors on either side have drive ways. The neighbor directly across the street from me is on a corner lot, so her property essentially runs along 60 feet on her side of the street. She also has one of the few houses with a two car garage. This is all directly across from my house. (One of the biggest lots in this part of the neighborhood). Her front door is not visible to me as it’s on the other side of the street. Her driveway and side of the house face me. \n\nMy boyfriend and I almost always park in the driveway, but since he leaves before me and gets home before me on during the week, we often play musical cars. What happens most often is my Bf parks across the street (on the right side) about 10 feet back from her driveway. For an hour or 2 until I get home and then he moves it behind my car in the drive. \n\nHe drives a pick up that has a long bed. The space between our driveway and our next door neighbors is very tight to park that in and technically illegal because the law is you cannot park within 5 feet of someone’s driveway. (It’s obviously not enforced unless your neighbor cares). I felt it was more courteous to park on the other side of the street where we wouldn’t risk someone having a hard time backing out/being fined if someone didn’t like it. \n\nToday before I got home she came over and asked my boyfriend not to park on her side of the street. BF said he was sorry and explained why he had been parking there and explained it would probably be only for a few hours each day if that and that he would do his best. She kinda skips around that and just asks “can you just not park there anymore?”. He felt she was being a bit pushy and rude. She then proceeds to tell him she thinks our dog looks “too skinny”. Over all he said it was a strange and awkward encounter. \n\nI can’t lie- I’m a bit irked. I told him to just not park there anymore and he’ll just have to squeeze in the spot on our side of the street. (When one of the neighbors isn’t using it). But told him that if he has to park there, well that’s just the way it is. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking SHES being the asshole? I thought it was quite ballsy of her to come over here. Believe me, I know I would be annoyed if someone parked in front of my house everyday and night. But this has maybe happened a few times a week for a few hours and has maybe stayed there over night 5 times. \n\nTL;DR My neighbor basically demanded we not park on her side of the street for a few hours every week with no real explanation as to why. AITA for thinking she’s just being a bitchy neighbor? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": " I was attending an event this evening with a group of friends and my girlfriend. We’ve all been friends for a while and I am teased quite a bit by two people in the group I’ll call R and W. It’s mostly in good fun, but the constant ribbing has really been wearing on me. Due to buying our tickets in advance, my girlfriend and I were seated in a different section from the rest of the group. Before the event, I decided to take a nap and set my alarm to go off an hour before the event was supposed to start. I’m not sure what went wrong, but I found myself waking up to a call from my brother telling me to hurry over because the event was about to start. To my horror, my alarm hadn’t gone off, the event was supposed to be starting just then, and I was going to be late for my date. I only arrived a few minutes late and apologized to my girlfriend, who was understanding about the whole fiasco, but my friends were pretty merciless. They sent this in the group chat:\n\nBrother: Enigma_Protocol you’re a buffoon.\n\nW: Absolute mad lad. Not the good kind of mad.\n\nR: And you wonder why you’re bullied.\n\nI decided to be the bigger man and say that I had screwed up. However, I feel really angry at them for their comments.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like they took it too far?",

      "description": "Bear with me here, I know the title already makes me sound bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some backstory: I recently attended a sold-out performance at my school and I got my tickets really late. This is a musical and in a school so it is NOT a formal performance. I wanted to sit with my friends but all the seats were taken. Fast forward to the day of the performance, I stand nearby waiting to see if the seats will be taken. I did not sit in the seat and just waiting for the performance to start with my friends. Eventually, I realized a lot of seats were empty so I sat down and took my seat. (for the record, no one ever came to claim the seat; I kept checking around me to see if anyone needed it)  \n\n\nNow, this is the part that makes me feel like an asshole. I'm just a rowdy kid in school and I admit I was not the most quiet person while we waiting for the concert to start, but I was dead silent during the concert - I never pulled out my phone or made noise. I leaned forward to tap my friend on the shoulder (we both knew the parts that were being sung and were super excited but we just smiled and continued watching) around twice during the first half of the concert. I never made any noise during the concert or pulled out my phone. Please keep in mind again, that I am not in my normal seat. It's an important detail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the entire first half of the concert, I was not informed by anybody around me to stop moving forward. There were other adults around me and I was not told to stop talking during intermission. Again (sorry if I'm being repetitive, I want to make sure I can give the best recreation of what happens), I was quiet during the whole concert and did not say anything. Intermission comes around and I'm simply hugging my friends. I admit some of my limbs may have went into the \"airspace\" of the person beside me but I never touched him. It was a short hug that lasted a few seconds. I moved back into my seat immediately afterwards. As the second half was about to start, he tells me to go back to my original seat (no one has come to claim it - it was empty from start to finish) because I'm being to distracting. I asked if I was being distracting and he told me to return to my exact seat number (I guess he was listening?) to which I then quickly left to just stand in the back aisle (I didn't feel like sitting). I'm not here to talk about myself but I'm not the most secure person so I wasn't sure if what I did was being rude? I didn't even lean towards him during the concert. I had an aisle-side seat so I leaned my body towards the aisle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to talk to my friends about this but it made me really uncomfortable for some reason, so I played it off. I didn't really know who to ask so here I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you think I missed some important details, please tell me I'll be sure to add it ASAP.** It's my first post on this subreddit so if I also broke any rules, please tell me. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; I was distracting during intermission and I got told to go to my original seat.",

      "description": "TL;DR, my 11 year old niece posted a video of my 3 year old son on Tik Tok, I made her delete it. \n\nLong version: at Thanksgiving this year, my niece took my son into his room and was playing with him. My husband overheard her say, “K, say hi to the camera!” \n\nMy husband asked her if she was posting videos of our son on Tik Tok. She said no. My husband pulled me aside, explained the situation and I asked her. She said, “Yes, but I’ll delete it.” I told her she needed to be sure to delete it. \n\nWe don’t like posting stuff about our son online. Mostly because he can’t really consent, we feel like children are exploited online, and not everyone needs to know every detail about your kid’s life. I will, occasionally post pictures of him to my private Facebook account. We have aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins that live across the country. Sometimes a picture on Facebook is easier than a group message with 20+ people. \n\nAnyway, my niece’s dad sent me an incredibly long message saying we hurt my niece’s feelings and we are being a bit anal and overreacting. \n\nBut am I the asshole?

      "description": "so a while back a big storm hit my city and within a few days we had maybe 2-3 foot snow drifts of thick, dense snow, all the side roads were swamped with snow and the roads were either slush or ice.   \n\n\nI used to leave for work around 6:15am to catch a bus, and it was winter and obviously completely dark outside. I lived on the top of a hill which merged into another road and as i left my house a woman on the adjacent road, at the top of the hill called me over and said she had woken up early to put the heating on in her car, then went back to sleep and when she woke up her battery had died and if i knew how to help her jump the car. I told her i didn't have a car to jump it for her, but i could help her bump start her car - bump starting for anybody who doesn't know is to get the car moving in 1st gear, with the clutch down, then as the car is rolling you pull your foot off the clutch and try igniting the engine and most times, it'll start.   \n\n\nI explained how to do it to her and offered to jump in and do it, she said no, she would do it if i pushed because i'm a big dude. i kept saying to her, \"you have 1 shot at this, remember, put it in 1st, then slowly turn the key while you're taking your foot off the clutch when you're in motion\" she said \"yep! got it, let's go!\" so i push her car, she rolls to the bottom of the hill and her car doesn't start.   \n\n\n  \nI walk down and ask what happened, she said \"i did what you said, kept it in neutral, tried to press the clutch and turn the ignition, it didn't work\". at this point the car was now in a dip in the road, with about 2 feet of snow infront of her right wing and she's telling me \"just push it further, i'll get it this time\", i say there's no way i can push her car out of the snow, up an incline and get enough momentum to get it bumped. she starts shouting \"YOU got me in this mess, you need to push me out\". so i go over and start pushing as hard as i can and the car doesn't move an inch. my feet are slipping on the ice, so i stop. go over and say \"it's pointless, you may as well get a bus\". so she starts to scream at me saying i'm going to cost her her job and whatever else. i say sorry again, then walk off.  \n\n\n  \nLater that night, i've finished work and i'm back at home, her car is still sat at the bottom of this hill now slightly more buried in the snow because it continued to snow all day. I get a knock on the door and it's her husband saying his wife had to miss work, is very upset, and that because i got her car stuck at the bottom of the road, she subsequently got a ticket for blocking a road and that i was responsible for pushing her car BACK UP THE HILL in the snow, but also responsible for paying her ticket and helping her get some juice back into her battery. I just laughed at him and shut my door. since then a lot of my neighbours are very hostile towards me.  \n\n\nam i the asshole? ",

      "description": "Alright, this is kind of a long story but I'll make it short as possible. So, I am (23m) about to graduate college and I will have a good accounting job that pays nice once I graduate. My parents are divorced but my mother remarried. My step father has two daughters that are quite a bit older than me (42 and 45) and they are both married and have two kids of their own. The kids ages range from 6 to 15 years old and then I have one other biological sister (32) that is married and has a new born baby. This group of my family goes on a big family vacation every 2 years and we normally rent out a nice large house to fit us all for a week. They have already started planning our next vacation which will take place the summer of 2020. Up till now, my mother and step father would pay for the cost of the house for the week and then the rest of us were responsible for food, travel, and activities. Now, that I will be graduated and have a steady paying job my parents decided that we should all split the cost of the house for the next vacation. The family all agreed, my step siblings and sister all have good jobs so the money isn't really an issue. However, this is where I start having a problem, I am single and as mentioned earlier there is a huge age difference between me and my other siblings and their kids. So, I don't really connect with them because we are in very different stages of life and I'm not great with kids, nor can I really tolerate them for a week. Also, no one in my family really likes to drink or smoke (pot), which is fine but it's something I like to do while on vacation. Additionally, the family all wants to go to Disney world but I have already been numerous times and I have no desire going back. Basically, I am always the odd man out on these trips and I am tired of it. I just can't justify spending $700 dollars for the house plus all the other expenses of a vacation for a trip that I know I will not enjoy. So am I the asshole for not wanting go on this family vacation and if not how do I tell my family that and not come off as a big F-you to the family?",

      "description": "Here's the thing. Back when my dad and my mom got married, mom moved into my father's house, which is usually crowded with my paternal relatives: grandpa, grandma, bunch of uncles and aunts. \n\nMy mom was seriously maltreated by those people. It's pretty complicated, but to put it simply, they didn't respect my mom at all. They would always mocked and scolded my mom for making tiny mistakes. Mom said they abandoned her, which made her mentally stressful even now. My dad was kinda naïve, so he did little to stand up for her.\n\nBack to reality, when my family has moved to a decent house and is financially independent, mom usually bitterly talks about her past and backbite those people. Mom feigns cordiality whenever she meet those people, and comes home with tons of insults, cursing them badly. She throws tons of bad words at them. She tells it to anyone she can find, which gives her comfort. When she tells it to me, she praises her upbringing of me, our family's 'superiority' over those people, and how fine she is right now with all the stuffs she accumulated.\n\nNow I'm a pacifist, and though I do hate those people for giving my mom hard times. I do get angry at her for telling shit to them. I feel like she is the bad one here and she isn't gonna be anywhere nicer than those people. I told her to stop cursing them at my face, and she started cursing me instead.\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, this happened 4 years ago. But I didn’t tell many people about this story, and looking back at it I kind wonder if I was truly an asshole, or if I was justified, since it felt like the person in question deserved what they got. So this is the story:\n\nMy first boyfriend and I were together for 4 years. Towards the end (the last year, maybe a little longer), he became *very* abusive. Not physically, but emotionally and mentally, and even academically. I became really depressed and had to go on medication for anxiety. I cried all the time. He threatened me if I didn’t have sex with him, try and “punish” me by taking things away, like planned trips, etc. His narcissism grew stronger. He didn’t care about my needs, my feelings, my opinions... However, prior to all of this, I spoiled the ever loving shit out of him. I wanted him to be happy. I got him so many concert tickets, VIP’s, merchandise... swamped him gifts for special occasions. Etc. Towards the end I feel like he was partially using me for my money. \n\nANYWAY. Eventually we break up for good. I felt so relieved. But 3 months later he messages me with huge apologies and how he made a mistake. Begged for another chance. I kept saying no. But this time... I kinda thought of an idea to get back at him for all the pain he caused me. \n\nHe asked to meet up for dinner just to talk. We’d pay for our own things. I agree to it. I purposely leave my wallet at home, make it sound like a mistake. I pretend to realize this after the check comes. He’s annoyed, but he pays. Then, we’re in his car. We start making out and after a while he’s all hot and bothered. After it’s obvious that he thinks he’s going to score, I pull away and tell him that I want to go home. I made it sound like I thought it was a bad idea, but I actually planned to do this. He was angry. Drove me home. \n\nI thought this would finally make him leave me alone. But he didn’t. still got messaged two times a month. Eventually he stopped though and got the hint. \n\nAITA for getting back at an awful person who deserved it? ",

      "description": "So, I've used this key before and I'll use it again\n\nMe - 14(m)\n\nX - my crush from a couple of months ago 14(f)\n\nY - her friend who is convinced I have a crush on her (I don't) 14(f)\n\nZ - a mutual friend 14(m)\n\nBasically, Y makes any sort of interaction with X downright impossible, and it's already hard because I'm an awkward fuck but if I'm trying to talk to X, Y will butt in and say something like \"why don't you love X anymore?!?!??\" 100% serious and make both of us feel awkward.\n\nX knows I liked her, she was the first girl I ever asked out in fact, but we get along relatively well and I haven't liked her for several months. She is really nice though and I want to be friends with her. Y is my obstacle.\n\nThis all came to a head when one of our mutual friends made a rather sexual joke about Me and Y, it was weird, but they're friends so I don't think it's a big deal. However, she heard her name and pressured me for 25 minutes to tell her, and eventually I gave in. She knew that Z was the one that told the joke, but she called ME disgusting (specifically me btw, I asked if she meant him, and she specified that it was me) so obviously I was peeved, but didn't take it out on her, because I'm practically allergic to beef.\n\nWell, turns out, a week later, she's claiming that she never said anything and I was lying, but she still acknowledged my reaction, so is basically stating that I got angry over quite literally NOTHING.\n\nAs soon as she was out of earshot, I said to Z that Y was a gobby bitch (that's British talk for big mouthed) and he called me out for it, saying that it was messed up I was so mean over something so small even though it was his fault, so AITA?",

      "description": "Hi all, this has been weighing on my mind all day, so any help would be greatly appreciated. So a bit of background, for the last week or so my wife has been in an argument with another woman on Facebook over the video that has been doing the rounds of the guy gaming and hitting his girlfriend when she asks him to get off his game. Her stance is that while he shouldn't have hit her, she shouldn't have kept on antagonizing him if she knows he is abusive. The other ladies stance is that he shouldn't have hit her regardless and is completely blameless. \n\nWhen the argument first started I told my wife that I agree with her view, thinking that would be the end of it. However as the week has gone by every couple of days she is on there fighting with this person and I'm constantly hearing about it. I personally don't see the point in arguing with someone over the internet for so long, opinions are never going to change and hearing the same thing over and over again is bringing me down. Last night it came to a head, we were watching a family movie with our daughters and she was on and off her phone, again arguing with this lady. After the movie finished she started going on about it again and this time it just rubbed me up the wrong way. I felt like she was constantly seeking validation for her point of view and I can't see the point of rehashing the same thing over and over, so I snapped at her.\n\nFor the record I understand I am the asshole for snapping at her, I said something along the lines of \"I really don't see the point of this argument and I really couldn't care less about it\" She immediately got pissed at me (fair enough) and went off about how couples are supposed to talk and i don't listen to her. She went to bed without saying goodnight and was still grumpy with me this morning. Sorry for the wall of text, what i need to know is AITA for not being more supportive ad not caring more about her argument with this lady? Any point of view will be greatly appreciated!",

      "description": "So a bit of backstory here, as every post in this subreddit goes. Girlfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years now. She broke up with me about 3 times so far, it isn't as horrible as it sounds so don't judge her too harshly yet. Basically she was forced to break up with me for one of those times and the other two she did out of fear of her parents finding out. \n\nSo the third time she broke up with me, about a year and a half ago, I got into a really bad place emotionally and well, became a bit of an asshole and dated a rebound for like a few days. Then got back together with gf cuz rebound got together with her ex and that's a whole other story. I acknowledge I was the asshole here but both of us are pretty much over that episode.\n\nAnyways, since then, gf has had some understandable trust issues with me and I've had some trust issues with her, but overall it's been great and we've been growing together and learning and stuff. So about like 6 months ago, I moved away and doing long distance rn.\n\nNow over the past few weeks, she's been talking to friends there, both hers and mine, about how I cheated on her by dating someone else as a rebound like I mentioned earlier, and how I gave another girl a gift who's literally one of my best friends but gf has been talking shit about it and well, I had enough of it. \n\nToday I snapped and told her that she can continue talking to others, because it helps her overcome those issues and I want what's best for her, and she can rant to me as well. But I told her to just stop telling me whenever she talks to her friends about me, because that really hurts me.\n\n\nAITA for snapping at her about that?",

      "description": "“It’s just a prank bro”\n\ntl;dr at the bottom\n\nA little background on this: I am a college student and live in Texas. This semester , I met this guy in one of my classes and found out we had similar interests and he met some of my other friends and we all started hanging out. He is from India but has been in the U.S. for some time, and calls himself an Indian version of “Jim” from the office because he likes to prank people (and he thinks he’s very smooth.) \n\nMost of his pranks on people are harmless and they tend to have a good laugh or at least be indifferent about them. But lately, his pranks have been going a little too far - being not so fun for the person receiving them and actually kind of making him a jerk. He has also grown increasingly arrogant and I am starting to not be able to be around him. \n\nI thought about talking to him about it as that’s what I would want somebody who calls me a friend to do for me. So I invited him to go get some sonic one day. He shows up to my house and I get in his car. Turns out, he already has sonic (?) for us and my sonic bag is in the floorboard of the passenger seat. So I’m like “oh. Well, thanks for buying” (probably didn’t know exactly what I wanted, but whatever, it’s a nice gesture I guess). He says “let’s eat it at this place on campus.” So we start driving there. \n\nAt this point I’m getting a little nervous about the confrontation. I am not a confrontational person and I am also a very stoic and non emotional person, and more emotional people don’t always respond well to that. While I am thinking, I immediately feel a sharp pain on the inside of my leg, near my ankle. I jump and look down to see a FUCKING snake attached just above my ankle. \n\nBeing from Texas, I see snakes every once in a while and while I’m not necessarily afraid of them, I certainly don’t like messing with them or being around them. Granted, this was a baby snake (maybe a Garter snake). So I start flipping the fuck out since this thing is gnawing on my ankle, and I don’t really know what to do. I try grabbing it to which it releases for a split second before biting my leg again. I try to grab near its head and it turns and bites my hand before releasing and falling to the floorboard. \n\nIn the mean time, Indian Jim is DYING laughing. I kept yelling for him to pull over and he doesn’t. He is driving so I can not get out of the car so I step on the snake with my shoe as hard as I can and grind it underneath. From my leg and hand, little blood pools are forming. My friend is almost crying from laughing so hard at this point and finally pulls over. \n\nLike i said, I am usually a fairly non emotional person. But this just got to me. I started shaking from rage. And he saw my face and started to cool down on the laughter and said “what?! It’s just a prank dude - don’t worry - it’s harmless.” \n\nI BLEW UP. “Are you fucking kidding me dude? A FUCKING SNAKE IS NOT A PRANK!” Out of anger and among other things, I said if this is his idea of friendship, he needs to go back to India because he’s not going to make it here. This came out pretty harsh. \n\nI get out of the car, tell him to fuck off, and call my grandma (long story) to come and get me. Later, my other friend and Indian Jim’s roommate who knew I was going to talk to him about his behavior texts me and says Indian Jim did not take our talk very well and that whatever I said “devastated” him and that I was a racist. He suggested I apologize to him and reassure him. I’m cutting him out and will likely not speak to him again.\n\nNo doubt the guy should not have let a snake attack me, but is there any chance I took this too far? AITA?\n\n\nTL;DR former friend put baby snake in sonic bag as a prank. I told him to find friends in India and cut him out as a friend.",

      "description": "Basically, I have a very close friend at school who is the most organized, kind, neat, early, polite (etc) person I have ever met. And I don't know why, but the way she acts just bugs me a lot. For example, when my friend group is eating lunch, she'll finish like 10 minutes early, already get packed up, says \"What time is it?\" (EVERYDAY AT EXACTLY 10:28 WHEN BREAK ENDS AT 10:35!) and just go off, my friend following while I'm left alone struggling to pack up. Happens every break and lunch, every lesson, every day. \n\nAnother example is how organized she is. One day I forgot my eraser at home and turned to her during history to ask her for one. She looked at me like I was an idiot for not having everything on hand, and slowly gave me the eraser. \n\nShe's also a lot more successful than me, being in the highest set in Math AND (newly) English when I read and work my butt off just to stay in the top set in English. She just kinda slides in, and it bugs me so, so much. She's so neat and tidy, never forgets everything and every teacher loves, LOVES her. \n\nShe literally RUNS to the next lesson when the bell rings, and I tell her (and my other friends,) 'hold up! Gimme a sec!' and sometimes the others do, but never, never her. It's like she thinks that if she isn't 5 minutes early, she'll die.\n\nAnd it annoys me a lot, to see how great she is, when everyone else is struggling. Sometimes I wonder if she has EVER messed up. And I feel like an asshole. I just need to know if I really am being one?",

His 14 year old son often comes on hunting trips or to watch sports games with me and my son. \n\nA weekend recently he stayed with us and told my wife and I about his new girlfriend, later he pulled me aside and asked if I could give him some condoms as he didnt have any and couldn't get any. \n\nI felt flattered that he trusted me enough to ask. I gave him a box, because I'd rather he had them to be safe if he needed them. I told him I'm not condoning any decisions he makes around being sexually active and that in only giving them because I want him to be safe if he does choose to. I also told him he should talk to his dad. \n\nAIATA because I'm not going to tell his very religious dad? He'll be pissed I gave him the condoms and he won't see it from my perspective. His view is his kids will not have sex until they are married. Period. It'll also ruin the trust I've built up with his kid, who may not come back to me if he needs help in the future. We also love the family and I think this may be big enough for our friend to cut us off.",

      "description": "I’m on mobile so sorry for the format, but let’s get into it nonetheless. \n\nFor context, my roommate, management, and I had a meeting in the past agreeing not to bring people and having them stay. However, the caveat is that if my roommate were to bring people over he would need to give a 24 hour heads up and not to mention, it was stated in the resident’s contract. \n\nI initially didn’t really care if my roommate brought over people, but the case changed when I found out that one of his “friends” went through my stuff and stole things from me. After that incident with a combination of other issues such as waking me up by walking in at 5 in the morning, I put my foot down and told my roommate he couldn’t bring people over. As I’m typing this right now, my roommate brought over the same “friend” that stole from me in the past and honestly it pisses me off. I’m no saint myself but I have a set of standards that includes not rummaging through all of someone’s stuff and stealing. \n\nBesides the point, my roommate claims to have texted me at 4 in the morning bringing someone over but I was past out by then. When I confronted my roommate why he brought someone over, he claimed that his “friend” left her keys in her dorm and she had “nowhere” to stay. I would usually be sympathetic, but given my history with my roommate’s friend  I couldn’t give a flying fuck abut her situation. I apologize if my story is confusing as I’m typing this at 6 in the morning. \n\nBut please tell me Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I [M19] am in the US and right in the South. I live with my family who have been here for over 30 years, and we're deep in the woods with the closest main road being over 2 miles away. One of the only 3 neighbors we have anywhere in our vicinity owns a very *large* amount of dogs. That's not inherently bad or anything provided you can care for them, but they are treated terribly. Flea infested, starved, and all of them are chained up outside to trees, basketball hoops, and anything else you can loop a chain around. The area isn't cleaned and the dogs are never taken to the vet or ever played with. When we had hurricane warnings, or our dam broke and there was major flooding possible going to happen in our area they always left them tied up, even with days to try to move them to a safer place. I remember one of their dogs getting hit by a car because he was the only 2 they ever had off leash and he had a huge gash on his leg. He was never taken to the vet and I tried to clean it and wrap it up with gauze but the next day I guess he tore it off. He does about a month later for \"unknown reasons\". This dog was still a puppy, under a year old. He was leashed up after he killed one of my dogs before he died, even though we asked them to tie him up because he was very aggressive to our dogs. They swore he wasnt, and barely apologized after their dog murdered ours. She even made sick jokes that they would \"bash the weak pups\" because she saw me saying that I was vegan as a personal attack or something.\n\nTheir other dog they keep off a chain is a girl, they ALWAYS had her pregnant. The only way they tried to 'prevent' this was to put every female dog they had who went into heat into this tiny cage that was full of feces and other fluids. Then anytime they came pregnant they would put the mother and pups into one of those outdoor dog fences in kennels, they never cleaned these and the pups were full of worms from never going to the vet. She also found a female dog off the road and told my mom that she wanted to keep her around for puppies and replace one of her females with her. \n\nThis seems like a perfect reason for calling APS, but my family gets outraged when I bring it up. They tell me that they've known the family for like 30yrs and \"yes it's bad, but they help us out!\" Or that \"you're just going to cause drama, this is a small town, nothing is going to happen to them.\" Our neighbors just see me as an angry vegan kid that showed up and are starting to start a fuss. I dont really care what they do, I dont like them eating animals but I keep my mouth shut because it's not my place. However this isn't a vegan issue this is just straight up animal abuse!\n\nI really want to do this and try to at least help the dogs somewhat, but my family thinks I'm an ass for even trying to say their friend is abusing animals.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "title": "AITA for sending a confrontational email to my father-in-law for encouraging his daughters to interact with their brother after he(the brother) had sexually abused them?",
      "description": "To preface, I[22M] just got recently married to my wife[20F] yet we don’t live together quite yet. She is living with her parents and her 4 siblings about 1000 miles from where I am. I am in the Marines and we intend to move in together when she finishes up her semester of school.\n\nA few months ago my wife was discussion abuse in one of her classes and she developed a faint memory of something that had happened in the past. She brought it up with me and told me that she vaguely remembers her eldest brother telling her to strip for him. Because he did a favor for her that she owed a favor to him. He was in 7-9th grade(no one can remember exactly when apparently), and she was in 3rd-5th grade. \n\nConfused and disturbed by these memories she confided in her older sister[22F] and her older sister confirmed. Apparently the oldest sister was also sexually abused by him around the same time but she didn’t tell anyone for fear of “splitting the family up.” \n\nUpon this coming to light, the parents addressed the brother and he confessed. He also confessed that he abused the youngest sister[20F]. He even touched the youngest one.(she had no recollection of this). \n\nThe parents sat my wife and her sisters down and told them that it was their responsibility to forgive him and to move it. The father encouraged that they interact with him. This made me irate. I was confused by all of this and i sent him this email: \n\n“Good Morning,\n\n\n\tIt has come to my attention that (the eldest brother) had molested your three daughters. I am sending this email to express my concern and to obtain some clarity of the situation. \n\n\tFrom my understanding, he was in 7th-9th grade and he abused his authority as the older sibling to receive sexual gratification from his sisters. He allegedly went as far as to touch the youngest. It is disturbing to learn that he is not only permitted, but also encouraged to spend time with the victims. It is equally disturbing that there is an attempt to normalize his behavior and to implore the daughters to interact with their perpetrator.\n\n\tIt is certainly the case that your daughters will experience emotional and sexual trauma from doing this. All of the girls have been expressively distraught. There is sound reason that the legal system separates the abused from their abusers. The girls' respect for authority is what is silencing them and their respect for authority is what allowed them to be abused.\n\n\tI’ve heard the case be made that he was too young and naive to understand the damage he was causing. That is not the consensus of experts. I’ve researched the topic and I’ve only come across sources that express how inappropriate that behavior is. \n\nExample: \"However, a fourteen-year-old boy who wants to look at his five-year old sister’s genitals is not showing normal curiosity. You need to ask why he wants to do this.\"\nhttp://www.ksacc.ca/docs/sibling_sexual_abuse.pdf?LanguageID=EN-US\n\n\tEven if you exempt (the eldest brother) of fault, it is still likely damaging to your daughters to live with him. \n\n\tIn addition, I’ve gotten the opinion of a couple therapists and they have a serious concern about the situation. According to one of them, it is incredibly unlikely that (the eldest brother) has resolved his problem without any counseling or treatment. Also, they’ve emphasized the importance of the two parties not living together. \n\n\tI was also informed, by the aforementioned therapist, that there are groups of people who maintain a position of authority that are legally obligated to report all accounts of known sexual abuse. One of them being pastors. You may be at risk of having your ordainment revoked should you continue to conceal these events from the authorities. \n\nhttps://www.pa-fsa.org/Mandated-Reporters/Understanding-Mandated-Reporting/Who-are-Mandated-Reporters  \n\nhttps://www.pa-fsa.org/Mandated-Reporters/Understanding-Mandated-Reporting/What-are-a-Mandated-Reporters-Responsibilities\n\n\tYour concern about people outside of the family knowing is troublesome to me. The question as to whether this should be public or not is up to the daughters, in my opinion. Also, I think that it's important that they understand the severity of the situation and feel comfortable seeking help outside of the family. I am concerned that they are going to adopt a warped conception of what has happened that will negatively affect their families in the future. \n\n\tI agree that it is important for them to forgive, but I am not convinced that (the eldest brother) has even moved on from these tendencies (given that he was never reprimanded or received counseling). Our God is one of forgiveness, but also of just punishment. \n\n\tThis comes from a place of love and compassion. (My wife) is distracted and upset by this, so hopefully we can find resolve. Counseling would be beneficial for everyone involved, so I will be notifying CPS and The PA Family Support Alliance.\n\nSincerely, \nA Frustrated Husband”\n\nI sent this email after my wife said that she was disgusted to live with him and considered living in her car. The parents motioned like they were going to address the problem but they never did, they continually gave her the run around.\n\nIn response to the email my father in law wanted to skype with me. In the call he was civil but he explained to me how the behavior by his son was normal. He compared it to boys peeking into girls locker rooms out of sexually curiosity. But when he did it, my wife was expressively upset(crying) and he was willing to watch her suffer. To me, this is much more disturbing. \n\nI called CPS and they conducted an investigation. My mother in law took personal offense to my calling and now she is upset with me. CPS said that they should all consult with a therapist but because most the parties involved aren’t children anymore then they can’t do anything. This affirmed the fathers stance that this behavior was normal and nothing about the situation was resolved. My wives sisters agreed to move on and carry on with him, now my wife feels a bit alone in her disgust. \n\nAfter another month or so I sent them any second and last email, I said:\n\n“Good Evening, \n\n\n\tI would like to take the opportunity to follow up on our last conversation. True to my word, I had contacted child protective services and expressed my concern to them. I reported all of the details that you and I had discussed in our call. In doing so, it became clear that no one had reported it, contrary to your prior claims. From my understanding, you are upset with me for reporting it, but may I remind you that as a parent, and a pastor, it is your duty to report cases of sexual abuse. You are a mandatory reporter. \n\t\n\tDuring the investigation, it was revealed to the representive that the molestation took place as a direct result of (the eldest brothers) inability to restrain himself after he lost access to pornography. This is not in line with the previous theory that this took place for reasons other than for sexual gratification. It is obvious that this was an act of perversion that is not normal for adolescent boys. Even if this theory did have any validity, (the eldest brother) delibertly abused his authority and watched his sister cry as he demanded that she strip for him. The action is reprehensible no matter how you paint it. \n\n\tYou had asked me what you could do to help (my wife) I think that this article would help you with that tremendously. The topics include the following:  \n\nDenying or minimizing the abuse\nBlaming and shaming the victim\nTelling survivors to move on and stop focusing on the past\nShutting down their voices\nOstracizing survivors\n\nRefusing to “take sides”\nPressuring survivors to make nice with their abusers\n\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/lib/7-ways-family-members-re-victimize-sexual-abuse-survivors/\n\nAlso, I think that you are doing her a disservice by trivializing her trauma and blaming other factors such as her work or her relationship. She is a victim of sexual abuse who is living with her abuser and thats the reason that she is distraught. She hardly feels any sympathy from those she lives with and she feels that it is her responsibility to “get over it” for the sake of the family. She is handling it remarkably well, and she is capable of making the decisions that are best for her. If she doesn’t seek a relationship with Julian, then don’t encourage one. \n\n\tLet me know that you have received this. If you wish to discuss further then do so via email. \n\n\tEverything that I have done is for the protection of (my wife) because she’s having a hard time coping right now. I am acting on my own devices and she should not be held accountable for anything that I say. \n\n(My name)”\n\nIt’s important to mention that they wanted me to join them for Thanksgiving but for me to conceal what happened from the rest of the family. They’re adamant about not letting anyone know. \n\nAfter this second email was sent my wife was livid. She attacked me and said that there was no reason to send this email. She called me malicious and attacked me. \n\nWe’ve since resolved our tension and we’re on good terms. But her parents never responded to me. Around Christmas they hid all the presents and put the police’s phone numbers around the house because they feared that I was violent and the father threatened a restraining order after that email. My wife says that it warranted a restraining order. I think that he father is emotionally manipulative and her was fear monger omg to make his family against me. I think he’s narcissistic and unable to defend his stance morally. AITA?\n\nSorry if some of this is incoherent. There’s a lot of details. I’ll answer any remaining questions though! \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole)",

      "description": "This happened one week ago, but today some developments came up.\n\nBasically, the 31st, me and my girlfriend went to a party with some friends of mine. The party was organized by an old classmate, ex male bestfriend of my girlfriend. He didn't know she would came and when he realized they started talking and I left them alone to catch things up. At the end of the party she came to me and told me how she had never been so drunk in her life and she could have done something she would have regretted for life (but she couldn't remember what).\n\nThe next day, this old classmate asks her out, to catch up better. I'm obviously happy for her, since she hasn't had friends of her own for years.\n\nThe following Sunsay they go out, but, before he picks her up, she tells me she will write me all night in order for me to check if everything was going smoothly.\n\nThen she writes me when he arrives and stop, nothing is written to me for the next 4 hours. I start to worry and to write her and call her: no answer.\nSince I was worried I call her friend. He doesn't answer.\nI call again my girlfriend and she answers:\n\nBasically, when he arrived, he took her phone and told her that it was their night out so they didn't need the phone. During the \"date\" she asked him for the phone but he didn't let her. At the end, while they were driving back, she had his phone and saw my call, so she told him and asked her phone. He got angry and told her that I was toxic and overprotective. She didn't say anything and got home.\n\nToday he writes her again, asking if she was still \"at house arrest\".\n\nSo my question is, since it's my word against his, am I the asshole for calling them during their night out? I'm obviously mad at him, not my girlfriend. \n\nTl,dr: girlfriend goes out with old friend, promises to check on me, doesn't answer, I call him and he gets angry. ",

      "description": "I don't like children. I never have, and the fact that my older sister had a baby at 16 and I had to live with it for five years didn't help. Mostly this is not a problem because, aside from the occasional annoying restaurant or movie theater experience, I don't really *have* to interact with kids much. My boyfriend is also firmly childfree, as are most of our friends, so we just sort of live our own lives and don't hang out around kids.\n\nOne of my coworkers just had a baby and has been gone on maternity leave, and she visited the office with her baby the other day. Now let me make it clear, I'm not some grouch. She is one of those people who was born to be a mom and I'm really happy for her. So we had a mini party when she visited and I made a little cake and we were all happy to see her. I was asking her questions about baby stuff and how everything was going and being part of it, it wasn't like I was just sitting off in the corner brooding.\n\nWell, she started passing around the baby for everyone to hold, and when it got to me I just said \"Oh, no thanks!\" and you would think I had suggested that we throw the baby out the window. Now, the actual mom didn't say anything about it but I got jumped on by everyone else.\n\n\"Oh my gooooood don't be rude,\"\n\n\"You can't hold the baby for five seconds?\"\n\n\"You don't have to be so dramatic.\"\n\nI really don't think I was being rude or dramatic for not wanting to hold the baby, especially since I was genuinely participating with everything else and I was polite about saying no thanks. I just really do not want to hold a baby and I don't see why it should be a requirement to not be rude. It's not like I'm saying it's not a good baby for me not wanting to hold it.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for letting my brother miss his exam after I refused to drive him?",
      "description": "I’m a 20 year old guy with a twin brother. As such, we both started learning to drive at the same time, and have had exactly the same amount of chance and opportunity to practice to drive and get our licences. I am on my Ps (for those outside Australia, that is a provisional license. It means I can drive without supervision but have to have 0 alcohol.) while my brother is still on his Ls, with only 5 hours practice completed out of the 100 needed to pass. \n\nAs I’m the only one of us able to drive, and our mom works all day, I end up giving him rides all the time. This is everything from a 5 minute trip the bus stop when he thinks he’s gonna be late to catch a bus, to two hour there-and-back trips to drop him off to visit his friends in the city we used to live in a couple of years ago. There have been very, very few times that I have refused to pick him up. There have been multiple occasions, one just a week ago, when he has woken me up at between 1 and 4 AM to go pick him up from wherever he is. And I have done it. I once had to leave a date with my girlfriend half way because he was drunk and said he was feeling unsafe. I am happy to do this, because I would rather know he is safe than have him in danger, even if it is annoying. I don’t charge him any money, even gas money, either. Okay, general backstory over.\n\nRecently I dropped him off at a friends house in the morning. He brought a bag so I thought he might stay overnight. At 11PM, as I ask halfway through my brush teeth/shower routine, i get a series of calls and texts, but I don’t answer or read them cause my phones in the other room. When I read them, it’s a series of gradually more irritated texts from my brother asking me to pick him up. I sigh, accept this won’t be the night I get around to man scaping, and go to get him. \n\nThe city I live in is hell to drive in anyway, and he gave pretty bad directions. I get lost cause it’s in a part of the city I don’t really go to often, and there is also traffic. It takes me an hour to find him, when google maps says the trip should be 35 minutes. \n\nHe opened the door and got in. No ‘hello’, no ‘thank you’, no eye contact or acknowledgement. He immediately put in his earphones and looked forward, apparently not speaking to me. I didn’t say anything but about halfway back made a comment about it, and he made a comment back, and it escalated. When I got home, at half past midnight, I am fucking pissed. I decide then that I’m not going to be driving him around anymore. I’ve told him I’m done driving him around before, but I always end up giving in, but this time I’m really committed to stick to it. \n\nFast forward a couple of days and he has an exam at uni. He asks me at 8am for a lift. His exam is at 10:30. I say no. He asks again and again, every like ten minutes. And I say no ever time. The bus to his uni takes an hour, and the drive is 30 minutes. The bus comes every ten minutes and is very easy to catch. At this stage, he still has enough time to get the bus with plenty of time to get to the exam room. He keeps asking for a lift and I keep saying no. Eventually I see the time getting closer and tell him he better catch the bus or he’ll be late. He says “No, you’re driving me.” I tell him no. The hour bus window closes, and he’s still hanging around. At 40 minutes before his test, he tells me we really have to go. I tell him I’m really, really not driving him. When it gets to 30 minutes to it, he’s switching between enraged and threatening and begging. I lock my door and put in my earphones and stick to my guns of not taking him, and he ends up missing his exam.\n\nHe’s furious with me, and tells our mom. She tries to stay out of conflicts like this so refuses to take anyone’s side. This is why I turn to reddit. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr. My brother missed an exam after I wouldn’t drive him to uni. The whole reason I stopped driving him is cause he acted like an ass.",

So we’re talking about a months work of prep. I was booked for 6 days which are typically 12 or more hour days. I should also note that my son is 13, and has recently discovered these movies. He was an instant fan. Had this not had an age requirement, he’d have tried to book the job, too. \n\nYesterday, my son fell during gym class and broke his arm at the growth plate. It was confirmed today that he will need surgery. Tomorrow morning. Bright and early. \n\nMy call times (the time you need to arrive) have typically been around 2-3pm. His surgery is scheduled for 6:30 and he is expected to be back home no later than 10. No question I’m there for the surgery. I asked him if he wants me to stay home tomorrow to take care of him. He said he is fine with me going in, since he’ll be sleeping anyway. He’s excited that he gets to brag that his mom is in the film. Keep in mind, his dad and younger sister will be home with him, and my parents live 10 minutes away (we are very close). \n\nI know he realistically will just be resting. And we could use all the extra hours of work we can get now that we have a few hospital bills. And I’m really loving this movie job. But I feel like I’d be a shitty mom if I went. WIBTA?",

      "description": "Our daughter is still too young to use a phone, so that's why it is hypothetical. The title maybe doesn't totally capture what I'm trying to say.\n\nMy parents believe part of respecting your elders is that grandchildren call grandparents, not the other way around. I had a strict time each month that I spoke to my grandmother for 10 minutes (very long-distance was too expensive for more than that at the time).and she said, \"Well, phones work both ways,\" and I told her that, in effect, no, they don't. This made her uncomfortable and here we are.\n\n\\[Since I know people will ask: Yes, my family is from a traditional culture with an emphasis on filial piety. That's about as much detail as I'm willing to give.\\]\n\nMy wife on the other hand believes that it is 100% the responsibility of older family members to forge a relationship with kids and says she would be uncomfortable forcing our daughter to call her grandparents without more \"reciprocity\" or \"effort\" from my parents. What makes her really uncomfortable is that they would literally rather let months go by without talking to my daughter (or any of her grandkids) than pick up the phone and call her to talk. They would also be furious at the blatant display of disrespect that my daughter didn't call (or that we didn't make her call). My wife says that this means it is about a power play, not love. I think that's an unfairly harsh characterization of something that is just different and extremely common in my parents' culture.\n\nTo be fair, my wife walks the walk, and it's definitely her upbringing. She has lots of nieces and nephews that she actively goes out of her way to text, send small gifts and letters to, call on the phone, plan special trips to see them, etc. She says that she would never expect the onus to be on them for forming the relationship and it makes her uncomfortable to enforce something she doesn't believe in with our daughter. Similarly, her parents already send our daughter small gifts, writer her letters, etc., etc., and they will definitely initiate phone calls and communication with our daughter.\n\nHonestly, I think it's a pretty standard cultural difference. We've been through a lot of those, but this is the first time we've discussed one that will directly affect my daughter. My parents will show love and effort, but just in a different way than my wife's western upbringing. I think it's good for my daughter to eventually realize that different people live in different ways, even within her own family. I think the diversity is good. Also I'd like my daughter to have a relationship with my parents and she definitely wouldn't if I tried to force them to subscribe to my wife's more individualistic philosophies.",

      "description": "So GF and I have been together for a couple years. We have had a couple of issues with her being suspicious, and even accusatory towards me with regards to cheating. For the record, I have never cheated on her, I have never even come close to anything that approaches cheating, I love and adore her. That being said, she has been in 3 long term relationships before me, and each of those partners cheated on her at some point, so now she has a bit of a concern with that. We have had a couple of big fights about this before, once where she broke down in tears because she found a stash of condoms in a drawer. It took half an hour for me to calm her down and finally get her to look at the expiration dates on them to show her that they were from long before we dated. I am not cheating, I just never fucking clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, last night I get a random text from a number I do not know. When I checked the area code it was from Baltimore, we live on the west coast. There was no writing in the text, just a picture of a girl smiling, showing her boobs. I was pretty shocked, and when she asked who had texted I said my mom. I quickly responded back to the lady telling her she must have the wrong number then deleted the text convo. I feel guilty for lying but I see nothing good coming from telling the GF. Lying is wrong, and I feel bad, but I know that telling her would have just played on her insecurities and caused her to worry, or even worse caused a fight. I asked a friend who said I should tell her, but that seems even dumber than telling her in the first place, because now it will look like I am covering something up making it an even bigger issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

We’ve been binging House M.D. and of course there’s a pregnancy complication episode where a dad is asked to choose between the baby and the mother (the mother was going to die either way it was just a little quicker). My wife said that she’d want me to choose the baby if it came to that. I told her there was no fucking way I would do that, we could have another baby but I could never have another her. She got all mad and questioned my commitment to being a father and I said I’m committed to being a father but I’m more committed to being a husband. This argument went on forever.  I told her that if she was brain dead or was going to die either way I would choose the baby but otherwise it’s her She said basically said what she wants over and over and I said I’m not spending another 50 or years without her. This is all because I love her more than anything else in the world. We’re still in disagreement over this completely hypothetical situation.

      "description": "I hope it isn't too much of a problem if I use a throwaway. My family monitors my account, so I couldn't use that one. Here's the basic gist of my situation: I went to college this year and utterly burnt out. I stopped going to classes and didn't study for anything; just couldn't force myself to do it. I've since gotten over said burnout, didn't have a plan to get back on track within a semester or two. I failed 3 classes this year. I got good grades in two, but I feel like that was only because I had friends in those classes that made it actually bearable. My dad always tells me I have no reason to get less than an A in any of my classes because he gives me everything I could need. Except for support in my opinion. His definition of everything I would need is food and a roof, with access to the internet. I haven't told him yet about this because he overreacts to everything. He blows up immediately without wanting or trying to understand the situation at all. He makes out everything negative to be the end of the world. And he is never once admitted that he was proud of me or that I was a good kid or anything. And to give context as to why I don't want to tell him about this I will tell you all a story of me from high school. I had gotten a D in a class because I did not have a good study habits. It was a genuinely difficult class as well. I asked my dad if I could retake it over the summer and he made me feel like I was worthless and less than trash. Then he let me retake it and forced me to lie about it to my friends until they called me out on it. But then I have my own flaws. I basically went to college because it was what was expected of me. I never really had any direction or particular goal. As such I have had low motivation for the entire time I've been here. I never built up good study habits and this semester at came to a head. I want to change for myself. that's why I made a plan for next semester and every semester after that. I don't want anything to do with my family in the future. All they bring is negativity and pain with maybe the rare occurrence of a positive time. So  r/AmItheAsshole, I submit to your collective judgement",

      "description": "My friend had a baby ten years ago (at about age 25).  We were super close back then and my mom and I spent a lot on the shower (probably $300-400 +), and her good friend did the whole baby pregnancy photo shoot for free.  It was pretty huge.  She got divorced about 5 months later, and she raised the child on her own.  The child is a boy and is now 9.\n\nShe got remarried a year ago.  She had 5 bridesmaids, including me.  We haven't been in touch as much because I live 2 hours away, and it seems like we only get to hang out when I go visit my hometown (i.e. she never comes in specially to see me although I haven't had a chance to invite her).  Anyway, we are still close friends but not as close now.\n\nSo what happened is:  Her husband messaged about 7 of us on Facebook and asked us what date would work for the baby shower as her friend had a space she could use on certain days in February, and needed to reserve it.  My pregnant friend knows that it will be happening and where, but the rest would be a surprise.  He pushed a certain date where the space would be free, even though one friend said she had class until about 2 hours before and would have to rush there.\n\nOnce a couple had responded the date worked, he said \"So I'll just leave the rest to you all just let me know if you need a hand with anything.\"\n\nNo one in the thread said anything about setting up and one friend will have to rush there so obviously wouldn't be planning or hosting it.  I haven't heard anything about her mother hosting it either.  So I think he meant that one or all of us should step forward and plan it.\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised she is having one at all, because she got so much at the last one (granted years ago, but I know she kept a lot of things).  I feel weird about spending another $100-200 (which I will have to not to look rude in this circle) on items that we bought before.  She has a house and good job now, so I am a bit put off by it all and I definitely don't want to plan it.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being an enthusiastic planner/friend?  She is announcing the sex at the shower apparently.",

Long story short, she lost full custody of her kids and now only sees them part time. \nThis made her depression even worse. In the 13 months we've been together she has had 4 jobs. All of which she would call off constantly and hasn't last in one for more than two months. She has been at her current job at Cincinnati Children's hospital for less than two months and has already called off twice.\nShe doesn't take care of herself. She doesn't clean up after herself. She constantly pretends she is sick to get out of EVERYTHING. She is basically useless. I'm sorry to use that term, but it's the truth. Hell, she only showers two times a week MAX. Her family completely turned their backs on her. None of them even speak to her. She has literally NO ONE other than me. \nI made a lot of promises early on. I thought I was in love with her, and think I really was. At least with the person I thought she was. We don't talk, we don't go out, or laugh together. We just coexist in a house together. She literally won't give me a reason to stay. I've grown so far away from her that I am actually starting to despise her as a person. She is kind hearted, but I just can't take much more. She blames it all on me. Tells me that I make her feel worthless. But I have done nothing but try to help her. \nIf I leave her, I am afraid of what she will do. I am afraid she will slip even further. She won't be able to care for herself. The part of me that still loves parts of her is just so torn. I am all she really has. But I am growing to hate her. \nWIBTA if I leave her completely alone in life?",

      "description": "I started seeing this girl over the summer 2018, and had a brief but very intense time with her. She had to move to the West coast for grad school in the Fall, and it was decided we wouldn't try to do anything long distance. Since then, we've only seen each other once, when she was back in town for Thanksgiving break. \n\nSix weeks ago she texted me and told me she would be back in town a few days at the end of March. I texted her back and said that was great, just please text me the days and I'll be sure to take them off work. \n\nA couple weeks later she texted me telling me that she'll be here Wednesday through Friday. I say great, and let my work know about it. \n\nWe don't talk for several weeks, as her semester is ending and I am busy working. This Tuesday, though, I text her and say \"Hey - looking forward to seeing you! Just checking - are you still heading here tomorrow?\". She texted me back \"Yeah I am! First day in I'll be all-family, and looks like me and my Ma have quite a bit planned, but I'll let you know when I get an idea when I'll be free\".\n\nSo, I get that I won't see her on Wednesday. Disappointing, but not the end of the world. Then yesterday, on Thursday afternoon, she texts me:\n\n\"Hey, I'm sorry, my time is too short here. I'm not gonna be able to see you. I thought perhaps after dinner tonight but I just have too much going on\"\n\nI was really upset, because I've been looking forward to seeing her ever since we made plans. She says \"maybe MAYBE\" she'll be able to see me after dinner Thursday night, so I hold out hope that we'll see each other then.\n\nShe never ends up texting me back, so I'm left in this limbo-hell of not knowing what her decision is, what her intentions are, etc. This really fucks with me emotionally. I was literally shaking at one point. Here's the full exchange:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Kn1DOat\n\nAnd so, I don't want to be a pest/pressure anyone to do anything they don't want to do, but we made plans six weeks ago, and then at the very last minute she canceled them, after I had already taken time off work and made myself available. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "To preface this, I’d like to say my sister and I were once incredibly close(and still are) but our relationship has suffered because of her actions in the past. I love my sister very much, and enjoy her company most of the time. In addition, I’d like to note that my sister is currently being treated for her mental illnesses(most of which I share with her, but deal with them differently) with medication and therapy, neither of which are working. \n\nMy sister suffers from a myriad of mental illnesses, and we suspect that she may have BPD. These things don’t make her inherently a bad person to be around, but they do dull her to the feelings of others(I think) when she’s being especially manic. \n\nIn my household, criticizing my sister is not allowed. Because whenever she is criticized, it almost always results in her screaming at us and crying. She also hurls insults, says she hates us, threatens us with death or says she wishes we would die. My mother tries to speak to her about small things that are an issue like: eating entire boxes of cereal in a day, cereal which is the only thing my autistic 4 year old sister will eat in the mornings. Even these small things will result in her screaming and throwing and breaking things. She has also lied to and stolen from several times. Whenever she is caught lying, she excuses herself with “it was just a white lie” even if it was something big and potentially harmful to her. My mother has been at her absolute breaking point for months and sobs almost days, as she as at a loss of how to help my sister. \n\nMy sister is aware that I suffer from extreme anxiety, especially in cars due to experiences in my childhood surrounding vehicles. Whenever someone texts and drives, I will shake and sometimes have a panic attack. At one point last year, I was angry and asked her not to text while driving. Her response to this, was fetching her phone and texting on it on the entire 10 minute ride home, which caused me to have a panic attack and nearly throw up. \n\nThese are just a few examples of the things she’s been doing to us over the past year. She has since regressed and her empathy for other people has gotten worse. I jump at the chance to be away from her, as her drama surrounds me day in and day out. So when my mother told me that she was planning on going shopping and bringing me with, we hoped that my sister wouldn’t be there and wouldn’t ask to come. We wanted time alone.  And I secretly rejoiced when she had work that morning so she wouldn’t get to come. \n\nI feel horrible for doing this and feeling this way, but I also just want time alone with my extremely stressed mother. I want time where I can forget what my sister has done to us. \n\n\nI’m sorry for the awful grammar throughout this, but I’d like some advice. ",

      "description": "Td;lr: boyfriends parents say bad things about me, the kids ( aged 7-9 ) and constantly fight with each other while I'm there. I'm no longer comfortable going over, AITA for refusing to go over or not?\n\n\n\n\nWe are both 19, I'm English and he and his family are polish, this is important as his parents are quite catholic.\n\nWe've been together for 4 years and when we first started going out it was fine, his mum was lovely to me even though we don't speak the same Language, she'd try and talk to me and the more I went the more I could understand what she was saying. The dad has always been shy and never really spoke to me unless he had to. I've cooked dinners for them and the family when they've been at work, I've looked after his little brothers when they go out and everything. I'd been to Poland twice to meet all of his family, learned basic polish to communicate with them.\n\nAbout two years into our relationship I was there quite often, I'd spend more time with them and the more time I spent with them the more I'd dislike them a bit. Not enough to effect the relationship but just at how ignorant they were. The mum used to feed the two young siblings ( age 7-9 now) a load of crap with 4 meals a day and then would laugh at them being fat, bullying them and pulling on their clothes saying they're too tight, they then started making my boyfriend pay £250 a month rent while working at McDonald's 2 days a week while still in full time education, this wouldn't bother me if it was going to the family essentials or towards the younger siblings but the mum was just buying tattoos with what was essentially my boyfriends whole wage. They made him give up a managers course to do an extra year at college (an English high school equivalent) then when he turned up it turned out he hadn't applied early enough so they forced him to give up something he wanted to do for nothing. \n\nFast forward to present day and my boyfriend got into an argument about rent and out of no where his parents brought  up out the blue saying that 'one day I will get pregnant and ruin his life' which is crazy as I have never had a pregnancy scare, I have always been on contraception and careful and I have no desire to ever have a child and 'that I'd grow up to be a baby killer' and  'that I handed myself to him like a whore' \n\nI was so angry as all I had done was do everything I could to earn their respect and the dad had just said all that. I spoke to my parents upset about it the next day and the said my boyfriend shouldn't have told me what they said, well obviously I was very upset about it but I obviously can't do anything about it because they don't know I know so I'm not going to get an apology so I just continue going over. Well the last straw was tonight.\n\nTonight I go over and his parents are arguing with each other loudly in front of the kids throwing insults back and fourth and I heard the 9'year old brother say to the other one 'do you ever feel something but not understand it and not know who to talk to' and it honestly crushed my heart. I told my boyfriend and we took the kids to go get pick n mix but I said to my boyfriend I can't come over anymore, the house and the family is too toxic. \n\nAITA for putting that pressure on my boyfriend or am I justified to feel uncomfortable in their home. \n",

My sister called me today and I've just found out that she has an entire different view on it. She has ground rules because of the baby, but I completely disagree with many of them which I'll talk about below. Some of them, I get and am supportive of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what she's proposing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; My medicine in a lock box in my room\n\n\\-&gt; I must keep my room baby friendly (no choking hazards, etc)\n\n\\-&gt; My cat needs to be locked in the basement at all times\n\n\\-&gt; I have to keep my dishes in my room or in one single area (food allergies)\n\n\\-&gt; I have a list of her pet peeves that I can't do (No left overs in the fridge, etc)\n\n\\-&gt; I can't bring most of my furniture, only the small things bc there is 'no space'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, from this it's implied that her and baby will have free reign of my room. I want to keep my cat in my bedroom at first until it becomes accustomed to the people/house and then most likely let it stay in the basement with me when I'm down there because it's a much larger space. I 100% understand that she's not comfortable with a cat near her child, so I get not letting it roam the house, but why can't it be in my bedroom?\n\nI mentioned putting a lock on my door to keep baby out and safe but she said that baby's always find a way into rooms and that my cat will be let out. I asked why people will be entering my room, and she said that she wants somewhere she can go to be alone when I'm not there. She's upset because she shares a room with the baby and doesn't have her own space. I told her that despite that I still need and want my own space.\n\nShe also said that she wants help with the baby and implied that I would be able to help watch him anytime she wanted some freedom. IMO, this isn't ok. I'm fine with babysitting and helping out but I have my own life and can't be watching a baby whenever she wants a break.\n\nI also told her that I'll be bring my furniture will put the 2-3 non bedroom things in the basement. She said that there's no room and that I should throw it out. I'll be moving out in a year or so and can't afford to re-buy my furniture. \n\nAITA for demanding that my sister and her baby stay out of my room when I'm not there? For deciding to put a lock on the door so that no one can go in there when I'm not home? For not wanting to be her free personal baby sitter? And for wanting to bring and store some furniture in the basement?",

      "description": "We live together.\n\nI drink less soda than my bf and whenever I get a bottle he gets one too (I drink coke zero, he some other brand but it doesn't matter.) I'm speaking of those bigger bottles, like 1,5 liters. He drinks his soda fast and then goes for my bottle without asking. If I'm home it's not that big of a problem: I can tell him not to drink it or if I'm fine it, just let him. But whenever I come home and I find my bottle empty, that's what bugs me.\n\nI'll give you today as an example of what I mean.\n\nYesterday we had bought a bottle of his soda and a bottle of coke for me, and he had emptied his last night. I had like 1/3 of coke left, and still did when I checked the fridge this morning before leaving to work.\n\nKnowing him, in the afternoon, I sent him a message asking if he had drank my coke. He said yes, ans I asked him if he had replaced it. He told me no, so I asked him to go to the store. He told me \"babe just buy some on your way home, it doesn't make sense if I buy it now and then wait for you to get home.\"\n\nIt is true that I can buy the coke on my way home. BUT if I hadn't send him the msg, I would've come home (again) to find the fridge empty, since he wasn't gonna tell me forehand - do you see what I mean? Now, I did buy a bottle of coke but from a high priced corner store, cause the grocery store next to our house was already closed. \n\nHe is a student, he has school like 3 hours/day, and so he spends most of his day home (today was no exception.) Myself, I started recently a new job and am working 10h/day (plus 2×1h in commune -&gt; 12 hours in total.) The grocery store is 200m away from our flat. He had 3 hours to go there before it was closing but didn't cus he felt lazy.\n\nI acknowledge that this isn't a HUGE problem but I still find him to be inconsiderate and selfish whenever he does this. What's your verdict, Redditors?",

      "description": "So for general context I am 22, and the cousins are 7, 9, and 11.  I live at home with my parents, and I pay rent.  My room upstairs is mine to do with as I please per agreement with my parents and it has a lock on it that only I have the key to.\n\nSo for the last several years my family hosts Thanksgiving and Christmas because we are pretty close to the halfway point for a lot of our relatives that live in different states so it makes sense for everyone to go here.  We have plenty of space and my mom loves hosting so it works out great.  The only issue I have is with 3 of my younger cousins who all see me as the \"cool\" older cousin.\n\nNow don't get me wrong.  I love these kids.  I love hanging out with them and playing games.  I even put my Switch in the shared living room so they could play Mario Kart and stuff with or without me.  The issue is that they also want to play with all the electronics in my room.  This includes my laptop which is used almost exclusively for work, and my PS4 which is not something I let other people play with.  \n\nWith past consoles I've kept in my room I used to just let them play to shut them up, but after a few hours I'd come back to saves erased, sticky controllers (Most from the younger 2.  Oldest is actually relatively well behaved.) and one time a broken TV because one of the kids tried to pull the console out of the TV stand and ended up bringing down the whole stand and TV with it.  Their parents paid for the TV to be replaced and nothing else was damaged so I am not mad about it, but I decided from then on I didn't want them in my room playing with my stuff.\n\nI brought this up with my parents, and they agree I have every right to lock up my room and keep the kids out, but they think it will cause drama with the kids and the parents making the kids feel unwanted and hurt their feelings.  I can see that point of view, and I definitely don't want to hurt their feelings.  The issue is after bringing up their destructive behavior my parents think its just \"kids being kids\" and that I need to accept that things are going to break.  They cite examples of things around the house that I broke when I was younger that they just accepted as well as things my cousins have damaged that they aren't mad about.  And even argue that my aunt and uncle are happy to pay for replacements if anything gets broken so why be mad about it?  This makes me feel a bit guilty honestly.\n\nNow my plan for avoiding the conflict is to wait until the day before they get here and take my PS4, Laptop, and anything else they would want to play with and hiding them in my trunk until they leave.  I could say that my laptop is in the shop for repairs, and my friend is borrowing my PS4.  That way I can leave my room open so we can hang out up there, but there isn't anything for them to play with so they will go back downstairs and maybe play the Switch.\n\nSo I guess what I am trying to figure out is is it shitty of me to hide things from these kids that they enjoy just so I can avoid potentially getting them dirty or damaged?  Should I hope that they are better behaved this time, or should I maybe instead just have a talk with their parents and set ground rules instead of this trick I'd be playing on all of them?  Is that the less assholish way to approach all this?",

      "description": "I will restrain from giving any character descriptions on both sides, but basically, the story is this - i have this neighbor/friend, with whom I'm on rather good terms, we do sports together, go out for a drink the usual...\n\n\nA little backstory:\n\nHe is a single father, raising a teenager with ADHD and a ton of other difficulties, and i constantly give him praise on the job and effort he puts into raising him, try to cheer him up and encourage him in every reasonable scenario he shares with me. They have a lovely maltese, of which we have taken care on multiple ocasions, over extended periods of time. The boy is to say the least, very hard to handle, follows nothing he is not interested in, has a very poor hygiene habit. \n\n\n\nNow yesterday - my wife went on a walk with our baby and saw the neighbors' dog escaping through the garage door of our building. (how is that possible ? Well they left their apartment and left their apartment door open, so the dog escaped) Of course, she went after it, its a lovely little puppy, who luckily knows her well enough to come back to her. I called our neighbor straight away, told him that we found the dog outside and sent him a picture of it playing with my son, to see that its all ok. So far so good - now here is possibly where it all went south - i knew that he will spend the day out of town and his son usually comes home around dinner - i offered to walk his dog, to which he actually agreed, as i assured its not a big deal and won't burden me at all.\n\n\n( The real reason being, that his son even if he would come home earlier is an evil little shit, whom i have caught beating and torturing the poor pup - without consequences, goes to lengths to avoid taking care of it and honestly couldn't care less if it stays in its own filth locked away in the washing room )\n\n\nThen in the afternoon, i get this call - where he basically starts lecturing me with a very harsh tone, that all this \"Willingness to help\" is too much, how im \"Overcaring\" and goes into a rant about me making him feel a bad parent, because i asked the boy in front of his dad a couple of times whether he has other clothes better suited for the weather outside. Which he probably does, because they are very well off financially and the boy seems to get his every need satisfied, so it was more of a reminder to change, rather doubt the lack thereof. (Tbh..people that don't know them, would believe its the case, because he has such poor hygiene, that he would wear the same clothes, shoes and socks (yes his feet stink of rotten hell through the shoes) for days, in case of shoes for weeks without washing).\n\nAnyway, i listened to him ranting on the phone for 10 minutes, apologized for multiple times (which i regret) if i made him feel like this, as it was really never my intent, since i genuinely do care about him. Turns out i am TA for doing this.",

      "description": "Just some context! In my city, there's a tradition of throwing wedding socials to raise money for the bride and groom. It's basically a large fundraising party where everyone gets together and buys drink/raffle tickets to support wedding costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm getting married in 6 months to an amazing man -- we've been together for almost 3 years now. We're all a part of the same friend group, we all knew each other through school growing up, and I also knew my ex-boyfriend (of 6 years) from that friend group. It's been a few years (I dated my fiance shortly after we broke up), but I know he's not over me; I'll get texts still whenever he's out drinking, and he's expressed that it's hard for him to see me moving on with my fiance even years later. It's caused a few rifts in our friend group and at times I've even asked my friends to not include him because of his behaviour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a really tight knit group, so obviously everyone (except my ex) is in the wedding party. This basically includes all of the friends that we both grew up with, and definitely all of his friends. My ex hasn't been doing well lately, and everyone's been saying he's going through a rough time. I wanted to have my social on St. Patrick's Day, but everything was booked up, so I had it two weeks before which HAPPENED to be on my ex's birthday. My ex was invited (everyone in the friend group was), showed up, and seemed to enjoy himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day, one of my bridesmaids said they felt bad that he had to choose between going to my wedding social or essentially doing nothing for his birthday, since all of his friends had to be at my social and wouldn't have been able to do anything with him. Honestly, that didn't even cross my mind. Like, I think it's been way too long for him to still be hung up on me, and while I could have had the social another day, it's my wedding and it's not like I need to cater to his feelings just because he can't move on. Apparently he had a really hard time at my social, but I wasn't really checking in on him so I don't know for sure what that was about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So about two months ago I booked a trip to Puerto Rico with some coworkers for this April. A couple of weeks later, my littlest brother (14, the youngest of 5) texted me to ask if I was doing anything the week of the trip.\n\nTurns out it's his spring break, and he wants to come visit me out where I live (a two hour flight from where we grew up).\n\nFirst of all, I was freaking honored - how many 14 year old boys want to come chill with their 23 year old sisters? Second, he rarely reaches out to me out about anything other than memes, so I paid attention.\n\nThird and most importantly, I took this seriously because my parents are recently divorced. We got the news 3 months ago, mom moved out 2 weeks ago. I would feel like an asshole if I didn't prioritize seeing him, especially at such an impressionable age, in such a tumultuous time, and always having been close with him out of all 4 of my younger brothers.\n\nSo I told him I would cancel my trip, and he can come visit any dates he wants. I told my coworkers about it, but kept my trip booked just in case plans fell thru. I waited about a month; he told me he'd work it out with dad when he's back at the house.\n\nFinally, today I heard back with: \"Is it okay if we visit from Apr X-X?\" I replied, \"yes, but who is 'we'?\" And got the answer of him, my second youngest brother, and my dad.\n\nThe problem is not that the personnel changed. I love all my family members and I'd be happy to see them all under normal circumstances.\n\nThe problem is that my dad, VIA MY BROTHER, invited himself on the trip without ever directly talking to me.\n\nAnd the real problem with that is, I don't want to see my dad right now. I have not talked to him since he called me to tell me he filed for divorce. He has reached out with things like \"oh look, I'm at our special restaurant!\" or \"omg I saw the Game of Thrones trailer. April 14!\" I haven't responded for a lot of reasons, but here's a high level summary.\n\nI've been the middle man and confidant for my parents' problems with each other for 5 years. They ended up divorcing for what I considered the wrong reasons, and also the circumstances were a complete 180 from what I had expected. I've been distancing myself from both parents because I want them to come to terms with things on their own and not use me as a crutch.\n\nI'm also just generally frustrated with my dad. He's a wonderful dad, but not the most emotionally intelligent or socially aware human. I'm frustrated by the way he treated my mom before the divorce, the way he responded when I confronted him about it, and the way he delivered the news (my mom didn't know he called me until later on that day).\n\nI haven't even seen my mom yet. I want control of my engagement with my parents; I don't need a pop quiz visit from my dad.\n\nI love my family. But I don't want to see my dad right now. So I messaged him and told him I would prefer if just my two youngest brothers came to visit.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "First time poster in this sub on mobile, sorry for any mistakes. For some background, I'm a college aged student who lives at home while I pay for school. I do chores around the house and chip in for groceries, gas, etc. I still haven't learned to drive (useless and unreasonably anxious in that regard) and have no car, so sometimes my parents are nice enough to take me to work at my retail job, which I really appreciate. \n\nSo tonight, I was closing the store and was scheduled till midnight. My mom let me know that I should take an uber because everyone would be asleep, but my dad said no problem, he'd most likely still be awake and will come get me. Now, I always wait to call when I'm done because we're notorious for never getting out on time and my dad HATES sitting there waiting in the car.\n\nI make the call to my house twice because the first time there's no answer. My mom picks up the second time and tells me my dad must've fallen asleep downstairs (as he often does) and to go ahead and call the uber, so I do. Halfway home, my dad calls asking where I am! Apparently he had been waiting in the parking lot and I didn't see him. I didn't think to look for him or to call his cell because he almost never has it on him and I was told he was asleep.\n\nI think it was just a big misunderstanding made by 3 sleepy people, but he's REALLY mad at me and I do feel terrible and tried to apologize but he wouldn't hear it. He wakes up early for work and it was raining so the roads weren't really safe, on top of the fact that he did tell me he was coming to get me when I first left for work so I do understand his anger and frustration. The wasted gas isn't an issue, I'll transfer some money over, but he could've been cozy in bed and wasted his time coming to get me. My mom also got chewed out while she was trying to sleep because I told him that she told me he had fallen asleep, so I feel double terrible. AITA? ",

      "description": "My mother has a lot of mental health issues and lost custody of me at around a year old because of neglect/abuse to my grandparents. She would, according to my grandfather, lock me in a basement room with no windows all night and leave in the morning not coming back until seven or later at night, drink my baby formula because “I paid for it so it’s mine!” (gross ik)..I still had part of my amniotic sac on my forehead at three months old and torticollis. \n\nMy grandma passed away in ‘04 and my grandfather passed away this January; I had seen my mother a total of two times in around thirteen years. As far as I’m concerned that was the last of my parents. My mother feels like a great great great aunt that you don’t really remember ever meeting but your closer family talks about sometimes. I barely know who she is.\n\nWell, my aunt bought her a phone and put her on their service plan and she’s been calling me like eight times in a row every other day. Ideally I would talk to her like maybe once every four or five months, and I just..don’t have the patience or time to walk outside in the middle of my shift and talk to my mother for forty minutes about what she had for breakfast. Sooo I barely answer and only if I’m at home and declined her first four calls. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to talk to her or have much to do with her? She’s never been around, I don’t know who she is, I feel mega uncomfortable talking to her. But I feel guilty because I’m her daughter and I DO care about her but it just takes up so much emotional energy that I don’t have in the first place. ",

      "description": "This one will be long, but I need outside perspective. I’m afraid all my friends and family pander to me. \n\nMy husband is significantly older than me. He was married to his ex for nearly 30 years. He was incredibly gracious in the divorce (he felt he owed it to her after 30 years) and bought her a new vehicle, left her the house (still paying for), gave her a job within his company AND paid EVERY SINGLE DEBT IN BOTH of their names. All she had to do was: sign her name. Keep in mind their children are in their 30’s. She was re-married within 2 weeks of the divorce being finalized. She (was) an able bodied adult, and had a makeup tattoo business/tanning salon at the time of the divorce. She was too lazy to keep regular hours and it went under within 6 months of the divorce. \n\nFor the first 6 months, things were smooth. She was in charge of keeping books for the company. Then, strangely, employees aren’t being paid, bills are behind. Answers are not forthcoming. I cajole him into letting me audit the books. Yep! You guessed it. She is robbing the company blind. Hand over first. The employees not being paid? **HER OWN SONS! THIS WOMAN IS LITERALLY STEALING MONEY FROM HER CHILDREN**\n\nHusband asks me to take over. I get things under control rather quickly, people are being paid within 2 weeks, debt into control within 2 months or so, bringing credit score back out of the gutter. She proceeds to visit many doctors and put the bills in my husbands name as the guarantor. I catch all but one, which ends up in a suit/garnishment. The way the dentist went about it was utterly illegal but by the time I located it there was nothing I could do. Long story for another day. \n\nI should also add that she filed 4 fake insurance claims, which ended in the super special insurance dropping the house so the special hazard insurance that it has to have went from $200/year to $500/month through the mortgage agency? But the Farm Bureau is the ONLY place here that does that insurance. Wanna guess who is responsible for insurance payments? NOT US! Wanna guess how much she’s paid??? $0. Which, at this point, have accrued more than is left on the mortgage. The way I see it?!?! Two options! We finish paying the mortgage and put a lien against the house for double what she owes us, interest etc. Or... she gets off her fat fucking ass and figures out how to adult!!!\n\nHer new husband has 7 DUI’s in Idaho. She’s a fat slob that is literally too lazy to go get on welfare. She has no job. He has no job. Do you see where this is going? For 11 years. I could offer more examples- but- really? Isn’t this long enough?\n\n\nTo;dr husbands ex wife constantly thieves from us, trashes our credit. She owes us more money than the mortgage has left. AITA if I let it go into foreclosure? AITA if I put a lien for double the amount she owes for 11 years of absolute hell?\n\n ",

      "description": "(throw away acct and changed names for obvious reasons)\n\nI started at this new job back in November so I haven't been there very long. Tonight three of my fellow coworkers were shooting the breeze with me while we were slow. Just general random conversation. \n\nOne coworker, \"Megan,\" says if she had ever had a son she would have named him Aiden James. My other coworker \"Julie\" responds with \"You should be careful about that because the only Aiden James I know is as gay as a two dollar bill. I mean like, really gay.\" And Megan says \"Yeah I've always said that with my luck if I ever had a boy he would have been gay.\"\n\nAnd there I stand in silence because of course I have a teenage son named Aiden who just happens to be gay.\n\nThe conversation continues but I don't really hear the rest of it because I decide I don't want to listen to anymore and go to another part of the warehouse. I don't say anything to anyone and leave about 20 minutes later cuz my shift is done.\n\nI have spent a considerable amount of time around these people and know that they are normally very nice, friendly and otherwise decent people. But this is not the first time I've had to silently endure remarks like this. Several coworkers have made comments about what they describe as \"fruity guys, poofs, fags, being sweet\" as well as comments about customers who \"were so sweet they left a trail of sugar behind them.\" I've also endured a few jokes about gays and lesbians. Everyone seems to think that if they start a statement by saying \"I don't have a problem with gays, to each their own.\" or \"I have plenty of gay friends but...\" that it means what they are saying is not hateful or mean or whatever. But it is really hurtful to me. I don't like it.\n\nNow I've never wanted to be \"that person\" who rains on everyone's parade by being offended by crap but I just don't see this type of behavior stopping if I don't say anything. And I don't want everyone knowing my or my family's business by explaining to them why I find it offensive. I don't understand why it has to be discussed at all. I don't start random conversations by describing someone as straight and I don't see why someone's sexuality should have anything to do with general conversation in the first place.\n\nSo my question to all of you is, would I be the asshole if I privately say something to my manager about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* sidenote \\* I've also heard Megan (a white woman) use the n-word several times in a \"joking\" way. (ie: Hey Megan can you do this? She replies with \"I ain't gonna do your work n-word\") We only have one black employee who is extremely part time and obviously she does not do this around them. I don't like it but living in the south it is something I've heard frequently and usually I'm ok with telling people I don't like that word, don't use it around me. But I've never had to deal with someone saying it in a professional setting before. My manager is aware she does this as she has also referred to him as an n-word before in front of me.",

      "description": "For a bit of context, I go to school which is dar from where my parents live, so I stay at grandparent's house monday to friday and only go home for weekends. And even though I love my grandparents, living with them is sometimes mentally exhausting and I was really looking forward to spending some time with my parents - just the three of us. Around two weeks ago, my mum called her parents (the grandparents I live with) and asked if they'd like us to be with them on Christmas Eve (which is the most important day of Christmas here). She didn't bother to ask about my opinion or even tell me first. And she knows damn well how much I love being at home. We also argue a lot when the whole family is together and I think it's gonna be even worse when Christmas is involved, because mum and I love having everything traditional on Christmas while grandparents like to keep everything as simple and cheap as possible.\nAnother thing that bothers me about this is my father's mother, with whom we spend very little time recently and I was hoping she could spend Christmas with us this year, especially cause last year she spent it with my uncle's family, and we've always taken turns.\n\nParents tell me that I'm being selfish, and I'm seriously starting to feel like I am.\n",

      "description": "My husband, then-boyfriend, and I started living together in college.  Back then, our chore division was that he would take care of trash and dishes and I would do everything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we graduated from college, he got a full-time job working 40 hours per week with a 30 minute commute and I went to grad school.  During this time, he was in charge of trash and dishes; I was in charge of cooking, grocery shopping, laundry, and feeding/walking our dog; and we would clean the house together during the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter two years, he quit his job and started grad school and I was finishing up my last year of grad school and working part-time (25-30 hours per week).  We kept the same chore division.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I am working full-time and he is still in grad school.  I spend 45-50 hours per week in the office and I have a 1-1.5 hour commute.  On top of this, I work 10-15 hours from home.  He has class for 4 hours, 3 days a week and he works 6-10 hours per week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started my job, we talked about re-dividing chores but my husband insisted that he would be really busy this semester and could not take on any more chores, other than doing part of the laundry (now, he washes his clothes and I wash my clothes).  To be fair to him, it does seem like he's working on school stuff whenever I am home.  However, I strongly suspect that, during 4-5 hours that I'm at work and he's home, he's not working on school stuff and either watching TV or playing video games and then he works on his school stuff when I'm home to appear busier.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I've had a few days over the past month that I've had to stay in the office late and I asked my husband if he could walk/feed the dog and pick up some takeout for us before I got home.  He always said yes, so I thought this was ok.  Last night, however, my husband told me that we needed to talk about our chores.  He said that it's unfair that I've been asking him to do some of my chores.  I pointed out that I only ask when I have to be at the office late and it's something that cannot reasonably wait to be done until I come home.  He said that I need to do a better job of managing my time so that my household responsibilities don't fall by the wayside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm kind of frustrated because I feel like he has a lot more free time than I do and that our chore division isn't fair, but I also kind of feel like I'm not pulling my own weight as a wife and member of our household.  I do see his point that it's unfair of me to ask him to do stuff that is technically my responsibility.  I guess it's hard for me to tell if my frustration is justified or if I'm being unfair to him.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are both very lucky that we are able to work online and live a digital nomad lifestyle.  Presently, I am in my home country visiting my family for the holidays and he is remaining in Asia in the last place we traveled together.  At the end of January, he will visit his family in his home country for one month.  I have offered to fly back to meet him at the beginning of January so that we can spend some time together before his trip home, but he is being very noncommittal about this.  He is also being very noncommittal about when and where we can meet again in March after his visit home.    \n\n\nIn ordinary circumstances, I would say that he is unquestionably the asshole, but recently his mental health has been very unstable and his depression has hit a low.  He says that his inability to commit to a meeting is because of this bout of depression, and I can tell that when I bring up this issue with him that he becomes very stressed out and it puts him in a bad place.  He says that right now he needs to be able to exist in the present moment before he can think about the future.  I don't want to add any more stress to his life, but I'm also very frustrated about not being able to make any plans.  I have been in a previous relationship where my now-ex was very resistant to making plans, and it ended when he stood me up after I flew to a different continent to meet him, so I am sure this is influencing my judgment as well.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of my boyfriend's work, it will be best for him to spend the spring in Eastern Europe.  This is not my first choice, but I am happy to be there if it means that I get to be with him.  But, given that he is not giving me any information about when we can meet again due to his depression, would I be the asshole if I booked a ticket to South America, where I would prefer to spend the winter/spring?    \n",

      "description": "Okay, so I messed up the formatting since it was my first post. This is a repost of the deleted one.\n\nI truly am broken up over this, and I’d like a third-party opinion. (TLDR is at the bottom)\n\nBefore, During, and a little while after the time of my birth, my mom was a drug addict. From 0-2 yrs old, I suffered from neglect. (She would leave for hours at a time, and whenever I cried I would be given candy to shut up(I had to get QUITE a few fillings))\n\nWhen I was 2 my mom went missing (turns out she was partying and then crashed @ a friend’s place) and my aunt found me at home, alone. Due to my father not being in a financially stable enough situation, I ended up living with my G-ma. After a couple months, my mom was forced to give up her rights as a parent.\n\nAfter this, she has done EVERYTHING possible to improve as a mother and overall person. Currently, she is a college graduate and has a husband whom she shares a daughter (my half-sister) with.  My mom, along with my Aunt and G-ma want me to try and “reconnect” with her. Since I hate to look rude, I accept to hang out with her. \n\nIt’s...uncomfortable, to say the least. My mom and I have never hung out alone, It’s always with her, her husband, and my half-sis. (Sometimes with the husband’s family.) They’re both the fakest kind of sweet, and it makes me cringe just seeing it (Ex: Instead of having real disagreements, they’ll be \npassive-aggressive and then laugh it off). Although it’s toned down the past year, it’s easy to tell that they want to look like the “perfect” family in front of either me or my sis. While we don’t actually go anywhere alone, we do have some conversations over text. It seems that she GENUINELY wants to connect with me, but I just can’t seem to get over our history and her current vibe with her husband, so I’ve been making excuses NOT to see her, or at least kindly turn her down. \n\nSince I’m moving to Tennessee over the summer, I’m thinking of using it as a way for both of us to cut our losses, since all of our interactions have been strained.\n\nTLDR: My mom abandoned me and is now trying to reconnect, I try to turn her down at all opportunities.\n\nAm I the asshole? Are we both in the wrong?",

      "description": "So I am in this monster business law class that is one of the hardest classes at my school. It’s not really difficult but it’s a lot of material and studying.\n\nI have a group of 5 people that I’ve been studying with this past semester. We break up lectures and each do 1/5 of a google doc for a study guide. The idea is to have it done before the test so we have time to actually study it. The first test I didn’t really make a deadline for them and they all waited until the night before the test while I had my part done over a week prior. We had discussed doing this strategy the first week of school so there really was no excuse for not having it done prior to the test, but I let it slide. \n\nWe have a test tomorrow morning. I had my part of the study guide done March 15 and asked the other people to have theirs done by March 27 at the latest. We decided who would do what chapters March 1 - so the people with the later lectures could have used their book notes (which are the same as the lecture) to add to the study guide. \n\nUnsurprisingly, no one else added to the study guide. So I copied and pasted my part to another document and deleted the doc that they all had access to. It was noticed pretty quickly and they asked why I deleted it, and I told them I didn’t think it was fair for them to benefit from my hard work without giving anything in return. I finished the study guide on my own and they are wanting access to it because “they have lives and can’t just drop everything to study”. I’ve said no twice now but they are talking trash about me in the group chat (that I am still in) calling me selfish for not sharing since I “already did the work”. These people are not my friends but I don’t want them to tell other people I am a bad study partner. Am I being the asshole for not sharing? The work is already done and I won’t be losing anything by letting them see my notes. I feel like I am justified in not sharing but at the same time don’t want to be known as the asshole who can’t share.",

      "description": "Some background. \nI recently passed 2 high level certification tests that give me the ability to take on much more responsibility and do more important tasks. One of those is to become an instructor for the national based program we work for.\n\nIn order to become an instructor you have to demonstrate your mastery of the material, and then have your mentor sign you off. Once signed off it goes to your program director who then gives the final okay.\n\nMy mentor has signed me off and sent off the application to our program director. They then responded with a no, stating they don't like they way I talk to her (specifically the way I talked to her as a woman). My mentor avoided probing the situation and came back to me with that information. \n\nThis is the first time I hear of ANY negative comment at all from anyone. Infact I was so flustered I asked a few of the other colleagues both male and female if they had ever thought my interactions towards them, her, or any women had been negative and they said no.\n\nThis then lead us to believe that she must be holding a grudge against me or that she heard something from someone else and assumed I was guilty without ever giving me a chance to tell my side of the story(she's known me for 10 back when I was a cocky teenager).\n\nI requested a meeting with her face to face to discuss, and even offered to talk on the phone if that wouldn't work out. She said no to both, effectively blocking any chance I have at becoming and instructor which blocks my plans for the future completely. And she stated she doesn't want me teaching at our facility at all.\n\nIs this even legal as it's a national program and I assume there is a proper grievance process for thinks like this?\n\nTL ; DR boss blocked my ability to progress based on the fact she doesn't like me.\n\nSorry for any grammar issues, typed on mobile.",

We don't really talk to each other anymore but a year before we would always walk to the store nearby and buy me food, candy etc. Nothing big but it happened a couple times. We recently fell out due to the fact that we had pretty much nothing in common. I recently went to a movie theater with some new friends, we went to the arcade cause we were ewrly for the movie. I went to this wheel spinner game, I won a $50 itunes gift card on my first try. I found it funny that i won $50 dollar gift card on my first try for $1, so I posted it on my story. He hit me up and told me I should give it to him (no big deal, a lot of people joked about the same thing). So I said \"😂 I'll sell it for $45. He legit thought he should get it dor free because of all the times he bought stuff for me. Me thinking they were gifts, and him never saying I had to pay him back told him, that if they were gifts he shouldn't be expecting anything in return for them and that its kind of cheap of him to bring up gifts to try and get something out of me. (He never denied they were gifts) He thought I should pay him back. So I told him I would sell it for 25 bucks. He still thought I should give for free. I told him no because I thought they were gifts, and he never denied they were and never asked any thing in return until now then he left me on \"that's a crappy way to pay someone back smh\" The way I see it. Its kind of like someone giving me a Christmas present. And then 6 months later they demand you do something for them cause they bought you a present. \nAITA?",

      "description": "This has been weighing on me. Need to know if I’m TA.\n\nI was friends with guy for a long time. I knew his history of cheating and cautiously entered the relationship.\n\nWe agreed to keep our relationship a secret from our friends for a while. Didn’t want the pressure from them. \n\nFew months into our relationship, I see one of my best friends names run across his phone. I asked and initially he acted like it was no big deal. I knew they had been flirty before despite her being in a serious relationship. He admitted that she was being forward but didn’t know how to shut it down without saying we were a thing. After some boundary setting he said he wanted to “come out” to our friends, and be exclusive. \n\nAbout 6 months of great relationship passes. He approached me about taking his house off the market, me selling my house, moving in. I was checking out job prospects in the area. I picked more neutral upgrades for my house preparing to sell it. We discussed marriage (both of us have been divorced) It was getting serious. \n\nHe introduced me to his friends, which he was nervous about. He had previously went on a few dates with one of them and didn’t want to hurt her feelings. \n\nWell, one night we’re at his place with all his friends about to watch a season premier of something. I walked into the kitchen, and he has both of his hands on this girl’s face telling her something. She is starring up at him sweetly. I walked in, and he quickly jerked back, and said something like “...babe” \n\nI said I was sorry but I had to get to a work thing early and needed to go. He followed me to his room where I was collecting my things. He asked me not to go, and that it wasn’t anything. I just kept saying I had to get up early and needed to get on the road.\n\nHis messages ranged from being apologetic to being angry. But I never responded. I felt like he’d sucker me into feeling bad for him eventually and I just dropped it. He still messages me periodically and I have yet to see or speak to him since that night. It seriously broke my heart though. \n\nTell me if ITA. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Little backstory: my wife and I got addicted to meth and got involved with dcfs. They took our 3 children (7f,5f and 3m) and placed them with my mom. Shortly after this my wife and I split up and she moved in with another guy. He was an old friend of mine so my kids know him but can’t see him because of our situation. \nMy middle daughter still won’t accept this and thinks once we get through this my ex and I will get back together. It’s like she thinks the judge is not letting us be together. So I’m having almost daily talks with my daughter trying to get her to understand that her mom and I will not get back together and her mom has a new boyfriend(fiancé)\nBack in October my middle daughter had her 5th birthday at a skate rink. My mom invited my ex as well which I have no problem with. We can be civil especially for a birthday party. \nAnyways, my daughter asks me if I will skate with her and then also grabs her moms hand. She then starts smiling and saying “we’re a family again” I then pull away and tell my daughter to go ahead and skate with mommy for a while and we can switch off. I was not comfortable with this. \nMy ex brought this up today and was saying I don’t know how to coparent and I should have no problem skating together with our daughter. \nIn my opinion it’s only making my daughter think that one day we will be a family again. I feel like she will only take it worse if we keep up the charades. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to do this?\n\nPs: I know every one kind of sucks here because of the drugs but we are both in recovery. So please don’t base your opinion on that and only base your opinion on the situation at the skate rink ",

      "description": "The background:\nMy husband's mother works for a company that requires a lot of travel, she missed both of my children's birth the past 2 year because she was out of state. My BIL worked for the same company for a fee years with no experience in the feild and made more money than me and my husband have ever made combined. Durning his employment he was out of town or state often.\nMy husband has told me that he wants me to stay at home and raise our children and he would prefer to work 2 jobs rather than me taking even a part time job.\nMy husband is currently working a job that is to put it lightly is not paying the bills. He has agreed he needs to find a new job and he has said he will take a new job or a second job if he can find one right away.\n\nOur current situation, we are on government assistance. Even with such assistance we can not pay our bills. We do not spend any money on anything other than bills, and maybe 40-60 bucks a month on toiletries, diapers and things not covered food stamps. We haven't paid to eat out in 3 years. With the government shut down we just won't make it very long off what he is currently making. To add to the current sense of doom, our current living situation is coming to an end in 6 months as the people handling the estate want to sell the house we are living in. So we will have to find somewhere to live with most places in the area being at least ×3 what we are currently paying for \"rent\" not to mention deposit and so on.\n\nI have talked to him about working for the company his mother works at, although she has never said we both know she could get him a job like she did for his brother. I made it very clear that it would only be temporary until we can put some money aside to have a cushion to go find a job that fits better or get more educated or whatever he wants to do. My husband has told me he doesn't want to but not why. I have asked if it was about the traveling, asking his mother for a job, or something else and he just told me he didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\nMy husband is an amazing father and husband. I would miss him dearly, in our whole 8 years of our relationship we have never spent more than a few nights away from one another. I have heard my MIL talk often of families being welcomed to come stay with them durning long stays and holidays. I would be 100% down for that. I just feel like this is the only way we are going to make it work if he wants me to stay at home with the children or even have a home to stay in.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting my husband to take a good paying job that would require a lot of travel, taking him away from me and his two children in order for us to be able to possibly get out of poverty?",

      "description": "I live pretty far from the rest of my family.  For the last three years I save up and take my sisters on a vacation.  My youngest sis and I are very close.  My middle sister not so much.  The relationship between the two of them is sometimes outright hostile.  \n\nI’ve included her the last three times more out of obligation than anything else.  The reason I want to leave her out of this one is because she outright ruined the last.  She insisted on bringing her young daughter.  If me and my other sister did anything that a young child couldn’t be included in she would throw a hissy fit.  She kept starting fights with my other sister.  One of the nights she was letting her daughter be so freaking loud that the people next to us complained and hotel staff came to our room and asked us to quiet down.  Then she loudly said, “jokes on them, he didn’t even care”.  I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t have come to our room if he didn’t care.     Whenever her and my other sister would fight she kept threatening to leave early.  I just kept my mouth shut internally hoping she really would.  \n\nThese vacations aren’t cheap.  This is the one big fun thing I get to do all year.  There’s just always some drama or hassle with her.  I know it would probably hurt her feeling or piss her off or both, but I want to be able to actually enjoy the vacation this year.  ",

      "description": "My husband of 1 year (together 2.5 total) is very funny and sweet at times. At his core he is a dream. He’s also drop dead gorgeous and we have similar interests. But, other times he is such a bummer that it drains me to even be around him. He alternates between being the life of the party and a living rain cloud. When the switch flips he slams doors and cabinets, walks heavy footed around the house, passive aggressively cleans up while making a big show about picking up a mess, and his entire face changes to a look of disgust and contempt. \n\nIn the good moments he is sweet and thoughtful and seems to care about my feelings. In the bad moments he raises his fist to hit me, actually hits me sometimes, calls me names and tells me I’m fat or ugly. I am an attractive woman but he has made me doubt my self-worth. The one bonus to this is that the day after being grumpy and moody he is very nice to me. \n\nThis behavior occurs monthly with arguments happening every other day that he seems to fabricate out of nothing. I have two children (not his) that live with me and though they never see it, they feel it. I am a naturally sunshiney and optimistic person and that’s the home they are accustomed to. I feel terrible for saying this but he makes our home feel like the scene in, “What Dreams May Come” where Robin Williams goes to Hell to find his wife. I’ve never verbalized that until just now and it gives me chills. \n\nWhen I tell him that he depresses me he has lately started saying things like, “I know I’m a piece of shit. I don’t deserve you”. He then spirals into a depression where he gives all of his belongings away and seems robbed of all joy. I feel as if I have robbed him of it. \n\nAITAH? ",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short, but my bf recently decided to buy a house and my brother recently became a real estate agent. Let’s call my brother G. The original real estate agent, let’s call her K, he was using didn’t seem like she had our best interest at heart. Wouldn’t even put in offers lower than the asking price. At this point I tried to convince him to use G. He didn’t seem to have any interest in doing that and didn’t really give him a chance. He then told his dad that he didn’t like K and his dad told a friend of his (that is also a real estate agent) to text my boyfriend. We will call her D. So D texts my boyfriend and he accepts her help. I’m a little upset about the fact that he never seemed to even give my brother a chance. We’ve been together for 3 years, he has spent holidays with my family. My boyfriend is extremely family oriented and protective of his family. Today I asked my brother to show up a house, not knowing he was asking D to show us the house as well. He got mad and told me to stay out of his business. Am I the asshole for being mad that he didn’t consider helping out my brother? I had to text my brother and cancel. I should mention my mom let us live in her house while we are looking.",

The room also had no light, only a lamp and there were lots of other minor issues. I am very hardy and can stand the cold, but it was 4C during the day and my legs started to go numb, so I had to eventually leave and pay for a hotel.\n\nIt felt wrong to leave a negative review so I contacted Airbnb. They said to ask for a refund, but I instead asked them to contact her and point out why this was an issue as this wasn’t about getting the money back. The listing now seems to be delisted (though perhaps I have just been blocked).\n\nI am wondering if I should have just left an honest review instead. I didn’t want her to stop listing, just understand that she needs to perhaps not let it in the coldest periods if she can’t heat the house.

      "description": "Sorry for the novel, but I'm so confused.\n\nI (36m) and my girlfriend (30f) just got 100% custody of my (5f) daughter as my ex wife is moving out of state at the end of the week. Prior to this new custody arrangement, we have had primary physical custody of my daughter because my ex works M-F 9-5 and is single. I work from home which makes transportation for school easy for me, and allows for us (myself and ex-wife) to avoid paying for after school care. My home is my daughters home of record and we have cared for her throughout the weekdays and have had all weekends kid-free until now. \n\nMy girlfriend was always opposed to this custody agreement, because to her it felt as though \"we are doing your ex-wife a favor, and she needs to do her part and take her daughter 50/50\" adding that she should pay for her own day care for the days she would have her if we split custody evenly, and that I shouldn't help her by taking extra custody days or by splitting the costs of daycare.\n\nI personally loved the arrangement. I love my daughter. Having her 5 days of the week was great! I submitted my point that we get the \"easy days\" with my daughter and have ALL weekends to be free adults! I was met with the idea that she wasn't having an issue with caring for my daughter \"more\" than my ex, but that she felt like we were being walked on or that I was doing \"favors\" for my ex-wife by taking my daughter during the weekdays instead of forcing her to figure out how to afford day care for the days she would be in my ex wife's  care. In couples counseling she stated that it would be better if my ex just left and we were to have 100% custody. Low and behold, two months later my ex-wife drops the news on us that she is leaving for a few years to pursue a career!\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my ex asked if she could fly in and pick up my daughter for a wedding (a 3 day trip) in February. The weekend just so happened to be on my girlfriends birthday weekend, however we would have to drive my daughter to the airport to drop her off at the end of the weekend. It's about an hour drive one way and happens to land on my girlfriends birthday. \n\nStill, delighted by the possibility of spending my girlfriends birthday weekend together as free - no kid - adults, I immediately said yes and began making plans to suprise my girlfriend with, as up until today, she didnt know about my daughter leaving for the weekend. \n\nOver the past 2 weeks I have been making arrangements to stay at the Stanley Hotel. The one from \"The Shining'. She's fascinated by it, but neither of us have seen it, and she's always asked for me to take her there someday. Plus, it's closer to the airport, and we could easily swing by to swoop up my daughter on our way home that Sunday!\n\nToday my daughter started asking about her trip for the wedding in front of my girlfriend. Although it's still over a month away, I figured I could tell my girlfriend about it now. Besides, she would have to ensure she had the weekend off work to make my suprise possible. \n\nAt first, my GF seemed delighted to hear that my daughter was leaving for a weekend, and got even more excited when she heard it was her birthday weekend! I hadn't even told her what I was planning yet! Just then, her face went sour.\n\n\"Wait. When does she come back?\" She asked\n\"On your birthday.\" I replied\n\nShe then demanded that my ex rent a car and deliver my daughter to us, as it was in fact, on her birthday. I told her that our airport was a layover, and that my ex had to fly back to the state she has moved to, and that that was probably not reasonable or a financially viable option. \n\nShe argued that it was her birthday and that she wouldnt be burdened with driving an hour each way to pick up my daughter on her actual birthday. \n\nI tried to reason with her that this was probably the last overnight weekend we would have kid-free for a long time and that it's a good deal for us. I offered to drive myself so she wouldn't have to endure the 2 hour hardship on her birthday. \n\nShe was also upset that I've known about the trip for 2 weeks and havent mentioned it. I revealed that I was trying to use it as an opportunity to surprise her (without revealing the suprise), but that still had no effect. She is pissed. \n\nShe thinks I am doing my ex a favor on her birthday and declared that she would just rather work that weekend because her birthday \"obviously doesn't matter\".\n\nI just dont understand. I feel like we were offered a gift, and that I used it perfectly in a way that would make her feel happy and special. However, I'm being made to feel like I am an assholes for \"ruining\" her birthday. \n\nI feel as though she is unreasonably jealous of my ex wife, and that her jealousy is bleeding into our relationship with my daughter as well. Should I have talked to my girlfriend about the trip and my plans  immediately and ruined my chance to suprise her?\n\nTLDR- My child's mother lives out of state. Wants to take daughter for a weekend. Happens to be on my girlfriends birthday weekend giving us 2 RARE kid-free days and nights. However, child must be drivin back to airport on girlfriends actual birthday. Girlfriends birthday now \"ruined\"\n\nAITA?",

It was cornered down to his feet smelling foul after being in the same pair of socks for two days, working/walking around in his sneakers. I ask him to please change his socks? He doesn’t want to. I tell him that is not cool, please change them?  I don’t care, I’m not doing it, is his answer. He acted as if I was annoying and out of line.\n\nHe often thinks i’m too much because I am very smell sensitive.

      "description": "So I was driving to school, and I was stuck in traffic behind an L300. The L300 in front of me suddenly braked, so I stepped on my brakes as well. There was about 10 feet of distance between our vehicles, so everything was good. But a six-wheeler truck hit my car from behind, and my car, being a smol (Toyota Wigo to be exact), despite being on the brakes, went sorta flying and ended up hitting the L300 in front of me- all of this resulting in a \\_pwingle sandwich. \n\nOf course, I'm a reasonable person so I got out of the car to discuss damages with everyone involved. I'm pretty young, I'm like 20, so my first instinct is to call my mom and my insurance. \n\nThe lady (who looked about 40) who was riding shotgun in the L300 got out of the car, and started accusing me of not having a license- but demanded my car papers (like car receipt, registration). \n\nI mean, I look pretty young, aside from my actual age, I'm Asian so... you get it. I was pretty shaken up of course, and I just tried to calm things down.  \n\nIn response to her asking for my papers, I asked for the license of her driver, as well as her vehicle's papers, all those documents, because the insurance does need that stuff. I didn't show her my papers until she would show me hers, for my own safety (which she did not, as you'll see later. She also refused to see my license). I did give my contact details, because I was still being amicable at this point, and of course, nobody wanted this kind of thing to happen. \n\nI was also trying to get the police (who did not show up), because I am clueless with regards to these things. I was also scared, given that there were drivers, who are big dudes and I'm kinda petite at 5\"2. \n\nShe lost her shit when I asked for her papers, she just started yelling at me for not having an actual license (which I repeatedly offered to present to her). I tried to tell her that I'd like to rewind the dashcam, because the truck driver had admitted that the impact was actually on him, but she was not having it, and just yelling at me nonstop for not having a license. I tried to get the details of her driver, but yeah that was a no too. \n\nShe then tried to get me to cash out, and pay what is more or less $20 USD (which is pretty big, where I'm from). I refused, because my insurance covers these kinds of things, and it seemed reasonable to me to want to go through legal channels. She was really not having any of it, goddamn. The only thing she cooperated with was giving me her number, and she used a pen with almost no ink- and it was not legible at all. I'm staring at the paper now, and honestly even if I wanted to call her and work something out, this crappy note does not allow for it. \n\nI lost patience- my car is somewhat new, I needed it for my boyfriend's birthday surprise next week, and my torso hurt like hell, and of course *RIP MY CAR* and this bitch was just not having any of me trying to be reasonable. \n\nI lost my shit- I'm usually a bitchy person, and I'm honestly surprised that I managed to stay nice for that long. I started yelling at her like \"how am I supposed to have my insurance cover this if you won't show me the documents my insurance needs????\" and \"I am talking to your properly, how are we supposed to do this properly if you aren't even talking to me properly????\". \n\nShe asked me if I was yelling, and why I'm being so rude if it was my fault. And I was like IT'S NOT MY FAULT OKAY, WE CAN CHECK THE VIDEO. And she refused, yet *again*. So I just checked her details which she had written down, and discovered that it was unreadable. So I asked her to rewrite it so I could get in contact with her. So she did that, while muttering all the while about disrespectful brats. \n\nI checked the paper which she had written on, and it was still not readable. While I was doing that, the L300 had sped off. So now, I don't have a way to contact the owners of the L300 to help with the damages on their vehicle, and quite frankly, I don't really plan to. \n\nNote: Where I live, it's a big cultural no-no to show *any* kind of disrespect towards elders. Even breathing the wrong way is already bad. And I technically did hit the L300. \n\nSo am I the asshole here for any of the aforementioned reasons (or maybe any reasons I didn't point out)? ",

      "description": "Obligatory first time posting, on mobile so sorry for format, tldr at the end \n\nI [21f] have lived on a small farm with my parents and brother since I was 3. The animal numbers fluctuate, but we typically have sheep and goats, chickens, cows, and pigs outside, and dogs, cats, fish, etc inside. At present, there’s two sheep, a goat, eight chickens, a [14 year old dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldManDog/a0olr8/4th_birthday/?st=JRQX1MAR&amp;sh=2606df21), a [15 year old cat ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldManDog/comments/836xew/old_man_clyde_is_15_aits_old_man_pippins_1comments/nd_a_damn_near_perfect_mix/?st=JRQX354X&amp;sh=9cbd4aa0), and a [1.5 year old kitten ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/aiiyfu/my_boy_ollie_is_occasionally_majestic/?st=JRQX4SXP&amp;sh=1a697017). Before the kitten joined the family, whoever fed the animals, fed all the animals. When I found and [brought Ollie home](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7idmf5/my_baby_boy_the_first_day_i_met_him_8weeks_old/?st=JRQX8DTA&amp;sh=a63d657c) in the summer, I was with him every day and fed him for every meal because he was my new baby and like I said, I was always there. Then school started back up and my mom made a point to say that if I wanted someone else to feed my cat, I had to ask. Okay, no problem, new cat, my parents weren’t particularly pleased to have another cat. I get it. \n\nFast forward a year and it’s still like this. Feeding all the animals is routine and Ollie is definitely part of the family, sometimes it feels like my parents love him more than the other cat. But if I have plans or class or work, I still have to make a point to ask the person at home to feed my cat. If I don’t, I get five texts in a row from my mother saying that if I don’t ask her then my cat will not be fed and will go hungry. Ollie may have started as “my” cat since I found him and brought him home, but he’s 100% a family kitter now. \n\nAITA for thinking that the new-ish cat should be included in the regular feeding ritual?

Catchy title, eh?\n\nSo the shortened story:\n\nAt 31, I financed my first car (before that I had a jeep that I bought in the early 2000's for cash.) Having never financed a car, I failed to find out if they added the cost of sales tax and registration and whatnot to my financing cost. They did not, unsure if the fact that i bought it in a neighboring state has anything to do with it. \n\nSo when the registration comes to the local title office I am hit with an unexpected $515.16 fee. As I am busy restructuring my budget, I don't have an extra $500 on hand.\n\nI tell my girlfriend about it, not overly worried because my tax return should hopefully show up before my temporary plates expire. My girlfriend offered to loan me $500 out of her travel account (money we set aside so she can come with me on work trips. Work pays for me not her) and I can just pay it back with my tax refund. I agree that it's a solid plan. \n\nFast forward to last night, dinner with friends. One of our friends has brought a date none of know him. I ask my gf if she wants a drink, and she jokingly says yes since I owe her $500. I'm getting us drinks and she fills in new guy about why I owe her money (for clarification, she's not bothered by the loan). When I get back I get to listen to a tirade about how people who borrow money from their loved ones are assholes and deadbeats. Dinner is ruined and the subject is changed after he leaves. \n\nReddit, am I the asshole, just none of my friends want to say it?",

      "description": "For context, i did not kick her out BECAUSE she is transgender. Just wanted to clarify that. \n\nBack in March, i found out she was DIY taking HRT. (no prescription) Now, I'm not against her taking hormones if she feels that's necessary in her life. I'm happy if she is. The issue is estrogen can cause blood clots, and seizures can be estrogen based. Both of which she is at a very very high risk for. She had many childhood seizures as a child, and has a genetic condition where she is at a high risk of clots. She is putting her life at risk, and our family will not be dragged down with her should she do that. In March, she agreed to hand them over if she wanted to live here. But we found out she never stopped taking HRT. We clued in when my wife noticed the changes on my daughter's body recently. While I'm happy that she likes the changes, she knew she would not be welcome here if she was risking her life this way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, we kicked her out about a month ago and she has totally cut us off from her life now and hates us for doing so. She is welcome in our life, man or woman but if she ends up having seizures i will refuse to deal with that because she knew what could happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am i the asshole here?",

I come from a kinda poor family background so sometimes if I am lucky, I get some online admin jobs to make ends meet. Last few months, I got a online job(admin stuff like responding to emails quickly) where they pay me (INSERT CASH HERE) where when it is converted to my currency, it is more than enough for my allowances plus I can help my parents pay my fees as well. The problem is, I have to stay late to do the job where it was 9 hours, (10pm to 7am) . I sometimes sleep during this hour while put notifications sound for 30 secs so I can get up and reply to it. This made me very tired and sleepless, but I needed the money to continue studying and for my allowances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of breaking up with my gf because I am not giving her enough time for us. I would be tired and sleep in the afternoon after my classes and at night, I would only spend few hours with her and then continue with my work. I get one day off and sometimes it is not enough to spend time with her. She is very supportive of me and she say it is no big issue that you are doing this to help your parents and that you need the money. But I know she wishes that I would allocate time for her which I wish I could but the work can be really tiring.I wanted to break up with her because I think she deserves better and someone who can give her the time she deserves, because she has done lots for me, and I feel like I am not doing her anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For context, my best friend (B) has been in a weird codependent fwb-but-not-really situation with her physically and verbally abusive alcoholic ex that she drives everywhere because he doesn't have a license. He's made her cry countless times, flirted with other girls while they were dating, and he broke up with her but he can't let her move on. \n\nAs a result none of our friends like him because she ends up crying to us time and time again when things don't work out between them. I've only ever been polite to him whereas others have flatout refused to go out if he's coming. Despite not wanting to see him she's dragged me out with him numerous times and I put aside my feelings for her sake.\n\nB's birthday is coming up so our friend group decided to go out for her birthday.  As we're planning out the finer details, she drops the bomb that she invited her awful ex. Both myself and a few others in our friend group said that we didn't want to go if he was coming out and we could do a separate celebration without him. \n\nAfter going back and forth how we didn't want to spent time  with someone who hurt her countless times for a good 15-20 minutes she blows up saying we can't even be nice for one day for one day, how she's heartbroken about it, he took the day off to go with us, and how we made her feel like shit. She essentially dropped everything we planned to accommodate him. \n\nAt this point I'm mad because we spent weeks planning with her and spent $60+ on the matching outfits she wanted us to wear (which is a whole other story).  I told her at this point she's choosing him over everyone who's supported her for the past 10 years.  Tbh I'm just so tired of all the bullshit and the drama surrounding this guy. I give her an ultimatum: either she chooses him or me in her life. \n\nB told me not to make her choose and tried to get my sisters to convince me to not make her choose. She cancelled the plans to go out all together and threw herself a pity party; basically telling all of our other friends I was being selfish and ruined her birthday when I put my foot down ONCE because I don't want him to ruin the night.\n\nIm angry and hurt because I've bent over backwards to be a good friend over the years including opening my home to her when she had nowhere to go. B apologized later but it was a \"I'm sorry but you should also be apologizing to me\". I'm the type of person who needs time to cool off so I told her just that.  Instead of respecting that she got drunk and spammed me with messages saying \"K so I have no friends\" \"So have a great life\" \"Probably see you at our school reunion\" and the worst was one saying \"You're the only other person I've cried about so I hope you're happy.\" I haven't spoken to her since. \n\nAITA???",

      "description": "I'm not really sure where to start but I guess I'll start here.\n\nMy (now ex) roommate (we will call him Alan) and I met online before our first year of college and we applied to room together with 2 other people. We lived together for a year and during that time he and one of my other roommates (Harry) got in a huge fight and Alan and my last roommate (Kyle) decided to not room with Harry this year. I stayed rooming with them because we had purchased some stuff (TV, printer, etc.) together, but I mostly stayed out of the fight because it didn't involve me. Alan and I both suffered from depression and I can say at times he was one of the reasons I didn't off myself in what was a very hard year for me, and vice versa.\n\nFast forward to this year, I'm living fairly happily. My depression, if not beaten, is manageable at least every day, and so I don't have much to say about my feelings apart from the occasional \"I'm feeling a bit stressed about this midterm\". So when Alan asks \"How are you?\" I usually answer with \"I'm fine\" because I am. He is still struggling, however, so I try to help him out, but, honestly, it's hard talking over the same issues over and over again when he doesn't change things ever and doesn't seem to want to. I don't think I'm supposed to be his therapist, but I also wanted to be a good friend. I kept inviting him to join me and my friends when we would go out, but he'd always be busy with plans with his friends or ditch me last minute for them. It also felt like he only ever wanted to talk about him and he rarely talked about me, except when we were in groups. He's always been that kind of person, but it started to grind on my gears because in addition to him ditching me constantly and always saying \"I have homework\" or \"I'm busy\" if I actually did have something to talk about, it started to be a little much. So I stopped inviting him to things over time and stopped really talking to him apart from greeting him in our apartment when I saw him. I'll admit I was a bit short with him at times because I was starting to resent him always having hours of time for his other friends but not a few minutes for me. I never did anything meaner than answer a question more tersely than he would have liked. At this point, I was also having big changes in school and work, so I turned my focus away from my home life to focus on that.\n\nEarlier this month, Alan moved out to another room because it was his \"neighborhood\", where all his friends live (roughly 10 to 15 of his friends live there). Which would have been fine, that's his perogative. My issue is that he's been saying to our mutual friends that I was a depressing roommate and that I never talked or hung out with him, and that I was never there for him which I guess was true towards the end. It feels like I'm being Harry'd for lack of a better term. So AITA for slowly pulling out of this friendship and should I apologize? Or should I confront him about what he's saying to our friends? Or should I just do nothing?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses.",

      "description": "So to provide context, I am referring to a garage parking spot at a residential home at which I am a tenant. When I visited the potential apartment, I knew that I would be living with the two landlords (husband and wife) and that I would have a spot in the garage. Fast forward a month later, their son moves back in due to some circumstances and along comes his car. \n\nUp until now, there has been no issue as there hasn't been snow. However since it is now snowing heavily, I would like to use the parking spot in the garage to prevent my delay of morning commute. The landlords want to park their car in the garage too, which is fine. But, their son works late shifts, while I work day shifts. Meaning that, if I park in the garage, his car would be parked behind me (I am not able to drive standard) and therefore I would be blocked from getting to work before asking him to move his car. They want me to park outside and have their son park in the garage . At which when the son returns home from work at 1am, I would have to move my car so he could park in the garage (or he would move my car). I suggested he park behind their car outside and he just move his own car when the landlords leave for work in the morning then he can go back to sleep. To which they say, they can't do that to their son. I am very disagreeable at this point.\n\nTldr: I signed rental agreement where I would have a garage spot and I don't want someone else operating my car. It is now snowing at I would like to use my agreed upon parking spot in the garage but they are asking me to do otherwise. I believe since he's their son, he should accommodate his parents rather than myself. ",

They said she shouldn’t have to work if I make enough. \n\n\nSo, AITA? I’m debating kicking her out in a few months if she continues to do nothing. ",

      "description": "\nSo I’m now living by myself at a big city 20 hours away from my hometown. I told everyone that it’s because there’re better career opportunities, lower rent and it’s exotic and fun. Which are all true but the truth is I couldn’t stand living with my family anymore. And I hated my hometown so much.\n\nMy younger brother dropped out in high school and just play video games at home all day and night, being rude to my parents especially my mom, and still getting allowance from them. My parents are enabling his toxic behaviour and it’s draining them both. At one point i got really depressed and anxious and times very angry. I’d have “episodes” once in a while. I stopped speaking to him and disowned him at one point. And I moved to my aunts place and then eventually moved to a new country with a very small saving. \n\nNow my parents decided are buying a new apartment, which is a big financial burden. My dad is having eye sight problems but still having to work. My moms always working overtime, and she had anxiety. My brother is still being his good old video game playing self and spending my parents money.\n\nAnd i feel really guilty because they’re struggling but I can’t help them either finically or just by being there. And I can’t make myself call them too because I don’t want to get emotional and make them worry. And my parents, and grandparents are all growing old and I feel bad for not spending time with them. And if something happens to anyone I care about , it’s a 1000$ ticket and 16-20 hours way back home. \n\nI think my parents are expecting me to move back after my visa expires but actually I’m planning to immigrate. I feel like I’m abandoning them though. \n\nAnd I feel bad for never helping my brother. At this point I don’t even know how to start any contact with him or if I even want to. Also I feel like an ahole for saying all the mean things I said to my family and the episodes I had and never really apologized. And making them worried about me on top of my brother and all the other issues they’re having. :-(\n\nHonestly i should’ve gotten professional when I was having all those episodes. I couldn’t afford it and my parents wasn’t supportive. And I chickened out. So I just educated myself about mental illnesses and it did kinda help. I am still a bit of a mess now tbh\n\n(Sorry my English isn’t perfect! Do tell me if there’re any mistakes on my grammar or vocabulary cause i am taking IELTS exam soon and need an 8)",

The server launched into a long story about what he is doing for Christmas, without being asked, and told me to pay attention because I wasn’t listening. I will be clear, he obviously has some reasonably severe learning disability so he is NOT aware he is being rude. When I kept talking to my sister, he touched my arm (not hard) which I really fucking hate. Unwanted touching is just a big NO. \n\nI took my tray, and went to another table. My parents really like this restaurant and say they have seen this server make big progress with his speech problems and that he seems happier because they have little conversations. I’m just not comfortable with it. It is the only restaurant nearby where they live so this limits my options. He works every day dinner shift except weekends (and I don’t see my parents at that time.) \n\nAITA? I really feel uncomfortable and find it unhygienic but my parents tell me I am being over dramatic. ",

      "description": "We were almost a year together, he was still living with his parents. He was a dentist and worked in the dentist office of his father. He avoided that I met his parents. I sometimes said \"Hi\" to his dad, but that was it. I think the parents didn't want to meet me. They are Russians and maybe they wanted a russian girl.\n\nDecember. I had handmade him an advent calendar. The surprises were sweets, body care, and some small GoT stuff like keychains etc.\nHe also gave me one he bought. I was happy.\n\nI sometimes asked him what he thought of the surprises.\n\nHe liked none. He told me \"too much sweets, I won't use this shower stuff ,all that GoT stuff is dumb\"\nHe was the one that got me into GoT, he knew all the houses, the map etc.\n\nI soon found out that the calender he got me was expired a year ago\n\nI was sad, because I had bought his christmas present long ago. 2 Tickets for a GoT concert, 160€ (~180$) in total. I'm a student and I have a tiny job, 160€ is more than half of what I earn in a month and since I had already bought them I couldn't do anything else.\n\nWhen I gave them to him He made fun of the them,\"you only bought them for yourself\", that I should've known that he didn't like concerts.\n\nHe took the tickets with him. I told him that his reaction to my gift was inappropriate he got mad. He was annoyed at me, didn't want to talk to me etc. I begged him to talk and told me that he suffered from depression. I of course told him that I was there for him.\n\n1 month after christmas he told me that he lost them, after I told him if he didn't want to go I'd go with my mom.\n\nHe confessed this to me over whatsapp &amp;I made 2 voicemails expressing my anger. Those tickets were very expensive to me and at least I wanted to go.\n\nHe didn't answer.\nNothing for 5 days. Then I decided to text him \"You could've at least said sorry. But you you just ignore me, like always.\"\nHe answered: \"Sorry I can never please you.\"\n\nHe ignored me again, 4 days.\nThis time it tore my heart apart. Every day without hearing from him hurt like crazy.\n\nI texted him, tried to call and talk to him an he'd ignore it all.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI texted him \"I want to talk, at least over the phone. If you don't want that or ignore me again, I'm gone.\"\n\nHim:\"I have other problems. I can't take the stress with rn. If you want to go, go.\"\n\nMe:\" Okay. I'll go.You broke my heart. Thanks for the wonderful time and thanks for the fucking shitshow of an end.\"\n\nHim:\" I'm sorry but I don't want to drag you into my problems. I hope you'll get happy. Good bye.\"\n\nI never answered again.\nI didn't break up over the tickets. If he had said sorry I would've stayed with him. I broke up because i couldn't take his ignoring anymore.\n\n\nI sometimes wonder if I was too harsh on him. If it was right to break up, especially after knowing he had Depression. I always thought breaking up over text is a horrible thing to do and now I did it.\nSo am I the ass because I overreacted?",

I was really attracted to her but couldn’t tell if she was into me and didn’t shoot my shot earlier, which I should’ve.\n\nWe were at a party a few nights ago and she was dancing with this guy, let’s call him Steve. I knew she and Steve were friends too, and Steve and I are friendly, but not super close. We run in the same circle and play pickup together but we don’t hang out one on one.\n\nAnyway, she and Steve were dancing together and getting close and kissing a bit. I asked another friend about it and he told me that they’ve been going out, but that they aren’t a couple or exclusively dating.\n\nI figured it was now or never since she’s not committed to Steve right now so I asked her out the next day. She said “I can’t, I’m dating Steve” and I fumbled a little and said “I know but I heard you aren’t exclusive” and she said “you know? Why would you ask me out then?” I asked again if they were exclusive and she said they weren’t but said it was weird for me to ask her out. I can tell Steve has been avoiding me too and one of my friends called me a tool. AITA for shooting my shot?",

She also tutors kids a few times throughout the week, frequently not getting home until 8-9pm during peak theater season. On top of this, she's constantly auditioning for and acting in plays/musicals of her own - she probably does 2-3 each year, each of which is months at a time if you count all of the rehearsals. She's also starting grad school this summer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been married just under 3 years and she's already had several nervous breakdowns due to being so busy that have taken her out of work for days at a time, our sex life has dwindled down to 1-2x per month, and to be completely honest I can kind of just feel our connection fading. She's missed several family get-togethers (which she genuinely feels terrible for), but I'm constantly having to explain to our family that our marriage is fine and she's just busy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn all fairness I can be pretty busy myself with a full time job during the week and a small part-time gig on the weekends - but other than that, I don't have many personal \"extra-curriculars\" that keep me away from home. But we've gotten to the point where we basically see each other for an hour or two each night, and MAYBE have one day a month where neither of us are working or doing personal stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a pretty major fight after her last breakdown. She was practically bedridden for a day or two and we spent hundreds of dollars out of pocket to see a therapist because she's been getting anxiety attacks due to the stress load - and the very next day she found out she got a callback to a personal audition and is all excited about it. My hesitance must have been pretty visible, and I asked her if she thought she might be overdoing it, to which she replied \"I wasn't really asking your permission.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can feel her running herself into the ground and it hurts to see, and I just feel like she's not taking care of herself mentally.

      "description": "Today I went to a surprise birthday party for a friend (friend B) that me and my friends had planned for about a month. We planned everything, including what to get. A cake was one of the items we brought. It was a small party, just 4 people including myself.\n\nI had been in charge of buying an ice cream cake, and had spent 18 dollars in total just for a very small one that could serve up to 6 people. Luckily, one of my friends (friend A) had helped me by giving 5 dollars. Later he and my other friend (friend C) went to the park to set up the party. I went to get friend B who I was going to surprise.\nUnfortunately, the cake was starting to thaw a little too much. I asked A to store it in the freezer in his apartment, and he agreed to for only 10 minutes, even though we had more than an hour to prepare. While he was going in and out (to freeze it and to bring it back), he literally held it SIDEWAYS despite me asking to be careful with it. I know I should've brought it later, but really? When I checked, the cake was not only still thawed but it was kind of smushed with the side of the box. I got upset but it was still intact so I let it slide.\n\nWe went to the park somehow, even though I didn't get any directions and had to find the address myself by doing a google search using an image friend A sent me. Friend C wasn't there, apparently she was trying to find me even though I asked her for the address on Discord. Turns out friend A took her phone away as a joke...  \nLater C hadn't shown up, so A went to find her. Unfortunately C showed up 5 minutes later, without A. \n\nSeveral minutes had passed and the cake was starting to melt, so we decided to at least split it in 4 equal pieces before the solid cake turned into liquid soup. He still hadn't shown up, so we decided to eat as we were hungry. He came about 20 minutes after he left to find C. \n\nWhen he came, he got upset that we ate without him, and said \"fuck you\" (he always says that when he's uspet), then shortly left without us. Unfortunately, friend C wasn't actually allowed to go anywhere without A (because strict parents), so C was scared of getting in trouble. We then had to end the party after he left.\n",

      "description": "So I moved to a smallish city and I have had a horrible time meeting people. I'm definitely as lonely as I've ever been. I meet a girl in one of my classes and we start hanging out. She's sober so I'm definitely excited to have someone sober to hang out with. We study, grab dinner a couple times, and cuddle. She compliments me and is very sweet but she also says she doesn't want anything serious which I am fine with. One night I get ready to leave her place and she kisses me. Which felt great. She texts and calls randomly a couple times which also feels great. Then one day she blows me off and texts \"can we just be friends\" I didn't handle it well but a few days later I call her and we talk and then end up seeing each other for a couple more weeks. Then she does it again and says that I made her uncomfortable by kissing her one day uninvited. I feel like I was sent a lot of mixed signals.  She says she's not over what happened and I assume it's her ex she's talking about after I piece some stories together I think her longtime ex cheated on her gave her HPV which she then develop cervical lesions which had to be surgically removed. We never actually talked about what happened to her. I understand how upsetting and difficult this must be. But I thought enough of her that I would have been willing to stick around and I am a good man with lots of good qualities.  Am I really in the wrong for trying to kiss her? I feel awful about it like I was being that creepy pushy guy that just kisses girls. I apologized afterwards but she still doesn't want anything to do with me. I've been beating myself up a lot about this and it doesn't help that I'm lonely. I also have had no luck meeting anyone else in town. I'm one of those guys that just wants to help but she made it clear she doesn't want my help. It's hard for me to watch other people suffer and not help but I expressed that I was lonely and she was not receptive which hurts. I don't think I would do the same I think I would even tell that person we can hang out just no touching rather than letting that person be lonely and suffer. Whatever we go through in this world we shouldn't have to do it a lone or at least that's what I believe. Am I the asshole? Am I not seeing the signs that she is not the person I made her out to be? Am I suppose to wait for a girl to kiss me? I thought kissing her would be a good thing",

Suddenly the guy in the car swerves blocking the whole road and starts screaming madly at me from inside the car (I cant hear a word) so I roll down the window and start telling \"wtf are you doing, just keep fucking driving!\" He speeds off and pulls over and I can see him still screaming, giving me the finger so I pull over and stick my head out yelling \"what's your problem?!\". He gets out the car still screaming in a different language runs towards my car, I grip the metal bar in my doors pocket (which I have for protection) but decide it's not worth getting into a physical confrontation as A. Although the gym has worked and I'm not exactly small I'll be real honest, I'm a bit of a pussy. And B. I could see his kids in the car. So I yell the obligatory \"learn to drive you dick head!\" And sped off giving him the finger whilst doing so, I had to do a circle of the town as it had made me miss the second turning to where I park my car.

      "description": "My friend recently ghosted me. I don't know her reasons for certain, but I can make a good guess; it's probably because I told the claims generalist the truth about what happened during a car accident we were involved in.\n\nMy friend, let's call her Anne, was the driver, and I was in the passenger's seat. The car Anne was driving belonged to her. She made a mistake in her driving and ended up in a car crash. Nobody was injured. The weird thing is, Anne seems to truly believe that the car crash wasn't her fault. She thinks the other car was changing lanes and crashed into her car, which is impossible since the road where the accident happened was a two-lane road, not a multilane one. The insurance company emailed me and told me to give them a call, which I did, and I answered all their questions truthfully about what happened. My friend probably got into trouble with them as a result. And since she truly believes her false version of the story, she probably thinks I lied to the company in order to purposely get her into trouble.\n\nI told my parents about this, and they told me I shouldn't have called the company; I should've just stayed silent in order to not get my friend into trouble. I think I agree with them. Nobody was forcing me to make that phone call, and I doubt there would've been any consequences to me if I had declined to say anything about the accident. I would never lie to the company, but I could've just remained silent to avoid hurting her. So what drove me to call them? I'm not sure. I just felt like it was my duty to tell the truth so that the other driver who was innocent didn't get in trouble.\n\nWe've been friends for five years and this is our first falling out. I'm pretty hearbroken, but I'm sure if I wait a month or two for her to cool off she'll be ready to talk to me again. Hopefully.",

My spouse wants to move there and I think it's weird. AITA?  \nThis is my first time posting on Reddit, so I apologize if this isn't formatted right/on the right subreddit/whatever. Trying to keep things somewhat vague for privacy.\n\nMore info: my partner and I are both 28 and have owned a small house for a few years. We were planning to sell it in a few years and build our \"dream home\" before having kids. Then my spouse's grandparent died and left their house to us. We weren't expecting this, and my spouse thinks we should just move into their grandparents' house and use the money we've been saving for something else. I really don't want to live next to my in-laws. We have a good relationship now, but they are pretty involved in our lives already. My spouse works for their company, and I think if we lived next door they'd come over all the time to talk about business. I also don't want to become their default caretakers as they get older. \n\nI also don't really like the house itself. If it was a house that had been in the family for generations I might be ok living there, but it's a ranch house from the seventies that smells like cat pee. I think we'd do better to sell it and use the money to build a house father away like we'd originally planned.\n\nThis has also caused a lot of family drama which is making everything more tense. My spouse's siblings/aunts/uncles/cousins are all understandably upset that we inherited the most valuable part of the estate. My parents are getting territorial about babysitting their future grandchildren. My parents-in-law are really pressuring us to move in next door.\n\nSo...AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for being incredibly angry at my friend when I learned his feelings towards gay people?",
      "description": "Hey guys, so my friend of more than 10 years came to confide something he was struggling with recently. It turns out he was pretty devastated that his son came out as gay. When asked to explain, he said it could be because he went wrong as a single father. Also, he mostly said he feels terribly sad that he won't have a biological grandson/grandaughter, and as he only had one son before his wife passed away, it would mean that their bloodline would stop. Yes he actually said bloodline, which I don't understand why this would be so important in this day and age anyway. Honestly, I pointed out that it is not too late to start another romantic relationship if he wanted to continue his \"bloodline,\" and I was quite disappointed with his homophobic thoughts, especially when I thought I knew him over the years. Thankfully he hid his disappointment from his son, but I felt quite disgusted with him that day. He says that he supports his son, but if he really did than he would support him wholeheartedly, not in such a grudging, melancholic sort of way he is doing right now. Also, he denies that he is not homophobic, yet still talks about how disappointed he was. It's difficult, because we are still friends, but it is also uncomfortable to think that someone you knew for so long had such a hidden side to them. He left promptly after a few drinks, thankfully, which gave me some time to think this over. What do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: One of my best friends comes to confess to me rather concerning thoughts about his son coming out gay, which made me feel that he was rather hypocritical.",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this short. I was a passenger while my mom was driving and was talking about some prison and something about readmittance rate. As I was saying that they only included people who could reoffend (not people who have passed n such) she said, \"wow that's amazing\". I was very confused and asked about what and she said, \"the number you gave\". Still confused I asked her what number and she said,\"oh well the fact you said you know\". At this point I'm visibly upset and I felt like she was just acknowledging me without listening and I felt like what I was saying didn't matter.\n\nI then told her how I felt like she was ignoring me and she said I was being mean and I needed to stop badgering her. After this I just sighed and gave up because she was driving  and it's Christmas eve, I don't want an argument.\n\n Just as extra info, my mother and I have had a HORRIBLE relationship that we are trying to fix (I'm 19F and she's 57). I also do have a resting bitch face and I can be kinda harsh in tone so maybe that contributed. The road at the time was clear and we were just cruising on the freeway with minimal traffic. I think I could've handled it better but I don't feel like I was mean. This happens often (outside of the car too) and I really just want to have a good relationship with my mom and I don't wanna be an asshole and sour that opportunity. AITA? ",

      "description": "my high school sweetheart and i dated 4 years on and off. we had lots of problems, but by the time we were in our senior year, we seemed to have it figured out. at least, i thought we did.\n\nour breakup devastated me. i was living with my (very, very) controlling parents and couldn't leave the house very often. i wasn't allowed to have a lisence, had no car, etc. so i had an extremely limited social life. however, i knew my boyfriend had to live his life, so i always encouraged him to have fun. i got worried i was preventing him from enjoying his social life, so i once asked if he wanted to break up, but he said no.\n\nour friends became his friends. he stopped asking me to go anywhere. he didn't eat lunch with me anymore. he blew me off for parties. i understood a party was probably more fun than watching movies with me in my parents' house, but it still stung a bit. i didn't say anything, but during that isolation, i developed a small online crush on someone. i felt so guilty i told my ex immediately. he later cited this as the reason he dumped me. which he did via text. while he was at a party.\n\ni felt incredibly guilty and like i had sabotaged my chance with the love of my life. we had planned to move in together and id been looking forward to it, but i ended up staying with my parents. he remained my friend and framed it as \"i forgive you and care enough to be your friend regardless.\"\n\nmaybe 2 years later, i found out he had been making out with all of our friends when they were drunk and often asked them if he should dump me. apparently they all heavily encouraged him to, one because she had a thing for him. she has assured me it would be best if i didn't know the details of what he said about me. i never told him i knew. i moved away. \n\nwe are still in regular contact, but one drunken night with aforementioned girl who was into him emboldened me to tell him i knew and that it was fucked for him to let me think it was my fault all those years. he said he never told me because it wasn't relevant to how he felt about me and it would only hurt me. he apologized profusely in what seemed to be very sincere. i forgave him, but he hasn't spoken to me since. i was worried he may be spiraling, so i asked my friend if i should text him to check in. my friend then heavily implied i was the asshole because it was 4 years ago and the convo probably hurt my ex's feelings. my friend said my ex has probably changed and emotionally matured and actually said \"that doesn't sound like [ex]\" but he has never met or talked to my ex so it pissed me off. my friend was doing that obnoxious \"i don't want to choose sides or be a meanie uwu\" bullshit, but after i was done being irritated, i started to feel guilty. \n\nidk, i think i'd want to know if i hurt someone that badly, even if it'd been a few years. my head is jello right now, sorry. i just feel gross.

When his mother reached out to me, I was shocked. There were no signs. I confronted him and he confessed that he had started using again. I advised him he was not allowed at home or around my family until he was clean and sober. I told him I would assist him in finding a treatment center and therapist but I would not be an enabler. I made him an appointment with a therapist and he was a no show. I told him where to go for help and he never took the advice. \n\nFast forward, I find out he’s also been using and selling cocaine, has abandoned his kids and is now homeless, has had at least two intimate encounters with another woman, and may be involved in gang activity. I’m not one to just ghost but this motherfucker and I are done. There’s nothing I have to say to this dude and don’t feel he deserves a dignified break up.

      "description": "We've known each other for a year, but didn't become friends until a few months ago. His separation was already in full swing, he had moved out like 6 months ago, but as far as I know there haven't been any official documents signed. So he asks me out in September, and the day before we're supposed to go on a date his ex mother in law dies. She had been suffering from cancer for a while, so it wasn't a surprise. So we don't go on the date, and we don't talk for a few weeks because he's supporting his ex, which involved moving back in with her for a couple weeks and then separating all over again. \n\nCut to a month later, we hang out as friends and we end up hooking up. It's super fun and super casual. For about six weeks we've been seeing each other on the weekends, talking a lot, and just having a good time. I don't want him to be my boyfriend because there's no future there. Right now I'm in a limbo year, and hanging out with him is really fun, and I like our friend-sex dynamic. \n\nHowever, he still meets up with his ex on a weekly basis to \"support\" her. Last night he tells me that it's really hard because he doesn't love her, but her mom just died and they were together for like 10 years, so they meet up every now and again to talk and be there for each other. The first few times I understood, it was day of the dead, his parents were in town and wanted to see her, but this last time there was no major reason to see her. Now, I completely understand that the death of her mom is a big deal, going through a divorce after a 10 year relationship is also a big deal, so I understand him seeing her. However, he's definitely leading her on, he tells me that she still has hope they'll reconcile whereas he doesn't want that to happen. I asked if she knew about me, and he said no... I was just like... okay, you do you. I don't really feel like it's my business to tell him that he's being a dick to her. \n\n\nAm I the Asshole for continuing to see this guy? Part of me feels like I'm the other woman and I keep imagining how hurt she'd be if she found out... but I don't even know her. The other part of me feels like break ups are hard and people can still be friends after they break up, and it's normal to be supportive when someone dies. The last part of me feels like the sex is really good and none of it is really my business. So what do you think?",

      "description": "So first time posting to this subreddit, hope I do it right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been friends with this one girl for a good year at least now. Me and her are pretty close, we talk a lot in the lessons we share together, but we aren't exactly the type of friends who are close enough to share our deepest secrets. From what I can tell, she doesn't really know what a lot of common slang used here on the internet means, and I usually end up explaining to her what certain words/phrases that I use mean, which I'm okay with.\n\nSo earlier today I was in a hallway with her, just chatting about random things, when she brings up that she is really popular with one of the classes of students, students that just so happen to be 2 years younger than us. Now, that's fine, there's literally nothing wrong with that, so I jokingly said something along the lines of: \"Ha, you absolute nonce.\"\n\nShe kinda just looks at me with a confused expression on her face. Turns out she didn't actually know what it meant. She asked me what it meant but I wasn't really sure how to put it into words without sounding really weird, and because I'm awkward when it comes to social interactions I didn't want to ruin the conversation, so I told her to go and ask someone else. \n\nShe went to go and ask someone else about it, and I just stood there waiting for her to get back, cause I didn't really have anything better to do. After about 3 minutes she comes back, but doesn't even look at me.\n\nShe then grabs her pencil case and hit me over the head. Hard. \n\nI'm just kinda stood there, completely in shock and trying to process what just happened, since it seemed to out-of-character for her. She then says something along the lines of \"Don't call me that. Ever.\"\n\nWe kinda just stood at separate ends of the hallway for a while, until we could go to our lessons.\n\nIt wasn't until later in the day when I saw her again did I try asking her about it. Our conversation lasted a while and was a little long, before she just decided to simply stop talking to me, so I'll try to summarise it: she didn't like me using the word nonce because it shouldn't be something you should joke about.\n\nI get that you shouldn't joke about paedophiles, but I've never seen the term nonce used in an unironic way. I struggled to try and explain to her what I was going for, while trying to apologise, but she hardly seemed to listen.\n\nNow, I'm the type of person who hates it when they hurt someone, or do something that gets someone in trouble, it keeps me up all night. She knows this, but she's still refusing to talk to me. I also really don't want to lose her as a friend, since I don't really have very many, and I try my best to stay close the ones I have.\n\nI didn't want to hurt anybody, but was I still a jerk? I just feel like I was a complete bitch but I want to believe that she was just overreacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR -I jokingly called a friend a nonce, now she is refusing to talk to me.",

Well they get mad that I’m not paying attention to their disagreements and start to ask me where I land. I tell them I don’t know and ask them why they need validation from me. That’s when both of them went from disagreeing on politics to agreeing that I’m an asshole in my own little world.

I got into relationship with my current girlfriend 8months ago and have been into a very peaceful and loving relationship. For past 2 months I had to stay in the same villa with my ex girlfriend due to work. Villa is our office and staying place. \nSo over 2 months we went from not taking at all to having 3 meals together ( it has grown organically, as we are sharing the same living place ). \nTwo days ago I wanted a haircut so jokingly said why don't you cut my hair to my ex and she agreed. I got a haircut from her. I know it isn't a big thing but my gf has been disappointed with me. \nSince I met my gf she hasn't heard a single good thing about my ex and suddenly she gets to know that I am living with her and now has got a haircut, I can't blame her for getting upset. \n\nI just wanted to know if Am I the Asshole?

      "description": "Partner and I have been together for almost 2 years now and last year he forgot my birthday. He tells me he has trouble with his memory but seems to remember things that suit him fine (his friends birthdays, things i've said that suit his needs). I didn't make much of a big deal out of it at the time, just said I was a bit upset, and asked him to put it in his calendar for next year (which I had to do because it was too much effort for him).\n\nPartner forgot to wish me a Merry Christmas. He doesn't celebrate it, so I didn't expect a gift or anything, but he didn't even say it to me, yet I know he said it to a lot of his friends and family (facebook), and he knows my family celebrate it hard core. \n\nPartner forgot Valentines day. Same theme as Christmas, but this time he jokingly wished his \"husbands\" (aka his friends) a Happy Valentines while I didn't get a word.\n\nA couple of days after valentines day it was his birthday. I had all ready agreed to go out with him and his friends for dinner, but before hand I wanted to do some personal shopping (like 3 hours before hand, I wasn't late to his dinner). While I was out shopping (he knew where I was, location wise) he asks me to drive an hour or so in the opposite direction to his place (where I was heading after my shopping) in order to get him something for his Birthday. \n\nI told him no. I told him he knew where I was going, that I was going to be far away from the requested shop before I left my home, and that if he had of wanted something he should have asked me before I left. I also told him he could go to another place closer to his (but still out of my way, on the way to his) to get what he wanted. He got uppity about it. He also knew I was very strapped for cash at the time because I have been off work for almost a month ill, and that what he wanted was very expensive. \n\nHim and his friends spent the entire evening being rude about me not having gotten him what he asked for, so I spent my evening being snidely remarked too. Most of his friends now refer to me as the bad girlfriend, even after I paid for his (very expensive) dinner. \n\nI just want to know if I really was an asshole by not getting him what he wanted. ",

      "description": "I made this account just to ask this lol.\n\nOkay so I met this guy around 2 years ago back when we were in 10th grade. He was very friendly and we had a lot of common interests so we started to just hang out. \n\nWe quickly became buddies; we played videogames, we went out (as friends, of course), we studied together and we even had a small \"band\" with several other friends and we would go over to his house to play on weekends. Time goes by and I notice he is starting to develop a crush on me. I could tell by the way he spoke to me, how he was nicer than usual and how he would notice and compliment my new outfits or haircuts. I liked him but  definitely not in *that* way. He was nice and a pretty chill guy but we had very different opinions on sensitive topics (which I consider very important btw) and I just didn't feel comfortable with the idea of dating him.\n\nSo he just makes subtle insinuations that he wants to date me but I either ignore him or tell him \"no\". Time goes on and then he introduces me to a new friend (let's name him T). T was super cool and I felt like I was crushing on him right away. It's difficult to explain but I quickly fell in love with him. And he did the same.   \nEventually T and I start going out without telling the other guys (including my best friend) and things are going really good for us.\n\nMy best friend then came to my house, around a month ago or so, to just you know, hang out and do the usual things. We are watching some anime in my bedroom when he finally opens up and asks: \"Hey Cassie, do you wanna be my girlfriend?\". I looked at him pretending to be shocked. I simply answered with \"Aw but I think we would best if we're friends, y'know... I just don't feel like we should date\".\n\nAt that moment he just looks away, hurt, and replies with a \"fine\". It was the most awkward thing and I was really uncomfortable. He eventually gets up and tells me he has to leave to which I simply nodded and wished him luck.\n\nHe didn't text me after that. He was very distant and avoided me whenever he could at school. \n\nThen, a week ago, T is the one who asks me out. I was super happy and of course said yes. We've been dating since. We told our friends and well... Shit got real.\n\nThey told me that my best friend was heartbroken, how could I do that to him, etc etc. I explained them that I just wasn't in love with him and I wanted to be honest and well... Just a bunch of nonsense drama. They made me feel awful for dating T instead of my best friend.\n\nI noticed that my best friend unfriended me from Facebook and he was posting things about how he unsuccesful at love, how terrible he felt and even how all the girls are going for bad guys (obviously intended to me)\n\nI feel so bad rn. My friends don't even welcome us (T &amp; I) anymore. Am I really the one who's on the wrong here? ",

Before I went back to university, we decided to date and try being in a long-distance relationship (keep in mind that this is about fifteen days since we went on our first date). All in all, I spent half of January in my hometown to see her because I didnt have much trouble with my exams, but when the period of exams ended, I knew I had to go back to Uni for a really long time because I cant afford economically and academically to take the train every weekend, it's a lot of time and money.\n\nAnyway, before meeting her, I was still talking to a a girl, which was my best friend and ex. We have a complicated story. Dated, broke up, still talked everyday, fell out then became friends again and on and on. I thought I had gotten over her but the relationship with this girl made me realize that I still loved her.\n\nSo, when I became aware of this, I knew that I had to break up with her. I debated a lot with my friends and myself what to do, and I always reached the same conclusion over and over, I had to blame distance and being this early in a relationship.

      "description": "This is a story that spans almost a decade. Very long story, but the TL;DR Is still there if you want it. I strongly advise against it though.\n\nA long time ago I met a girl (let's call her D) in a Facebook group chat, we clicked and we became best friends, chatting everyday.\nBasically, both of us were in love with each other but were too scared to make the first move. So she ended up with another guy, probably to make me jealous.\nAfter almost a year of supposed friendzone agony, they broke up and a mutual friend told me I should tell her that I like her (he knew she liked me).\nI took the leap and actually bought a ticket to travel where she lives. I spent 5 days in her grandparents' house, I was 15 so I had to go with my mother.\nIn the end we kissed, I said goodbye and I told her that next time she will come where I live.\n\nAfter almost one year she buys the ticket and I tell her that she can no longer come (my family told me at the last minute that could not afford to have a guest).\nI don't remember much after that. I just know that somehow we didn't talk anymore as time went by and I got a girlfriend.\n\nAfter a couple of years she managed to find me on Facebook again (I had deleted my profile because I need to take a break from it) and she texted me asking me how I was doing. I was so happy to have found her again but because of my jealous girlfriend I had to be VERY cold and insensitive. D's last text was \"Don't vanish!\"... I did not answer.\n\n\nThis was the last time I heard from her for 4 years.\n\n\n2 years later me and my gf broke up.\n\nI found D on Instagram.\nI said hello.\nI knew there was something wrong.\nShe was SO angry, cold, I could immediately tell.\n\nI tried to apologize as best as I could. Multiple times. She always responded with stuff like \"It's in the past now, don't worry.\"\n\nYesterday I told her all the truth, explaining why I did what I did. She told me that when she bought the ticket she tried to get a refund but she didn't get it, it was pretty expensive. I feel like garbage for what I did even if I was just a child. She appreciated the honesty though.\n\nIn the end I asked her to know only if I still mattered something to her or I was just \"a thing in the past\".\nShe told me that even though she felt like shit because of me, I still do matter \"something\".\nYet I know she hates me, she is very cold and distant. \n\nI am very sad right now. Maybe I still love her, maybe I don't. I am sure I still care for our relationship and it's breaking my heart.\n\nWhy, after a these apologies and miserable honesty, does she treat me like I am so irrelevant? \n\nTL;DR: I was a big asshole to a girl in the past. Now I said sorry and she still hates me.\n\nWether I am asshole or not, is there anything I can do to fix this? ",

      "description": "I'm currently living with my mom but am moving out on the first of March. Although it is definitely time for me to move out, I feel like I'm not that behind on doing it as I am only turning 19 tomorrow. Especially living in Canada where housing is extremely expensive, very few people I know move out at this age, but then again, I'm open to the idea that maybe I am doing this all wrong.\n\nEvery morning, around 7, I wake up to her standing in my doorway either just standing there with the light turned on staring at me, or yelling about how lazy I am for not living on my own yet, or telling me to do something like unload the dishwasher or whatever (which could definitely just be done in an hour or so after I'm feeling a bit more rested), or to just complain that I'm lazy and should have a different job because my scattered work hours annoy her because she doesn't like hearing the door open when I get home around midnight if I'm doing a closing shift. \n\nWhen I try to tell her that i don't appreciate that or how she never just knocks on my door and speaks to me calmly, she turns into a T-Rex and makes a bunch of loud noises that I guess are supposed to mean \"this is y house, I can do what I want, if you don't like it, get out.\" She doesn't seem satisfied when I tell her that I will be out in less than two weeks because when this is happening she wants me gone NOW. Once in grade 11 when she told me to get out over something silly and I actually did leave and my boyfriend's parents were willing to take me in because they're super-duper beyond kind and many times they had overheard her yelling at me on the phone, calling either me or my boyfriend or EVEN THEM rude names even though to this day she's never met them, she would call me just about everyday saying that I'm immature for running away from my problems and not just putting up with her. I lived with them until the end of grade 12 and came back because at that point my grandma was staying at my moms place and it was nice to be around her.\n\nSorry for rambling on, I don't know if the info helps at all. Also I know that even if people side with me on this, i know this might be silly because walking up to her with a computer saying \"the internet thinks you're in the wrong\" is not going to do anything but I really need to A) work on myself and the way I think if I'm being  a spoiled brat or B) get some peace of mind knowing that I'm not that bad of a person.\n\n\nEDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO/ I was extremely lucky and got to move out early! I’m glad to have my own space and feel more comfortable and relaxed. My mom has started to text me and be much more kind since I’ve left. I’m proud of myself.",

We planned out a meeting together which he said he would run. Now, his girlfriend rescheduled a plan they had (the day of) so that he wouldn't be able to come to scouts. They planned to meet for two hours. If he cuts it to 1 hour he'll only be 15 minutes late to scouts. I suppose its important to mention that scouts was planned before their \"date\".

      "description": "Ok, so of course at first glance, the title would make me jump to asshole for even suggesting that. However, let me explain.\n\nMy girlfriend (20F) and me (21M) have been together for about 2.5 years. We met while in College and it’s mostly great. We got along well, we had even talked about marriage. However, things began to change a few month ago.\n\nHer family is mean, and I mean really mean. They bicker to her every second about her life choices. For example, they harassed her for month when she decided to go into music education because it wasn’t a STEM field. Well, I met these parents a few times and they invited me to go on vacation with them. I accepted, but they offered in a kind of way that they were rubbing their nose over me. However. I saw to the full extent what these parents did to my girlfriend. Her mother would consistently berate her about weight (She’s chubby, but like, not even close to obese) and her dad likes to yell for a variety of reasons. Anyway, they don’t end up liking me.\n\nFine, I figure that things will be fine and she and I are adults. Who cares about what the family thinks? Well, they start nailing into her and if it’s not about me then it’s about her chair in the college concert band. \n\nShe begins to start feeling worthless. Which I do try to come in and help out. But her parents are still bashing her and she is just upset and understandably so. I feel bad, so I start making offers.\n\nI tell her she can come live with me and we could organize some loans to get her through the rest of college.  She refuses that idea because she is afraid of how her family might respond. Fine.\n\nHowever, now she is depressed. She feels trapped. She is regularly lashing out by yelling and getting into fights. She is pushing other people away and just doesn’t feel motivated to do her work. It’s starting to affect me and I just don’t know how to keep putting up with it.\n\nI started talking to a friend about it and they told me that I was an asshole and thought I was abandoning her. I just feel that I’m young and I have things to focus on. I like her a lot, but her depression just hurts. Even after breaking up, I would still help her anyway I can.\n\nTL;DR Partner’s Parents make her feel like crap. Now, she is depressed and lashing out.\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway, for reasons.\n\nI’m 56 years old and my daughter is 17\n\nThe daughter and I have had a few issues throughout the years which started in her teens, as most father-daughter problems do.\n\nWhen she was little, she was a little chubby so I used to call her chubster, pudge, etc, as a joke and talk to her about the importance of losing weight. When I was growing up, my dad would often call me fat and to keep fat, which inspired me to lose weight and get fit. \n\nAnyway, when she got to her teens, she started being a bit funny about being eating, (making herself sick, etc). She wasn’t anorexic though as she wasn’t skinny enough. Anyway, we started having arguments and the revolving subject of those tiffs would be how I made her feel ‘unworthy’ and ‘fat’. She also keeps bringing up this occasion where I apparently called her fat in public at age eight, making her cry and telling her, ‘go eat a chocolate bar, that will make you feel better, fatty’. This is an event I cannot remember but my wife remembers clearly. \n\nThis has caused a significant rift between my daughter and I and on many occasions she has used the silent treatment on me. I’m talking weeks of silence, only speaking to the wife. It makes it unbearable. \n\nWe usually have a slightly jokey relationship when we are friendly, however the banter sometimes becomes a little bit personal. She will call me fat etc and I will in return. Sometimes, it’s ok and sometimes it’s not. I just don’t know where I stand. \n\nAnyway, in one event in question, she called me a ‘cock’ so I said she had a big nose. It was all friendly but immediately, after I said that, she went cold on me. Turns out, or so my wife tells me, she hates her nose which is sort of Roman-esque but nothing huge or anything. It’s one of her ‘big insecurities’. She didn’t speak to me for about a week and is still cool with me now. \n\nAnyway reddit, am I the asshole for taking banter too far? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This happened a few days ago and first I thought she was overreacting but I mentioned it to a friend back home who told me I was being an asshole so I've been thinking of it more...\n\n\nI travel a lot for work and was recently in a really dope city for a conference in which I got put up in a super swank hotel. I match with a girl from tinder and we exchange snap usernames and start talking on there. We send a couple of innocent snaps before she mentions she is in an Open relationship and was just looking for no strings attached sex, pretty much a hot romp 1 off. This piques my interest immediately and tbh I started getting a bit hard and my thoughts racing. I ask her when she wants to meet up and she tells me she'll get through with her day and then hit me up.\n\nBlood rushing to my dick, I send her a couple video snaps of my suite. This thing is seriously huge. Double room. Sweet bathroom. Amazing view with a balcony. I follow up with where I'm staying, that I have a private super swank room and that maybe she should come over when she's done with work. She opens the vids and says the room looks great, thanks for the view and offer etc etc but that she has had bad experiences with meeting strangers at hotels in the past and that she would rather meet somewhere neutral first to see if we vibe. I say okay.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, I'm completely hard and looking over this girl's pics and get a bit caught up in the moment of possibly banging someone elses girlfriend in a city i'm visiting. I send her a quick dick pic and a view of the skyline from my balcony and tell her \"Or you should just come over right now and I can fuck you against this window.\"\n\nShe shuts down immediately. Calls me an inconsiderate asshole for \"pressuring\" her after she told me she had a bad experience. I honestly didn't think it was that big of a deal and more spur of the moment sexy but she immediately blocked me and unmatched me from Tinder. It's been a few days since and I'm still blocked so I ended up mentioning it to a friend back home who basically gasped and called me a raging asshole. So.... AITA? ",

      "description": "Boyfriend has tried going to school many times before i met him.  maybe 5?  He has always been in the service industry as a server/back of the house, etc.  He complains all  the time that he hates the job and wants to get out of the industry.  At first he tried real estate, he said industry was booming and he could make  a lot.  He went to school, passed one state test, failed the federal or something 3 times and quit.  All while doing part time serving, while I supported him with my full time job. We live together by ourselves.  Recently about 3 months ago he started going online school for IT, he said that he loved computers and this was his what he wanted to do.  IT made a lot of money and had a high pay while moving up.  I was proud and said good for you trying to make a change.  I was really proud of him for deciding to do something with his life.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust now he said he wanted to quit school (already failed a class and is now on academic probation for doing bad in his current class). He said he will start to be a bar back since they have potential for a lot of money.  Which I guess they do.  Every time he would start school he would tell me to make sure he's on track.  So when he told me he wanted to quit school this time I told him not to, and he hated his current job and told me to keep him on track.  I basically told him what he told me back.  He got mad at me for being irritated and said he just wanted to complain.  Then he said I wasn't being supportive.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do.  I'm his girlfriend so I'm supposed to be supportive but he just always gives up.  I'm supporting him now (he pays half but sometimes he falls short), he only works 4 days so he can go to school online, but now he wants to quit.  How long should I be a supporting girlfriend, like I know some people aren't meant to go to school because they just can't mentally handle it. People need time to figure out what they want to do and I know it might not be now for him.   Was I in the wrong for getting annoyed? Should I have just agreed and let him complain and quit school and support him until he finds his passion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe hates being in service industry, complains all the time.  Maybe being a bar back is his thing so he can work his way up to a bartender.  At the right restaurant/bar they have the ability to make a lot.  But when he's unhappy with his life, sometimes he comes home and it affects our life together.  AITA if I were to break up with him because of his choice to quit school?",

      "title": "AITA for delegating my boyfriend to ask people coming to our house party to clean up after themselves?",
      "description": "It's super bowl Sunday, neither my boyfriend, roommate, or I watch football. However, we have friends who do, so we offered to host and entertain them our 65\" TV, and also to give ourselves an excuse to bust out the deep fryer for some fun. \n\nNow, these are close mutual friends from college. We've been housemates, classmates, project partners, and are in the same student club. Having them over is a blast, and there is no one better to drink with than college friends who've known you for years.\n\nHowever, among this group of people we have several close friends who've frequently been to our place before. And on multiple occasions, I've been left with cleaning up empty bottles, trash, spills, dishes, clutter, etc. While I understand that as a guest, they have no obligation to clean up, I've gotten tired of being the default housekeeper after every party. As I mentioned before, these are mutual friends of me and my boyfriend. When I bring up the issue of no shoes in the house (mopping is hard work), I don't get taken seriously. I've tried asking people not to wear shoes, to pick up bottles, put dishes in the sink, clear the kitchen counter, etc. at the end of these parties, but most of the time I'm met with responses like \"sorry my Uber is here\", or people pick up enough and 'did their part', or people simply leave before I get to ask. \n\nI've stopped asking after a point, because I realized that it was only perceived as nagging and wasn't getting me anywhere. This is going to sound silly, but during a party game there was a question along the lines of \"what does rachelhazideas want more than anything else?\", and people voted \"kitchen counter space\" as the best answer. That's the moment when I understood that I was being a party pooper, so I stopped having expectations towards the guests. Instead, I shifted the responsibility to my boyfriend and asked him to offload some of my work. \n\nUnfortunately, motivating him to clean up after more than himself is not easy, so I decided to ask him to be responsible for asking people to clean up after themselves. He is very nonconfrontational, and I know this is not easy for him, but I asked him simply because people take him more seriously over my nagging. \n\nI asked him to be proactive about this, and suggested making a Facebook chat for everyone coming tomorrow and mention that shoes are not allowed in the house, and also to recruit more cleanup efforts. I could tell that this made him uncomfortable, but I asked him to do it anyways because I said earlier that if anyone walks over the freshly mopped floor with shoes again, I'm just going to walk out of the house. I didn't explain to him why I would. In truth, I'm very anxious about unintentionally becoming the stereotypical woman who cleans up after the men while they watch football and BBQ. It makes me feel isolated, excluded, and like a tag along girlfriend, when this has not been my relationship with these friends during college.\n\nOn one hand, I know that if I want my guests to treat my home a certain way, it's my responsibility to convey that to them. On the other hand, I feel like my boyfriend isn't carrying his half of the burden of mitigating after-party cleanup, or simply cleaning up. Am I the asshole for making him confront our friends on cleaning up, even when I know how it stresses him out?\n\nTldr; I got tired of cleaning up after parties so I asked my boyfriend to delegate instead, knowing that he doesn't enjoy it.",

      "description": "So my mom tells me to shovel a *path* out to her car and her boyfriends car around four o'clock, no big deal I thought and I did it without hesitation and left for work an hour later. Fast forward to my way home from work and she texts me saying that she can believe that I ignored her and should expect to shovel snow in the dark. **Wat?** Fast forward again and I get home and she explains again how I'm going to be shoveling snow in the dark. I politely tell her that she requested a path be dug and that I am not going to go outside when it is *six degrees and windy* just to shovel all *100+ feet* of the driveway when her car has very good all season tires and four wheel drive. May I also add that I could stick my finger in the snow and you could still see half of it.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole?",

      "title": "AITA if I don't want to host a party?",
      "description": "For years, my husband and I had a New Year’s Eve party at our house and invited Couple A and Couple B. For a while, Couple A would bring their kids, then – when the kids got old enough to not want to hang out with the oldsters anymore – it was just the six adults. It was fun – we’d order pizza, my husband and I would prepare appetizers, we’d play games and watch movies, then we’d pop a bottle of champagne at midnight and toast the New Year.\n\n3 years ago, my husband and I were unable to have our party on December 31st – we had a family obligation that we couldn’t get out of. No worries, though – we had the party a few weeks later, even though it wasn’t technically New Years.\n\n2 years ago, Couple B said that they’d been invited to someone else’s house for December 31st – could we have our party a few weeks later like before? We were a little hurt that our long-standing tradition had been disrupted, but we felt that we couldn’t really object since WE’D been the ones to disrupt it the year before (even though we’d had no choice). So, once again, we said yes to the later party.\n\nLast year, same thing – Couple B was once again invited to that same someone else’s house for December 31st. This time, though, Couple B offered to host the later party – they had a new house that they wanted to show off. We three couples had a good time, and I thought “Huh, maybe THIS could be our new tradition – have the later party at Couple B’s house instead of ours.” \n\nNow might be a good time to mention that we see Couple A and Couple B several times a year, and we ALWAYS host. No-one else ever offers to do it. And, to be honest, it kind of bugs me, because it’s a bit expensive. My husband and I pay for 99% of all the food and drinks and, if we rent a movie, we pay for that, too. We’ve tried to make the parties potluck, saying “How about Couple A brings an appetizer, and Couple B brings dessert”, but 9 times out of 10, one or the other of the couples completely forgets to bring anything. It’s kind of become a recurring joke that they’ll arrive at our house and suddenly say in dismay “Oh, were we supposed to bring something?”  \n\nI’ve sometimes suggested that one of the other couples hosts instead of us, but they always say “But it’s so comfy and nice in your house – we’d much rather come to you!” Flattering, I guess – although that puts all of the preparation on us, and the cleanup afterwards, too. Honestly, my husband and I are feeling a bit used. \n\nThis year, Couple B has been invited to the other party on December 31st again, and they’ve asked if WE can host the later party again. I wasn’t really thinking, and I already said “Okay”, but now I’m regretting it. It just feels weird having a NYE party in January or February, plus, I’m still a bit hurt that Couple B would rather have the big celebration with people who aren’t us. It feels like they want to have their cake and eat it too. WIBTA if I said “Let’s just get together for a non-NYE party some other time”?, and WIRBTA (Would I Really Be the A-Hole) if I said “And how about one of you guys host this time?”?",

      "description": "Three days ago my best friend (f20) told me (f21) a story that she heard while hanging out with her boyfriend’s group of friends (they are also friends with my boyfriend, just not as close). \n\nThe story was that one of them got a video of a girl I know having sex with a guy from the high school I used to go to.  The girl in the video used to be in my class, and we were close back then. She is in an open relation with her boyfriend of 6 years, and her boyfriend also knows the people that had the video. \n\nAt first I was kinda outraged because I assumed that she allowed the guy to film and I thought that was kinda disrespectful towards her boyfriend since everyone knows each other and he could end up watching the video.\nI thought about this for some days, and then when I talked it over with my boyfriend and other friend, it hit us, maybe she didn’t consent it. \nAt the moment, to me, it was logical that the right thing to do would be to tell the girl in the video that there was a video going around, and that I wanted her to know, because if she didn’t allowed the guy to film it she should act on it. \nAs it turns out, they had sex but she wasn’t aware of the video. \n\nAfter that, she immediately called me crying, telling me everything, and I couldn’t bring myself to lie to her since we would be talking about a serious crime if the video existed, so I just told her everything I knew, names and everything. She then talked to the guy that supposedly filmed, he denied it and she believed him. \n\nThe thing is that this guy now wanted to go talk to the guy that was telling people he had the video. The girl told me he was standing in front of his house... and that guy is friends with my best friend and her boyfriend... so then I called my best friend and told her what I did. She immediately lost it, called her boyfriend, who called the guy telling everyone that had the video the other guy was going to go meet him at his house. \n\nMy best friend was furious, telling me I just made drama with the friends of her boyfriend. And saying that I should have talked to her before I talked to the girl (I agree with that, I just really thought the girl in the video knew and the convo would end there, mainly because this girl post a lot of sexual content online and I know she wouldn’t be ashamed to tell me if she knew there was a video. It was never my plan to tell my friends names). \n\nShe was really mad, and I apologized a lot, thinking that I betrayed her. The thing is that I really felt I was doing the right thing.  And I feel that she is prioritizing her “friendship” with people that lie, and spread rumors, or even film other without permission, over me. She is coming over tonight to talk, and I would really like to know if everyone thinks AITA. ",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile. Also sorry that this is crazy long. \n\nSome background: I have a husband and 12 year old son. My husband is the step father, we have been together 3.5 years.   \n\nMy son and I were living in California when I met my husband. After a year, we were engaged and he was offered a job in Indiana. We decided since I was working full time and trying to go to school full time, that I would quit my job and we would move across the country. This way I could focus on school and then get a job. \n\nMoving to Indiana meant moving my son away from his father, who we can call P. P was never consistent, spent a lot of money on drinking and weed, and never ever ever paid child support. For the last several years before we moved, I wouldn't even tell my kid when P was coming to pick him up because many times he didn't show up. So, we weren't exactly moving away from father of the year. Side comment: I did set it up with the courts that the child support he was supposed to be paying could be put into a travel fund to fly the kid back and forth. This is enough for him to fly out twice per month via Southwest. Aside from the three times my husband paid for the kid to go out there, his father has never flown him out. We haven't heard from P in a year and a half now. \n\nMy kid took the first move really hard. He was in fifth grade, had lost his grandma (my mom) a year and a half prior, and now had lost his dad, for all intents and purposes. He actually failed a class which was not like my kid at all... And he started making some friends that were bad influences. I always give kids a chance because you never know what kind of situation they have at home, but when they prove that they don't want to live a better life I figure I can't help them. \n\nAnyways, After I graduated, I got a great job paying about $120K per year, and was accepted into a top MBA program in Chicago (I travel to Chicago once per week for classes). This job required that we move about 50 miles away. I stayed at this job for just over a year, but the culture and environment was so unhealthy I actually started to suffer depression (no prior experience with depression). I started to let go of things I cared about, my grades were slipping, and I found myself not really smiling from being happy but smiling from force of habit/appropriateness. \n\nAnyways, things got really bad for me and my husband and I decided I would quit my job and focus on acquiring a small business (which has always been our dream). \n\nThe kid adjusted much better to the second move. He has all A's and two B's at school. He is an avid hockey player and is at the rink practicing 5-6 days a week. He even has a pretty little girlfriend. He's adamant that he never wants to move again. \n\nFast forward to 3 months later. The business deal fell through and we're super disappointed about it. We've spent thousands getting prepared to take over this business in our city but unfortunately it didn't work out. \n\nCurrent situation: my husband is currently a VP. He makes good money but we lost a lot of income when I quit my job. \n\nHe's been looking for a new position for a couple of reasons. Things are getting really rough at his current place of employment. They were just bought out and all the higher level executives are at each other's throats and stabbing each other in the back, because they know the new owners won't keep all of them. This makes his day to day life more stressful. \n\nAlso, he wants to be able to supplement some of the income I was making/would have been making with the business venture. This will also help me start a new business of making fine wood crafts and custom furniture. \n\nThis week he's staying up in Michigan, about four hours from here, interviewing for a President position. He's one of two candidates and I have no doubt he'll get an offer (he's amazing!)\n\nI have really no attachment to where we're living aside from a little part time job I have, horseback riding lessons and Irish dance lessons. I'm sure I can find those things up in Michigan too though. \n\nMy concern is for my son though. I'm so worried about moving him again. I'm not worried that he won't adjust again, I think he will. He has such big dreams and he wants to get a scholarship to pay hockey for Notre Dame. I'm sure all of that will continue. I'm just so conflicted about sending him through the emotional trauma of moving again. \n\nWe discussed my husband moving to Michigan and coming home on weekends, so that my son and I would stay here But, my son has made so many exceptional improvements since having a male role model in his life, that I feel losing that will do more harm that moving again. We're a family and need to stay together. \n\nIf this all goes through, my kid and I would stay where we are until the end of the school year and then move in the summer. My husband would move immediately. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I moved my kid a third time in three years? ",

      "description": "Let me give some context. Around September, my close friend (X) and I met someone around a year older than us (Y). I met him through a class that he later dropped, and I thought he was kind of cute (I am a bisexual man). Later on, I introduced him to her after class one day (keep in mind that she knew about my affection for Y). For several months, we’ve had a pretty good friend group, and the three of us would always hang out, get lunch and coffee, etc. After a while, I became suspicious of the whole situation. After hanging out with Y alone (we work out together sometimes), he told me that he felt something for X. I eventually couldn’t keep the secret from Y. After I told her, we were very conflicted because she didn’t want to date him originally, but said she wanted to “try it out” now. Because the situation caused us to have a few arguments and made us upset, we made an agreement which stated that neither of us could pursue him romantically in order to preserve the friendship between the three of us. Roughly a week ago, Y told me that she that she wanted to date him for several months, and they have gone on several dates, lying to me about them in the process. I’m now pretty mad about the situation, and it makes me upset to think about how I may lose two of my close friends because of this. ",

      "description": "I have a friend that I've been talking to for several months now; I'm very slow to make friends because of my mental health, it makes it difficult for me to branch out and try to communicate. This friend is important to me, I'm involved in their life at this point, as I know all their friends, people they've dated, places they've been recently, even though we haven't been friends for very long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat friend revealed to me that they were pregnant recently, though I've had suspicions mounting over the past few weeks. They got back together with a male ex, they've been complaining about back pain and nausea, looking for a better paying job, etc. I had to ask them up front because they didn't tell me when they found out about two weeks ago. I don't have very many details on the matter, other than they seem utterly distraught over the whole situation, and that the girl they were seeing broke up with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, pregnancy and children are the two things that cause panic attacks in me. Even writing the word gives me stomach cramps that last for hours or cold sweats that linger. I have a phobia, to the point where I considered drastic measures when I had a pregnancy scare about half a year ago. I do my best in public, but it almost always comes with sweating or vomiting or a breakdown afterward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis friend has told me that they are depending on me for emotional support while their life is in shambles, and I've tried my best to comfort them over the phone, via texts, or personal visits. But it's taken a toll on me. All they talk about with me now is their pregnancy, how hard it is, how their life is ruined, and it's getting to a point where I'm becoming so overwhelmed with it all that I start getting stomach cramps whenever I've seen that they've messaged me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't told them about my phobia; I intended to before, but now I feel as though it would be selfish to do so. Pregnancy is an enormous amount of stress, and I know it's the most important thing in their life right now. I feel like, my stupid phobias seem meager and unimportant. I've rarely discussed it with people in the past, if they have had children or are around children, and normally just slowly evaporated from that person's life to avoid causing them trouble. I've been considering doing the same with this friend, lessening our contact more and more until it's minimal, before vanishing entirely. They'll have a child that I will fear coming into contact with despite the enormous amount of therapy I've been through to ease the problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: A close friend of mine is pregnant, and I have a debilitating phobia of children and pregnancy as a concept. I haven't told them about my phobia and they've told me they're relying on me right now for emotional support. Am I the asshole for considering ghosting them?",

      "description": "On Saturday night my girlfriend picked me up for my house to hang out and have dinner. I decided to stay the night and go home in the morning. Well It was a wonderful day to go out and take a walk. I even offered to take her dogs for a walk earlier in the morning. Which she said no and gave no reason for. After sitting around waiting for to be ready to take me home. I thought it would be a good idea to just walk. So I went into her room, she was about to shower. Told her I was leaving and I would see her later. She asked if someone was picking me up, I said no I was going to walk. She starts saying I wont be much longer just a shower and I can take you. I said its cool Ill just walk I want to anyways. She then starts making up excuses as to why I shouldn't walk. Its to far, no one walks home, offers to take me home then. I told her it is not that far of a walk, I like to walk and don't worry about. She gets pissed off and just jumps in the shower without saying anything after that. I went for my walk. Some info about the walk. It was at 11:00am on a Sunday morning in one of the more wealthy parts of town. According to google maps it is 4miles, one street all the way down crosses 2 intersections. No big deal I have walked further then this before. I was having a wonderful walk get about half way there when she calls yelling and screaming at me for walking home. Telling me I better get in the car when she pulls up. I start thinking to myself what is this nonsense. It is just walk but whatever I will get in the car. When I get in the car she starts yelling and screaming telling me to never do that again and that I shouldn't have gone on the walk. I say it was just a walk it is not that far anyways. I was really enjoying it. She doesn't seem to care and start exaggerating on the distance of the walk. I don't really say much kinda in shock that she is yelling at me like I am a child. We get to the house I get out of the car she slams on her gas and drives off. I then receive a text saying never do that in my presence again. I respond with I will do whatever I want. It was just a walk. This breaks off into a whole different argument that I will spare the details of. Unless wanted.  So Am I? I am very confused on this still.  ",

      "description": "This just happened, and I'm wondering if I was rude in the moment. \n\nAt work, we recently moved office buildings, and the one we're currently in is an unlocked building. When we first moved into our office, we got a lot of people just walking in off the street and soliciting to us, so our boss put up a sign outside the door that says \"No soliciting, please. Thank you.\" It's the only thing on the door besides our company name. \n\nJust now, a guy walks in in a full suit (it's Florida and 80 degrees out, so I felt for the guy) and makes a joke or two about why he's here. I asked him a couple times what I could help him with, and he finally got to the point. \n\n\"I'm actually working with T-Mobile to bring businesses better service. Is the head of the office around?\" My boss was in his office, but I knew he wouldn't want to hear from this guy, so I decided to let him down gently. \n\n\"No, sorry, he's in a meeting. Now's not really a good time.\" Then I looked pointedly at the door he had just come through. \n\nThen he says, \"Well, I'm actually allowed to extend this promotion to employees as well, who's your carrier?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm annoyed. He's clearly interrupting the work day and our open office space, which I know is his job, but I shouldn't have even entertained him in the first place, since I know he saw the sign when he walked in. So I say, quietly, \"Listen, man, you're not supposed to be soliciting here. There's a sign on the door that's pretty clear.\" \n\nHe says, \"Ha, yeah, I hate solicitors too!\" At that point, I just looked at him and then at the door and waited. He thanked me, I thanked him in return, and he left. \n\nWhen he left, my coworkers all climbed out of the woodwork to ask what he wanted. When I told them what transpired and what I'd said, a few people had raised eyebrows, and one person said, \"You really said that to him?\" So now I'm worried that maybe I was rude and should have just let him do the spiel and said \"No, thank you,\" at the end. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Hello, first time posting and not sure if imgur links are allowed, if so then there will be a nice link to the exact conversation in question here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/GKWJCFp](https://imgur.com/a/GKWJCFp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case it's not allowed, here is the story in full. I DM for several friends a DND game and we had a request from one of the players to have our game on Monday instead of our normal Tuesday because his Birthday was Tuesday and he might be doing things that don't involve us. It was going to end up being just two of my three players at first since the third player couldn't make a Monday game so I was going to prepare a one shot game... until two days before the game when the player whose house we host the game at invited his roommate to play with us. He would be playing for the first time and I was more than willing to introduce someone to the game. I prepared a quick newbie game, made the NPCs, made character sheets for the players. I was ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA half hour before I'm ready to head out for the game I get a message from the host that the roommate might not make it, and then as I am on the road I get confirmation from the host that roommate is not going to make it.  The following conversation happens via our group chat:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"So... board game night?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHost: \"No!\"\n\nHost: \\*crying emoji\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Ok... I guess I'll head home then.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen silence. Nobody said anything in the group chat for 50 minutes. I thought the night was called and done until I get a text asking where I'm at and an argument ensues. The main point seems to be that I should have known Host was joking and come to hang out anyway, and that I should have clarified that I WASN'T joking by saying I was heading home. ",

      "description": "So I (32m) started dating a new girl (26f) after a disgusting horrible divorce from my wife who I’ve been with for like 15 years.. \n\nSo I was super patent and deliberate in choosing a girl to date, turning down lots of others over the last year or so of separation... Then I met this girl and she is like EVERYTHING I want in a woman, and I could really see myself having a long-term relationship with her. \n\nWe took things slow and waited about a month to have sex, just fooling around and doing other stuff. Then when the time came she stopped me right before and told me she had been living with herpes since the age of 19.. She was very mature and responsible and understanding and said she’d give me time to think about it, but...TBH I’m fucking freaking out. I’m terrified that this could affect me and my life forever if I end up being with her.\n\nI basically told her all of this, and broke up with her. I said that I couldn’t risk my health or well being and that I’ve been through too much to not give myself every chance at happiness. She says I’m being immature and I’m an asshole and insists that it’s really no big deal.\n\nSo, am I being an asshole?? I sure feel like one... But at this point in my life and with a daughter who I basically raise alone I need to be selfish with my time and my life. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What are my options? Help me out Reddit, I’m feeling pretty f’ed up over this...",

      "description": "I have been with my girlfriend for 9 years, we’ve been long distance for 2 of those years (I know so crazy! We saw each other regularly though and I know she has been loyal). We are both in our late 20s.\n\nAbout 2 years ago she started noticing that she had issues with her body. She had been in college at the time finishing her second to last semester and was during it, she got sick and she had to go to the hospital for severe abdominal pain. \n\nThe doctor’s could not find anything wrong with her and she was referred to a rheumatologist. When she got her blood results, she was told that she possibly had an autoimmune but they couldn’t pinpoint the exact one. \n\nShe kept going on with school and kept trying to find out what was going on with her. She is a bit of a hypochondriac so she will go to doctors but she’s also scared to take medication because of possible severe side effects. She also has extreme anxiety and slightly dependent on her mother, who is essentially her best friend. \n\nAnyways as I said earlier, we are long distance. Like she lives in Florida and I live in Massachusetts. Before I moved up there, I had asked her what she thought of possibly moving up there after she graduated in December 2017. She said yes. \n\nAnyways, she moves up here with some of her stuff and immediately arrived to one of the coldest winter’s in Massachusetts history. She stayed here for like 2 months and then went down to get more stuff for her move. What was supposed to be 3 weeks, turned into 2 months. \n\nDuring those 2 months she was feeling terrible again. Feeling pain in her abdomen and also had a lot of feminine issues that scared her. She was desperate to find an answer and somehow ended up going to a homeopathic doctor who put her on some strict food regimen. \n\nShe moves back up and finds a job that paid very little and made her do the work for two people at two locations. In all honesty, this job sucked and with her stress and anxiety, she kept having flair ups. She had a really nasty flair up and she said screw that job and she quit. \n\nAfter quitting she said she was going to go down to Florida for a few weeks with a one way ticket. I knew that meant that she was going to be there for an indefinite amount of time (her mom works for an airline and can fly for very cheap). Well turns out I was right. She has been gone since early September. \n\nThis entire time has been very stressful for me. I had high hopes of having a present partner and she let me down with that part of it. Down there she has gone to a bunch of doctors trying to get answers. Over this time I gave her an ultimatum and told her she needs to be back by feb 1 or I am done. \n\nLike 2 weeks ago she went to a rheumatologist and got blood drawn and it was found out that she had serious issues. Her doctor told her that if she doesn’t do anything about it, it could be dangerous. The doctor prescribed her a medication called Plaquenil. My girlfriend googled it and she found that it had a possibility of serious side effects such as blindness and a weakened immune system leaving her susceptible to infections. \n\nAnyways she decides that she does not want to take the medication and she is going to the homeopathic doctor and doing natural healing and will need more time and won’t be able to come up on Feb 1. \n\nThis enraged me because I am a firm believer of evidence based medicine and I do not believe in alternative medicine. I told her she still needs to come up and she was crying and I could tell she was scared. I want to support her so bad. I offered to help her portion of the rent and to get her on my health insurance (luckily my job allows) and I started going off on her about how she’s ignoring her doctor’s orders and putting her life at risk over some bs natural witchcraft. That pissed her off. I told her feb 1 she better come up or like I said we are done. She said I am not supportive, that my offer of helping her financially is just so I can hold it over her head.\n\nI truly love this girl. She is my rock. We have been together for a long time and we had lived together in the past and made it through a break up due to some infidelity on my part. When I moved up for work in 2016 she had 2 years left of school so I waited. I feel like I am throwing out my soulmate for being impatient but goddamn do I get annoyed she’s not following her doctor’s orders and I truly do love her. \n\nAm I being the asshole. \n\n",

But that doesn't bother me, what bothers me is that she let's her 2 and a half year old daughter do whatever she wants with no consequences. It doesn't help that my dad also takes her side all of the time and he also sees no wrong in her doing. The last straw before I said something to them is when her daughter hit my dog hard as crap on the head with a hard plastic wand thing and I yelled at her for doing it and she started crying. Then my sister and dad yelled at me and told me to put the dogs downstairs. I just told them to teach her the difference between right and wrong instead of taking the easy way out. Their argument is that she is to young and I said shes not young enough not to know the difference between yes and no. I told my sister I wish she moved back out and shes a bad mom in the sense that she lets her child do anything and when she grows up she is going to be a demon child that's going to make her life miserable.

      "description": "So this happened a few years back, and I no longer live with this roommate (not because of issues, he moved away to pursue a master's)\n\nOne morning before work, my roommate was taking longer than usual in the only bathroom in the house. Normally we had it down pretty well so that I was done in time to catch my bus. But that day he took an extra 15 min. \n\nBecause of this I decided to knock on the door and politely remind him that I need to get ready for work. I may have used the words \"hurry up\" but I don't think my tone or intention was aggressive, just informative. \n\nWhen I knocked and said this, he blew up on me. He opened the door, started yelling, waving his razor and saying \"you don't knock and bother someone while they are in the bathroom\".\n\nI was a little intimidated, but I just held my ground, said that I was going to be late to work because of him, and I don't appreciate being yelled at.\n\nI come from a house that had two bathrooms and 7 people living in at (at least at one point). Knocking to let someone know you need the restroom (either if you couldn't hold it or you had to be somewhere) was never an issue. So I didn't think it would be an issue in a house with 3 people and on bathroom. AITA for knocking and asking someone to speed it up a little?",

      "description": "Alright so here’s some background information; I am in high school and I do online school, which means I’m always home. I live with my mom, brother, and sister.  My mom is a teacher so she leaves for work in the morning and gets home at around 4. My sister has a job with varying hours. My brother mainly just stays in his room. \n\nSo I’ve been wanting a dog for a while, and a week before my mom got a dog, I had taken care of a friends dog. Let’s just say I was very unprepared for this. I never actually put any thought into how much work a a dog is, and by the end of taking care of this dog, I felt drained. Now the dog I took care of wasn’t even a “bad dog,” she was trained and basically just slept all day. For some reason, I still felt exhausted, even though I only took care of her for a day and a half.  After the friend had taken back their dog, I had texted our family group chat that I felt so drained and that I didn’t want a dog anymore. \n\nNow a few days later, my mom texted our group chat saying that she’s getting a dog. My response was basically neutral and I didn’t say anything about not wanting a dog. I understand that I probably should have but I don’t think that would’ve changed anything. \n\nIt’s been about 2 weeks since we she brought the dog home and I just really wish that she would’ve asked if we were all on board with getting him. I don’t hate him or anything, I just don’t like having him, if that makes any sense. I’m the one always home, so I’m the one that basically takes care of him. My mom says that if I don’t want to be with him, then I can just go to my room, but I feel guilty leaving him alone. He’s really energetic and needs a lot of attention, which is basically the opposite of me. I like being alone and just staying in my room all day doing work. I feel bad for being a little mad at my mom for getting him, and I feel bad for not wanting him. So am I the asshole?",

      "description": "  So I've been roommates with a guy friend for the last four years because him and his old roommate had a falling out, so I let him move in with me, in my house I'm renting from my folks. It's not a big house at all, it even has a door way between our rooms, but no door.(Its just the way the house is built)\n\n   Any time he had a problem I would do what I could to fix it. It started off with simple request and I didn't mind putting up with it because he pays his side of the bills but, he has gotten worse since I got a boyfriend. \n \n  He now eats most of the food I buy, specially the junk food and he doesn't buy any (He ones ate over 85% of a family size lasagna by himself in two days). He has no issues dirting up dishes, but won't wash a single one after they pile up in his room for three weeks. (No joke, in four years of living here, he might have wash them 5 times). He doesn't clean up the house at all because he's tired from work and it's not his problem, that I need to do it.\n    \n   He has bitch that I need to stop listing to creepy stories or crepy documentaries while I sleep because he can hear it and it bothers him, that maybe I should just sleep with the tv off. He sleeps anywhere between 8 PM to 7 AM and between those times, if I make a sound louder than a whisper, he gets mad.\n\n   Now the icing on the cake is that he has made it very well known he doesn't like it when I have sex with my boyfriend and when i mean well known, he has slammed doors as soon as he has gotten home to tell me he is home and to shut up (again, it's a tiny house) he has even texted me ten minutes after the fact, just to tell me we woke him up. (I just got a text tonight from him that reads, \"you wake me up every night\"). \n\n   He won't shit when my boyfriend is around or awake. He wont say anything to my face, but he sure likes to text me all his issues and complaints. I've bent the knee more times than I can count to make him happy, hell I've even try to change my life style so he would shut up, but this has just finally built up and I can't take it anymore. I love my night owl life style, I love my creepy stories, and I love banging my man loudly! He knew all this about me before he moved in, he has no problem with any of this until my boyfriend is around. I'm just lost for words. I don't think I'm the Ass, but according to him I am one and being extra disrespectful on top of that. So I ask yall, AITA? Or should I tell him to go play jump rope in traffic?",

      "description": "AITA: \nEveryone in my office (mostly women) seems obsessed with who poops in which bathroom. There is one women’s bathroom upstairs where all of the cubicles are, and there are several downstairs where the main lobby, kitchen, and everything else is. On my first day here the HR rep told me the downstairs bathrooms were the designated “pooping”bathrooms. I’ve heard office gossip about one girl who allegedly poops in the upstairs bathroom just to spite everyone. At an office meeting yesterday one of the women in my office made an announcement to reiterate this rule, and complained that someone had pooped in the upstairs bathroom and that it smelled up the entire office. Even though whoever pooped had used the air freshener that’s in there, this apparently only caused the two smells to mingle. I feel that this is extremely petty and on the level of high school girl behavior. Especially to bring it up in a meeting as if it’s official business worth sharing to everyone. Personally I use the upstairs bathroom to poop if all of the downstairs bathrooms are full or if I just don’t feel like going all the way downstairs. I do feel a little spiteful when doing so because I feel they are being so petty about their “rule”. However my cubicle is not near the bathroom so I actually can’t be sure if it truly smells or not. I also don’t think that my poop ever smells that bad or strong, but I can’t be sure of that either because people tend to be a little smell blind to their own poop. I understand being disgusted by the smell of someone else’s poop, I also think it’s super gross. I just feel that these women take it too far, so I continue to poop upstairs. Am I the asshole for spitefully pooping upstairs, and possibly putting the petty women through the uncomfortable experience of having to smell my poop? \n\n(FYI I was given the name of the woman who is accused of spitefully pooping upstairs, it’s not me. Again I’m not sure if they know that I poop upstairs or not) ",

      "description": "This actually happened back in like August but I keep thinking about it and was reminded of it last night when we returned to the same place. \n\nBack in August, my whole family went to a popular sports bar for my cousins 21st birthday and rented out the back of the restaurant because our family is quite large. Everything was fine and went well until it was time to leave. \n\nNow the floor in the majority of the restaurant has that shitty outdoor carpet that you find at places such as this that isn't soft in any way but also isn't smooth either. I hope you guys know what I'm talking about. \n\nAnyways, it was all carpeted besides this tile area by the hostesses podium. This area was slightly wet and kinda slippery from what I assume was a pop machine leaking. I slid a little and warned my family behind me but ultimately ignored it.  It seemed fresh and I was sure someone would clean it up. \n\nMy boyfriend, however, had a different plan. He rudely pulled aside a waitress (not the hostess who was literally right there) who was very busy in the middle of carrying a lot of stuff and sneered at her that the floor was wet and they should \"probably clean it up or at least put a sign down.\" He was very rude and I, feeling for then girl and being a waitress myself, pulled his arm away and told him to stop being rude. I was very embarrassed especially since he did this in front of my family and I thought they'd take my side but the opposite happened. My family kind of told me not to yell at him (I was not yelling in the slightest, I assume they meant scolding) but I kinda brushed it off and kept walking. This whole interaction was maybe 30 seconds long. \n\nI was the first to admit that I shouldn't have called him out like that and apologized for it but still told him that was rude and he should have been more polite and found a different employee and told them in a non-condescending way. \n\nThe next weekend at a family BBQ my aunt came at me and told me that she was glad he said something and that I shouldn't have scolded him.  I told her that it wasn't the fact that he said it but the way, that I knew I should have went about it a different way, and apologized but still thought he was wrong. \n\nShe kind of brushed me off and everyone treated me like I was some overdramatic bitch and even jokingly said stuff to each other about how they can't believe I want to be a teacher when I am so impatient and that I need to get checked for bipolar. I just ignored it. \n\nMaybe this is irrelevant, but I think my family pities him a lot  because his parents are shitty and are overly aware of my actions because I am and always have been very strong-willed, even as a child. I have always got the vibe that they think he's a poor defenseless guy and I'm a quick to get angry girlfriend. This is not true though. I have a slight temper but I rarely get short with my boyfriend and admit/apologize when I do. I just don't tolerate bullshit and will call it out when I see it. Up until that day, I had never done this to my boyfriend in front of them (or ever even in mean way in general) It's hard to describe. I didn't even think I was that mean to him during this incident, just that I should have talked to him about it afterward.\n\nSo what do you guys think? I know I should have said something in private, but am I the only asshole or were both of us wrong here? \n\nAlso, sorry if the format is weird, I'm on mobile. ",

When I have free time I like to spend it alone because social interaction is taxing to me and I need a break sometimes. However, my mom wants to spend with me when we are together because she has a busy job and is working most nights. I usually curl up on the couch with her and we watch a movie, or tell her that I need some time to myself and she listens and leaves me alone.\n\nSome days though (like today), my door is closed and my music is on and my homework is being done and every ten minutes she pops in saying: “You want to go for a walk?” Or “What to watch a movie?” Or “Want to read next to me.”\n\nThe answer is always, “Maybe tomorrow mom, I’m enjoying my alone time.” I feel guilty though because she looks really sad when I say that and I don’t want to make her feel bad, but on the other hand, in the past when I’ve spent time with her when I’ve wanted to be alone I snap at her and make her feel worse.\n\nI know this is stupid and wayyy longer than expected and you don’t want to hear a 13 year old gripe, but I want some confirmation that I’m doing the right thing (or not) by turning her down.\n\n",

      "description": "Last month at the community clinic, I was queuing at the pharmacy after my checkup (both pharmacy and doctor’s clinic are within the same building). It was my turn but a parent (P) with a teenage child of about 15 years old, cut in front of me and requested for an express service. This is a common practice, where express service is reserved for elderly, disabled, pregnant females, etc.\n\nP requested for an express service for her daughter who is severely asthmatic. The daughter looked fine, to me at least. The clinic attendant (CA) wanted to give an express queue number to P, but discovered a problem with the prescription. The CA called his boss (which I am guessing is the pharmacist) and showed the prescription. The pharmacist informed P that she will need to check with the doctor regarding several issues on the prescription (which I am not privy to what the issue is). The child was asked a few questions and she looked fine to me, although that is my own judgement.\n\nP was very annoyed with it and berated CA. P requested that CA apologize immediately for not prioritizing her asthmatic daughter, but CA was trying his best to explain the discrepancy on the prescription, and the check with the doctor will not take long. Nevertheless, P started throwing accusations at CA and saying CA was rude, not professional, etc.\n\nI noticed the queue was getting longer, and some elderly patients are behind me. I lost my patience and told her off. I scolded P and told her to let the pharmacy staffs do their job, and her yelling will not improve things. The argument got heated and voices were raised, to my regret. I’m not trying to push the blame away from my outburst, but to my surprise, none of the pharmacy staff immediately stepped forward to serve the other patients. I did not want to argue further, so I sat down and ignored P when the other patients were being attended to by CA. The angry P threatened to file a complaint and sue me as well, but I continued to ignore her. The pharmacist soon got the information she needed and attended to the patient immediately.\n\nI did not give this issue much thought, until three weeks later when I was due for my checkup again. I noticed the CA was not there, and I casually asked a friendly clerk at the community clinic if he was around. The clerk recognized me as I was a regular, and quietly told me that CA was temporarily suspended pending an internal investigation over the matter above. Apparently, P filed a complaint to the clinic director. I was told CA will most likely not be fired, but the temporary suspension will be in effect until this matter is resolved, and P is satisfied with the investigation/apology. I felt really bad because I am directly involved in it. I’m also aware that this clinic has a bad track record on defending their own employees and matters of employee welfare.\n\nSo, AITA here?",

      "description": "Well I’m not using a throwaway or anything for this, you can see in my post history multiple mentions of my SO and mentions of our 5 year relationship and counting if you feel you can’t take me at my word (just thought I’d ward off the early SHP judgements) and also to those of you whose best advice is “leave her” “she sounds terrible” all that other stuff save your fingers some effort, I’m here to find out if I’m the asshole. I love that girl with every fiber of my body and want to spend the rest of my days on this earth with her weather it means taking care of her or enjoying the time with her. Would take moving some mountains to change how I feel about her. \n\nAnyways as mentioned in the title my fiancé suffers from bipolar disorder, which can be as much of an issue to me as it is to her depending on what’s going on. Her negative manifests consist of severe depressive lows with really inwards focused depressions, however if I happen to accidentally make her upset any of her petpeeves anything like that while she is on a low she will yell at me. Things that would usually be super simple interactions become like diffusing a bomb with the potential of an explosion. And as much of a shock as it might be, full grown man and all, this shit is really getting to me. It actually hurts me because I value her opinion so highly and every time she puts me down like that my self worth/opinion suffers.\n\nSo this brings me to my questionable behavior, after a couple months of this type of situation arising fairly regularly I straight told her that I feel like our once awesome relationship had turned a tad abusive emotionally on my end and she asked me to explain, when I was done putting it to her as I’ve put it to you here she was reduced to tears wondering how she could do that to me and telling me it wasn’t her intention. To sum it up I was walking on eggshells and felt very unwanted/unloved. She honestly didn’t realize it, probably because of the BPD although I don’t know. And now I often catch her crying relating back to the feeing that she was abusing me far more often than I think about her negative treatment of me (notice I said was because after this discussion, she decided to try just walking away rather than yelling and it’s been working wonderfully) and I actually feel really bad and feel like I may have gone and crossed a line that can’t really be uncrossed. \n\nSo reddit AITA for calling my fiancé out? \n\n",

However, he's consistently been putting off working on the project at every stage until either the day before it's due or straight up the day it IS due. I was, admittedly, not working as hard as maybe I should have been to make up for it, because I did 90% of the work at one stage when he had a friend/coworker pass away suddenly. Indtead of telling the teacher at all, he left all the work to me. On the day it was due he finally did work on it.\n\nNow it's the end of February. We finish in April and go on a work-term for five weeks. My partner already has his, and it's more focused on the math aspects of our program. We were sitting with another girl to do mark-ups for each other, and he outright said \"Yeah, I'm losing interest in Architecture. I don't care about working with AutoCAD or Revit, I only care about Estimating.\"\n\nSomehow, finally physically hearing it makes me panic. We share a grade on this project. Suddenly being fully aware of the fact that he no longer cares about the project has me wanting to tell our teacher I'm very concerned. WIBTA to tell the teacher now, or would it still be valid to at least tell my teacher I'm concerned?",

      "description": "I used to go to uni out in a different state however I decided to take a break for at least a semester and just work. So I was still paying even though I don’t live there because I wouldn’t want my 3 other roommates to split the $510 a month because that’s just a huge burden to leave them with. As I mentioned, uni is in a different state so and I finally made it up there yesterday to see some clothes and video games gone and something that I ordered to there is gone too. I asked all of them if they had borrowed anything or if they know where some of the things had went and they all acted clueless. So as I was walking out, I told them that there was no point in me paying rent if I can’t even leave things there without worrying about them getting stolen. Maybe I’m still just pissed, but I’m truly not planning on paying rent for the rest of our lease which ends in July. I’d say that everything stolen was worth about $200 and I’d be screwing them out of about $2000 worth of rent money but I think it’s fair. So, Reddit, AITA for this?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to cut ties with my mother?",
      "description": " \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to cut ties with the one person who has cared for me all my life?\n\nSo recently (since October last year) a lot of my life has changed. Me and my mum were very very close until I moved in with my boyfriend a few years ago. She wasnt happy that I chose to live with him than her because I did a lot to help her out, I took care of my younger siblings wiht special needs and kept the house clean and cooked the dinners and held down a job so I could pay her rent. My mum on the other hand hasnt had a job in years and spent a lot of that time sleeping or watching tv. At the time though I had no issue with this. In October of last year I met my dad for the first time in around 12 years (I'm 21). This came as a shock as my mum had told me that my dad had passed away and she told my dad that she had moved me out of the country so he wouldn't see me again. Me and my dad have now got a strong relationship and in recent times I've also met my mum's mother (my granny).\n\nThe problem comes here. All my life I've grown up with no money for myself. This has never bothered me because at the end of the day I wasn't allowed out to do anything and therefore had no need of money. I've also grown up being terrified of my granny because my mum told me she was violent toward my mother growing up and tried to kill her and abused her on multiple occassions. I confronted my granny about this because I realised some of what my mother was saying didn't make sense to me. As it turned out my granny has never been harmful or abusive toward her children and these were just lies my mother told in an effort to make me feel lucky about my upbringing. I've also found out that my granny has been putting away money for me every year since I was born so that I would be able to afford a house when I left school. This money was stolen by my mother also (totalling over £5000). Whilst speaking to my dad I also found out that during the time I thought he had passed away my mother was still in contact with him in an effort to get drugs. I also found out she lied to my dad that she was in a wheelchair in order to make him feel sorry for her. She also recently lied to me about having cancer and that it was killing her. The stress of thinking she was dying caused me to fail my A levels as I couldn't sleep and I struggled a lot with self harm as a way of coping. As it turns out, she never had cancer and was never going to die. I also found out as well that she has stolen a lot of items from myself and other family members and lied about how she obtained them, the most notable of which were books by charles dickens printed in the 1800's that belonged to my great uncle who was upset thinking he misplaced them .\n\nI can't wrap my head around the lies she's told, as she's told me many more which I know to be false. I don't feel safe around her and I don't feel like I know who she is because everything I know about her is false. At the same time though, she's been the only constant in my life, she's raised me and clothed me and fed me and everything like that. I want so bad to confront her about these lies and to tell her that I don't want to speak to her anymore because she makes me feel so depressed and angry but at the same time I love her and don't want to hurt her.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to cut ties with the one person who has cared for me all my life?",

      "description": "Ok so I'm 16M and I live in Kenya. I don't yet have a drivers license but upon visiting family in the US I got my learners permit. My friends and I went to a party and they all got drunk, including the designated driver, so I had to drive his car. I had to drive his car in fucking Kenya where the roads are unkept and potholes are literally large enough to flip buses. Not to mention it was ILLEGAL for me to drive.\n\nThe dd had some plan to get everyone home that I didn't know but he wasn't really giving coherent responses when I asked him and neither were any of my friends, so I brought them all to my house. my parents and most of theirs are gone for a work trip for the next two weeks, (the dd is the only one whose parents don't work for the same office.) I had to walk them to my bed and cover for the dd when their parents called by telling them that they were sleeping over at my place. \n\nI'm very difficult to anger so I was just slightly annoyed that I had to drive and sleep on the couch. In the morning I waited for them to wake up and explained/reminded them what happened. They all got mad at me on the grounds of endangering their lives and also not taking them home. so I retaliated by blaming them for making me commit a crime and saying that I did the best that I could given the shitty situation they provided to me. The dd stayed kind of quite throughout the whole argument. \n\nEventually I got so angry and kicked them out of my house, forcing them to walk home (because the dd didn't want to drive them), in Kenya, which is very dangerous. The dd stayed behind and helped my clean up my room etc. and apologized before he left. I haven't talked to any of them since.\n\nI'm angry at them for blaming me but I kind of feel bad for making them walk home, and I am guilty of endangering their lives by driving and not bringing them home.

      "title": "AITA for tearing my family apart by standing up for myself?",
      "description": " \n\nAITA? This one's a little murky, but I'll try to explain both sides as best as I can.\n\nThe family I'm referring to is my older brother, my father, and my mother. My brother's moved out, my parents live together (though they're both unhappy in the marriage), and I visit their house on the weekends to see my cat (I can't take him to the place I'm primarily staying at, and they're happy to keep him there. I made sure it was fine with them and offered to move somewhere if they didn't want him).\n\nMy mom and I have a horrible relationship. She's a covert narcissist--thinks she's a constant victim, needs to put others down to inflate her ego, etc.--and I am her target. At the age of 12, I confided to her that I was seriously considering suicide. She responded by yelling at me to grow up and slammed my door in my face. Ever since then... hoo boy. Constant insults, laughing at me when I cried, screaming in my face so much that I often ran from her in fear that she'd beat me (she never physically abused me, but I wouldn't put it past her).\n\nWhen I was 14, I developed an abscess that burst (which is NOT good). Note: the abscess was right next to my rectum. To their credit, I didn't tell my parents that it was there because I hated myself and didn't want to give them another reason to potentially be disgusted with me, plus, it was mortifying. At this point, my dad wasn't anywhere as bad as my mom, but he ignored my problems and would just stare at me blankly whenever I cried/said I wanted to die/had a panic attack, so it's not like I felt comfortable talking to him. But to MY credit, this abscess was the worst pain I've ever felt. No exaggeration, every time I moved, the pain made me scream bloody murder. I didn't tell them what it was, but they knew very well that something was wrong. They did nothing, and once it burst, I realized that the infection that came with it had rotted away my flesh to the bone. My parents still forced me to go to school, and my dad only called the hospital when I collapsed in the hallway. It takes bloodwork to know for sure, but I think I had sepsis. Because my parents did nothing until that point, I couldn't walk without a cane for 6 months after my surgery. All this, and they lied that my pain medication wasn't addictive. I was worried about this because addictive personalities run in families and my mom was an alcoholic. I stopped taking it immediately.\n\nMoving on, this is mostly shit I have with my mom. I don't like talking about what she said and did or else I might break down, which is why I'm keeping this relatively vague. My heart is pounding as I'm writing this. The things she did has given me complex PTSD. Once when I was having a PTSD attack, I pressed my back against my door (which didn't have a lock) as I cried as quietly as I could. Mom's response? She went ballistic. She threw herself against the door until I was knocked aside, where I curled into a ball in the corner, covering my neck in case she hurt me, screaming bloody murder because I was so goddamn afraid. She got an inch away from my face and screamed things like: \"Why are you doing this to me!?\" and \"Why are you so afraid of progress!?\"\n\nThe \"progress\" is referring to the \"progress\" we made while I was in a residential treatment center for 10 months. Family therapy sessions were required. I couldn't adequately explain my situation and what exactly my mom did to me because I still thought it was normal. My mom, being the charmer she is, convinced them that I blew things way out of proportion. The counselor forced me to apologize. I only did so to get out of that treatment center.\n\nNow, semi-recently, I decided enough was enough. I stood up to my mother one day. I didn't call her names. I didn't say I hated her. I simply explained why I was always quiet when she was around. I explained that I was terrified of her, that I couldn't get over what she did to me, that our relationship would unfortunately never be the same. Cue the ballistic actions again. She called me \"fucking evil\" and pretty much made me out to be the devil. She followed me around the house, calling me names, all that.\n\nShe constantly goes to my dad and brother, crying that she doesn't know why her own child hates her, how awful it makes her feel. This is where the whole \"tearing family apart\" thing comes in. I told both of them my side. My dad doesn't believe me, and my brother thinks I need to get over it. I'm heartbroken because this is really affecting both of them. My brother loves my mom, and he broke down in tears because she was so \"sad\" over me. My dad is mostly angry with me. Their side is that I should forgive her already. She's never hit me, she put clothes on my back, fed me, drove me places, all that stuff. I was a privileged child, undoubtedly. That's why all this confuses me. Why does my mom do great things for me and do horrible things to me? Do I have a right to stand up for myself to parents who sheltered me?\n\nI can't get over it--obviously, due to PTSD. Losing this fight and going back to my old self, who never questioned why Mom would do this to me, would absolutely shatter my heart. I'd kill myself, not even kidding. But by trying to prove that my mom hurt me and get justice for myself, I'm splitting my family up. I feel so alone, so invalidated, and so guilty. I sincerely want to know who's in the wrong. I think I'm not, but all the counselors I've spoken to are on her side because she did so much for me. Please help me.",

      "description": "Me and my SO moved in with my parents about two years ago. We pay half of all the bills and have never had any kind of financial disputes. It works out great because it's cheaper on everyone and we all save money.\n\nSO &amp; I get along great with my mother, but my father is a different story. To make a long story short he's a drug addict and neither of us can stand him. He emotionally abuses and manipulates my mother into giving him whatever he wants (most of the time money for drugs). He's also just an asshole person in general. His addiction started again (he's had issues with drugs all my life) shortly before we moved in with them. It's actually one of the main reasons we decided to move in. I know how he is when he's on pills, and I did not want my mother living alone with him. If I'm being completely honest, I hate my father.\n\nRecently it's gotten to the point where I can't even be in the same room as him he pisses me off so much. My SO and mother work full time, while me and my father are unemployed, I am a full time college student though. It's left up to me to do ALL the cleaning. I, of course, don't expect my mom or SO to clean since they work, but it bothers me that he won't help out around the house at all.\n\nSo a few months ago me and my SO made tentative plans to start looking for a new place to live, but life decided to throw a big ol' pile of shit in our faces. My grandfather (who lives right next door to us) is very ill. He cannot do anything on his own, and my grandmother cannot take care of him by herself. This means me, my SO, and my mother all pitch in to help him. I love my grandfather and don't mind helping him at all.\n\nNow we're conflicted. I don't want to leave my mother alone with my father, I don't want her to have all the responsibility of taking care of my grandfather, and she recently told me that the short-term disability my father was drawing ends this month, so she would be even more financially stressed if we were to move. I have told my mother several times over the past month that we are moving if she doesn't kick my father out. This sounds harsh, but the only times he's gotten better is when she sent him off to rehab. Also, she very frequently vents to me about him. She says she doesn't love him and gets almost as frustrated with him as I do. She has talked about kicking him out in the past, but never goes through with it.\n\nLiving with him has taken a toll on my mental health. I have started seeing a therapist again and have also had to up my antidepressants. She begs me not to move. She says she needs me, and she does. But I don't know if I can stand being here anymore. I despise him, and I'm honestly afraid I'm going to hurt either him or me if I don't leave (I have also told this to my mother.)\n\nI would feel so guilty if I moved, but at this point I'm thinking it's my only option since she won't get rid of him.\n\nSo WIBTA?\n\nOn mobile &amp; throwaway account for reasons.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I ask my teammates to not take so long to leave after practice?",
      "description": "So for the club sport I play at university, I have a few practices each week, with a couple other teammates each day. One of my practices is supposed to take place in the evening and I have this practice with two other girls who I’m not too friendly with. We are nice to eachother and I don’t dislike them, but they arent the type of people I would be good friends with outside of the sport. For lack of a better way to describe them, they seem/act like stereotypical (from a movie) sorority girls and I’m not like that at all. The girls see eachother a lot during the week.\n\n\nWe carpool to the practice location; one of the other girls drives. However during our practice, from the time I get into the car to the time I get out of the car 3 hours later, these two girls act like I don’t exist. They barely say Hi to me and are constantly talking about whatever in the car. At breaks during the practice they are always taking amongst themselves. After practice and when we are cleaning up/getting ready to go, they are talking.\n\n\nThis talking makes the clean up, which should take 30mins max, last almost an hour for them and I’m left sitting around doing nothing while they talk. By the time we get back to campus, its usually 30 mins after our scheduled return time, sometimes more. On nights where I have a meeting or something similar, this is really frustrating. Even on nights when I don’t have anything in particular, its annoying that they’re talking constantly while they could be getting ready to leave.\n\n\nWhen I’ve had events, I’ve asked them to leave on time, and they oblige (mostly) but I get the sense that they are annoyed by me. I usually don’t ask to leave on time if I don’t have anything important. But it’s become like this every week now and I’m annoyed by it. \n\n\nI wouldn’t be so annoyed if they included me in conversation, but they literally never have. And I would contribute to their conversations but they’re always talking about things I don’t know nor care about (parties, etc). When I’ve tried to talk to them about other/normal things, they seem annoyed at me or just kind of like “uh ok...” \n\n\nI can’t change practices at this point in the semester. I feel like I may be the asshole if I ask these girls to leave on time if I have nothing to do back on campus; I may be feeling so annoyed just because I feel left out, so maybe I should just suck it up since they aren’t doing any real harm by just talking and taking awhile?\n\n\n\nWIBTA if I ask these girls to talk less at the end of practices and leave on time, even if I don’t have anything in particular to do immediately after practice? Thanks.",

      "description": "Me and my friend, for the sake of it, lets call him Jim, started a music project back in 2012. After 3 years of playing for fun we decided to make a band. Since 2015 we played regularly. We also recorded original songs and wanted to release an EP at the end of 2019. In that time Jim had some side projects, but being a very talented guitarist, he handled everything flawlessly. Last year one of the projects turned into a band and they even released an EP, me and Jim talked about it regularly and openly, he assured me on many occasions that our band was still his primary focus. He was that guy in the band who was always pushing others to do more and bringing the best out of people. We called each other every week to talk about life etc. The atmosphere in the band was really good, we were really good friends privately as well. At the end of last year he started acting a bit strange, he stopped pushing us, which was an immediate red flag for me. I sat down with him, asked him if he wasn't happy with the band, if there were any issues or if he felt anything was off. He assured me he was just tired because of college and the student job he got and that otherwise he was really happy with our band. So fast forward to last month, we applied for a band competition and were accepted, guess what, his other band was accepted as well, we laughed about it and everything seemed fine, he even went on a drink with one other band member and talked about how our bend is important to him and how much he loves it. Last week we found out about another competition where we could apply with an original song. We decided to record the song and went to a studio in order to do that by the deadline day. After the first day of recording, which went good, we got a group messege on Facebook where Jim told us, he felt like he wasn't needed in this band anymore and that we are better off going our separate ways and remain friends. After that I was in shock as were other members of our bend, no one saw it coming, especially not in the middle of a song recording and before a big competition. I called him and asked him what was going on, he just kept repeating the same BS he sent in the message, so I asked him, why was he lying to my face if he felt like that. He started making excuses that he realized it only a month ago (keep in mind he kept telling us all how happy he is, the whole time), so I asked him why now, why in the middle of the recording and the competition that could be big for us? He said he just doesn't feel the energy of the music anymore. That is when I lost it, I told him he was a selfish little prick, a liar and that he can go F himself and stay the F away from me and hung up on him. We haven't spoken since.\nFYI he is still going to the competiton with the other band. AITA here?",

      "description": "BACKSTORY: My brother (20yrs) and his baby mama (20yrs) have a very toxic relationship. I don't wanna get too deep into it but basically there has been cases where domestic violence was definitely involved. As toxic relationships goes, they just cant let each there go and they always get back together eventually despite all the shit they've done to each other. (Side note: they live in the Philippines, in the much poorer areas.)\n\nAnyways, they finally did the one thing that really ties them to each other forever and that's having a baby. A beautiful baby girl. So innocent, so unaware of the problems that revolve around her young parents. I thought the baby would somehow magically clear up the toxicity (HOW NAIVE I WAS) and mature them because now they have a baby to take care of but nope. Literally they have fought every single day. \n\nMy parents and I live in the US (we're all filipino), and we live a decent life (we're low middle class). My brother had always been a wildcard and cant stay in one place. He comes back to the US every couple of months and then goes back to the Philippines for another couple of months. He likes to live independently and works once in a while. The baby mama doesn't work at all, dropped out of college and has my brother (technically my parents since it's their money) provide her the basic necessities.\n\nBACK TO MY MAIN QUESTION: \nMy mother is flying over to the Philippines soon and she wants to convince the baby mama to let our family take care of the baby, at least for a awhile. Reason being that they're situation in the Philippines isnt great because (A) They live in the really ghetto and dirty parts of the city, the baby has gotten mutiple fevers but luckily have all subsided. (B) We don't want that child growing up with the toxicity of their parents. (C) We believe the baby will have a better future in the US. (D) The baby mama can focus on going back to school while we take care of the baby. \n\nMy brother will also be coming back to the US to search for work and save up, which leaves only the baby mama left in the Philippines, but it's the best option for the baby. And the baby mama said she would do anything to give her baby a good life and so convincing her to take the baby to the US shouldn't be a bad idea. Of course, there would be daily facetiming, so the baby doesnt forget her mother. The baby mama seems to be semi-convinced but she's still a bit hesitant. So AITA for really getting her on board with this idea?",

      "description": "A few weeks ago two of my classmates invited me to a teahouse, primarily to try a hookah for the first time. On the website of the place, it said only two people can use one, and there were three of us, so I invited another classmate I'm on fairly good terms with. He's one of the people I wanted to get to know more, and he agreed. The people who invited me also didn't mind that I would bring him along.\n\nAs we were about to leave, another classmate, also a friend of mine, storms out with the guy I invited, and starts acting extremely offended that she wasn't invited. I told her I didn't want a crowd, I was not the one who suggested the idea, and she probably would have said no (she's pretty judgemental, and has a bunch of disorders that makes it hard for me to know what the hell she can or can't have with food and drinks). She stormed off, but I figured me apologizing would be enough. \n\nTurns out I was wrong, as weeks later the topic came up in the groupchat we were in- her, the guy I invited, and myself. I repeated my reasons- the hangout wasn't my idea, we needed an even number of people, I didn't want anymore people, and that I didn't tell anyone else, so it's not like she's the only person I left out of this grand event everyone was invited to. It really was just the four of us. \n\nShe then went on about how it seems like I don't care about our friendship- nevermind that I threw her a birthday party last year, catering to her specific needs with food and beverages. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but we're in high school, and I don't really earn money so the best I could do was ask mom for help with food and invite her over. But I guess that flew over her head, simply because I didn't invite her to a hangout I did not initiate anyway. I understand she felt left out, but I literally didn't invite any other friends either. It was just one guy, and just one time. Am I the bad guy here? \n\nPS: sorry if anything doesn't make sense, English isn't my first language! Any corrections on grammar are appreciated. ",

      "description": "ATA for not having his kids home when he's not here? \n\nSo my boyfriend (37/m) and I (32/f) live together right next to his mother (r/whatcouldgowrong) and she legaly requested to pick his 2 daughters up from school on Fridays and keep them the afternoon, if it's the father's weekend they come to our house, and this has been going on for a few months until i moved in from another city and they come and go as they please all afternoon. They have here a bedroom, clothes, special food they like, everything. Today is the first day of school (we're in Argentina) and they recently stayed here for 2 weeks on vacation, but kids, it's normal life now and I never offered to babysitting.\n\nSo i locked the door and told my bf to inform my MIL to keep the girls at her house, since I've had diarrhea for the past 3 days and im taking a new sleeping drug wich makes me tired. They got here and IMMEDIATELY came to the house. Door locked. THEY CAME BACK WITH A SPARE KEY, yeah, you heard me. They came back and forced a key into my front door which I had previously locked with the key turned inside, impossible to shove another one. They left again. I confirmed with my bf if he asked the mother to keep the girls since i though someone tried a key to our door, he says he did (he didnt, he is never direct and this gives her the opportunity to act silly) MY BF MESSAGES ME asking to take the girls in because they really miss me and the mother tried the door which was locked shut.\n\nNow wait. Why would she insist on a key if you supposedly told her to keep out?\n\nTHE MOTHER MESSAGES ME asking if im awake bc the girls want to come over (yeah, simple as that, wake up and open the door) to wich i replied that unfortunately im sick today and can't have ppl over, but i will inform them as soon as im better. Period. \n\nI never offered to baby sit, ppl, once the father gets home they can all play. But as for me, i never committed to this amount of responsibility and when they're with me they demand my full attention wich they do get. So I'm sorry but today is legaly grandma's day, stated by judge in court. AITA? ",

      "description": "Some background: boyfriend and I live together. He is recently graduated and looking for a job in our city. I am employed and went through an extensive job search last year.\n\nToday, I came home and he told me he had an interview with a great business here in town. He asked me about coming up with references. Now, I had hinted once or twice over the past 3 years of our relationship about forming relationships with professors, and I recently said something since he started his job search about asking people if they would be willing to be a reference. This place that he has an interview with emailed him a reference check, where he needs to supply 5 references (they won't allow any less) and he has to submit them within 24 hours. He did not form meaningful relationships with professors, and has a couple supervisors and some distant coworkers he could ask. We had this conversation around 4pm, and the references are due at 9:30am the next morning. He had yet to reach out to anyone. \n\nTonight (Valentines Day), I got on him about talking to people before it got too late and he gave me reasons such as \"they're busy right now,\" and \"I'll do it later.\" He was also planning to cook us dinner for the romantic day. I pushed him again about references, and I got upset with him over it, telling him that he didnt value my perspective as his partner and that he put down every suggestion I had. He has since refused to hang out, and our plans tonight are cancelled. I got upset about this and told him that his response wasnt nice and we had plans, could we please keep them. He said no, tells me that I am not being very nice, and he went to bed and now I'm on the couch because he needs space.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

This has been going on for months and I am averaging 4-5 hours of sleep a night and it's really starting to get to me. I've tried putting in ear plugs but everything is still so loud. I feel like my mom is overreacting about this situation and that I'm sure our tenant wouldn't react by moving out promptly because we asked her to be a little quieter. My mom is getting the rent money, not myself, so she doesn't care about this as long as she's getting her monthly check.

      "description": "My SO and I have been together for 7 years. I'm 34 and he's 30. Today he bought a new (new to him) car. He had been talking about it for a while as his car is older and has a few things about it that bother him. I myself don't have my full licence, and one of the issues that is blocking me from getting it is that I don't have a vehicle of my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in Canada and we have a graduated licencing system. I have written my test and got my G1 or \"learners permit\". The next step is a physical road test. I can take this test, but I would likely fail it due to not having much practice in a car. My boyfriend recently moved in with me and has his own car, but he won't let me use it to practice and thinks I should pay $300+ to rent a car from those driver training people for a couple of hours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTBH this irked me somewhat because I am not an irresponsible person and in my eyes, giving someone $300 to use their car when I have one in the driveway now, just seems crazy to me. If he's concerned about me ruining his car, I  would gladly practice down small side streets, or late at night where there is less traffic and people, or whatever he wanted to make him feel more comfortable; he would also be in the car with me at all times as well, as per the rules for G1 drivers. My brother even let me practice driving in his brand new car with no concerns. BUT my SO's insurance is under his father so I could somewhat understand.  Sorta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCue today, we've discussed him getting a new vehicle, and  I am fine with that. I was wanting to know what his plans were with his old one. He didn't really know; either trade in, or sell it on his own. I mentioned it would be the perfect beginner car for me. It's an older sedan and my argument is, is that if I do happen to bang into a pole, or get into a fender bender because I am a new driver, then it's not a big deal because it's an older car and we didn't put 30 grand into it. He is totally against this idea. He brings up the fact that it's \"half rusted\" which is vastly over exaggerated, (it's only got a few rust spots) the water pump is scheduled \"to go\" in another 20 000 Km despite no sounds or issues with it currently (he just expects it to break down at a certain Km mark) and the trunk is a bit damaged because he was rear ended with minimal damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these reasons do not matter to me. My point is, if I want to get driving, I'm going to need a vehicle of my own to drive, especially since he's not keen on letting me drive his current car, and I highly doubt he will let me drive his new one. So, the alternative is I go out and drop 20-30 grand on a used one when I could have his for much cheaper. ALSO, I know the history of his vehicle, I know he takes good care of it and does all the routine maintenance on it. His next argument is that I can't register the car in my name because I don't have my G2 yet. This is a minor detail at this point and no REAL reason as to why I can't have his car to dive when he gets his new one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI EVEN OFFERED TO BUY IT from him. I'm not expecting him to just GIVE me the car. And he still disagrees. I then asked him what he figures is the alternative? He didn't really have one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe went out to test drive the car he's been eyeing, and bought it. He's trading in his old car for 5k... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my eyes, if the roles were reversed, I would have no problem with letting him use my car (with my father's permission) to practice on, and if not, then let him at least have my old car to use. This to me is what being in a relationship means, to help one another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

I decided it might be a good idea to give it to my GF, I have discussed with her before about working out. She hates the college gym we have, so she said if I give her the free membership she will go to the gym. \nShe also has told me too that gym is not her passion, she only works out because she has to. At the same time she complains about being fat (not fat but rather has a few pounds from eating she wants to lose). \n\nTonight I was about to set up the membership for her, before I did I thought the membership would be better for someone else I know if my gf will not be committed to using it. So I asked her how many times she would come to the gym per week, I got a idk for answer. Then i asked will she quit after a while since it’s not her passion or interest but rather than work she has to do, she got really mad and started yelling at me for questioning her.\n\nI feel like I might have been a bit overboard but it was definitely right to ask her these questions since it’s a lot of money I could be wasting on her if she doesn’t use it properly when I can give it to another friend who would love to. \n \nAm I the asshole for asking these questions and pissing her off.",

They've been blasting music so loud you can hear it from blocks away and the entire street is blocked off and all our neighboring houses are covered in beer bottles and other garbage. Hell 2 guys passed out in my yard. It's now 3 am and I need to wake up at 7 so I'm fucking pissed i haven't been able to get any sleep and what's worse is the neighbors plan to have the wedding party last a few more days, it's already been 2 nights of this shit. I call the police and the police come over and the wedding hosts were able to bribe the police (my country is very corrupt so this is common) and they do nothing. Not wanting to tolerate a few more days of this shit my friend's (other neighrbos also pissed) devise a plan to ruin the wedding. We decide to bring out our own food as gifts which we coated in laxatives. We also put laxatives in the other foods being served there when nobody was paying attention. It only took an half hour for everyone to run to the bathrooms. The bathrooms were overbooked nonstop for another hour and people were shitting on the street. We also started a fire on a couple of the tents which caused everyone to panic but we put the fires out before they could spread to any of our properties. Everyone was too drunk or busy shitting to notice us set fires. Nobody was hurt but it ruined all their wedding equipment much of which was rented and now they have to pay it all back",

Frankly my uncle started throwing insults about my parents religion (very active Catholics) and being generally rude. \n\nThat's where I step in:\n\nBeing the idiot that I am I tried to defuse the situation. First I tried to convince my mom to let it go, then I appealed to my uncles academic side and he told me to go to hell. Frankly that pissed me off. I just raised my voice by like 30% to tell the arguing table to just let it go. My mistake. My uncle acts as if I just told him to go fuck a pig or something because he throws this big stink about never letting someone insult him, he tells me to fuck off and then storms out with my cousin, his son, pleading for him to calm down. My parents go out to try and stop him while I turn to the rest of the guests mortified apologizing profusely. \n\nOnce my uncle is gone my parents come in and I go to talk to them. Turns out I should have shut up and let my uncle insult both good taste and my parents. My dad basically told me Im not welcome at their parties anymore and my mom, a bit more forgivingly, just asked me to shut my mouth when the \"adults\" are talking (Im 27 and only came to visit at their insistence)\n\nSo now Im spending New Years driving back home waiting to get a call from every other member of my extended family to tell me off for having tried to defend my parents.\n\n I really hope 2019 gets better.\n\nTl;dr I got kicked out of my parents new years party for telling my asshole of an uncle to shut up about politics",

      "description": "This happened years ago, when I was a teenager and working my first serving job. I remembered this recently, and I'm trying to work out if I was in the wrong. So, I was 18, working at a combined pub/restaurant, earning minimum wage. This place was a dive - we're talking 1/2 stars on google. Therefore, the only people that really came here seemed to be kind of...trashy. A young couple (late twenties) came in with their son. I seated them, gave them the menu, and served their food. I noticed the kid seemed abnormally quiet for a toddler. I took another tables order, and went to the kitchen to check on a different tables food. Then, a customer that wasn't from one of my tables, he was sat on the table next to the young couple with the child, walks straight into the kitchen. He says it's outrageous that they had to sit next to a pool of vomit, and when was it going to be cleaned up?!? I was super confused. I go out into the dining area, and it the couple of minutes I had been in the kitchen, the kid had created a swimming pool of vomit across the table. It was dripping off the sides of the table. I have no idea how so much vomit came out of a child that size, we're talking exorcist territory here. And the parents were just kind of... sat there, staring at the vomit. I walked over to them, asked if everything was okay. They kind of shrugged, seemed non-plussed, and said something like 'oh yes, he's just feeling a bit ill today.' Dude. They didn't attempt to clean up the vomit in anyway. I asked if they needed napkins to sort it out, and they became horrified that I would imply that they should be cleaning up at the restaurant, when they were guests. I straight up told them that I was a teenager, who had never touched a child's vomit in my life, and that I was not paid enough to clean their kids sick. They said they weren't going to either. Fine. It became a stand-off. I walked back into the kitchen, and watched them through the glass in the door. I felt pretty guilty, and still do, for the people sat on the tables around them. After about ten minutes, the manager threw them out and proceeded to clean the sick himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...AITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

One by one a week before we were supposed to go they all changed their minds and said they couldn’t go. This was after I had booked a non-cancellable hotel stay and paid over 500$ for us to stay there. And when I confronted them about it they shrugged it off as if it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nI don’t put expectations on anyone because that’s how you get let down, but personal integrity came into play here and they went back on their word.

Around June, I started to feel as though I didn't have feelings for her anymore.\n\nI had decided to be honest about my feelings, I tried to tell her that even though I don't have romantic feelings for her anymore, I wanted to be friends and continue to be there for her. She blocked me after that so I thought giving her some space would be best because I didn't want to make things worse.\n\nThat same day, she unblocked me and started messaging me about how she hates me, she said I had abandoned her, I tried my best to apologise and explain, but she continued to tell me she hated me and that I was making her suicidal.\n\nBoth of us had been struggling with depression, she was going through a rough patch at the time and she accused me of not caring about her enough, I ended up trying to tell her that I didn't want to lead her on by pretending to love her.\n\nThis carried on, these messages saying she hates me, and that I fucked everything up. So at some point I decided to step away from her because all of these messages she kept sending to me weren't doing well on my own mental health. And I didn't like the daily reminders that she hated me and thought I was the worst. Even saying she wanted to kill herself because of me.\n\nAm I selfish for that?

      "description": "Hi, Reddit and this is a very frustrating and unpleasant situation I found myself in recently. \nSo I am an opera singer and a 28 y/o woman. Few months ago I worked on a big production in Europe. The production was massive and had over two hundred people involved in it including some actors. \nOne of them was exceptionally handsome, like high-fashion kind of handsome, and from day one he never concealed his attraction towards me. Let's call him Marco. We flirted but I never really thought about hooking up with him as I was consumed with the show (partly because I was doing the main role). \nAfter the premiere there was an after-party, and of course I got intoxicated, so did he. Then it was 5 a.m. and he was stranded in the town without any means to get home at that time of night. \nObviously it was a roose to get into my bed, and I was tipsy and relaxed so I played along. I offered him a sofa in my flat, and of course, next thing I know we are messing in my bedroom. \nIn the morning (well, more likely, in the late afternoon) we had the post-sex cuddle, and Marco casually mentions that tomorrow is his birthday. I joke about having given him an early bd present to which he laughs and says that it was the best present ever.\nThen I ask how old he is going to get. And then he drops the bomb: he is going to be 18. Tomorrow. \n\nI panicked and quickly got out of the bed. He did not look 17 at all, I thought he was younger but I never thought he was eleven years younger than me. I was mad. He looked surprised and said that \"he is almost a man\" and that \"he had many girlfriends including a 30 y/o when he was 16\".\nI screamed that I did not care about his other girlfriends and that I am going to be in big trouble. I did not know the laws of that country so I had all my life flash before my eyes. \nI begged him to keep his mouth shut and he swore he would never tell anyone.\n\nOf course when I got to the theatre the next day everyone was giving me weird looks. By the end of the day I noticed people laughing at me and some of my colleagues even asked me really dirty questions. Not only he bragged about having sex with me to his friends, he also gave them all the details including the amount of body hair, shape of my breasts and all the things I did to him in bed. \nI was a wreck. I ran into the cafeteria and was weeping incessantly. Never in my life I felt such shame. \nNext morning I was called into the theatre director's office. He was very disappointed in me and my lifestyle choices, and he also mentioned that as a \" primadonna\" (ugh hate that term) I should have known better and taken better care of my reputation.\nI thought it was over but in few hours I received a phone call from Marco's mother. She was screaming at me and though I speak Italian, I was struggling to understand everything she said.\nApparently not only I had sex with a 17 y/o but I also raped him as he was drunk and therefore could not possibly consent to sex with \"a fat old woman\" that I was in his mother's opinion. She screamed some more and promised to get the police involved. \nI was devastated. In my view my career was over as well as my reputation. I wished I were dead. \nHis mother also discovered his messages to me and threatened to expose me a sexual predator, and called me a paedophile. \nMy colleagues stood up for me and promised to testify if need be that Marco has been chasing after me since day one, and that he has made everything he could to stay at my place that fateful night.\nJust when i thought my life was over it turned out that Marco's mother tried to blackmail the theatre director into firing me or raising her son's  salary. The director went furious and threatened her with exposure so she backed off.\n\nAll this situation was quite horrible for me, and I am glad I am unscathed by the experience although there is (must be!) a stain on my reputation. But as the time passes by and I recover I cannot help but wonder - what if I am a predator? What if I scarred that poor boy? What if I raped him - as he was clearly drunk and I am a grown ass woman and whatnot?\nThe very thought of it horrifies me as I am a rape survivor myself, and I pray I haven't hurt this young man. \nWhat do you think, guys? I am so confused and genuinely upset.\nSorry for the long read.",

      "description": "There's this old dog that's like 12 years old, I don't even know to be honest, we never bought or adopted him since he came to us looking for food when we were building our current house, so having no pets we decided to keep him. Obviously we vaccinated him, bathed him and did many health related things that I don't even remember since I was just a kid back then and didn't care about it too much. \n\nMy cousin and I often go to my 2nd floor where I have some gym equipment and we workout together. There's a window that has a view on the dog that's caged in the corner of my backyard. My  cousin once looked at it and told me that he is really sad that the dog just spends all day every day in his cage and we can do nothing about it. When he goes out of his cage, he takes a piss on everything and ruins all the plants to the point where they are completely brown instead of green. We can't take him for a walk since he is almost a wild dog, we never took him for a walk and he never experienced anything other than this backyard from time to time when we play with him. Another reason for not letting him get out is that we fear he would impregnate our second female dog. \n\nA few days ago when my friends came over, they saw the dog caged in the corner of my backyard and kept asking a bunch of questions about him. I said \"The dog is pretty old and should die soon, I'm not really happy about it but I'm looking forward to it because we would then get another dog\". The reason I said this (and I tried explaining it to them but they wouldn't listen) is that the dog is just living a miserable life and there's nothing we can do about it. With a new dog we would have more options. We could train him and take him for walks, like our second dog. But they just started shouting at me for being so rude and having no feelings. They wouldn't talk to me for a few minutes and later they kept on looking at me weird. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Currently living in a pet-friendly, three bedroom apartment for a little under a year now. They were supportive of me bringing along my male cat, approximately 4 years old. One roommate had always wanted a cat and the other is willing to live in his own filth so he didn't care much (invalidates his opinion a little bit.) Everything has been going great however the roommate who had always wanted a cat now wants to adopt her own, a female of unknown age. When we moved in I told them the likelihood of me being supportive of getting another cat or dog would be very slim. It's twice the work, twice the dander, twice the feeding, twice of everything. I'm under a lot of stress about to start school again working 40 hours a week, school 30, while also trying to maintain a relationship and I don't think I could handle another animal in my home life. I feel like I'm being selfish but I don't know how to express my feelings on this matter.",

      "description": "Last year I went through a tremendous heartbreak after the love of my life - Beryl - broke up with me. I was taking Xanax, Valium and other downers on a routine basis to ease the pain and spiralled into addiction. I was living with Beryl's workmates and they decided to kick me out because they felt like it would be more convenient for her. I was at the peak of my addiction and my best mate Steve and his girlfriend Rosa decided to let me stay at their flat for a bit when I was going cold turkey. I was too depressed and in so much pain from the withdrawals that I went on sick pay and the next month was so much better.\n\nDays became months and I was staying there. I started dating again and met a lovely woman called Catherine but I couldn't shift my heartbreak about Beryl. This caused many arguments, including her crying and me punching the walls and myself. I got addicted to nitrous and Xanax I lost track of my finances and Catherine was loaning me a bit of money for living expenses. I also began obsessively watching videos by Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia, as they really resonated with me. Despite my misery I would try and make myself happy by making art around the house, such as collaging pornographic magazines for a laugh. I would record songs for my band, singing my heart out until 2AM in the morning. I spent most days in front of the telly vaping and eating chips. I think as much as it became my home, it became my cocoon. I didn't have a job or a regular income so I couldn't pay three months rent. \n\nThe fights I was having with Catherine were becoming more frequent. She didn't like the media I was watching and I didn't like her criticising it and it became a push and shove between us. I quit nitrous and have been cleaning up. Me and Catherine broke up. Unfortunately Rosa dropped the bomb on me that she recently got engaged to Steve. Great, I though! Except she wanted me leave on a month's notice. How is that possible?? I have no income, no friends in the area and I fell out with all my family. I'm so unhappy I can't even wash. What do you do when you've got no family and no friends and nowhere to go? Nowhere to stay?\n\nI found a place shortly after a casual friend turned out to be living close by but after taking out three quarters of my stuff Rosa kept messaging me even though I practically moved out so I unfriended her and Steve. Now they are now complaining that I didn't pay rent and I'm a sponge and whatnot. I have nothing to pay. Can you really accuse someone who has nothing of being a sponge?! So I'm wondering Reddit if I am.\n\ntl;dr - best friend lets me stay with him when I'm withdrawing from addiction and very heartbroken, I relapse into addiction, lose track of money and can't pay rent. Best friend's fiancé kicks me out on a month's notice when I'm penniless and now is saying I'm a sponge for being unable to pay rent and cutting them out my life. AITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory throw away. Worked at a company for roughly a year where I was in charge of a small specialized team. From the start I knew the boss played favorites and unfortunately was among that crowd. Recently after acquiring my team an employee under me came to me crying about a hurtful comment the boss had said to her. This is also right after I had stood up to my boss after he handpicked the youngest and “demographically” similar colleagues to have a special assignment. When confronted he asked if “I was going to make this a thing” and said whatever he said goes. This recently developed spine was inspired by me wanting to stick up for a team member who has been with the company longer, and expressed interest in these types of assignments but is not “demographically” similar to the preference (black). \n\nThese two incidents triggered a mass re-evaluation of my time at the company.  The boss would consistently say inappropriate things about females at work. There was a time when a colleague was wearing a dress and he turned to me saying “so and so has nice legs right Sauk?” I replied that I wouldn’t know because she was wearing boots. His response was “what can’t game recognize game?” (I’m female) there also has been comments about evaluating a woman’s value on their looks and so many comments I can’t even list it here. At one point he mused about how another higher ranking woman is “probably a total dom in the bedroom”.  These are along with extremely racist comments including “I never was interested in black women because I heard their pubs are like Brillo pads” and hurtful remarks about another coworkers preference in black men.  This was all enveloped in his passing comments of “killing anyone who messed with his money” and that he was “super close with the head of HR so whatever is said really doesn’t matter.”\n\nI looked for another job and luckily was able to find one quickly. While cleaning shop my team urged me to voice my opinion during the exit interview and I did. I laid out the above and way more. I feel awful. I feel horrible about letting this go on and although HR was sympathetic she even agreed that I had allowed this treatment to happen to me and my colleagues. \n\nSo AITA for allowing this to happen and letting it get to this point? Was I being egregious for bringing this to the attention of HR? I also am guilty of laughing to get in his favor in the past. What can I do in the future? I’m really not asking for a pat on the back here because I really feel like I did the wrong thing for not even noticing how toxic this environment was until too late.\n\nTL;DR Experienced a toxic workplace caused by sexist/racist comments from superior. Played along/was silent because I needed the job. During exit interview aired my grievances. Now I feel like the asshole for not doing anything sooner.",

      "title": "AITA For not speaking to my mother for weeks, months?",
      "description": "Settle in guys, this'll be a long one.\n\nLittle back story first - I've always had a very difficult relationship with my mother.\nI'd also like to add that I recently have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I'm getting the help I need.\n\nMy mother lives in Belarus, I moved to New Zealand to be with my kiwi partner, now husband and pursue a better life 3.5 years ago. She's always been supportive of my decision to move. She's also been through a lot of turmoil lately, like losing her dream job due to circumstances out of her control. I know how hard it is for her, and I have offered to help both financially and emotionally. \n\nThe crux of the issue we have, is she is incredibly manipulative and abusive in her behaviour towards me. I think. She is quick to declare I've done something to upset or wrong her when that was never my intention, and to berate me. I only started to realise this isn't the norm in the last couple of years, and I keep going back and forth, confused. I'm hurt, and I certainly FEEL like I'm to blame for everything, including our awful relationship. I could use an objective view of the situation, as my husband will always side with me for support (bless his soul). I don't really feel comfortable discussing this with people I know personally. \n\nAlthough there is a 14 hour time difference for us, we have tried speaking on the daily before. The trouble starts to arise when I miss a day, or don't reply within a couple hours (when I'm at work for example). I work 45-47 hours a week, ten hour days most days of the week in a customer facing environment where I have to keep the façade up at all times. It's not difficult, just emotionally draining. Sometimes I come home and I don't want to speak to anyone, period. \n\nWhen that happens, she has gone absolutely ballistic in the past. She would ring me until I pick up, then proceed to yell at me for being an awful and uncaring daughter. This has kind of become the norm. She abused me verbally and emotionally, and I took it, because I knew that if I hang up it will just be worse next time. So I listened and took the blame, for anything and everything. I was her emotional outlet. A noble thing perhaps, but I am getting crushed under the weight of her expectations for what a successful human being looks like.\n\nThe thing is, she does have some genuinely good reasons to be upset with me. I can be lazy and distant, sometimes straight up ignoring her messages for a couple days even when I know they are urgent. In the past, she has lost some money because of this. \n\nI feel stressed and anxious whenever I speak with her, even over text messages. I can not explain this feeling, it's like a nagging, sinking dread in my chest. I want to justify her actions, and I have many times, but I know it will just keep happening again, like it has before. Every time I get a text from her I need to steel myself before I read it, in case it makes me feel something I'm not prepared for. \n\nIn the past, I used to take her spiteful words and try to ignore or rationalise them. For any situation, she feels she is qualified to give her (often baseless) opinion on things she has very little knowledge of, and put me down for disagreeing. This can be anything from life decisions to how often and with what I brush my teeth. Only her opinion is valid, and she makes that clear by letting me know what a huge \"New Zealand sheep\" I am should I try to disagree. \n\nI guess at large I also feel confused. Is it really my duty as her child to be this emotion-toilet? To always be available for my parent? Sometimes it feels like she is the child, whose problems I have to either solve or be blamed for. \n\nI've taken to completely ignoring her for months over the past year. This wasn't entirely intentional at first, as I read/heard her abusive language, calling me a pig and an unworthy human being, and was simply unable to respond. When she finished, I would simply not follow up for days, then weeks. Then months. During this time, I worry about her mental well being, but I'm too ashamed to ask. She considers me a horrible child, I know this, and I feel like by not being there for her I'm only validating her view.\n\nShe's expressed numerous times how she feels I don't love her, don't care about her, and I never possibly could. This is simply not true, and hurts me beyond words, I wish I could prove her wrong.\nAt the same time, this relationship has caused us both so much pain, it feels like limiting our interactions is the only way to make it stop.  \n\nEarlier this year she finally nagged my husband and I to go on holiday with her, despite us not really being able to afford it. She sweetened the deal by agreeing to pay all the accommodation expenses for our trip, so I thought \"what the hell, I haven't seen her in four years. Maybe this is the chance to make things right between us.\" Boy, was I wrong.\n\nShe had booked accommodation on two opposite ends of a very rural part of a tropical country, with no way of getting there. Long story short, we ended up staying somewhere completely unplanned, and spending all our savings on a very stressful, unfulfilled holiday. She lost all her prepayments and deposits for the hotels she had booked.\n\nAfter we came back, my grandfather (her dad) had a severe stroke. This with the added pressure at work and financial stress after our badly planned holiday finally made me collapse. I shut out all my friends, all family not in NZ, including my mother. I gradually reintroduced them all, except my mother. No communication for about three months, blocked her on all social media and on my phone. After this time, I had realised I was actually, for once, feeling happy. \n\nShe has just posted me a physical letter, outlining all the ways I have failed as a daughter, and why I'm an egotistical monster. Her words, not mine. She has also demanded I return all the money she spent on my husband and I while on holiday. By which I presume, she means the accommodation deposits she lost. I'm actually happy to pay her this money if it makes the issue go away, but is it right? Will potentially justify similar requests in the future?? \n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: My mother abuses me verbally and emotionally for years, causing my mental state to spiral out of control, affecting my work and home life. I choose to cut contact, she demands I pay.\n\nAITA for choosing to stop speaking with her, causing this fallout? Is it justified for her to ask for this money back? Am I taking her words too harshly?? I'm hurt and confused. Any insight will be helpful.\n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I share similar jobs (we both work at public schools). She has a longer commute, but doesn’t have to be in at work until later than I do. We both have to be up and getting ready around 6:30am. The issue is that she sets her alarm for 5:30am, as where I don’t usually get up until about 6:15am. I’m a pretty light sleeper and when her alarm goes off it wakes me up and I have trouble going back to sleep. She says she needs an alarm at 5:30 to “start the wake up process” but then goes back to sleep until 6:15. This morning was tough because I didn’t sleep well and the alarm went off at 5:30 and I couldn’t go back to sleep. I asked her if she could set her alarm for later (like around 6:00am) and she think this is ridiculous and refuses to compromise. AITA for wanting an extra 30-45 min of sleep without an alarm going off when we both get up at the same time? \n\ntldr: wife sets alarm 45 min early even though we get up as same time. I’ve asked her to change it ",

      "description": " \n\nI know that it sounds terrible, and I'm not entirely sure I believe it myself, but it seems like he ruins everything our family tries to do. I'm 17, and the oldest of 3. My little brothers are 13 and 10. The 10 year old brother is autistic, more specifically he has Asperger's(high verbal, lacks any sense of empathy, sympathy, or caring about any human beings besides his 95 year old great grandmother). He seems to ruin everything we try and do as a family, threatens with violence (held a knife to his own throat because he was grounded from playing video games), and treats my parents like slaves.\n\nI can't stand hearing him berate my mom with demands and horrible comments, but when I call him out on it, she gets on to me. I am in debate and theatre, and my parents have to miss my performances, award ceremonies, and even being recognized in front of hundreds of people for helping a Cub Scout Troop cross over into my Boy Scout troop with more achievements than this troop had ever seen before because they cannot leave him at home. He has tried to run away into the woods at church and wouldn't come back to the car until 30 minutes later when my dad carried him back while he was getting hit, kicked, and clawed by the demon.\n\nMy parents do everything in their power to try and help, and believe me, they are astonishing parents, but he spits everything back in their faces. Even on Christmas Day he yelled at me because I made a joke about a cat dying in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. I forgot to mention, the only thing he cares about besides electronics and his great grandmother is animals. They tried taking him to equine therapy, but he refused to go. Even behavioral therapists gave up on him.\n\nI can't go in the living room, it's a warzone. Unless he retreats to our office where he plays Roblox for 5 hours straight despite being told to take a shower for 3 of those 5 hours until he is dragged out and the computer is unplugged, resulting in his daily meltdown. I stay in my room almost the entire time I'm at home, and I am afraid of having friends over at my house because he throws his fits so violently, and I have to deflect until it can result in me getting out of my house.\n\nThe cherry on top of this wonderful post is that over the past year or so I've developed severe depression, and I'll come in and out of depressive states depending on how stressed I am, and the only person that seems to notice is my girlfriend. I would talk to my parents about it, but they shovel so much money into the medications he needs to function at all I don't want to add any more strain to their lives. I just wish I had an actual family again, because this is far from a family. I'm a junior in high school, and I want to go to college as far away as possible, but I don't want to leave my 13 year old brother in the dust. Everything seems like it would be so much easier if he didn't exist. So Reddit, how much of the asshole am I?",

      "description": "Title is sufficiently self explanatory. A bit of back story\\~\n\nThere was this girl I went out with a couple of months ago. One thing led to the other and I was very much in love with her, though we hadn't been dating very long. Unfortunately, she didn't feel the same way.\n\nFair enough. Things don't always work out my way. I took the rejection gracefully, and tried to remain a good friend.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, and prom is right around the corner. Since she wasn't graduating this year, she couldn't go unless invited by someone passing out. While we were dating, she bought up prom at some point and I, of course, went along with it and said something along the lines of \"Sure, I'm taking you\". I didn't really want to go back on a promise (albeit one made so long back, under different circumstances), so I'd made up my mind to go with her if she was still interested and bought it up again, but not to ask her out myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's how the conversation (text) went.\n\nHer: By the way, I suppose you're not going to bother with prom?\n\nMe: That isn't really a question, is it? So I'd suggest you rephrase it as the question you'd like to have me answer.\n\nHer: Oh, you're not going to talk me into asking. All I did was ask if you're going.\n\nMe: Suuuure. I hadn't given it a thought previously, but I think I would go.\n\n(Half of my best friends are female, so I figured I'd just take one along and actually have fun.)\n\nHer: Dammit, I just lost a bet.\n\nMe: A bet with someone, or a bet with luck?\n\nHer: Well, a person. But you don't get to ask who :P\n\nMe: This may not be the most demeaning thing I've been told, but it definitely makes the list.\n\nHer: Demeaning?\n\n(Two hours later)\n\nHer: The bet, or that I won't tell you who?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did message me on another platform to complain I was ignoring her the next day, which I duly ignored. It's been two days after that, during which we spotted each other on the streets without exchanging a word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was very disturbed by the fact that she would take something so personal and make a bet out of it. Besides, if it was going out with me that as important to her, she would've asked me out, right? But it looks like it was the bet that mattered to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? Am I making mountains out of molehills?  \nI don't hold grudges, and to admit, being on a sour note with *anyone* makes me uneasy. I'd been thinking of messaging her to let it slide, should I?",

      "description": "Yeah, I absolutely know that the girl I am with now is the one for me, except in two ways...\n\n1: I somehow still sexually crave my ex-fiancée. She does things I can't explain, and even just the way she looked... She was a perfect 10/10 in every way in the bedroom.\n\n2: When the current girlfriend and I do somehow fight, I think she is the worst. We're so similar that she knows how to push my buttons and get her way. I hate this part.\n\n\nMy ex-fiancée was verbally and emotionally abusive to me, though, and was terrible to me, but wow... She has essentially become a fetish of mine, whereas current girlfriend is not actually too good at what she does. I told her what I like, and do it to her, and now it blows her mind but at best with me, it's average.\n\nAaaand yeah, current girlfriend is horrible to fight with, argue with, etc., in a way of making it about her and guilt-tripping me for it. Finances and family issues, she injects herself into. I tell her that I'd rather be dead than live with my family, she does nothing to get me out of the situation I am in where I have to live with my emotionally and financially abusive parents, but makes me feel bad for exposing her to them. My parents actually are the reason my ex-fiancée left me the most recent time. \n\nBut, everything else about her is perfect. Her sense of humour, her dedication and loyalty, I respect her but I am not sure I love her in a romantic sense. I don't love anyone in a romantic sense like that, but I do notice that my one coworker (in a happy relationship I am not going to break apart, before anyone suggests that) who looks just like my ex-fiancée somehow drives me nuts... She tempts me into thinking about my ex-fiancée and I realize that I still love her, but that it's the easiest way to end up dead by suicide by the depression ex-fiancée causes.\n\nAITA for reconsidering a long-term relationship with someone who's nearly perfect just because she doesn't remind me of my ex-fiancée? AITA for getting into a relationship knowing that I'm still not over my ex-fiancée after like 2 years and 11 months? AITA for not being sure if I ever will be over her? AITA for valuing my ex-fiancée's appearance and overall ability to make me weak at the knees over the girl with the right personality?",

A little backstory, my sister and I were raised by an amazing stepfather who stayed our dad even after he divorced our mother.  He's a great dad, always there for us, family-oriented, tough, but supportive.\n\nWell, I never thought it would happen, but he finally got remarried.  When he told us the date over a family Facebook group chat, my older sister said she wouldn't be able to make it because she already asked for spring break off from work and \"couldn't\" ask for any more time.  She had plans to go tubing down a river and some plans for my nephew.  Our dad gently tried to encourage her to maybe let her husband watch her son for a day or two during spring break, so she could work and exchange that day for his wedding day.  She said she just couldn't possibly, so sorry.  She had months at this point to try to adjust her plans and make his wedding.  Instead, she suggested HE change HIS wedding date.  WTF?\n\nSo, I, being more than a little annoyed at her, posted a gif in the family chat that basically said \"Just remember, it's all about YOU.\"  That set her off, she cursed me out, told me she didn't care about me at all, I was dead to her, and hasn't spoken to me since.  And no, she didn't come to the wedding.\n\nNow, I get that it wasn't exactly a nice thing to do.  I was trying to make a point in a moment of disappointment and annoyance, and yeah, I probably meant it condescendingly.  But...\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I’m an engineer, and I have a friend that used to work for the same company and department with me for my first job out of college.  We are good friends, but I wouldn’t say I enjoyed him as a coworker because while he is great at his job he loved disrupting me and giving me a hard time.  I’m gay, and he made a point of telling people at work, so I also have some touchiness around sharing personal info with him. Fast forward to now, we are working for different companies, and he’d like to know my salary in case he decides to interview here.  I don’t mind sharing this information with some friends, but even though I consider him a good friend I just didn’t want to do it.  I told him no, and his wife immediately texts me and says I should at least give a range, and that I’m playing into a “toxic culture of money being taboo” to the advantage of companies lowballing salaries.

      "description": "Help me out here Redditors. \n\nIm ALWAYS throwing parties for others, I love showing the people I care about how important they are. But i HATE being the center of attention. That said, past three years my friends threw me a surprise birthday (last year i threw a surprise for my ex-girlfriend who was born one day before me, so idk classify that how you want to, some of my friends were there).\n\nRecently, my life has slowly been falling apart and it kinda brought on a depression; im deeply disappointed in some short comings that my friends are VERY aware of. Im NOT in a festive mood. Not to mention nearly all my so called friends have honestly shown almost zero care, something i would NEVER do in return, even when i tried reaching out to them. So i made it clear to them for weeks i am completely uninterested in celebrating my birthday. Repeatedly. Time and time again for weeks. They have given me many problems but it seemed like they understood. \n\nWhat I did want to do though, is go out with this girl ive been casually seeing. Havent went out with her in a while, and made it super clear to her that im only interested in going out with her tonight to enjoy her company, NOT celebrating my birthday. Well, she agreed that we would treat today like it was any other day. Except my friends hit me up asking to join her and I. I didnt tell anyone we were hanging out. Only person who could have told them was the girl i was gonna go out with tonight. Shes part of said friend group... so it seems to me like an attempt at a surprise party or celebrating my birthday. I genuinely wanted to believe that she wanted to go out tonight just out of romantic interest, not out of some due-diligence of some sort with regards to my birthday. \n\nAITA for being upset by this and considering just not meeting up with her at all? I feel cornered by both her and my friends into doing that which i dont want, I seriously dont fucking want to celebrate my birthday, just wanted to go out on a quiet date. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to mediate my parents' divorce?",
      "description": "So for some context, my mom definitely treated me rather questionably as a kid. I hesitate to call her actions outright abuse, but some of it certainly bordered on it: for example, she would be very quick to anger and hit me for very minor mishaps (such as, say, forgetting my lunch box at school) and when I had a pet hamster around age 11-ish, whenever I would disobey her she would threaten to kill the hamster or release it outside of the house and leave it to its fate. There's more, but suffice to say my opinion of my mom hasn't exactly been the greatest. She did \"apologize\" for these actions and attempt to make amends, but even still, I have my resentments towards her. When I was in high school, my mom left working full time to stay at home so she could \"devote more time to the family.\"\n\nBy the end of my final year of HS, I got into a good college in another state. In order to get in-state tuition as well as a larger home, my parents found out they could move to the new state. It was at this point that apparently, my father had asked my mother to find a job and get back into the workforce. Without saying too much personal detail, there were some disagreements between my parents about my father sending money to support some of his family back in my parents' country, and my father had basically told my mom that if she had a problem with the money being spent that way, she should find a job and get back into the workforce now that I was in college. My mom more or less dragged her feet on getting a job until about my sophomore year when my father started demanding it more seriously. Even then, she was reluctant to do trainings and apply to jobs and such, saying that she didn't know where to start. My dad pointed her to some resources and told her how she could get back into the job, and mentioned the names of some of his friends' wives who had gotten back into the workforce after their kids went off to college. For whatever reason she said that their advice wouldn't work or she couldn't make sense of what they told her and still put off getting a job. My dad in response to this began to up the ante.\n\nIt started small and kind of petty: for example, my dad would refuse to eat at home and always go out for dinner, claiming he would only eat at the table with her once she seriously began looking for a job. Then whenever she wanted to do anything other than some kind of training/job hunting (for example, when they had first moved to the new state they talked about how they wanted to set up the media room in the new house with a projector and stuff), he would \"remind\" her that she needed to find a job, and begin using the job to shut down any arguments. At this stage I'd ask my dad why he was being this punitive in terms of not eating at home or constantly reminding my mom she needed to get a job, and he would always say that that was \"the only way to get through to my mom,\" as he'd tried explaining to her \"normally\" that she needed to find a job and she didn't take any action towards doing so when he'd done it that way. I explained to him many times over that shame wasn't an effective way to get her to find a job, but to no avail: he kept on doing the same. The money situation and the job situation resulted in lots of arguments between my parents, devolving into yelling matches and many times I had to mediate the situation for them.\n\nThen he ramped it up further. He threatened to divorce her if she didn't find a job by this past March. On numerous occassions, my mom would call me to basically vent to me about how my dad was treating her, and these calls would go on for an hour at a time. She would expect me to step away from whatever it is that I was doing, promising me she just needed to talk for \"ten minutes,\" when I knew that wasn't the case. She was clearly miserable, but at the same time I had my own life as a college student to deal with and in some ways I resented having to carry the burden of the same woman who treated me so badly when I was younger.When I went home to visit, I asked my dad on the car ride back if he was actually planning on divorcing my mom if she didn't find a job by the end of (this past) June. He said that he was, because he felt that he had compromised on a lot of stuff for my mom's sensibilities: for example, allowing her to be something of a helicopter parent when I was a kid, not eating meat in the house (a common thing in my parents' culture since meat is seen as \"dirty\" food), not drinking alcohol at gatherings with family friends while she was there (since my mom is rather religious and against drinking), etc. He expressed disdain that my mother wasn't willing to compromise for him when it came to him asking her to get a job even if she had some hesitations about getting back into the workforce, and that if she couldn't make this compromise, then maybe their values weren't compatible any more. My mom's side of the story on her lack of compromise is as follows: In dealing with my dad's side of the family (as mentioned earlier, they basically kept demanding he send them money, which he did to an extent but then basically told them to piss off because it was clear these people couldn't manage money responsibly for the life of them), she said she had to sacrifice all sorts of things that their peers in America had: for example, being able to buy a bigger house for our family, having another kid, etc. She said that she felt satisfied being a housewife and that she felt it was unfair for my dad to demand she get a job without any regard to how she felt about it, that they wouldn't have been so tight on money if not for his family, etc. Now it's important to mention my mom definitely isn't lazy or some kind of gold-digging leech freeloading off of my dad: as many negative things as I have to say about her, I can say this about her confidently.\n\nAnyway, my dad's treatment of her has gotten even worse. He extended the \"deadline\" for her job hunt to the end of this year, but he refuses to talk to her in person, saying that he gets frustrated every time she talks to him. Instead, he expects her to always text him, even if they're under the same roof. He also expects her to email him weekly progress reports on her job hunt letting him know about any leads she found, trainings she completed, etc. Another thing that's relevant to mention is that he picked up a smoking habit while my mom had gone on a trip last winter to visit her family in their home country. My mom was very concerned for my dad's health, and would demand he stop smoking. When my dad stopped talking to her face to face, she made me go and ask him to stop smoking for the sake of his health. When I was at home for summer break, she would expect me to wake up at 6:00 AM right when he had his morning cigarettes to \"catch him red-handed\" and tell him to stop smoking. I humored her at first, but after a few times, it became very clear that this was an ineffective approach. Accordingly, at one of these incidences, he blew up at me, saying that my mom should \"stop using me to police him\" and that the next time either of us brought this up, he would just get up and leave my mom on the spot. Still, despite the fact that my dad blew up at me, my mom demanded I keep engaging with my dad about how he was treating her. When I refused to do this and told her it was an ineffective approach and that I couldn't just burn my hands for her sake, she got angry at me, saying that I was \"the only person she had left\" and \"I've done so much for you, why can't you have the gratitude to help me back?!\" (These were the same things she would tell me when she called and I was busy either studying or with my friends and didn't have the luxury of stepping away for a long time to talk to her.)\n\nNow here's the thing with my reaction how my dad treats my mom. He is treating her unfairly, no doubt, but I can't bring myself to have that visceral level of sympathy for my mom because of how she treated me in the past. Whenever I see my dad giving my mom the cold shoulder and beating her over the head with this job hunt thing, I definitely see it as wrong, but I don't see it as worse because it's my mom; I just see it the way that I'd see it if it were some random guy doing the same to his wife, if that makes any sense.\n\nAnd also, I've gotten frustrated with my mom refusing to see that what she demands of me in helping her isn't furthering the cause of getting my dad to back down. She says that I should \"express to my dad my desire for us to stay a family,\" and quite honestly, I don't feel that way. I feel that if one person wants out of the relationship, then the relationship is over, no matter the reason for wanting out: you can't make someone stay in a relationship with you. When I expressed this to my mom, she said that in her culture \"you don't just throw a marriage away,\" and that I wouldn't understand since I was raised here. And I'm at my limit in being the emotional outlet for my mom. At a point, I feel that she is saying the same thing over and over, to the point where I dread having a phone call with her. I realize that I am part of the family and this affects me, but at the same time this is her and my dad's marriage: I can only do so much to influence the situation, yet she seems to expect me to fix everything or devote every last drop of energy to consoling her even if she won't say that's what she wants outright. Am I wrong in feeling this way? I feel like she'd call me a monster or something for saying I want out, but shit, that's how I feel.\n\nTL;DR: Dad wants to divorce because my mom won't find a job, mom doesn't want to divorce. I wind up getting caught in the middle a lot, and I'm not sure if I'm selfish for wanting out, partly due to unrelated resentment towards my mom. Advice wanted.\n\n*I am a bot, and t",

      "description": "So last night I caused a scene because of how my brother was acting. My girlfriend says I was an asshole and I want a second opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my girlfriend of on spring break right now. We didn't really want to do much over the break but wanted to take the chance so we decided to throw a casual party for all our friends which included a pot luck. This is where my brother Dave comes in. I invited Dave 3 weeks ago and he told me no. He said he wasn't going to come to my \"stupid party\". W/e, i didn't really care and that was the end of it. Well, until last night when he showed up uninvited and did not bring any food (like we asked everyone to do)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the main problem comes in, Dave is vegan. Now, I have nothing against vegans, my girlfriend is a vegetarian. It's respectable and it's none of my business. But dave is the stereotypical vegan everyone hates. The hardest part of the 2 years he's been vegan is bringing it up at every chance. He will shame you for your diet while not shutting up about his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of the 16ish dishes we had maybe one was vegan. The two my girlfriend made were vegetarian but had egg in them and most of the others had meat. So, when Dave showed up he began to complain to me and others that I didn't consider his lifestyle. Along with this, he was actively trashing others dishes. MY sister offered to make him a dish of one of hers without egg in it (she had left over ingredients prepared) and he turned her down, telling her to \"enjoy her chicken menstruation). He also told a classmate of mine that her chili reeked of \"cruelty\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the party went on he would not stop bitching and began to push some of his animal liberation stuff but I decided to just ignore him, until he began trashing me to my girlfriend. He told her that I treat him like crap, just imagine how I would treat an animal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was furious at this, so I turned off the music and announced to everyone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Attention everyone. I would like to personalty apologize for the actions of my brother. You see, he's a vegan and animal liberation. He has compassion for animals that are smarter than him. I will personally buy each of you a steak as apology for his actions.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother was furious but the people at the party laughed at my joke and began to ignore him themselves. Eventually he just slipped out as everyone just ignored him. He texted me this morning saying he wan't an apology but I ignored him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly feel like I was justified but my girlfriend says I was to mean with how I acted. She says he was an ass to but I handled it badly. What do you guys think? Was I wrong to do that and am I an asshole? ",

      "description": "So there’s this video game which I love. I’ve been playing it with my boyfriend since 2011 and it’s essentially been the backbone of our relationship and we’ve been together for over 10 years. I have countless great memories of me and him playing this game together, and I’d be playing it with him right now if I could. I moved out on my own for the first time a year ago, and it means I do not have any spare money, and certainly not enough to ever be able to afford a new laptop in the near future at all in order to play. As I’m typing this I hear the propane delivery truck outside and I already know there’s a 200$ bill stuck to my door. Since over a year since I’ve been able to play there been tons of new updates and whatnot, and I miss the game badly but there’s not really anything I can do. \n\nMe and my boyfriend have been playing Xbox games together since I do have a functioning Xbox. He has a functioning computer unlike myself so he technically can play the game i miss, but he doesn’t without me, and he doesn’t talk about it because there’s no point. We simply just have to wait however many years it takes for me to be financially secure enough in able to afford a gaming laptop ( or just one of any kind ) and he’s patient and nice about it. My best friend also use to play this game with me, and recently she decided to reinstall the game and play. I have no problem with that, all I did was simply as her if she could not talk about it with me as it saddens me I can’t play anymore, but she’s decided to be rude and sarcastic about it, taking my request in the wrong way. Specifically, I asked her the first time to please not talk about it as it upsets me. She decided she didn’t care and continued, so I got angry and was more stern this time. Now she’s being sarcastic about it and calling it “the game which should not be mentioned” to be a dick.... \n\nTLDR: I asked my friend not to rub in my face I can’t play a game and haven’t been able to in years, and she doesn’t care and keeps mentioning it.

      "description": "This happened about an hour ago. My brother and sister in law live next door. I have a ranch and have a colony of feral cats (all fixed and vaccinated before we go down that road). I was out of town yesterday and apparently my SIL found one of the younger cats close to the road. She posted a picture of it and the location it was found on a lost and found pets Facebook group. I saw the post and commented “lol. That’s one from our feral colony.” She said neither of our husbands recognized it to which I replied “mine doesn’t pay any attention so that’s not surprising 😂”. That’s it. I called my brother and he didn’t answer so I texted both him and his wife and explained what cat it was and that I would walk over to get her. I walked over, knocked on the door, could hear them talking but couldn’t make out what they were saying. Knocked again in case they hadn’t heard me. Brother opens the door and tells me the cat is at SIL sister’s house down the street. I said “oh ok. I’ll call her and go pick it up.” My brother then proceeds to tell me I should have called or texted them first before “putting them on blast on Facebook”. To which I replied something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I just thought it was funny that it was one of my cats.” He then told me that it was rude of me to say “lol”. We ended up getting in an argument about it with him saying that I was rude and me saying that was ridiculous and then I left to get the cat. So, am I the asshole for saying lol? ",

      "description": "Me and two girls were video chatting. I tend to flirt with one of them playfully so, I flexed my bicep to her (weird way to put it but whatever). She replied by saying imagine needing to go to the gym to have a good physique. So I replied with imagine needing to diet to get to average weight. The thing is she got very mad at me for saying that and didn’t talk to me for 3 days. \n\nShe has commented about how she was insecure about her weight before but I never really thought much of it. \n\nSo I messaged her saying if she was mad and we argued a bit about I made her feel. \nThe thing is me and my friends always roast each other about our biggest insecurities so I never thought much about how it can make a person feel in a bad way. \n\nAnyways I apologized but continued to argue my point. She said I understand that but girls don’t take jokes like that about their insecurities.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n(First time posting on this sub, sorry for any format errors)",

      "description": "Let me start by giving some background information for our relationship. I (22M) love my girlfriend (21F). We met in the summer of my junior year of college (summer internship) and did distance for a year. I ended up getting a job that allowed me to move back up to her city after graduation and found a studio apartment. We moved in together shortly after as I felt her living situation was less then ideal. My girlfriend was in a car accident two years ago that left her with a hip injury. Her Uncle ended up offering to take her in and she lived with him before I moved up. The living situation between them ended up becoming less than ideal. I didn't want her to pay rent since she wasn't in a position financially to do so. After she moved in she ended up having to get knee surgery again. I tried my best to support her through the surgery and be her caretaker as she would be in a wheelchair for two months. This was a rough time for her. Her mood and demeanor changed as she was dealing with the fact that she would have to push off school and work to deal with the recovery. She ended up getting a job at a bank two weeks ago, after regaining the ability to walk. We both go to work and we come home and essentially prepare for the next day. I'm generally an outwardly affectionate person and during the time of our relationship, my girlfriend would be as well but she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this past year and has even admitted to me that the she was in a manic state when we met that summer. Knowing this, I have tried to dial back on the level of attention and affection I provide to her and tried to be more understanding. She was on Abilify for a couple of months but has since stopped taking it because its made her gain weight. I know there are moments where she doesn't want to talk or be bothered but it has now come to a point where for the past couple of months, I've been feeling as if she is more of a roommate rather than a girlfriend. I feel like our relationship is at a point where I have accepted that the weekdays I leave her alone for the most part and hope that her mood changes a little when the weekend comes around. She says this is fine and that I should just let her be tired and when she wants to grab my attention she will. I have no problem with that but its just getting to a point where our relationship operates on when she wants to open up and be attentive and affectionate rather than it being something that is mutually given by both partners. I really love her and it may be my age, but I'm just trying to understand how to communicate to her what I am feeling.  If you have read this far then I definitely would love to hear your input about this and I am able to provide more information to any follow up questions that may be asked.",

      "description": "Hey all so when I was in high school I got with my now ex husband and his mom was horrible to me. \n\nFrom day one she knew I could never be good enough for her baby boy and actually cried when she found out we were getting married and begged my ex not to do it, that “if  he loved his mother he wouldn’t” we ended up getting married anyway and she made my world a living nightmare. \n\nBack to when we first met though, she worked for this millionaire lady taking care of her mentally disabled son.  The deal was my ex’s mom would take care of the son and the millionaire would pay her cash so she didn’t have to put it on her taxes. \n\nMy ex’s mom stole SO MUCH money from us over the years we were together in multiple ways. \n\n1 when he turned 18 he got a $17,000 settlement from the government (something to do with his father it’s a long story) and she took every penny of it. \n\nHERES where it starts effecting me \n\nWe got married when we were 20 (dumb I know but that’s not what this is about ) as soon as tax season rolls around I start getting phone calls from his mother \n\nThe calls were essentially this “I’m going to claim my son on taxes this year so you better not filed as married filing together or ill x,y,z” \n\nNow it’s my understanding that when your 20, married, and not living under your parents roof you can’t be claimed by them? But that’s exactly what she did.  This crazy ass woman claimed my ex husband on taxes so that she could get more money.\n\nDid she care that it effected our finances or my college at all? Nope I was just the fat bitch married to her son \n\nThe entire time I was married to mommies boy mom was first and if I did anything to hurt mommy I was the bad guy. When he told her we were getting married and she cried he told me that if not for me he would take it back because mommy was upset. \n\nI want to report her to the IRS\n\nThis is in no way to get back at my ex but rather his mother for being a scumbag. Some of my family and my current s/o are like YES DO IT and others are like man your messed up what’s wrong with you \n\nam I the asshole?",

In stock are the shops own branded items, and then other brands from outside. So yeah, I'm casually stocking the products on the shelf, and this customer comes up to me and says why aren't the dates on these products? I explain how it's for waste reduction (which is a brilliant idea, plenty of people throw away food because the \"expire\" date has past\" but the food is very much edible). But yeah, our shops own brand doesn't have expiry dates because of that reason. \n\nThe customer proceeds to call me a \"fucking useless idiot\", I was at the end of my shift (11hrs), couldn't be bothered, so I asked her if she was a fucking moron. She asked for my badge name, which I happily gave, now I have a meeting with the manager. But coming to think of it, maybe I was a bit harsh. She seemed quite old too...but she did call me that first. AITA?",

      "description": "So, I'm about to go off to college and this won't be an issue for too much longer, but for the next few months at least I am going to be living here in a house with my parents. I try to be out as often as I can because they are not your traditional pleasant, mature parents as many of my friends have. \n\nThey're regularly getting drunk to the point they can't stand every weekend, I drink on occasion with friends, but they drink a lot more than I do and to the point where they can't function shit-faced drunk. This would be fine in itself, I just avoid them when I can. \n\nHowever, what I can't avoid is that there are times I need to be home to do homework, or tests because I have a hard time focusing when I'm around friends, or my boyfriend. Every day they smoke maybe an inch from the door frame and will make the entire house smell like a small smoke filled casino. It's to the point where they might as well smoke inside.\n\nI have brought it up with them, lung cancer runs in the family and my grandma died or it and my grandpa died of emphysema.  I have told them I choose not to smoke because I don't want to get lung cancer, or emphysema. I've politely asked them to close the door since it only takes a second. I've tried suggesting they vape, or maybe try quitting.\n\nYet the next day or an hour later they will be smoking with the door wide open and the house will smell like an ashtray. It has never once changed and they have made zero effort for any progress once. \n\nI'm beyond frustrated and just sent my mother a text with a link to second hand smoke statistics since that is a reality of what could happen. In my anger I also said that they are adults and should act like it. Which she got upset over and said was not okay. If I could afford to get an apartment for the few months I am here I absolutely would even though I am moving to a completely different city.  \n\nTLDR; I've asked my parents to close the door when they smoke and they've kept doing it. I've gotten frustrated to the point of telling them they need to be more mature and act like adults. AITA for being upset and bringing it up?",

      "description": "This was atleast a year ago. I was dating my ex for a good year in a half. We ended due to us losing interests in trying due to reasons (whichs is a fuck up on both parties) However a few months roll by being single sucks and start miss her. She was a very sweet girl, honest and so on. She asked to come in and grab her stuff which I was fine with. I asked her to sit down and I unloaded my feelings to her. Telling her I miss her and wish we could of done better together. She goes on saying she has \"Moved on\" But then she hugged me and next thing I know she kissed me and well...you can guess what happens there. After a week I asked her to dinner too talk more. She obviously was avoiding me after the fact, but I convinced her to have dinner and talk. I tell her I do miss her and love her again asking if she wants to try again. She says no and has a new bf. I was hurt and asked point blank \"Why would you even kiss me when I told you all that. You knew I missed you and yet you did that to me.\" Her excuse was \"It was just the heat of the moment.\" Then she rattled off how I'm this and that even saying things that were completely out of context. Like I told her to get a rag when she ran out of tampons (I said that as a joke and took her the drug store for more) or how I had a fight with my mom. (me and mom have our issues) or her saying I'm flirting with other girls (When I just know alot of girls I was very loyal in the relationship) Goes off saying if you can't treat your mom right how can you treat me right. That set me off she doesn't get that me and mom do love each other but still have issues. \"That is me and my moms business I have never treated you unfairly your going to pull that crap\" I started to say some of the stupid things shes done to me over the relationship, trust me their stupid. I was so hurt, after I basically poured my heart out and what we did, in my mind I thought we had a chance because she did that with me. After a few back and forth of insults. We calmed down but apologized and moved on. We talk here and there but I still feel like I was the asshole in all this. Idk guys help me out here I need some inside.",

She's now super pissed with me and won't talk.\n\nSo yea, I told her. It's normal, we want to look at other girls. Hot girls. It's evolution. So I should be able to check them out. We weren't even more for monogamy so she should be happy I'm quitting other girls for her\n\nSometimes my girlfriend can't cut it. I'm a guy. She's okay attractive, but usually I can only get off from her during sex. If I want to jerk off, she's not enough, I need someone hot and gorgeous. I'm not that attractive either, she's more of a personality person. So why can't she accept she may not be there in the physical apartment, I still love her for who she is\n\nI would do anything for her. I love her to death  I dont understand. I'm not physically cheating(and I totally could get with some of them, but I don't) so what is her deal?\n\nAm I actually the asshole?",

      "description": "Exam leave started for us 3 weeks ago. I ask my friend who I hang out with at school almost daily for the past 4 years if she would like to hangout and she says she is hanging out with her somewhat new boyfriend on these days. When talking to her she says her mum wouldn't let me come over as she needs to study but for some reason her bf can come over everyday. \n\nThis goes on for 2 weeks with me asking to hang out maybe 5 to 6 times over the 2 weeks all receiving the previous response. Everytime with her bf. Everytime her mom wouldn't allow her to go out or me to go there. (I am not a bad influence or anything, her mom likes me a lot as far as I can tell.) \n\nThis has gone on for 2 weeks so I get upset and don't message my friend for another week. I say we need to talk and explain myself about how I'm feeling that she isn't making time for me and I feel as if her reasons are fake. Then ensues a big argument about it to which at the end she says \"I can't be f*cked with you rn\". AITA for initiating the conversation? And is there any advice for next steps? ",

      "description": "To give some background info, I was on my high school's swim team and all the guys on the team bleached their hair every year before the district meet as a fun way to get excited and bond together for championship season. My class were all really good friends and after four years of walking around with white hair together we were used to other people's reactions in public. We had this running joke that whenever somebody asked why all our hair was blonde you had to say something funny or dumb just to see how they'd react. Examples included \"we're all trying out for Cinderella in the school play\" and \"going to a guy fieri convention.\" I'd say it got a slight chuckle like fifty percent of the time.  \n\nAnyway, the day we bleached our hair my senior year we all went to eat tacos and I was first in line. The cashier took my order then kind of pointed at all of us and said \"what's up with the hair?\" So, keeping in line with our running joke, I whipped out a response I thought would be funny and said for all my friends to hear \"we're going to a costume party dressed as gonorrhea\" in the most deadpan and casual tone possible. The cashier gave me a horrified look and and put her hand over her mouth like she was going to puke. We stared at each other in silence for about five seconds then she told us all we had to leave. I walked outside but my friends asked if they could still order food and she allowed them to. Obviously it was a dumb joke but AITA? Did I deserve to be kicked out of the restaurant? It's been a few years and I still cringe when I think about the way she looked at me. I feel like her reaction was over the top for a shitty joke but I could see how this would be a common response from someone who doesn't know me.",

      "description": "So, it’s been a while since it happened but it’s something that occasionally weighs on my mind and as I’m not very good at dealing with people/relationships/feelings, I thought it would be good to get some feedback.\n\nI was in a relationship with a guy for about 8-9 months during my second year at uni. The university had a pretty high-pressure, competitive environment so a lot of people there struggle with mental health problems. \nAlthough I personally wasn’t stressed out academically as I’m not particularly competitive and definitely not a type A unlike a lot of people who were there, I’ve had on/off up/down mental health issues for other reasons since I was young and was stressed out with managing finances (as the university was very expensive, didn’t allow you to have a job due to the workload and my parents earn too little to properly support me but too much for me to qualify for a bursary/decent maintenance loan) and just not liking my course or the traditional, stuffy and stereotypical white-upper/middle-class environment. \nI think the guy felt stressed/depressed over a lot but didn’t really like talking to me about things. Some of the things that he gradually opened up about or I just learnt from observation was that he was stressed about his course a lot (as the medicine course at the university is very intense, especially during second year), he felt as though he didn’t have any ‘real’ friends and frankly, he just didn’t have anything he was interested in (but enjoyed criticising and making fun of other’s passions/interests... which is kinda unrelated but just something I’m bitter about since I held a lot of things in during our relationship).\n\nI think towards the later half, our relationship definitely deteriorated and I recall him calling it toxic. I remember being upset at the time and just didn’t say anything but upon reflection, I honestly think it was just as if not more toxic for me than it was for him since he was always the one complaining and expecting me to change whereas I just kept my mouth shut and turned a blind eye to everything that I found frustrating about him. \n\nI kinda just decided to just cut contact with him after a pretty disastrous short trip to Amsterdam - he kept getting frustrated over everything I did (I have a few borderline ADHD tendencies so can be a bit absent minded and impulsive) whereas I just got frustrated at him getting frustrated by everything and being so controlling. I honestly wanted to leave before even getting on the plane since he was very aggressive in the way he was acting in the airport (his tone when he talked to me, constantly ordering me around, grabbing onto my wrist and yanking me very hard - to the extent that it was painful - into a queue because I looked unhappy and wasn’t paying attention to the queue, etc).\n\nI think after our trip, it was pretty obvious our relationship was over since it was close to being over several times before and it was kinda the final straw. I think our final exchange was him asking me how my working holiday in Korea was and how a concert in London was a couple of months afterwards (to which I ended up replying because I am unfortunately a sucker when it comes to talking about BTS - but I definitely made sure I kept it brief and kinda cold which is how I normally talk/act to people I’m not close with). \n\nAbout a week or two afterwards though, he texted me again saying something along the lines of ‘I really can’t cope’ since he had started another year at uni (whereas I took the year out and reapplied elsewhere) and didn’t really have anyone to turn to. I deleted the message and didn’t reply. \n\nTo be honest, I didn’t have any regrets and still don’t really. But when I think about things, I sometimes think I was a bit unfair as he was there for me and all my ups and downs at university during our relationship - including a couple of suicide attempts - but I just decided to ignore him afterwards when he kinda called out for help?\n\nSo, AITA for ignoring his message when he was kinda in need? He seems to be doing fine - at least on surface level - since I stalked down an old mutual friend for other reasons but saw him tagged in a fairly recent social media post.",

      "description": "I [22M] have been talking to this girl [19] for about three months now. I started talking to her with no second intentions since she was in a weird situation with her (now ex) boyfriend. We got pretty close rather quickly and talked about a lot of personal subjects, one with which was people we would like to hook up with. She always had someone to talk about, while I mostly listened, since I don't really like talking about girls in that way, so my take was a simple \"I think this person is good looking\".\n\nOur friendship was pretty tight, to the point of calling eachother everyday, sometimes more than once. Plus all the text and silly pictures sending. Our mutual friends think we are very cute together and shipp us a lot.\n\nEventually, she broke up with her boyfriend for good, and we went on a couple of dates and things went pretty well. But as I said, we were pretty close, and she would also talk to me about another guy from her work that she had a few dates with aswell. I have never been the kind of guy to have a date every weekend (because I don't care AND because I'm a social disaster), so I never touched this subject with her. But, last week, I actually got a date with another girl that's my age. As I mentioned before, me and [19F] would call eachother everyday, but since I was out with someone, I didn't reply to any of her texts, so she calls me mid-date to ask why, and I simply say that I'm not home and that we could talk later. \n\nWhen I finally got home, I texted her sorry for worrying her and told her that I was with someone else. She changes completely, giving me short answers and saying good night. The next day she tells me that she didn't like that I went out with someone else and got angry at me for this.\n\nTL;DR: person that never considered me a first option got mad at me for dating someone else, both of us being single.\n",

I was barely using that route and the only reason I ended up at that bus stop is because I missed my bus and had to take a different one and I've never seen this lady in my life, after around half a minute to a minute of her loudly saying it was intentional while I was standing between parked cars to let her pass I ended up saying in a very sarcastic way \"well I'm sorry I didn't hear you walking behind me could you ever forgive me for not hearing your footsteps\" and she passed me just looking all pissed and not replying\n\n\nI mean she was a pretty shitty person but am I the asshole for going after her disability? I mean it is the reason I didn't hear her behind me and she could've at any moment asked me to let her pass, I wasn't using headphones or anything, and I didn't look back once, so I didn't know she was there.\n\n\n\nLady in wheelchair was mad at me for not letting her pass me in a narrow street when I didn't notice she was behind me, and after her bashing me for doing it on purpose I apologized for not hearing her walking behind me.

      "description": "Let me just start this by saying that it's not about looks or anything related to that. I really could care less about your appearance since we all trying to become the best version of ourselves. \n\nI've been working out for about 2 years consistently at various different times &amp; at different gyms. I currently workout at a 24hr gym which I like since I'm a full time student &amp; full time employee it gives me the chance to get a training session at midnight (right after work).\n\nIm not one to fully engage in a conversation since I'm just trying to get my workouts in &amp; I find it to be a waste of energy. If I see someone often enough I'll just acknowledge them &amp; move on with a simple \"what's up\" or just offering a hand if they need it. But I really don't try to talk to anyone for more than just a few mins. \n\nRecently a couple of guys started coming around the same time consistently. Some of them have told me what's up or tried talking to me but I try to end it fast. THE MAIN REASON being is that whenever they use an equipment they don't clean it up or they don't place their damn weights/dumbbells back to their designated area. There are plenty of signs around my gym asking politely about returning or cleaning up after yourself.\n\nTo me the gym has become my temple &amp; I feel like they just disrespect the place. So every time I pass by them I don't even acknowledge them since I don't like to engage with people that don't have common courtesy. If they were to ask me for a hand. I don't think I would be able to help them at all. I'd just ask them if they know how to read &amp; point them to the signs around the gym where it states the gym policy. I just feel like if I help them they will start talking to me which is something that I do not want. \n\nCurrently I am going to switch my schedule to early mornings since spring break starts in just a few day after finals. I want to get my body used to waking up in the morning so I can be more productive through out my day &amp; have a less annoyance at the end of my day. \n\nI asked my buddy &amp; he tolds me that it was kinda of an asshole thing to do so Reddit AITA?

      "description": "In my household, I am typically the cook and cleaner. This is mostly by choice though, as I enjoy cooking and don’t hate cleaning. Also, my wife isn’t the most thorough cleaner. This isn’t usually a big deal, as I take charge of the cleaning most of the time. We have gotten into small arguments in the past about it. If she cleans the bathroom, she will wipe the mirror with a damp rag leaking streaks all over it. I will then tell her that windex works better. She goes off “I’m not an idiot, I know how to clean”, I feel bad, we move on.\n\nTonight, I cooked diner for me and my wife. Nothing special (tacos) but it made a small mess of the kitchen. I clean up after myself as I cook typically, so it wasn’t a big mess, mostly just the grease splatter on the stove top and bits of food here and there.\n\nAfter we enjoy the meal, my wife tells me that she will clean up since I cooked. I tell her not to worry and that I don’t mind doing it. She insist though, so I stay seated and let her. After she’s done, I bring my glass that I was drinking out of to the sink. The kitchen is pretty much just as I expected. Hunks of salsa still on the counter tops, grease streaks all over the stove top, and crumbs of tortillas in the corners. Pretty much just as dirty, just smeared around and thinned out a bit.\n\nI wash my glass, and use the soapy sponge to start cleaning the still dirty kitchen. She comes in and reacts pretty negatively. “What, it wasn’t good enough the way I did it? I tried being nice and you don’t appreciate it”. I tell her that I do appreciate it, and that I just saw a few little things I wanted to touch up. I don’t want to sound condescending, but when you’re explaining something as simple as cleaning a counter to an adult, it’s hard not to sound condescending. \n\nI know it looks unappreciative, but it needed to get cleaned. If I waited longer, the gunk was just going to dry and be that much harder to clean when I did it in the morning. I wasn’t going to say anything to her about it, I was just going to do it myself and get on with my night. This is exactly why I usually insist that I will clean and get it all done myself.

      "description": "Obviously a throwaway but to begin with some background. Tensions have surfaced within the last 6 months between my best friend and I over her drinking and me having given up alcohol all together. I believe she is an alcoholic and needs to get help. I have told her to get herself together over it. Fast forward to a month away from her wedding and I am supposed to be her Maid of Honor. I hosted her bachelorette party and we ended up in a fight after I overheard her talking to someone and badmouthing me because I don't drink anymore. We talked the next day and she apologized, admitted her drinking problem and said she was going to therapy and trying to fix it. Fast forward a few more weeks and my fiance (who is also a groomsman for the same wedding) ends up having to pay $100 extra dollars for his suit vest because he is a bigger size. We did not know it was going to cost this much and we are trying to buy a house so it was inconvenient to say the least. I asked her if she knew it would cost this much and she said she did not. She sent me a picture of the Men's Warehouse brochure saying the vests should only cost $40 for a big and tall. Regardless, we are out the money for the vest he will wear once. It ended in a fight and after a few hours of talking with my fiance we decided to back out of the wedding completely because of the tensions. The wedding is 10 days out and after learning we were leaving the party, another bridesmaid backed out as well because I wouldn't be in it. AITA for leaving because I feel it would be awkward? ",

      "description": " I personally don’t think I’m the asshole, but my other friends do. \n\nSo, I’m a college student and I used to be friends with this person, let’s call her Amy. Amy and I met through mutual friends and we hung out together pretty often. We also had a class together, and we both took a foreign language class. The thing that annoyed me, though, is she would ask me for help with things, and then criticize me and basically say I’m wrong, then complain about not doing well and blame me and the world for not helping her or for being unfair. We also had a group chat with all of our friends, but it was mostly Amy spamming it and complaining about not doing well in classes, not wanting to study, how her sister got a kitten but she only got a bunny, etc. Annoying, but whatever. \n\nThen one of our classes had a paper due, and Amy asked if I could help her. I invited her own to my dorm room, and she brought her ESA animal with my permission. At this point I was already contemplating how to explain I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore, but I wanted to try to help her one last time. That’s when things got really downhill. I regret this decision. \n\nShe invaded my privacy by opening my drawers and making fun of what I had. She made a mess in my room and didn’t clean it up. She would ask for my help then criticize me and whine and make excuses. She started blasting YouTube videos and reading stuff out loud. I told her to please be quiet, that she was irritating me, and I wanted to get this paper done. I really wanted to kick her out, but I knew if I did, she would throw a fit and cause drama, so I stuck it out. \n\nThe final straw was this though: she went to leave, and the RA was in the hall doing things, which she came back in my room and panicked. That was when she informed me that her ESA animal was not supposed to leave her room, otherwise she and I could get fined. She never mentioned this before, and of course I was shocked and very upset. Amy told me to keep the animal in my dorm, then left quickly, so \\*she\\* wouldn’t get in trouble. I’m pissed at this point. I wait a few minutes then text her to get her animal, which she does a few minutes later. \n\nI clean up the mess, try to calm down, and breathe. I wait a few days mulling my feelings over and decide that this friendship would not work. I text her a respectful message stating my feelings and shortly after blocked her on everything. I thought that was that. \n\nBut now my other friends are calling me an asshole because: \n\n“Amy’s always been this way,”\n\n“She has depression, it affects her differently than it does you,” (I have depression also but I don’t use it as an excuse to be rude)\n\n“So many friends have dropped her without warning, she’s bad at social cues.” (In my opinion, if so many people before felt the same, that’s a Strong hint that the problem is you)\n\nShe’s a grown woman. Her behavior was and is unacceptable to me, and the fact that she refused to take responsibility for her actions as well as her ESA animal (and throw me under the bus) only proves my point. \n\nI wholeheartedly feel I am not the asshole, but I just want to be sure. Am I The Asshole in this situation? ",

      "description": "A few weeks ago i decided to go pick up some mexican food at a restaurant i've been going to for years. It's not exactly in the best neighborhood, but it's close to my house and pretty cheap. \n\nWhen i arrived to pick up my food i park my car not directly in front of the place but like twenty or thirty feet away in the main parking lot. I remember i opened my car door and stepped out about halfway while texting on my phone for a minute or so. I then step out of the vehicle and start heading up. My car keys are still in my hand btw. I soon as i start walking i see a woman angrily arguing on a cell phone and walking around the strip center, and a sort of disheveled looking dude squatting next to the entrance to the mexican restaurant, staring at me. \n\nBarely thinking much and looking away, i hit the button and lock my door. As im entering i hear the dude go, in a very snarky tone \"Oh hey hows it going, i see you locked your door and i was wondering if it was be-\" \n\nim now in the restaurant, i grab my food in like 10 seconds and head back out and leave without incident. \n\nI'm a white male btw. I couldn't tell if he was white or hispanic. I only mention this because theres possible a racial element to this on his end.\n\nIt made me think. I mean i usually am always finding my self in class or at work and getting anxious, thinking about whether or not i locked my door. And when im just running in to a place real quick i often only remember to, if i see someone walking about.\n\ndo people really get offended by this? i'm actually curious because i've since noticed alot of my friends don't EVER lock their car doors and it bothers the shit out of me lol",

      "description": "I, my best friend (let's call her N), and our new friend (let's call her A) are rooming together in a college dorm. We made plans to move into a house together this summer. We've, also, made plans on going to an anime convention together and traveling to Japan in the winter together. We always got along. We would shop, watch movies, play games, eat, and so on together.\n\nThis evening, A messaged in our group chat that she's moving back home and returning to her past university. N and I were shocked, especially because she has never expressed a want to return home. She would always talk about how expensive her college was, how uncomfortable she was there, and how toxic her home life was. Now, she told us that she's moving back because her parents are offering to pay for her to return to her old university and she took it. She also said the following:\n\n&gt;**A:** plus you always left me out of everything so what difference does it make. it doesn't matter. point is you were okay before i was here...this is what i want to do with my life. i saw that i don't have a place here and i want to go back and be with my siblings. i leave bc it's fucking annoying how you would act like it was just you two in the room. i pick up on shit and if i'm not given what i deserve i leave...i don't know what you can't see that...none of you get to tell me what i feel. i'm the one feeling it...no i know it's there i see it all the time and i can't stand it so i leave.\n\nShe then told us that she moved here \\[to our current university\\] to be alone. I called her selfish and she said, \"I am. Sad that you couldn't see that earlier.\" N and I mentioned that we took up cosplay to become closer to her. We sit in the living room and invite her to study, work on cosplay, or hang out with us but she refuses and goes back into her room. There isn't anything wrong with that. I'm also introverted and there are times where I want to enjoy my time alone. However, we were confused why she felt isolated from us when she would isolate herself. We thought that everything was okay and she dropped this bomb on us.\n\nShe said things like \"my plans were the same as yours until now; I don't see what's wrong\" or \"life happened.\" She told us that she didn't need our permission or opinion or to discuss her moving back home but the thing is, we were going to get a house together. We'll have to change our plans and I understand that, but it pissed me off how she would brush it off as if her changing her mind on us is something that N and I have to deal with.\n\nI don't know if this extra information about A helps, but she is an Iraqi Muslim and her parents are wealthy and physically abusive to her and her siblings. She's the oldest child, but her father favors her brother.\n\nSo, AITA? Should I have done anything different?",

      "description": "FTP, LTL, please forgive formatting as I don't post on Reddit much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end of September my dad passed away. We have never been a religious family so we didn't have a traditional church service/wake for him. Instead our family and his friends gathered at his and stepmoms house to tell stories and remember him. My brother lives close to them with his wife and two small kids. This is his second marriage (and second family). Brothers wife, in my opinion, is a controlling, narcissistic bitch who loves to play the victim. My first time meeting her was at the baby shower for their oldest. As she was opening gifts, it was like she was taking inventory. Not a smile, not a thank you. She didn't seem happy to be there. She was just taking stock of what she got. My brother had to delete all social media a long time ago because he can't be friends with women. Brother and the oldest kid had to quit Cub Scouts because one of the leaders was a woman and Brother was \"flirting\" (talking to) with her. Apologies, I'm getting distracted by my dislike for this woman... I think you get the type of person she is though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay before the gathering at Dads house Brothers ex-wife comes to dads house to bring their 17 year-old son. Ex-wife loved dad, they had a great relationship. She's come to pay respects to stepmom and bring her son to his grandpas gathering. Ex-wife is very respectful, she knows Brother and Wife are there. She knows how Wife is and stays mainly by the front door talking with me and stepmom. Wife proceeded to lose her damn mind. Apparently, because Brother didn't IMMEDIATELY get up and tell Ex-wife that she needed to leave because, \"It's disrespectful for her to be here when my wife is here\", he must want to go back to her. In Wife's mind, if Ex-wife had any respect or sense she wouldn't have even shown up because Wife was there and Brother is her husband now. Brother and Wife started arguing the minute Ex-wife arrived. When Brother and Wife's youngest kid woke up (he was taking a nap during all of this) an hour later, she hustled him out the door, plopped him in the car, and sped away (getting uncomfortably close to the other kids playing outside) while telling Brother he should just go ahead and file divorce papers. She even said that if they get divorced, Brother is taking one of the kids with him because she doesn't want them both.(Spoiler alert: they're not divorced)  I mean, who says that?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe made my Dads gathering/wake about her and unnecessarily more difficult for my brother. A week ago I got a call from Brother asking for a picture of dad. Apparently Wife is making something for the family members. I'm not sure what it is; I should receive it later in the week. I'm not sure that I care. Brother thinks it's her way of saying sorry for what happened. I recognize that she's making an effort, but AITA for still needing to hear the words \"I'm sorry\" from her? She's never said it. Not to stepmom (who I think needs to hear it most) or to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He still lives with his mother, and according to people who have met him, he doesn’t appear to be a very good person. \n\nShe hasn’t told her parents yet, and his behavior is concerning. She’s talked about how he pushes her boundaries when she’s clearly told him no, then gets defensive when I tell her that behavior like that isn’t good. He’s convinced her to go back to his (mothers) house and they were alone for a couple hours without anyone knowing where she was. He’s been making fun of her religion, and trying to convince her to become atheist. Regardless of the religion issue, I’m worried about the fact that he’s attempting to alter her worldview. He even wants her to move in with him when she graduates, and I think she’s going to, she’s said that she’s seriously considering it at least. \n\nShe has actively lied to her parents about where she is and who she’s with to hide him. She isn’t a very mature person, and is attention seeking. She acts like she’s 10 when it comes to her mannerisms, and is easily manipulated. \n\nMy mother has tried to subtly tell her parents, but they refuse to believe what is going on. \n\nWIBTA if I told her parents point blank what is going on?

      "description": "Sorry for clickbait-y title, this is just bugging the hell out of me. I'll try to make this brief but there's some back story.\n\nI have this co-worker/\"friend\" who is very selfish and irresponsible. Long story short, she doesn't have a car at the moment. This wasn't sudden. She sold her vehicle a couple months ago because it broke down. Ever since then she's been relying mostly on rides from various people, and occasionally a cab to get to work. She frequently asks me because we work the same shift and I live across the street. I take her when I can, but I'm not always home because my fiance and i share a car, and sometimes I have to go to my dads house (close to my job) in order to get myself to work.\n\nTwo things have me kind of done with this situation though. 1. She doesn't make a plan for how to get to work. She starts looking for a ride like an hour and a half before she's supposed to be there. Every day. 2. She knows she will have days she may need to take a cab, it happens at least once a week. Yet she sets no money aside for this. If she just couldn't afford it I would understand, but she straight up admitted to me she's spent almost $1k on weed in the last couple of weeks. I'll spare you the rest of the details here, but she overshares daily so I have a good idea of her financial situation. She could have saved some cab money, she just didn't want to.\n\nAnyway, yesterday I was at my dads before work. She texts me like usual and i say i can't, I'm at my dads (she knows my situation there). She says she's screwed because no one can take her and she has no cab money. Here's where I feel like an asshole. I could have woken up my dad and asked to use the car to go get her. I just didn't want to because he would be annoyed about it, and i would have to rush to get ready and drive all the way across town to get us both to work on time. I'm done putting myself out just to bail her out of shit she could have prevented. Unfortunately, this meant that our boss had to work a double shift, about 14 hours. \n\nI feel bad, and sort of responsible for our boss having to work such a long day. I could have at least tried to help. But at the same time this is a frequent situation, and i have helped many times. If it were truly not preventable I wouldn't hesitate to help any time I could. So, AITA? \n\nTl;dr Irresponsible co-worker didn't plan for a ride. I didn't help because it would have put me out. As a result our boss had to work 14 hours. ",

      "description": "This is a lighter post obviously but it annoys me when people are clearly wrong about obvious things. But it also annoys me when people pick useless fights so i probably fucked up, lets see what you think.\n\nMy grandpa is an old man in his mid 70s. In general we get along very well. He likes westerns, i like westerns, so one day we started talking about the movie 'Tombstone'. Spoilers below.\n\nHe is convinced that Doc Holiday lived through the movie. \n\nDoc Holiday clearly died in said movie. Bedridden and dying of TB, he tells Earp to go on and live without him, then repeats his final line \"This is funny\" then breathes his last breath and stares blankly into the camera which fades out. These were the real Doc Holidays last words and manner of death.\n\nMy grandpa is convinced that he lived in said scene, stating his eyes never closed and references an earlier scene where Doc runs out of bed to help Wyatt. This is an earlier scene, yet he thinks its after the previous scene and that Doc lived to the end.\n\nI show him Doc death scene and the wiki page on the real Docs death and his last words. His response is \"WELL SO WHAT, ANYONE CAN SAY ANYTHING.\" which makes zero sense.\n\nI am pretty worked up and press him about it and he says \"I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IVE SEEN THE MOVIE.\" I respond \"IVE SEEN THE MOVIE TOO AND HES DEAD GRANDPA!\"\n\nI then challenge him to watch the movie in its entirety but he just throws up his arms and yells \"FORGET IT\" like im being unreasonable.

      "description": "My brother and I share a 1 bedroom apartment, with a less than ideal floor plan. He is set up in the bedroom, where the bathroom is; so when he is using his room, I can't use the bathroom. And I am in the dinning area, which is open to the living room and kitchen; so I have no where to be alone. I also work from home, and am a homebody in general, and hardly ever leave the apartment. We have lived like this for about 3 years, and it's been rough, but doable.\n\nRecently he started dating a girl he met through me, who I have been friends with for a long time (which is wierd for me to begin with), and they have been making out and having sex during the day when I'm home, and I can hear it, and it makes me super uncomfortable. So I talked to them about it, told them I was uncomfortable with them being affectionate around me, but that I don't mind if she is here just to hang out. And after some convincing, they agreed to be more considerate and not do that around me.\n\nWell about a month later, they start doing it again. To be fair, they don't come here as often as they were before, but she has her own room, and a roommate with a 9-5 job, and it's only 7 miles from us (close in L.A. terms). So there is no real reason for them to be here, other than conviniece. They even work together doing event hosting, and her house is closer to work. \n\nSo I talked to them again, this time a bit more forward and assertive, asking that they refrain from making out at all or having sex when I'm around, and they argued that I was being unfair, and nobody else would care that they could hear people making out. And they claimed it's too inconvenient to use her place, even though I said that I don't care if she stays the night here, or what they do once I'm asleep, I just want them to go to her place during the day if they want to fool around.\n\nI feel like I've been more that fair with the situation, and that they aren't considering how I feel. But maybe I'm being selfish and just need some perspective?",

Which includes paying for my internet.*\n\nNeedless to say Im angry. He asked me once to improve being on time, however *everyone* was sick for a week. (My mom even said \"she felt like she was actually dying\") and I wasnt waking up till 12 to.1 pm. No one was. And Im expected to go within a day from waking up at 12 to waking up at 8.\n\nThats nearly impossible for me. I make habits easily and its hard to break them. I'm also eating terribly because I was so sick. \n\nHowever I set double alarms and started going to bed early. Mind you I was \"better\" by Wednesday. And thursday I was up by 9:30. Still not good enough. So dad blocked my internet. But I pay for it. \n\nSo now I'm fighting with them nearly non stop. I'm not even truly trying to. A great example is I asked for a chunck of time that I wouldn't even be home in to be unblocked, so I could upload a video to YouTube, and my dad had to literally start screaming at me. \n\nMy whole family is angry at me and saying Im being a bully and a jerk for arguing so much. I just want my internet back. I paid my rent and I dont care if you want to punish me for being late, just dont mess with things I paid for. ",

      "description": "Mobile yaddah yaddah format wtv. Basically this is a long story and I’m very lost about how to feel right now. \n\nMy girlfriend and I got together junior year of high school. Her parents are very strict and she’s technically not allowed to date boys, despite her doing so since middle school. \n\nFlash forward to the end of our first semester as freshman at our respective colleges (7 hr drive away). At the beginning we were ecstatic because we could now video chat with each other and see each other everyday. I thought things were great, since I could now see her everyday, even though we couldn’t physically be together. Since both of us were fairly out of state and loved each other, we decided that I would take a greyhound to visit her for the weeklong thanksgiving break. I buy the tickets almost immediately after confirming with both our parents to get the cheapest price. Things were going great the entire semester and we got more and more excited about the trip.\n\nNovember rolls around, and she starts to really feel homesick. She wants to go home but insists because I already spent the money, that I should come anyways. After a 13 hour overnight trip I get there. She seems cold the whole time, and admits that when she’s with me over break, she feels guilty about not being with her parents and she’s homesick as hell. I’m not too close to my family so I don’t understand how she feels but I try to console her. I tell her that we’ll just have to make the most of what we have. She feels guilty if we sleep in the same bed at night so I sleep on the floor of my other friend’s room (with a blanket as a mattress). She’s really close to her family so this is all well and fine with me. I love her and was glad we spent the time together anyways. She enjoys it as well, just gets remorseful later at night when she calls her parents.\n\nRoll through to winter break. I’m not back home for various personal reasons. On the second week of break she breaks up with me. Not because of anything except that she hated lying to her parents back home about dating me. She felt guilty because she always promised them that she wouldn’t be with anybody until she got a college degree. She still wants to be friends though, and it makes a lot of sense to me. She’s even ok with fwb, which makes me happier, sure. \n\nJanuary rolls around. I realized how hellish my life would be without calling her my baby everyday so I block her for the rest of winter break (my first bad decision I know). Through a mutual friend, she tells me to unblock her. I do so reluctantly thinking that if I see her I’d cry. We video chat once and it’s awkward as all hell. We have awkward talk like this for a week. \n\nAnother week later our mutual friend tells me I shouldn’t have to talk to her. Mentions how she has a tinder and shows him all the matches she got. I get angry. Obviously there’s a reason that we broke up and I confront her about it over video chat. She says she’s using tinder as fun, wants to see what kind of pick up lines ppl are using. I fucking lose it here. I hang up on her and tell her I don’t want to see her doing things like that. I block her again and tell her not to ask to be unblocked. She tells me she “made a good friend” on tinder.\n\nCome a couple weeks later to the end of January. I miss her. I miss her like fucking hell and my life sucks without her. Come crawling back and asking to be friends again. She tells me that I didn’t indulge her when I tried to be friends with her, so she won’t indulge me. I tell her how I wanted to be friends again before tinder, but she won’t have any of it.\n\nReddit I feel bad. Was I justified in getting mad? Do I deserve not having her in my life? I want her in my life and I should have trusted her way more than I did. I should have taken her word that it was for fun right? AITA?",

While in college the 3 of us were in and out of relationships, and each time Joe had a new girlfriend I had hoped this was it. He would become single whenever Laura ended a relationship in hopes of them getting together. Joe would constantly talk to me about Laura, the majority of our conversations were about her. \n\nYears passed by and Joe got married. I thought his crush was over, he stopped talking about Laura. Laura got married &amp; Joe was silent on the topic. Until Laura announced she was getting a divorce. Once she made this announcement Joe started talking to me again about her constantly, even said he was thinking about getting a divorce from his wife. \n\nWell, he tried getting with her and she denied his advances again. He ignored this, and still felt that eventually she would return his feelings. \n\nLaura started to date again and began a new relationship with Dave. \n\nJoe was extremely pissed off that she started to date someone new, our conversations were all about Laura and how much he thought Dave was wrong for her. \n\nAt this point Joe’s behavior was annoying, but it wasn’t worthy of dropping him completely. \n\nI had invited friends to my bachelorette/bachelor party (my fiance, &amp; I had one event to party together w/ mutual friends before our wedding), &amp; Joe ruined the night for me. Laura &amp; Dave were there, which made Joe upset. Joe got drunk, &amp; even drank the majority of the punch bowl full of mixed drink we ordered. Once he was properly drunk he stole my husbands seat and just continued to bitch to me about Laura and Dave. It was miserable. I was trying to talk to my other friends, but he kept dragging me back in to his conversation. Meanwhile Laura and my husband saw this happening and called an uber for him and forced him to go home early. \n\nAfter that night he did apologize, but he only apologized to me after Laura forced him to. After his weak ass apology he continued to talk about Laura and how Dave was a douchebag and wasn’t good enough for Laura. He also started to say some crazy things that I know didn’t happen. He claimed that he had been having sex with Laura, they were meeting up on the weekends (weekends I spent with her and her daughter). He claimed that they had talked about moving to another state together and start life anew, but he was having a hard time totally convincing her. At this point I just let him type these kinds of things out and I was just reading them and not responding. And I continued not to respond and ended up closing my computer and did something else. \n\nI let Laura know the kinds of things he was saying, she ended up blocking him on social media with one last message. I didn’t block him, but I just stopped talking to him. He only tried to message me once since then, and I didn’t respond. ",

      "description": "I have a friend who I never particularly liked.  I am female he is male.  He used to be super possessive over me and I had to talk to him about it. Once he even tried to kiss me while I was wasted knowing I do not feel the same about him.  I have had plenty of conversation about my feeling towards him.  I have since moved away from him and continued a phone friendship as it was harmless but now he keeps making comments on how he loves me. (He has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend). On the phone all the does it talk about how he cheats on his girlfriend and how he wants to “fuck”.   I honestly just don’t care anymore.  I recently got a job and I am in school full time and this year I have had a lot of projects. Well a month ago was the last time we talked. I told him I’d get back to him when I can. He didn’t last three days before calling me again.  He knows I hate talking on the phone in the first place and refuses to text me.  I will admit I became super angry when he didn’t even let me have a few days before calling me again.  So I didn’t answer.  Since then he has called me almost every day since and I grow increasingly angry at him. I know I should tell him how i feel but does one not get the fucking hint?  We are in our late 20s-early 30s. Why does a friend really need to talk to someone that much?  Am I wrong for ignoring him even though he’s possessive and creepy towards me?  ",

Typically, I'll let it slide the first few times, and make gentle suggestions (\"look up for the pass\")or give direction through encouragement (\"press up on the three, he can't get around you\"), everyone makes mistakes. However, when someone repeatedly makes the same mistake multiple times in a row (see definition of insanity), I have started to voice my frustration with them. For example, if you're too tired to play defense, then go home. Don't sit there and not guard your man, every loss leads to a minimum 1-2 game wait. If you can't dribble well, stop trying to drive into 3 defenders so you can get stripped every time. If your man just hit multiple threes, stop sagging off during the game winning shot.

I mentioned that a year or two ago, I was open to lower paying, less demanding jobs a lot more. However, now that I graduated from school and am paying my own bills, I realized it's important that I make more money (than I initially was okay with). I was talking about my long term goals. My boss then asked me if I was talking about this job, to which I replied yes since this was my first job and one where I was developing my personal finance skills more. I was trying to say that this job helped me grow up a bit.\n\nAfter that, he said \"I am sorry you feel that way.\" I was a bit confused, and now I'm concerned that he felt I was complaining about my pay/job. I in no way wanted to imply that. I've talked to my friends, who say I shouldn't apologize and bring it up again and to just let it go. What do you think? Am I overreacting?",

      "description": "TL:DR My Step-Grandmother prevented me from seeing my Grandfather on my moms side for the last six years of his life and dad says i'm being an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it's not really my grandmother, it's my step-grandmother. I've never known my real grandmother on my mothers side because she died before I was born. I really looked up to my Grandfather. When I was 11 years old he gave me his 1950's 3/4 sized Gibson acoustic LG3. He taught me my first chords on that guitar, taught me how to take care of and tune it. It was a pretty beat up guitar but it worked and sounded amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandfather is one of my biggest role models and heros. He was a musician and grocery store owner. He brought frozen slushies to my town at the grocery that he owned and operated in the 1960s. He started one of the biggest Canned Food drives in my town the same year, and it's a food drive that is still going today despite the grocery having been bought out and turned into a big box grocery store. Truly an amazing man, and I'm lucky to be his Grandson\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this woman (lets call her SG) prevented me from seeing my grandfather for the last six years of his life. Six years before my grandfather died I was arrested for felony marijuana distribution and jailed for ten days. I got out on bail and over the course of the next few years I dealt with the legal struggle until finally pleading guilty to felony possession. During this time when my family would normally go to meet my grandparents (holidays, birthdays, etc.) my mother was told by SG not to allow me to come over, she didn't want a \"Dangerous Felon\" in the house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time my grandfather was already in pretty bad decline. The last time I saw him (before my arrest) he had difficulty getting out of bed. He was kept on numerous medications for pain and other issues that I have never been made aware of. So if I tried to go over and see him I would have to go through SG first. She would lock the door and changed the key so that I could not come in with my mothers key to their house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here is the kicker. SG is a huge hypocrite because she used to smoke pot. And apparently a lot of it. I am not aware if she still does, however I doubt it. This is confirmed to me from my mother, her sisters, and her step-sister. According to these sources she is also heavily addicted to oxycontin and several other pain medications, and has been regularly using it for many years, well before my arrest. (My speculation is that she also used with my Grandfather, which may have led to his rapid decline; however I have no proof.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know how or what they said, but my mother and her sisters fought for me to be aloud to attend his funeral. Since that day SG has contacted me a total of two or three times in three years - to ask me what my sisters would like for Christmas. This past year she contacted me to ask about what my mother would want for her birthday several months ago. I have never responded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - My dad tells me that I'm in the wrong because she has tried to reach out to me several times, and that I should let bygones be bygones. He says maybe she wants to apologize, but I highly doubt that she even realizes the depth of how I feel, or that she even knows that she should to apologize to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been nearly a decade since I last spoke to my Grandfather.",

Each lab must be completed in the alloted time, there are no makeup labs since we are seniors and we should know how to do this. There is somewhat of a language barrier between us students and the TA who is from another country she will be called \"sam\". Usually we are in groups of 3, 1 CSE student per every 2 EE Students. I am a CSE student, lab is 1 hour and 30 minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was snowing so my lab partner \"sue\" would not be able to make it on time, which is ok since she made arrangements with the professor since she is a commuter student who lives a hour away. My other lab partner \"tammy\" was already in lab about 15 minutes early and texted me asking where I was and if I was going to show up. Sue is friends with Tammy, I am friends with Sue but don't really know tammy. I told her I was printing off my lab report and would still get to lab early. I get into lab and can tell that \"tammy\" was in a bad mood, she was talking with another student about how useless the TA is and how she already knows everything without her help. I stay quiet when she gets like this because I don't share the same feelings about the TA as her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe TA was going to start class at 2:45pm when the normal start time is actually 2:50pm, \"tammy\" loudly interrupted the TA to tell her that she was starting class to early. The TA apologized and said that she was confusing this lab with the Tuesday lab she also runs. \"Tammy\" then says \"fucking dumbass\" under her breath.  I asked \"tammy\" if she looked over the prelab or any of the handouts since she was on our shared computer. She said yes and that the lab would be ok. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce lab actually began \"sam\" the TA went over the general instructions of the lab. I kinda understood what she was saying but she has a language barrier. We were to outline code in assembly, make a flowchart and then pick up where we left off in the next lab. So this would be something that I as a CSE student would quickly write out and then we could both work together on a flowchart to represent what the code is doing. that is not what happened. All we were programming the microcontoller to do is a simple \"dead man switch\" which is sometimes used in industry. While a button is pressed send a signal that the button is pressed, if the button is not pressed cut the power.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drew up a simple flow chart so that I could see how I was going to assign inputs and outputs to certain registers in the microcontroller. I asked the TA if the flowchart that I had was logically ok, she said that it needed some work but that I would get it. \"tammy\" made another rude comment about the TA and decided that she would write the program in C since this microcontroller can be programmed in assembly and C. But that is not what the lab required, I told her that and she got nasty with me saying it was too hard to do it in assembly. She waists about 15 minutes before she gave up. I told her to scoot aside and I would begin to write it in assembly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got everything addressed and was beginning to make logical statements to test the input of the button, but she wanted to test to see if the addressing scheme that I made would compile. So I attempted to compile the code but it gave us an error. I was going to ask the TA why I was getting an error but \"tammy\" told me there was no point that \"sam\" was an idiot who was only there to suck up oxygen. I stayed silent and scooted over and \"tammy\" deleted all my code and began to code everything in C again. \n\n  \nWhile she was coding in C she kept getting compiler errors and I would tell here \"your missing a bracket here\", \"thats not how you use that comparitor\", \"you cant use \"else if\" if you arn't doing another if statement\". she told me to literally \"shut up and stop\" because she knew how to code C, which she clearly could not. So me being me I stayed silent and then when she gave up I attempted to code it in assembly again. there was only 5 minutes left at this point. I asked her to pull up the assembly cheat sheet that the professor gave us and she did. \"tammy\" was really helping at this point because of time but we ended up literally not getting anything done at all because of the errors we were getting. Every time the TA came over she told \"sam\" that we were fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSue finally got to lab at this point but we only had 1 minute left. \"tammy\" left the lab and as she left she said \"sorry i was such a bitch\" I kinda just nodded and then I asked \"sue\" if she wanted to stay and work on the lab since the other lab for the class is right after this lab. \"sue\" agreed and we began to work, because of the weather most of the second lab didn't show up so we stayed in that lab. That's when the TA came over and asked why we were still in the lab. I told her that \"tammy\" was not in a good mood that day, and that we got nothing done. Sam was shocked that we didn't get anything done because \"tammy\" kept telling her we were doing fine. I told the TA that Tammy was trying to program it in C and deleted my assembly code and the second time I was writing the assembly code it wasn't working. The TA told me \"of course it wouldn't work, in the next lab we will actually set up all the other registers that are required but arn't in this lab. This lab was to get you to just write up assembly code to see how well you remember it. It was not going to Compile until next lab.\" I was so mad at that point because if \"tammy\" let me ask for help it would have been explained better that the introduction since the TA has a language barrier. The other groups left so fast we couldn't really ask others for help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the TA allowed Me and Sue to stay and finish the lab. We took about 10 minutes writing all the code and showed it to the TA who then said everything looked good and then let us leave. As we were leaving the professor stopped by and asked if we could talk with him before class. Class is right after the second lab group is completed. When we got to class Sue and I spoke with the professor outside the classroom. He asked us what happened in the lab, I only told him we were having some issues. He then said \"thats not what I meant, What happened in the first lab.\" at this point Tammy came out of the classroom and was standing behind the professor and I was looking at her and said, \"we were unable to do it because we were not working well together and \"tammy\" wanted to write the program in C and wasted so much time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Prof. said we could go back to class but wanted to talk with \"tammy.\" I have no idea what the Prof. said to \"tammy\" but she was crying and had a breakdown and then stormed off. After class Sue and I asked the Prof. if we could still work with \"tammy\" because we felt bat, He told us he would give us 1 more chance before he would just move sue and I to the second lab so Tammy wouldn't hurt our grades. He also said that tammy agreed to let us share the work more and not take over and would work as a team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTammy wasn't kicked out of class but left on her own. She kept texting us \"what the fuck what the fuck\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to \"sue\" it is totally tammys personality and mental state to cry and have a brakedown. But I feel so bad about her crying, If sue and I had just left at the end of the first lab we would not have had this happen. We would have probably gotten the assembly code done really quick in the beginning of the lab next week. I admit I was also in a really bad mood because how much time we wasted but I have no time outside of school to work on a lab because of my job and i'm not going to let my grades slip. I also should have spoken up, but it isn't really my personality and i'm afraid of girls (engineering student).  AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " At my school the are 2 high level math classes, they are the excact same course taught at the same time and since there are too many students to fit in 1 class we are separated into 2 classes taught by 2 different teachers.\n\n  We have all of our tests simultaneously, but the teacher for the other class has been consistently allowing her class to use a full page cheat sheet whereas the standard for the entire school is a quarter page unless it's an exam, including my math class. This inherienlty provides a unfair advantage to the other class while writing the same test as us.\n\n  The reason why this hurts my class is because of a complex scoring system used in universities which incorporates your avg, based on the avg of that particular course which would incorporate the other classes avg and since there avg would theoretically be higher because of a longer cheat sheet the people in the other class would have a higher avg and a higher of the above mentioned score well we are almost guaranteed to have a lower score.\n\n So I decided to email my math teacher (on our day off) and ask if there was a specific reason why we had a smaller cheat sheet then the other class and that it was unfair, but at no point in that email did I suggest the other class's cheat sheet be shortened.\n\n The next day (today) we have our math test and our teacher makes no anouncement, but in the other class there math teacher says that because someone complained (which lays the blame squarely on me), starting the next test everyone in both class's is restricted to a quarter page cheat sheet. My classmates figured pretty quickly that it was me who caused it. Now everyone from that class hates me and thinks I'm selfish for doing what I did and that its unfair to them because we have a better teacher. What's worse is that people who dont like me are using it as an excuse to insult me more then usual, I dont retort these insults because I dont want to hurt peoples feelings even if they are mean to me, I much rather my feelings get hurt and make them feel better about themselves, then to hurt theres , it's just not in my nature.\n\n I've tried appealing my teachers decision but he insists I did the write thing and that the other teacher should be listening to the whining of the students, and that she should have never given them a full page. I dont regret my decision because of the outcome it lead to but I do regret it because of all the backlash I've received, because in the end both our classes have the same odds of doing well or poorly on our various test.\n\n  It should also be noted that I'm  mediocre in math atm.\n",

However, one time when I was forced to six next to him, I didn't simply feel like talking and just listened to music. \n\nThe music I was listening to was not very PG - like to say the least .

      "description": "Long story short: I rolled my eyes when I thought neither of my parents could see me. I didn’t notice him in the next room when I did it, and he threatened to cut me off financially and kick me out of the house if I did it again. I’m 17, almost 18.\n\nContext is that we were all preparing the house for a surprise party. My dad is notorious for saying that we should prepare weeks in advance, but he does everything last minute. Plus, he expects everyone else to do the work while he sits down and moves maybe one or two objects. \n\nAnyway, my dad was expecting the house to be immaculate. He wanted the doors scrubbed down, baseboards re-painted, windows washed, etc. I was already stressed, because my dad had given me three simultaneous tasks to do, and my mom called me to do yet another task.\n\nWe can’t say no to our parents. Period. You only say yes sir/ma’am or you get punished. I was annoyed because I had so many jobs to do, and knowing I couldn’t tell my mom I was busy, or that I would get to her task later, I rolled my eyes in frustration.\n\nMy dad caught me doing it, and he told me if I ever did that again, he would take all his financial support away from me and kick me out. I got intimidated and did what he asked of me. But looking back on it now, I think he was overreacting.\n\nWe could never show displeasure in our house. We had to smile and nod to whatever they said. Anything outside of that was met with corporal punishment. If we were mad, sad, or upset, we had to express it quietly and in private, otherwise, our parents took that as “back talk” and we’d get spanked. When we grew older, it shifted to threats of taking away support. Ever since I rolled my eyes, he makes me stand in plain view when he asks me to do something so he can read my expressions.\n\nAITA for thinking my dad was overreacting?",

      "description": "This requires a bit of context but I'll try my best lol. There's two friends here, I'll call them Rachel and Lily. Rachel has been one of my best friends since sophomore year in HS and Lily and I became pretty good friends senior year, but those two were super close too. These friendships carried on into college and they met some new friends with people on their floors and this group of 10ish girls would party together, go to football games together, etc. This group includes Rachel's roommate.\n\nAfter a night of partying, Rachel was going to one of the girls' dorms where they were all were. (Rachel stayed out later). She opened the door, and out of nowhere, one girl started going off on her while everyone else, including Lily and Rachel's roomie, just sat back in silence and let it happen. The girl accused her of \"shit talking\" everyone (it was like tiny complaints that aren't worth making a big deal over) and exiled her from the friend group. Rachel was hurt that no one had talked to her reasonably before humiliating her in front of everyone while she was drunk and couldn't comprehend the situation.\n\nRachel was the most upset about Lily who was her best friend out of all of them. Lily is the one who Rachel would go to when she had complaints about someone, meaning it was her who ratted her out. After all of that, Rachel texted Lily who said she didn't want to be friends anymore. She and the group of girls continued to shit talk Rachel and made her feel horrible.\n\nI was there for Rachel, took her side, and supported her whenever she wanted to rant. I'm not a confrontational person so I didn't call Lily out but I made it a point to keep my distance from her. Rachel's roommate still remains super close friends with Lily. There are also friends of ours who have stayed close with Lily and while it makes her upset, she never calls them out.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, all the drama happened 4 months ago, which is the last time I had spoken to Lily. I was at Starbucks doing homework and I got up and I see someone waving at me, it's Lily. She's a very enthusiastic, high energy person so she goes \"Hi I haven't seen you in forever I miss you so much I love you!!!!!\" I'm the type of person to match people's energies (if that makes sense) so I go \"omg hi!!!\" I give her a hug, compliment her hat, and then carry on. The interaction lasted 10 seconds. I felt weird being nice to her but would feel even worse if I ignored her or was mean when she acted so excited to see me.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but Rachel's roomie told Rachel about the interaction and now Rachel won't talk to me. The only reason I know she is upset with me is because she keeps posting passive aggressive things on her finsta story about being upset with someone and I wasn't invited out with her and our friends last night so I'm putting the pieces together myself.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "My mother called me up a few days ago to lecture me about my vibrator. Apparently she found it in my drawer and threw it away when I was staying at his house during the weekend. She was being quite demeaning, showing her disapproval at the \"morally bad\", \"horribly pink\" toy. I hung up on her after asking her sarcastically \"What century is this?\"\n\nAfter the call I told my boyfriend what happened immediately, to which he replied, \"I don't like vibrators either.\" \n\nI was initially confused by the awkward reply, and then got annoyed because he was being tone-deaf. I pointed that out to him, then he basically just repeated what he said \"I don't think there is anything wrong with you owning one, it's just that I don't like them.\"\n\nTo me he chose the worst time to share his preferences for sex toys, since I was expecting him to take my side on the modern women's sexual liberty versus traditional parents, etc.\n\nAfter trying to explain to him why his reply was uncalled for, he simply told me that he didn't appreciate being the target of my anger become my mother was the one that started it all. So I rather begrudgingly dropped the subject.",

He got there, it ended badly and he came home. He told me what happened and asked me to forgive him.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and last night I find out he's still talking to her.

My boyfriend (32M) and I are looking to move in together as the next step in our relationship after I finish my degree next month. We recently discussed what we want our living situation to be. We have talked about it before and was always under the assumption that we'd buy or rent a house somewhere close to both our parents to be able to visit them regularly.\n\nLast night, however, he expressed wanting to keep living in the house his parents currently live in. The house is really big and could potentially be split up into two houses with some renovations. However, I don't enjoy the idea of living with my in-laws. I expressed this to my boyfriend and he in turn called my irrational.\n\nNow I understand that financially, living in that house would be beneficial. Eventually he would also inherit the house. But I fear it might take a toll on me. Instead of merging both our lifestyles, I feel like I'd have to completely adept to their way of living. If arguments happen, it would likely also be their family against me alone. I fear it will be emotionally stressful. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting our own place even if it costs us more money? ",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry at my gf and hanging up on her?",
      "description": "So bit of a backstory, I’m a 23 years old male and my gf is 23 as well. We’re both on our last year of college and we’ve been together for 4 years, we were even about to get married but called it off for now because of money/college issues. Her college is out of the city she normally lives in (which is where I live as well) so it takes me 5 hours to get to her and 5 hours to get back each time I want to see her and unless it’s the midterm/finals week I usually go to her place every weekend to stay for the weekend and return home. This semester of college, my schedule is a bit fucked up so my school starta at 8 in the morning on my mondays and ends at 7 in the afternoon at my fridays. This makes it so that I can only go to her on saturdays and return 1 day later on sundays. Which means I spend around 10 hours on the road in 48 hours to be with her for 24 hours every weekend. I’m telling you this because these numbers are important.\n\nI never whine about this or resent her for this since she did the same things for me on our first year but we decided that it’s better for me to go to her being because of me being male and all.\n\nAnyways back to the situation. This week our female cat got in hear for the first time, she lives with my gf as she was a present from me for her. Anyways she’s in heat but also it turns out her fur is somehow full of lice as well even though she never leaves the house and we had her get a lice bath (or whatever it’s called) from our veterenarian. I tell my gf to go back to them and get our cat shaved there and etc.\n\nShe gets the lice situation done with no problems on last saturday. But since Bubbles (our cat) is in heat she tells me that the cat is screaming and meowing like a maniac and she couldn’t sleep the whole night. Cue the same thing happening on sunday as well. So it’s monday now and she was able to sleep like a total of 8-9 hours when Bubbles was asleep as well.\n\nNow to the problem:\n\nI told her that I can come over on Monday and stay and look after Bubbles till Wednesday so she can get her sleep and relax a bit she says that it’s not necessary and she can handle it.  I ask her again to make sure and she says you don’t need to come over again. (Note that she’s not doing this for me to not miss out on my lectures because my lessons and at 12 in the morning on mondays, my tuesdays are empty and my lectures start at 5 in the afternoon on wednesdays so I could go to her and back without missing anything) Ok, so I’ll see her at saturday right? WRONG.\n\nToday at 2 PM she messages me asking if I could come over. Now, this is really fucky because I don’t have a car and I use a ferry to go over the sea and then get on a bus to get to her, Next ferry is leaving at 4 PM and it takes me an hour and half (if I’m lucky) to get to the ferry. I have 2 hours to take a shower, get ready to go to her, pack some clothes and make it to the ferry which is impossible. Next ferry is at 7 PM so I can make it to that one but what’s the point then? I get on that ferry and I’ll be at her place at 10 in the evening. I’ll need to be back before 5 PM tomorrow so I’ll be going over there to be there and look after Bubbles for 11 hours.\n\nI ask her why didn’t she tell me to come over when I asked her and she says that she thought she could handle it and couldn’t and says that she thought I could just come over to her and drop by (the fuck?). I’m getting pissed now but not saying anything about it I ask her why she doesn’t ask some of her female besties (that she always goes on and on about) to come over and look after Bubbles while she sleeps. Them coming from 10 mins away to help her out when she needs makes more sense than a guy coming over from 5 hours away right? NOPE!\n\nShe laughs at my ‘stupid’ suggestion saying ‘why should they do that?’. I’m beyond pissed at this point and finish her sentence saying ‘when you have a dumbass like me who can come over from 5 hours away whenever you like right? It’s not like I have a life or fucking plans or anything nope! I just have to come over anytime you ask even if I offered my help before and you refused it. You’re right why would you trouble your precious friends when you have a stupid fuck like me on a leash who can do whatever the hell you want whenever you want right?’ And in between my sentences she’s saying no and it’s not like that and shit but of course I’m not believing her because why would I? So I say I’m hanging up and end the phone call right then and there.\n\nThis happened like 4 hours ago, I KNOW I’m not the asshole here but for some reason it’s eating away at me so I wanted to ask what everyone thought.\n\nSorry for the long ass post, I probably could’ve cut off some of these but I’m kinda agitated right now so... yeah. Also, I’m writing this over the phone so sorry for the shitty formatting and thanks in advance at anyone who takes the time to read this and reply, even if they decide that I’m the asshole.",

She did this because I live in a really religious community, and having sex before marriage is a big no no.

Obviously this ruined the rest of my high school years. I had no friends. My life was ruined. \n\nAfter high school I left and moved 4 hours away. I deleted all social media, made new accounts with no high school followers, and started over. \n\nAll of my new friends know nothing about this. When asked about how high school was or if I have any high school friends I simply just say “I was weird in high school, kind of lonely. Didn’t talk to anyone” and end it at that.\n\nIt’s been a couple years, and I’m in college. I recently had a girlfriend (we just broke up) for several months and I never told her anything about it. She wonders why I am so secretive about my past, made new social media, etc. \n\n\nSo WIBTA if I never told my future girlfriends about this? I don’t want to risk it.

He also has been treating our little circle of friends awfully and tries to play it off as a joke when everyone well knows that there was no joke behind it.\n\nHere’s where I question whether or not I’m an asshole: I am have another friend who has been desperate for a date and he treats me how I should be treated. He’s really nice and we would be going just as friends. I just don’t know if I would be an asshole for switching dates especially because my current date and this new date are good friends. I just need some perspective. ",

      "description": "My roommate and I had an unspoken agreement that we are sharing snacks and stuff that we bought for our apartment. This worked out fine at first, but I eventually kept coming home to my candy wrappers all over the place and whole bags of candy missing from the drawer. The part that especially annoyed me is that some of the candy that was missing was from a store close to my home town, about an hour away, that my mom was buying for me. I told her that that was mine and I’m happy to share other candy, and she got defensive but eventually agreed. The other day, she got a bag of candy and I said “oh my favorite” and she said that it was for her only. Flash forward to yesterday and I realized that an entire bag of the special candy was missing which really pissed me off. I moved the rest of the candy to my bedroom because I don’t want her eating anymore of it. I know we said that we’d share food, but AITA?",

He then states he could have gone pro but decided not too. Instinctively I scoffed and said “ right why get paid millions of dollars to play a game when you could be a cashier at Cabelas.” She immediately gave me a death glare and said why do you have to do that! as if I was calling her a liar, and we proceeded to have a awkward first 15 minutes at the gym.

      "description": "So my heater died. On 11/13/18 I signed an invoice for a new one to be installed. Which included 3 rebates for a total of $1650. It was installed improperly 11/15/18 and had to be fixed on 11/16/18. On 11/15/18 the installers backed a truck into my house ripping the gutter off the side. After contacting the owner he sent someone out to repair it. On 11/19/18 They basically bent it back in shape and wrapped some sheet metal around it and put some rivets in it. It looked like garbage and I send pictures to the owner. Who proceeded to make fun of me. I pressed that I didn't have a bent gutter before the install I shouldn't have one after. On 1/5/19 the gutter was 100% replaced properly. I was withholding payment until my house was fixed. I told them to make sure I don't go into collections, which I got calls that they were about to send me to collections and I stated you guys hit my house and haven't fixed it. \n\n\nFast forward till now. I'm still waiting on 2 rebates because they filed them improperly, missed the deadline on one and have to wait until April for them to file it. Meanwhile this extra $1650 has been sitting on a credit card racking up interest charges pretty much negating the rebates I have been waiting for. \n\n\nI've been trying to give them time and room to breathe to get this all cleared up but at this point I'm highly annoyed and want to blast them on social media and Google reviews. But don't want to mess up the chance of getting the $1650 I'm still owed. \n\n\nIs from 11/13/18 up to today's date of 3/20/19 an acceptable timeframe to get a job completed?!?!",

      "description": "Background info: My ex tried to use me for money, I broke up with her but continued to be in my sons life, she tried to not allow me to do so, we went to court and I have my son every two weeks on the weekends. I am not a deadbeat dad, I pay for his daycare and clothes. I’m not complaining about doing these things but I just want to show y’all that I do take care of my son. \n\nProblem: I had an extra day off(normally I work 7 days a week) and wanted to spend it relaxing, I took this day off because i was burnt out from working morning and nights every single day. I posted something on my sc along the lines of “first day off in a couple of months, gonna enjoy this”. 30 minutes later my ex shows up, son in hand, convo goes like this \n\nEx: “I want you to watch Neal”\nMe: “is it an emergency?”\nEx: “No, ___ invited me to hang out” \nMe: “You can’t take him to daycare or take you with you?”\nEx: “I saw you were available so I decided to drop Neal off to you”\n\nWe argued for a bit and she ended up taking him to daycare. I pay for daycare for this reason, for her to have a safe place for him when she cannot watch him. I offered to have my mother watch him(I live with her because I’m saving for a house), she declined and wanted me specifically to watch him. I told her I couldn’t because my mind wasn’t right and I didn’t want to yell at him unnecessarily(terrible 2’s are a thing). Any other time I would’ve taken him in a heartbeat, but he shouldn’t have to be stuck with a grumpy dad. \n\nI’ve been getting hate messages from her family/friends about how much of a bad dad I am, I’m an asshole, don’t deserve my son, etc. \n\nTell me reddit, AITA? \n\n\nTLDR: I was burnt out and grumpy from work so I took a day off, ex tried to get me to take my son outside of our schedule, I said no, and am now getting hate mail.",

Instead he used it for a different family matter. \n\nI am upset. Because a) he did not inform me about this change in plans and b) I told him multiple times specifically to pay the bill to get his heat back. \n\nOk so I feel he misused the gift I gave him. I feel he was wrong for that. I feel he should return the entire amount to me instead of half the amount as i originally stated when I gave him the loan. \n\nSo am I the asshole for thinking this way?",

      "description": "Happened a few months back, we dated for 2 1/2 years got engaged, I was getting out of the military and decided to stay in the area because it was close to her parents and career. So I bought a house with my gi bill, she was paying the utilities. About three months into the engagement she mentions that shes been thinking about not wanting kids. We had discusses everything before we got engaged so I was a little shocked. We decided to see a relationship counselor to figure it out. I got busy with work and school and never got around to finding one myself.\nWe went on a trip to see my parents and after that it seems like she starts compartmentalizing herself from me, wasn't really sure to do because I didn't know anyone in the area besides her and her family so I just hoped she would figure it out and maybe it was just pre marriage jitters. We sit down and talk one day and she tells me she doesn't want kids, and brings up a slew of relationship problems she has with me that she never told me before. \nI tell her she has to figure out if she wants to stay engaged or break it off, she says she wants to break it off. I went out on a walk to figure it out in my head because I cannot believe what just happened. I got angry and went back to the house almost shaking, tell her she has to figure it out now. She says she wants to break it off so I told her to \"Get her shit, get the fuck out my house I don't want to talk to you again\" She had two weeks and move out while I'm not home. \nAbout sums it up, just wondering because about a month ago I got a message from her calling me a piece of shit for kicking her out and not helping her through the break up.",

      "description": "INCREDIBLY long post inc. TL;DR at bottom.\n\n  \n\n\nTwo years ago I 'met' this guy, we'll call him... Duncan. So I think it's important to know that Duncan and I have never met in person, but we did always intend to.\n\nAnyways, we hit it off great. More than great. We'd talk on the phone before work/uni and also sometimes during lunch if we were free, then after work/uni we'd call again for a little while. We talked about anything and everything, felt like we could confide in each blah blah and we listened blah blah whatever. So he confesses after a few days or a week and... ok. I reacted in an arsehole-like manner. I basically told him that I didn't think he had feelings cos we barely knew each other blah blah. He was hurt and I didn't really realise at the time but I guess from there things went a bit downhill.\n\nHe started to reply less, and then would not reply for days at a time. Honestly I get that people have lives but the dynamic between what we were like before was too great for me to just, not be hurt by it I suppose. We'd agreed to stay friends and stuffs, and both at the beginning were very honest with one another. Blunt honesty, cos that's what we liked I guess.\n\nSo I could understand if the reason he didn't reply anymore was for wanting to move on but he never said so and rather agreed to be friends and to be there for each other etc.\n\nSoon he stopped replying altogether. I got incredibly anxious that I had done something wrong, and he'd just disappeared without a trace. I sent him texts explaining that basically, I really don't like being treated like that (ignored for days at a time and not a sound until I message again days later), because it just makes me feel... not worth someone's time I guess, and that I'm going to keep off messaging for a while. He does reply to this, but I didn't want to go back and forth so I just left it.\n\n  \n\n\nEventually when I message him again, he doesn't reply. So it's my fault, right? I get it. I apologise over and over, but he was gone by this point.\n\n  \n\n\nI don't get attached easily, but when I do, I get attached hard. So this plays on my mind constantly until I sum up the courage to message him maybe a few weeks later. He replies, and accepts my apology. We talk again but... It's the same. Ignored for days and feeling like I can't say anything because I'm worried I'm spamming him. Instead of running away this time, I tell him I'm anxious that I'm bothering him, that he finds me annoying, that I'm spamming him etc. Keep in mind, I only texted the guy a couple of times maybe every few days....\n\nSo nothing changes and I call him out on it. Then again, silence.\n\nThis scenario I believe happens one or two more times afterwards (yeah I'm a sucker for punishment). Now at this point I guess you guys are wondering why I'd be friends with the guy again even after ghosting me like 4 times. Well... I am naive. And though it's my fault I'm extra forgiving to those that I've been attached to, the point of this is to know if I was being an arsehole about it along the way.\n\nSo 6 months later after the last ghosting, I get a text from an unknown number. \"Hey (: hope you're okay.\" Well, who else could it be but our favourite ghost Duncan.\n\nMy first response is to ask why he is bothering me blah blah. He's telling me how he found my number on his old phone, and I'm telling him he's a douche and I have no idea what he wants from me after every time he's just ghosted me.\n\nHe tells me he has no one. He tells me he's really low. Do I bite the bait? You betcha I do. Hook, line and sinker. I apologise for calling him a dick and pointing out all the times he ghosted me and treated me like I was invisible, and said he'd do xyz but never did. I apologised because suddenly I felt bad for him.\n\nWe talk and he promises never to treat me like that again, he says all this stuff like how he's so happy to talk to me and such. How he won't just ghost me, that he'll show me his efforts and blah blah. I cared and wanted to be there for him but whaddya know happens? After one day of actually feeling like we were actually kind of friends, he shits on me again.\n\nA girl (his neighbour's friend) had shown interest in him and wanted to head over to his, he agreed, but she never shows. He talks to me about it, and I try to give him other points of views to consider, and told him he should text to see what's happening.\n\nHe says \"The reason (she isn't here) is a waste of time. If she wanted to be here, she would be.\" So I try to convince him to just give it a go, you know, how communication and honesty is important? Especially considering he kind of wanted to try a serious relationship with this girl. But silence.\n\nSo when our next conversation occurs, I call him out for just going silent again. I told him how it felt like he just picked me up when he needed me (to rant) then threw me away when he was done. I told him he was selfish in the ways he was acting, and that he still has the same traits, the things he told me he wasn't gonna do anymore. I told him that the reason he lost everyone was because he does things like this to people who care about him. I was just so done.\n\nHis reply was, to all the above, \"You're wrong but okay then. I wish you well, bye.\" Then blocked me. And that was it. The friendship he so apparently cherished was this easy to snub.\n\nSo was I wrong to call him out and confront him, or was I the one overreacting? Was there really any other kind of reaction that this behaviour warranted?\n\n  \n\n\nTL;DR: Guy I considered a good friend ghosts me 4 times, comes back a 5th time after 6months of NC telling me he has no one, I bite the bait and then he continues to treat me like I'm non-existent. Now gone again (but this time he actually said bye).\n\n  \n\n\nSorry for the long post, I'm terrible at writing.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\nSo some background here: \n\nMy older sister is 24 and lives across the country. She decided to move across the country after she had a meltdown and was hospitalized a couple of years ago. I have been putting a lot of effort into our relationship, calling her at least 3 times a week in hopes that she’ll pick up the phone, always making time for her when she calls (about once a month) etc. My parents still pay for her car and health insurance, and she is using a car that is technically theirs, so it’s not like she’s financially independent. She’s an alcoholic and an addict. She says she’s clean now but she has a history of lying about it. She has used meth, coke, heroin, crack, and pharmaceuticals. \n\nThe real story:\n\nMy parents and I came down to Florida to spend the holidays with my grandmother. My sister came for 2 days around Christmas. She could have made more time to be around family, and my parents were paying for her to fly down. She also lied about why she could only spend 2 days down here. I decided that it was her choice entirely that she wanted to spend little time here, and if she really wanted to spend time with me she would have come for longer.\n\nI did some stuff with her, but I also spent time with my mom and dad without her for the first day. She started to get offended that I was not going to great lengths to spend time with her. I didn’t know this until she started lashing out at me. My sister was belittling my anxiety and panic attacks, saying that other people that she knew had bigger problems than me. I explained that I’m diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and how it’s not about the amount of problems, it’s about brain chemistry. She still wasn’t very supportive of me and wasn’t a good sister.\n\nShe knew that my grandmother and I haven’t been on the same terms for a while. My grandmother is extremely racist and narcissistic. She has also been talking about me behind my back to other friends and family members. My sister would loudly say things about being worried about my alcohol consumption, and how she wishes I called her more often when I was sober in earshot of my grandmother. I don’t call her when I’m drunk or after I’ve smoked a j, and these are things that happen maybe once a month anyway.\n\nIt all came to a head when I decided to talk to her and see why she was being such a bitch for lack of a better word. I was really calm at first and she and I talked. She said it hurt that I wasn’t spending a lot of time with her and she felt like I wasn’t being real with her. She asked me why I’ve been so anxious and I told her that I recently got raped and how it really has been fucking with me. She knows that it wasn’t the first time and she proceeded to tell me that it wasn’t that big of a deal, and that it has happened to a lot of people, and that it wasn’t the first time it happened to me so I should know how to deal with it better. I ended the conversation by saying that I don’t want to talk to her again and telling her to not bother calling me. That night at dinner I didn’t say anything and she left for the airport at 3 AM. \n\nI know that she hasn’t had the easiest time with things, and I’ve tried to be understanding, supportive and love her unconditionally, but after that interaction I decided that it would take a lot on her part to get me back as a friend and sister. My family is really big on supporting each other and understanding that we all make mistakes. I don’t want to overreact, but I think a lot of her recent decisions and actions are unacceptable. WIBTA for cutting her out of my life?\n\nTL;DR My sister has been having a hard time with life recently, but belittled my issues, tried to make me look bad in front of my family, and hasn’t been putting effort into our relationship, WIBTA if I cut her out of my life?

      "title": "AITA For Not Apologizing for My Friend’s Broken Phone Even Though I Paid For It, and It Was Kinda Her Fault?",
      "description": "So I was in high school one day in my engineering class, and I got to work on a project with one of my best friends.  The project was to build an original Rube Goldberg machine. While we were thinking of ideas, I picked up a PVC pipe and started talking.  While messing around she playfully tried to tug the pipe out of my hand.  I tugged back, saying “Quit it” because I was already in a work mood and didn’t really want to mess around.  She tugged back, harder, and when she did, I lost my grip around the pipe and since she was pulling so hard, she fell back.\nI started laughing, as one normally does when their friend makes a sill mistake, but what I didn’t know was that her phone was in her back pocket, and she landed on it when she fell. The phone had some pretty large cracks, (which made sense, because she didn’t have a screen protector and she is a little overweight) and it was not turning on.  I was still laughing from the fall, and I said I would pay for the phone no problem ( it was a Samsung Galaxy S5) and that period I was met with strings of curses and insults like, “Go **** yourself”.  Throughout the rest of the day, whenever we passed, she wouldn’t say anything, and would just give me a cold stare.  \nIt has been 2 days since the accident and she still has not talked to me and I have paid her $80 of the 200-300 that I owe her.  Yesterday, I found out that she was talking to my other friends and acquaintances, and trying to convince them that I pushed her/threw her phone, none of which I have done.  When I talked to said friends about it, they said, “you should go apologize to her” and I told them no.  They told me that was f***** up and that I should be ashamed of myself.  \nI feel that I have been nothing but respectful (minus the apology) while my friend has been nothing but cold and immature.  I don’t think that I have to kiss her a** since she told all those lies and I’m in the middle of paying for it.  Was not apologizing really that bad??",

      "title": "AITA for dating my ex girlfriend's best friend?",
      "description": "I'll just jump right in with a bit of background with a TLDR at the end. \n\nI was dating a girl, we'll call first girlfriend (FG), for about two years in high school. It was my first really serious relationship, and it seemed like we really fit together. Both of us were really happy for the first year of the relationship, and then things started to get a little rocky.\n\nIt's important to know that I am a year older than FG. This and some other personality things contributed to a dynamic where I would sometimes end up being her counselor listening to her problems and helping her work things out. Yes, sounds like a normal relationship thing, but this was to a point where it was becoming unhealthy for both of us; I'm a high school kid, not a trained counselor, and it was a lot of emotional stress for me. It also didn't get her the help she really needed, and so I pushed her to getting set up with a real counselor. As beneficial to both of us as it was, FG was still hurt because it felt like I wasn't there to listen to her as freely.\n\nOver the summer between my junior and senior years, FG came out as a lesbian. Up until that point, we were both bisexual, and naturally this was the end of our relationship. I was heartbroken, but we both agreed we wanted to do our best to stay friends, because there were still fond feelings. From my perspective, she moved on a lot faster than I expected. Hanging out after the breakup, she would talk about new crushes while I was still trying to get past having had strong feelings for her.\n\nAbout a month and a half after breaking up, I was feeling much better about the situation. Having her talk about other people, as painful as it could be, pushed me to move on faster than I might have otherwise. I ended up having a pretty major surgery the month before school, and to keep me company while I recovered, a mutual close friend of FG and me came over frequently. We'll call her best friend (BF). \n\nAs you can already guess, BF and I kept getting closer until we ended up a couple. There was no mean intent or desire for revenge on FG, the circumstances just pushed BF and I to realizing that we had a lot in common and things happened from there. We knew it would be hard for FG that we were together, and tried to respect her feelings, but we also weren't going to deny that we had feelings for each other. \n\nFG, as you might imagine, ended up very upset. She said it came from a mix of feeling like I moved on too fast and feeling hurt that I was dating her best friend. I genuinely feel bad for upsetting her, because I still care deeply about her, but I am also very happy with BF and feel like it's unfair to expect us not to date for her sake. FG also feels hurt that she is no longer as important to me, like I'm shutting her out because I don't spend as much time counseling her. \n\nAm I in the wrong to be dating BF?\n\nTLDR: I'm a guy, my first girlfriend came out as a lesbian and we broke up, our mutual best friend came to take care of me after surgery and I ended up dating her.",

      "description": "It’s important to note that I already have 2 cats and live in a small one bedroom apartment.\n\nSo my girlfriend found a cat in the dumpster at her work a couple days ago. She always has cat food in her car ever since she saw a homeless cat in her neighborhood while driving. So, she leads the cat in her car with the food, gets it to her house and sets it up with food and water.\n\nShe starts sending me picture after picture, this cat, she thinks is a boy, is actually really nice, rubbing up to her, butting his head against her, and is really calm. They go to the vet and the little guy isn’t microchipped. I say they can go to a local animal shelter, which we both can vouch for (it’s a no-kill, very good turn around kind of place, it’s actually really really cool of a place), but she’s worried about who might adopt him. \n\nNow a day ago she texts me and says her mom has a proposition for me. They will pay for everything (equipment, vet visits, food, etc.) if I keep the cat. My girlfriend (who lives with her parents) says she’ll stay over to help introduce to my own cats, and other stuff. Her mom thinks they were meant to find this cat and they really love the cat but can’t keep it because they have dogs and also a cat, and apparently it would make her dad go ballistic. \n\nNow I don’t want another cat. The second one I got reluctantly, which of course turned out good in the end, but this time I did not want another one. She might be here for a week or two to help, but after that it’s on me (she otherwise only visits after work for a couple of hours or sleeps over on the weekends on occasion).\n\nSo I text her.\n\nMe: So listen, I really don’t want to hurt you or your mom’s feelings but I really don’t think 🤔 want another cat right now\n\nHer: Okay.\n\nMe: I’m sorry\n\nHer: I posted about him. (She posted a nice Facebook post about the cat and asking anyone if they wanted him because they had no other options (even though there’s still that shelter).)\n\nMe: Yep, I see it. Looks good 👍\n\nHer: Okay.\n\nIt’s been awhile and she hasn’t texted me back, even when I asked if they considered that shelter, so I assume she’s mad at me for not taking the cat.\n\nIt just seems to me like she’s acting a little childish that she couldn’t keep the pet she found. I know it’s sad, but it happens all the time and there is worse places for the cat to go, again, this shelter is amazing and I have no doubt he’d be adopted in a week with his personality. But I digress. Reddit, AITA?",

At the beginning of this year a new kid had arrived, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. However he kept making racist remarks and do very creepy things, so I was never friends with him. However my friends took a big liking to him to my surprise. I'm not one to tell people who to hang out with. But for the last 2 weeks it seemed like they would rather hang out with him than me. So last Friday I decided to not talk to them anymore and not explain to them anything until they talk to me first. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "For more background, I dated this person for a month before he decided he didn't want a long-term relationship. Which sucked, but I was fine with it so long as he wanted to continue a friendship with me. So after giving myself some time to put any romantic feelings to rest, I asked him if he wanted to hang out in a more casual context. He didn't respond for a day, which was unusual for him, so I got worried to a point I thought he was in the hospital or otherwise in danger. But when I eventually messaged him on Facebook to check up on him, he left me on \"Seen.\" Twice, in the space of about twenty minutes. Which pissed me off, because I'd left a voicemail detailing that I understood if he didn't want to see me at all anymore, so long as he responded that he was, indeed, not hurt or in danger as I had worried he had been. Which he ignored, as I did not receive any sort of confirmation that he was okay before he left my Facebook messages on \"read.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize now that I'm being ghosted, but I don't want to take that lying down after he had promised me that a friendship between us was important to him, and that he did care about me as a person. I hate the whole culture of ghosting people instead of being forward and honest about why you don't want to be in contact with them anymore. And I'm pissed off enough about this whole ordeal that I want to confront him about it in person, but the only place I could reliably see him is at his workplace. And I am already aware that I will be told to just let it go and cut my losses instead of dragging this out further, but that's not why I'm here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be the asshole for confronting him at work about how he's ghosting me?

I also have another friend, M, who does track who is more like BFF too. They both try to pressure and guilt trip me but I usually don’t fall for it. I’m so close to telling her to stop being like that and calm her out for it. Today I went out of MY way to run an extra 3-4 miles with another track friend(A). It was super fun. This other track friend we will call A, A agrees that what BFF and M is selfish.  A is a long distance runner and is good at it. She helps give tips and stuff for running which is awesome in my opinion. I’ve been going through a lot at home recently and BFF has been really pushing my limits these past few days.

      "description": "A little backstory: my son's father (who we'll call R) and I split in 2015 over a lot of reasons not necessary to go into here. Shortly after the split, R was in a DUI accident with our then 1.5 year old son in the car. I lawyered up and was granted temporary custody and have remained the custodial parent for the past 3 years with no financial help from R at all. \n\nR still has parental rights to our son as well as court ordered visitation, however due to the nature of his charges, he was only granted supervised visits. I tried to take on most of the supervision, but during times that the tension was high between R and I, my mom or his aunt would step in to keep things as calm and civil for our son as possible. \n\nR has been flaky and inconsistent since the very beginning. Even with his choice of supervisor, he has never once used all his visitation time (2 days per week) and has often gone weeks/months without even texting to check on our son. At first, I was entirely too lenient. I would offer rides. I would cancel plans last minute to accommodate visitation. I would wait for hours for R to show up... And then I finally came to my senses and decided that R needs to figure this shit out on his own. Uber is cheap. 24 hours notice is not too much to ask. Either arrive on time or reschedule. It's pretty simple. I don't fuss anymore or remind him or even really try now and honestly... I'm a less-stressed parent for it, my son has adjusted well without his dad and there's significantly less/no tension when visits actually take place. But now that my leniency is gone, visits don't happen much. \n\nR has seen our son of his own choosing 7 times this year. He's going on three months absent right now. Didn't try to see him on Halloween or Thanksgiving and rescheduled Christmas plans. R hasn't actually spent more than an hour tops with him and the shortest visit was actually 15 mins. I can tell our son doesn't care anymore... I haven't heard him say \"Daddy\" in at least a year, maybe longer. He shows no affection towards his dad or excitement since he's there. This isn't just around me or anything... Other people supervising say the same. Our son just doesn't have a relationship with R anymore.\n\nIt scares the shit out of me that if something were to happen to me, R still has legal rights and would get custody.. R has still not gotten his life back on track since his DUI. He's failed multiple drug tests while on probation and we're suspicious that he's abusing his and his gf's prescription meds. He is living in a trailer that is not safe/not up to code. Has yet to keep a job longer than a month. And has offered nothing in ways of support besides, \"hey you want half a box of pull ups? [Gfs kid] outgrew them.\"\n\nI have no idea how to actively go about terminating R's rights.. And feel a good deal of guilt for wanting to do it. I already feel guilty enough for not being able to work things out with my son's dad... I never wanted my son to have the childhood I had with an absentee father. Am an I asshole for wanting his dad out of his life completely? ",

All of her posts are in the same vein as her bio, with tags like #fetish or #dirtyroleplay. Again, she's 17.

      "description": "**Summary:**\nSo I go to a private school for kids with certain behavioral or mental issues, and this school had done me wonders for a few years. The problem about this is that it’s located at a city infamous for gangsters and and an overall rude atmosphere. Today, my classroom was getting extremely loud and uncomfortable and I didn’t want to be involved in it. The more obnoxious peers seem to single out students who are better behaviorally, and today I was technically the target. After smoke seemed to have settled and some students left because it was near dismissal time, there was one more little jit being obnoxious around me and I couldn’t handle it anymore so I called him out. He started to brag at me about me being “autistic” and certain things I said that wasn’t meant to hurt anyone. This was my limit, so I instantly rocketed off my desk and started attacking him. After being separated, the teacher (Who was just as fed up with these students as I was) confronted the other kid telling him that he kinda deserved it. One thing leads to another and the kid had to be manhandled. As much as I felt happy, I feel really guilty for getting physical in the first place. Like before, there was a bunch of these kids and he was basically friends with a lot of them. Also, I got scolded for laughing at the whole thing like it was a joke. Was I the real dickface in this situation?\n\n**Extra Info:**\nThrough the years being at that school, I felt like I’ve changed for the better and I want to return to my regular school. Kids like him and the usual support these people received held me back because I’m an outcast compared to the rest. When I first came I was in a class that would usually be around physically or mentally disabled peers, and I guess that’s how I got such a bad rep where I am now. Maybe I shouldn’t have a voice.",

He smokes like a chimney (and smells like it) and constantly has a \"smoker's cough\" and sneezes 2-3x per hour. Whenever he sneezes, he sneezes INTO HIS HANDS and will not wash them before then touching shared equipment (keyboard, mouse, etc.) If we have food catered, he will eat over the equipment and then LICK HIS FINGERS before then touching the equipment. There are other examples but I think you get the idea. Again, this is on a daily basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to share a workstation with this guy and I find this behavior disgusting. I am the only one who has to use this workstation with him. Other coworkers will witness him doing this and make faces or laugh, but because it's not \"their workstation\", no one cares enough to say something. Management doesn't care unless he were to actually break something, which he hasn't done. I have said something to him to please clean up/stop EVERY SINGLE TIME I see him do this, as I am often seated just feet away and I can watch him working. Despite my revulsion, I began by asking politely. He responded politely at first, as well. However, this behavior has continued for months, and I have become less and less polite each successive time. It has gotten to the point that the issue is starting to affect our working relationship. He now responds sarcastically and acts like I am being an asshole for asking him not to lick his fingers and then touch our shared keyboard. I have taken to carrying Purell wipes over to the workstation and wiping everything down before using it and avoiding contact with him. So, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for locking my mother out?",
      "description": "Basically me and my mother have a dysfunctional relationship to say the least but its 'ok' because she works a lot and I'm ready to go to bed by the time she comes home so our interactions are at a minimum most of them time. Anyways, she doesn't have consistent hours and ends up coming home anytime from 6pm up until 1 am and so I never really know when she comes home but for the past two days she's been coming home at midnight. Now there are a few things i should mention before i carry on: A) We live in a flat which has a buzzer system, B) I'm in my final year of sixth form and for the past week or two I've been working exclusively in my room as it's the only place in the flat where i can actually get some work done, C) when I'm not listening for it I can't hear the buzzer from my room but if I'm in the living room i can hear it as clear as day and D) we only have one key for the building door (that i usually take because i come home a lot earlier than she does) but have separate keys for our flat door. So today I'm working in my room like any other weekday and i get a call from my mother asking me to let her in, so i go to buzz her in and then I get more than an earful (to put it lightly) about how she's been outside buzzing for ages. I then suggest to her that if she doesn't let me know when she finishes work she could always send me a message so i can listen out for the buzzer and well... she didn't like that. Apparently I'm being very pretentious, entitled, stupid and lacking of any common sense and I honestly can't see why. Her arguments were: E) After an entire day her battery is on a low percentage so she cant call me or else she risks her phone dying, F) I should move to the living room when shes about to come home and G) I'm being very selfish for asking that of her when I could simply come to the living room when shes about to come home. My rebuttal? E)Surely if she can conserve her battery over the hour and a half journey it takes to come home from work, surely she has enough battery to send me a simple message saying \"im coming home\" and/or she could tell me her work schedule before hand so i know when to expect her. F) I can't do this unless 1, she tells me her work schedule or 2, I stop working at home (previously when i spent my time working elsewhere she accused me of lying and then proceeded to prohibit me from going to Pret). G) I'm striving for the most efficient method that works for the two of us, how is this selfish?  She then went onto ask me an array of rhetorical questions about who pays the bills, what the power dynamic of the household is, why I'm being so disobedient in the eyes of God and why she should be made to suffer in the cold while i enjoy the comfort of a warm house but I don't see why my suggestion is so offensive. Anyways, the first parents evening of the year is happening next week and she promises me that my evil nature behind closed doors will be exposed.  She has also taken the key for the building door despite the fact that I get home earlier than her because I \"deserve to be stuck in the cold\" to know how it feels and I'm stuck thinking there's no way I'm thinking straight, i must be missing something. I've probably forgotten something so just ask if you need more info.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I didn't hear my mum ring the buzzer for the building door, i suggest she may want to message me before hand so that i can listen out for the buzzer. I'm essentially told that I'm an asshole for even thinking this because I'm shifting the blame on her and not doing anything to fix the issue on my part. Am i actually the asshole here?",

      "description": "I will try and keep this story very mutual as i understand you are only hearing it from my side of the view. Some history about me, I have had some very poor relationships and I know I am not the perfect guy, however I am 'too nice' sometimes which makes people walk all over me. I had a job where I didnt require a place to live due to excessive travel. It was a wonderful job and I unfortunately got let go. This amazing woman let me move in with her and her family and she has really been there for me when times are tough. I had enough money to get my life back on track and within one month of living at her parents with her I got a car, job and an apartment. I got the apartment in my name because i have been through a relationship before where things ended up not working out and I was screwed. I guess you learn from your previous relationships. She helped me move into my new apartment along with helping me buy new furniture and she came with me to purchase my new car. She has really been there for me. She immediately moved in with me and I could tell after a month she wasnt that comfortable. Maybe it was because of the drastic change from her parents? or maybe it was because we moved towards the big city? I still will never know but I could tell she was very uncomfortable. \n\nMy wake up costs are nearly $3000 dollars. Yes i know this sounds like a lot but my new job was paying well. Rent $1650, Car $400 with insurance, Phone bill, other bills, student loan. Yes it comes close to about $3000 dollars. Insane right?\n\nWell fast forward 5 months later, I asked her to help me out with rent even if she could pay me $500 and possibly groceries. anything as this point because it is very expensive for me to be paying for both of us. She works full time 40 hour weeks. She makes about $3000-$4000 per month before taxes. She would never help me out!\n\nIts getting to a point where I am coming off as a dick now because she is not helping me pay the bills at all, and i keep confronting her. Her excuses make me even more upset like how she said she pays her sisters gym pass and she doesnt even go. how does this effect me or even us? One of my friends asked if she splits the rent (idk why he asked but i was standing right there) She blatantly lied and said yes she helps a lot. I confronted her about this, she still just plays completely dumb about it and tells me she has no money and comes up with excuses where her money goes. \n\nI cant keep doing this. I told her 'love' isnt enough to keep this together if she wants to be in a relationship it needs to be made together it feels very one sided right now....  It just sucks because im not that kind of guy that would just end it based off something like this but enough is a enough.\n\nSo everyone... AITA??\n\n",

      "description": "Bit of context. \nEveryone mentioned is either 20-21 male\nThis is an alt because the guy that's getting the birthday party knows my main. \n\n\nOk so me and 3 of my friends decided to surprise our best friend with a birthday surprise party. It's not much of a party we're just inviting him for dinner , getting him cake and just celebrating a friend's birthday in a less-crazy way.\n\n\nOur families are all middle-class. but 2 are a bit high up there. \n\nM (Me) , BF (Birthday friend) F1 ( Friend one) F2 (Friend 2) , F3 (Friend 3) \n\nWe tried asking BF where'd like to eat just like always but he asked us to agree on something and tell him. \n\nI asked F1 , F2 &amp; F3 and they said the same thing. \n\nI started naming random restaurants for everyone privately , like I would send them private DMS and gather responses. Everyone would agree on except for F3 because it's a bit expensive for him. \n\n(Keep in mind F1,F2 &amp; I) knew that he'd have a little trouble with money so we told him that he doesn't have to pay 1/4 out of BF meal nor buy him a gift or anything. He'd just have to spend money on UBER &amp; food he'll eat at the restaurant. \n\nWe named like 10-20 restaurants and he'd always say no either because they're too far or expensive. \n\nWe named the cheapest good restaurants (even burger places that are a bit more expensive than fast food restaurants) just for him to come with us and celebrate. He said that none will work.\n\nThe next day I told him to name restaurants that he'd go to and he literally said \"I don't care,you guys pick and tell me\". I told him that we agreed on like 15 restaurants and he rejected all of them. He shouted at me \"I already told you I don't know and I don't fucking care dude\" then he said \"Let's just cancel this and make it next Friday\". \n\nI was really pissed. We gave him the option to choose and he rejected then he'd ask us to cancel our friend's BIRTHDAY celebration. I told him \"hey If you don't want to hang out it's fine just tell us from the beginning instead of wasting our time We have a lot of planning in a short amount of time\" I then stopped asking him where'd he like to go and just excluded him from the plans.\n\n\nI feel bad that hey he doesn't have a lot of money ATM and I should respect that but he should also respect that it's a friend's birthday and it's only ONCE a year. Not something that we can cancel or delay. We tried cutting as much as possible for him without us extra paying. We only have a certain amount of money to spend on ourselves+ the fact that everyone of us is paying 1/3 for our friend's meal, 1/3 friends cake &amp; 1/3 of friend's gift. \n\nso AITA? \n",

      "description": "So this girl and I have been friends since high school, we bonded over 1D and Little Mix, and we lost touch for a little while after she graduated. When we started talking again she had a toddler and now she got lucky with twins. She's in a stable relationship that has a stable income and she always wanted kids, so I'm super happy for her! The problem is that she won't stop talking about her children. Yes, I get it, they're your kids and you love them, but stfu about them for half a second. I'll be telling her that I'm not feeling good and I don't want to talk right now and she'll tell me to go babysit her kids (for free!) cause that'll make me feel better. I know it's a joke, but she knows I don't like kids most of the time, and as I don't know hers and I don't agree with the way her and her SO are raising them, there's no way in hell that would ever be funny. And she knows that. \n\nLast week I kind of snapped. It was a build up of her ignoring my requests to stop talking about her kids when I'm in a bad mood (whether that means mad or sad or anything that means I can't just send her supporting messages while she discusses how tired she is). I was in a certain amount of pain and she kept repeating \"oh I get it, with the 3 demons around I'm constantly aching\" or versions of that and I just snapped. Idk what happened, but I told her something along the lines of \"You know we used to be friends because we had things in common, now we're friends because you have no other old friend left because you keep talking about your kids all the time. Having kids doesn't make you special and it definitely does not allow you to compare your pain - which is caused by your choices - and mine - which is due to a chronic pain disorder that has been ruining/controlling my life for the better part of 3 years.\" She told me that was harsh and unfair but I just told her that I had repeatedly told her to stop with her kids and her comparing her kid-related problems to my health problems. She told me I had been rude about her kids for a while now and that I should just tell her if I didn't love them. So I told her that I had never met them and that I don't like kids, \"do the math.\" She called me an asshole, I didn't respond, and we haven't talked since.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My husband and I have been together for 17 years or so, married 12-both 41. His family is in another state so I only spend time with my MIL for maybe two weeks out of a year. She is an amazing person, so warm and caring and considerate-I’m very lucky. He comes from a religious very family oriented situation, while I grew up in a very fractured dysfunctional family, never talk about your feelings or anything real. My MIL has always tried to connect with me via emails and phone calls, and always says ‘love you’ at the end of our interactions. \n\nI appreciate this and it means a lot to me, but I can’t say it back and I feel shitty about it. I don’t say that easily, because I need to really mean it in my bones if I do. I’ve had some fairly traumatic situations with two different stepfathers and though I know an in law isn’t the same, it does still feel a bit like having family foisted on me again that I didn’t choose. I logically understand that by choosing to get married, I’m now part of his family, but due to my crazy past that just doesn’t mean as much to me as I wish it did. I’m kind to my MIL, I thank her for kindnesses and do my best to connect with her, but I just can’t bring myself to say ‘love you’. \n\nI’m not even sure I don’t, I just don’t feel comfortable saying it. But-i know it would make her so happy and it’s just a few words that aren’t completely untrue. Should I just say it back? AITA?",

She invited me to get together at her house. She said those girls are also invited. I refused and told my friend that I never want to see those girls. \n\nMy friend called me childish and petty. She said that happened so many years ago. Everyone has grown and matured.

We both work retail so we don’t make a lot of money.  We have been splitting groceries 50/50 as well.  \n\nMy problem with it is two fold.   1st.  When I work I don’t pack my lunch/dinner.   I tried for a while, but having that break/s with my work friends at a fast food place is nice.  I enjoy the time.  Also Nothing I or the gf made tasted anywhere near as good as fast food.   I think I have a trashy palette or something.   So 1-2 meals a day I am eating out instead of groceries.  \n\n2nd is that my gf refuses to shop at Save A Lot or Aldis.  She buys a lot of Whole Foods and Wegmans.   She says it’s just much better quality.   She’s not wrong, but for me the quality is not worth the mark up in price.  \n\nShe’s pretty sensitive about her weight.   I have no idea how to bring this up without it sounding like I’m saying something else.   I’m really not though.   I just want that extra money I would save if we bought our own groceries.  ",

      "description": "Okay my wife and I currently own 1 vehicle but both need one in order to get to work. For a while we only needed one as I was working from home but that changed late last year. We have been borrowing a truck from my father in law for the past few months but that is only a temporary solution and he told us in January that we needed to start saving for a vehicle. He gave us 6 months of use of his truck and then he is going to need it back.\n\nAbout a month ago, my father in law approached us and told us that he had found a car that he felt we should purchase. Its a 2004 Cadillac DTS with 88,000 miles on it. Its not currently running as it has a blown head gasket, that we know of, but my father in law can fix that. He's worked on cars his whole life and is not worried about the repairs, but there will be additional cost to get the vehicle in working order. At the time my wife and I didn't really have the money to purchase a car, especially when there were potential unknown costs to fix it. We both were also imagining an old boat with a bench seat in the front and the ability to fit a smart car in the trunk. Not something either of us wanted. So we said no, but he went ahead and purchased the car for $600.\n\nMy sister in law and her boyfriend have been living with my wife and I for the past few months because they were unable to afford moving into a new apartment when their lease ended at the end of last year. They have two cars, her Prius which is newer but has quite a few miles on it, and a POS Honda Accord coupe that he purchased a while back. When I say POS, I mean it. The entire roof is falling apart on the car. It leaks when it rains, etc. There are definitely issues. Last month when she heard that my wife and I didn't want to buy the car, she decided that she wanted it to replace the accord that she drives. She called her dad and told him she wanted the car.\n\nMy wife and I recently found out that I am going to be getting an extra paycheck next month which is significant as I get paid monthly and this would allow us to go buy a $2000-3000 car without much issue. This past weekend my wife and I went out to visit my in-laws and my father in law told us to take a look at the car. Turns out it is much nicer than we originally thought and something that we probably should take advantage of.\n\nWhen we told my sister in law, she lost it. Balling hysterically, stormed off, and hasn't spoken to us since. That was on Sunday. Admittedly, my wife and I do feel guilty for originally saying that we didn't want to purchase it, but I also feel that we need a second car and they do not. We can afford to purchase a car, they can not. They cant even afford to get an apartment on their own and my sister in law has no means of paying for the vehicle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre we the assholes?",

I get the Number of the janitor who trained me and I text him “hey BROTHER, this is D I just wanted to let you know this is my number if you need anything you can contact me here. So today I received a call from the Janitor who trained me and I pick up and he is all like “hello?, who is this? “ and I am like  this is D” and he is like “d who ?” And I am like D the new Janitor and also I did not get the email to watch the  video  to become an employee so if you can relay that to the lady that would be great” and he tells her and she gives him attitude and starts saying shit which is false like “ I just called D yesterday and he told me he received the  email and saw the video what is he talking about how do I have his number if he did not get the email to become an employee” and then the Janitor says “ yeah D how does she have your number if you didn’t do the email to become an employee?”  And I say “I have no idea but I am positive I did not call her as I did not have my phone at the time so she probably got my phone from somewhere else” and the Janitor says “okay bye” and hangs up.... then I text him “can you tell her to send me the email again at •insert my email• thank you L appreciate it .  That is when I get a call from the LA fitness from my city and I pick up and it is the lady and she says this shit “ Hey D this is blah blah I just wanted to say that first off you must apply to the gym online (note  which I already fucking did and told her to check on indeed)  and then after you apply which I told you to do on the phone with L idk why you didn’t you will receive an email and then complete it then come in at 3 like we had said yesterday , oh and another thing, don’t disrespect L like that ever again by calling him bro or dude or mate or whatever it was you called him as that is very disrespectful,  from now on you as a person will refer to him as sir or Mr. L got that? I said Do you understand (yelling at me I said yes) ok great and anyone you ever communicate with over here you will talk to as sir or miss and since you’re Hispanic you probably speak Spanish so whatever it is in your language senira or senir (note this is her completely fucking butchering my fucking language trying to pronounce sir and mam) and then she hangs up.  I call back the number pissed off and say I do not want the Janitor job and that I was talking to the lady and she was being rude as hell and she can go fuck herself and that L can go fuck himself too.

      "description": "First post here...and before I begin the full story let me begin by saying that I only had the best intentions by calling the police on this guy.\n\n It was around 10:30 PM two nights ago  and I was leaving my girlfriend's apartment that is right by a trolley station. The apartment complex she lives in is actually quite nice, with many nice residents and a pretty decent staff that keeps the place in order. However, there is one side exit right by the trolley station that is hidden from street view so it naturally attracts some seedier attention late at night. There have been multiple occasions when I am on my phone and am not paying attention and start walking up the steps to someone passed out in their own vomit or shooting up. If that happens I usually just walk around to the front of the building and have her let me in there, which is a lot farther from her apartment and the guest parking lot but the safer thing to do. However this situation was a little bit different.\n\nAs I was leaving her apartment instead of arriving, I had to exit through this doorway which opens out into the alleyway. I pushed it pretty hard, and immediately was met with a strange amount of resistance and heard a large bang. I tried opening it again but it was being pushed closed from the outside, and that was when I realized that there was a man on the ground holding his head with one hand and trying to grab at me with the other. I just stared at him for a second and then slammed the door shut. He appeared to be visibly intoxicated and was yelling and cursing which I could hear from my girlfriend's apartment that I retreated to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt really bad about the whole situation because I could have really hurt that dude by slamming a door into his head. However, I also kind of think it was his fault for passing out on whatever he was on in front of a doorway that is actually frequented by a lot of the residents. Its not unreasonable to think that if I didn't open the door into him someone else would have eventually.\n\nBefore I left through the front I decided to call the police non-emergency line. I didn't really have an issue with the guy being there but I was legitimately concerned for this guy's well being after having a heavy metal door slammed into his skull. I didn't stick around to see what anyone did for this guy, but my girlfriend said he was still there laying down muttering 15 minutes after I left when she went to bed. So guys... AITA?",

      "description": "I'm home for the holidays and I brought my two 7yo Pointer mixes home with me, my boy and my girl. Now like any decent dog owner, I love my dogs and treat them like my children. My brother loves dogs too, but has none of his own. He dotes all over my female dog, giving her treats and pets and all kinds of love. But my male dog is treated much worse. He will push him off the couch and call him \"dumbass\", makes constant remarks about him being \"mentally disabled\" and just be straight up mean to him. He never yells at him or actually hits him or kicks him, but it makes me so upset when he plays favorites with my dogs, especially  since my sweet boy is such a lovebug and wouldn't hurt a fly. \n\nI asked my brother to stop and he just argues that my boy can't understand English and isn't bothered by his bullying.

However, sometimes when she's venting over email about relationships to me she shares some sexual details that are just a little more than I really want to imagine about my sister's sex life. I'm here for her no matter what, so if she needs my advice about something serious I'm always here for her, but I don't necessarily need explicit sexual details about current relationships. So I told her that, essentially: \"feel free to leave out the gory details if you want\".\n\nShe seemed to get embarrassed, which I guess I can understand. She hasn't said much about it since then but also hasn't really written much either and I'm wondering if I broke a trust with her, in some sense? Maybe she felt comfortable enough telling me these things and now doesn't. I'm not sure how many other people she's on such frank terms with; maybe she doesn't have many people she feels comfortable talking to. Am I The Asshole here?",

He was still attached to the lead, and there was no signs forbidding dogs coming into the park. A severely mentally disabled child approaches me and reaches towards my dog. My dog is not good with strangers (only men for some reason, god knows why) and he jumps back. I start looking around for the kids mom but there’s about 50 different white women and I have no idea who to look for, so I take my dog and sit at another bench. The child follows, and I’m beginning to get annoyed so I decide to leave. He then suddenly pets my dog from behind which spooked both me and my dog. Eventually, he started squeezing him and my dog started yelping. In fear for my dogs safety and the kids (in case he tried to bite) I pushed him, unsure of what else to do. He fell back (not my intention) and bursts into a fit of tears. His mother appears out of nowhere and starts inspecting him and holding him. I get dirty looks from all angles. I know the kid had no idea what he was doing, but I still feel I had to stop him before the situation escalated. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR I pushed a disabled kid who was hurting my dog (unintentionally) and he fell and cried.",

      "description": "First, sorry for the wall of text there’s a TL;DR  at the end \n\n(FYI: I personally DON’T like porn for ME, I can’t get off from it.) \n\nSo me and my SO just got into an argument where I absolutely lost my shit. \nFor starters, we have had multiple fights in the past about his lack of communication / lying habits.\n\nThis fight in particular started because my SO was watching porn and masturbating, in the bed with me while I slept... I initially thought he was looking at my nudes and got turned on and we ended up having sex. Afterwards, he asks to shower. I showered last night so declined and just went back in bed after cleaning up. I was curious as to what nudes in particular he was looking at, so I opened his phone and found the porn. I was a bit sad, ngl I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I was RIGHT there and he has so many of my nudes... I was just shocked. \nWhen he gets back into bed I simply ask him what he was looking at.\n\n(a little while back, I bought a dildo and wanted to start using it - his response was “what’s the difference between that dildo and another dudes dick” / “you have me, you don’t need the dildo” so I was curious to see what the fuck his excuse was for watching porn if I’m “right here” ) \n\nHe ignores the question and just says “reddit”, then I ask “why were you touching yourself then?” And he lies to my face and says “no, I was just touching my balls I wasn’t masturbating”  (I KNOW he was masturbating, I’ve been with this dude for 3ish years..) \n\nAfter a while I keep asking and he finally admits to watching porn. I ask, “why didn’t you tell me in the first place? Why’d you lie?”and his response is “I was embarrassed.” I get it, I do, but he still lied...\n\nI then ask him what the difference between me using a dildo and him watching porn and fantasying TO the porn: “the dildo is a physical object, porn is not.” \n\nI’m honestly pretty pissed he’s able to go ahead and say “no I don’t like the dildo, it’s basically cheating” and further discourage me from using it, to him just watching porn and masturbating? He also said that it was a “substitute” for having sex with me?! But, I can’t have one?! \n\nI brought that up and he said “Nono I never said you COULDN’T use it, I said I didn’t like it” (oh yeah, so telling me it’s basically cheating is really going to make me feel great about using the dildo).\n\nI generally wouldn’t care if he watched porn IF he wouldn’t put me down for using a dildo?? Is it just me, or is he a hypocrite?\n\nSorry for the long post, wanted to get as much info in here, but finally I just want to ask: Am I The Asshole here?\n\nTD;LR : my SO hated the idea of me using a dildo, told me it was “basically cheating” because he’s “right here”,  then goes on to watch porn in our bed right next to me and expects me to be a-okay with it.",

      "description": "So basically, I have a group of 6 friends (well now 5 really, 2F and 3M). Anyway, one of them (call them A) was seeing this girl very casually, this girl has a boyfriend. This girl, is pretty crazy, they would fall out, start talking again, meet up, etc. every few weeks. This went on for about 3 months. Personally, I felt bad for her boyfriend. A would tell us about how mad she would get at him over tiny things, she seemed bipolar or just really confused with what she wanted. \n\nNow my other friend, (let's call him B), is somebody who was included in our group, we all find him cool, however he wasn't as involved in terms of clubbing, going to the beach with us, etc. I was the one who introduced him. Anyway, so from experience, B is pretty bad at keeping stuff private, not secrets, but he will ask really personal or weird questions when we're out, not to me, but to any of his friends, or with us or whatever. Or he'll tell private stories about other people. However, over the past few months, B has become less and less involved with us, we always invite him, but he either wouldn't be around, or wouldn't respond.\n\nBut anyway, B ends up meeting the girl in a bar. B is his friend, who really doesn't like A (let's call her C). So anyway, they end up all having a few drinks, and going their separate ways that night. B tells us he met her with C.\n\nThe next day, the girl starts texting A, that she's \"gladly she knows what A thinks of her\", that he calls her a psycho to us and stuff, and that he's ready to break it off at any moment, etc. Now, he had called her crazy in our group chat, and that he was so confused what to do with her, but didn't say he'd break up with her, because to him, they weren't dating.\n\nSo A texts B and asks what was B saying to her. B says that they never said anything to her, and that it was only C who was telling her all of this. C is not in our friends circle, so wouldn't really ever hear this if it weren't for B telling her. So A is annoyed with B and C for this. A tells B that he's sick of him not bothering to hang out with us and tells him pretty much to fuck off. B is adamant, that he never said a word, and it was all his friend C.\n\nNow, I didn't want to pick a side. IMO, it was B and C both saying telling the girl these things. C because they don't like A, and B because he some times just is a big gossiper. A, and the rest of the group, are done with B, they were getting distant with him before, and this is the straw that broke the camels back. B was kinda upset and frustrated A wouldn't believe him. I told B, I didn't want to pick sides and I would stay friends with him.\n\nHowever since then, he never texts me anymore asking to hangout. We would usually talk every day or two, and he would constantly ask me to go drinking with him and his friends, but now nothing. The last time we met (after this) we were fine. I'm kinda resenting him now.\n\nAITA for being annoyed that he's basically stop talking to me?\n\n",

I brought my dog outside and he went to the bathroom as expected, but I turned around and she had put the dog down (inside) and he peed on the floor. She said that she had to put the dog down because she wanted to “put on her coat” instead of simply admitting that she made a mistake.

      "description": "Context for later: my SO's friend got into a car accident 2 weeks ago, in which she collided head-on with a tree because she was on her phone. This is important for later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,\n\nHere's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice. Sometimes she'll leave early and tell my SO at the last second, forcing me to ditch the time I had for schoolwork and fucking up my schedule as well as my SO's.\n\nThen there's today. I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4. This pissed me off because they had agreed to carpooling way before that, as well as to take my SO to a nail appointment after school, and they wouldn't reasonably be home until about 9. \n\nI don't get mad at things like this. I try to use reason and see everything from both sides. I told her friend that while I know it's hard to say \"no\" to a parent, it seems to be inconsiderate to change plans with my SO at the last second, making me abandon my schoolwork while jeopardizing my SO's plans in the afternoon. She then told me that I have no right to get mad (which I wasn't), I occasionally pick her up from school anyways, and that her mom comes first. Then I told her that I agree family does come first in many cases, but doing her mom's hair isn't as pressing as going through with taking someone home, especially when that agreement came first.\" This caused her to tell me that \"things come up\" which causes plans to change. I told her that her argument would be valid for an actual emergency, but that I thought leaving my SO without a ride and forcing me to put my schoolwork on hold for the entire day was a bit rude (especially when this is far from the first time), and that I felt her mom's hair wasn't the highest priority compared to a deal she made first. \n\nThen, she told me she wasn't gonna waste her time arguing with me, and that she wasn't gonna sit there and argue when \"I know that to me, I'm right\". I felt I hadn't said anything to warrant that, which pissed me off. I told her \"Logic and reasoning don't matter when your feelings keep you sure in yourself\" and then \"remember next time you're driving that your main priority is not hitting trees and staying on the road, maybe that'll help you keep your priorities straight.\" Then she called me a dick, and the conversation ended. She's been doing this to my SO many times, and I felt like today was when I had to speak up. Was ITA, guys? ",

      "description": "Just for clarification I am completely new to reddit and just lurk scrolling through posts, so bare with me while I explain. But this recently happened and I need to know if I am the one in the wrong!  \n\nI recently started going to a new gym that is super close to my house and started making some friends - keeps me motivated! Less then a week ago a random guy came up to me and was sparking up a conversation, I didn't think anything of it and tossed him my number. (Important to note I am a 6pm gym goer and pretty much eat / go straight to bed after) Once I was done, I went home - ate and passed out, when I woke up I had 7 missed messages from this guy! \n\nLets call him T, they consisted of him (M26) explaining he's a nerd, was bullied in school and never approaches girls then how I must be \"one of those\" that just ghost people and got his hopes up. I didn't respond since it was kind of creepy and weird, also rude!  \n\nNEXT DAY\n\nIm at the gym doing my thing and notice he sat at the leg press next to me, I smile &amp; nod and just keep doing my workout. He then PULLS MY HEADPHONE OUT and told me I could have the decency to acknowledge him. I told him that it was weird and uncalled for with all the messages, however I picked up my pride and apologized for not letting him know I went to bed. FLASH FORWARD to that night, he spams me - again. This time with sexual messages about my body. Now Im creeped out, because its not just compliments - its lengthy detailed fantasies, I never respond and block him.  \n\nNEXT DAY\n\nHe follows me around the gym, not saying anything but always standing a good couple feet behind me. I waved and acknowledged him but he never said anything. Weird. \n\nTHIS IS WHEN SHIT GETS CREEPY - Two girls come up behind me and let me know hes been taking snapchat videos of me, and they saw him doing it. They explain he was creeping on them not more than a month ago and told the front desk. \n\nWe all decided to go report him to the gym and they take action to ban him for harassment.... where we in the wrong? took it too far? I feel odly bad because he was bullied but THIS IS CREEPY, right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I've been close friends with the same group since freshman year of high school. That was almost 8 years ago, and we've all remained fairly tight, and maintain a group chat.\n\nI'm widely-known for being politically passionate (the details of which I will not mention, as I don't want this thread to devolve into a political debate), and my friends have known this of me for years. They don't exactly agree with my politics, but it's never been a problem. Up until now.\n\nI was doing one of my rants in the group chat, when one of the members (we'll call him K) suggested that what we [as a society] need is more dialogue. I said that I am clearly open to dialogue, as I am responding to their points and listening to their views. K responded by saying I \"barely have a dialogue with them as is,\" and that I'm \"always on my phone around them and not participating\" (a charge that I've verified with other friends is not true of me). Another group member (lets call him J) seconded this, and said that he and K had spoken about this separately and saw it as a problem. I took their words into consideration but brushed it off, as I thought it was just a way to shut me up.\n\nJ and I are best friends, and he is also my manager at work. We've always gotten along incredibly well, but recently at work he's made underhanded comments towards me like \"lol you're broke as fuck\" and \"for someone who proclaims to be open-minded, you sure are closed-minded. [Another friend, we'll call him L] told me so the other day.\" \n\nAfter he left work, I texted him (J) and asked why everyone seems to be taking jabs at me and excluding me from functions. His response read \"Its not like something snapped. We dont hate you or anything. Nothing like that. But i think its one of those, look at your friends, and ill tell you who you are sort of deals. Im not saying i dont want to associate with you any more, but some tendencies youve displayed in the past months, or years, are adding up for me personally as someone i may not want to surround myself with.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on these \"tendencies,\" he focused on my political views and mentioned a few events in the past year (kicking bad roommates out, breaking up with past girlfriends) that didn't sit well with him or the group.\n\nAITA for not understanding why this all happened within a week and why I'm the punching bag all of a sudden?",

      "description": "My “friend” works at target (he came to my house twice now, drank, didn’t put in any money, and left early without saying anything to me so we weren’t on the best terms) and he texted me saying,\n\n“hey, i’m sorry about leaving early, that was a dick move on my part i was just tired and didn’t realize how rude it was in the moment”\n\nhe’s not one to apologize so i appreciated it and told him it was okay. He then texted me saying,\n\n“I’ll make it up to you, come up to target and buy the neon Switch Controllers and i can get you them for $20, all i ask is i buy 1 off of you when i’m off”\n\nI thought, a $10 switch controller when they usually cost almost $80 for 2? hell yeah. I didn’t really want the controller that bad but $10 is a deal i couldn’t pass up. \n\nI went up there, grabbed the controllers and came back to his register, he put in some special code and it said “manager approval code needed” and he goes “oh shit” and only took $40 off of the total so it wouldn’t ask it. Honestly if i knew in advance that it would be $20 for 1 controller i probably would’ve stayed home but i was already there so i just bought the one and he said he’d be by around 10:30 to get the controller for $20. \n\nHe comes by, drops off the money gets the controller and goes to hang out with his girlfriend who also works at Target. \n\nI do not know what was said between them, but he texts me and says “hey man, i feel really bad. but i’m gonna need the other controller back and also the $20. Apparently target is definitely going to find out, fire me, and possibly get the police involved so i just want to return the controller, pay off the difference and quit so i can get off easy as possible.”\n\nI understand his logic, we did technically steal $40 if you think about it, he wanted his $20 back and to pay another $20 to make up for the amount, but he also wants to take the controllers back? if that’s the case then i have no controllers and am out $40. \n\nI’m usually the type to get walked all over but after the shit he pulled before with the whole drinking situation, only apologizing so i could help get him a cheap controller, and now expecting me to just be okay with losing $40, i was upset. \n\nI told him if he gives back the controllers, i expect my money back (annoyed bc he was very obviously avoiding the topic of paying me back). \n\nOR\n\nhe goes in, explains what happens, pays the difference, quits and we at least keep the controllers. \n\nHe was about to sleep but sent me one last message,\n\n“I’m gonna go in, explain what happened and pay the difference and WE (as in him and I) will go from there” I said alright and he went to sleep.\n\nIf he expects me to help him pay this off, give him his $20 back, or the 1 controller, I’m not doing it unless i know for a fact i will get my money back. (he did mention at 1 point he gets paid in 2 weeks but he’s about to get fired and i’m not sure i can trust him to give me the money). AITA?",

This year those 2 days fall to this Friday and Saturday. I already know I want to study biology, but am deciding on which college to choose from. On Friday I planned visiting a nearby college and on Saturday I will visit the one which is pretty far. Because nobody in my circle of friends don't like biology and my family doesn't have time because they are working, I decided to invite my boyfriend to go with me. He agreed and that was it. Perfect.\n\nBut then it wasn't anymore. You see, when he agreed to go with me, he started to look for a job. And on Sunday, he found it. He worked there yesterday and will work tomorrow too, but it's just like a trial run and they will discuss if he will still work there when this week is over. So for now it's still not a very serious job.\n\nThe problem starts with today, when he told me he won't be coming with me on Friday because he has to work and his boss probably won't give him a day off. I told him to just ask his boss, that way we will know for sure. He told me that he doesn't want to ask him because he is afraid how the boss will react to that. \n\nAnother thing to note, I'm a very anxious person and hate going to crowded places, especially alone.

I’ll admit, they have some good songs. But recently a song came out, and had some pretty homophobic lyrics.\n\nI knew that she really liked this artist, but as I have recently came out to said friend, I was very uncomfortable with these lyrics.\n\nWe discussed this lightly, but eventually moved on. We both agreed that the artist was out of line, but overall could probably just say sorry and it’ll all be okay. It didn’t seem like much, until I saw the interview. This particular artist said some VERY problematic statements.\n\nSo I went on to my group’s chat and showed them the interview. My friend agreed that it was horrible, and said that they were really upset. Specifically “why does this shit always happen to the artist’s I like, I’m so upset rn.”\n\nI feel like shit, I didn’t mean to upset her.",

      "description": "A little bit of a game of telephone… so a friend of mine (let’s call him Friend A) recently wrote and directed a feature film. The film is starting to gain momentum. Yay for him!\n\nA mutual friend (let’s call him Friend B) happens to casually browse torrent sites. Over the weekend, he notices Friend A’s film is popular a site he frequents.  Friend B tells me this while debating whether or not to tell this information to Friend A himself.  I remark that this information is actually kind of flattering, considering it means even more people are watching it… even if they are watching it illegally.  Ultimately no hard conclusion is drawn.\n\nI have ANOTHER conversation with ANOTHER mutual friend (this would be Friend C) and I mention what I’d heard from Friend B.  Friend C then texts Friend A about his movie being pirated on torrent sites. He mentions that he's heard this information from Friend B.  Friend A's response was simply \"wow - no way\"...  So I'm not quite sure how to read that. But  Friend B is now upset with me for telling this this Friend C in the first place... and because he didn’t relay the information to Friend A himself. \n\nI guess I didn’t understand how secretive Friend B felt the information was... it seemed pretty trivial to me. Still, Friend B is upset with me because he claims he told me this information in confidence. Am I the asshole?",

I'll tell it from her POV. \n\nFor V day my bf of 10 months and I decided to not do anything too big cus money is tight. I made him a big collage of pictures of us and I got him a gift that was personal to him, something I knew he would like and use. \n\nIn return he gave me roses (he knows I don't like roses), a teddy bear (he knows I don't care for teddy bears and would've rather have any other stuffed animal), a heart shaped pepperoni pizza (he knows I don't like pepperoni and he ended up eating the pizza). \n\nHe asked if I liked the gift and I said yes but I'm sure he could tell I wasn't really into the gifts. He started arguing with me saying that I was being ungrateful and that I knew he didn't have a lot of money to spend on me. The thing is, I wasn't upset about the monetary value. What bothered me was that we've been together for several months and he couldn't at least try to get something that was at least personal to me. \n\nHe ended up leaving to hang out with his friends and I left to hang out with my friends. He called me later and I said I was hanging out with my friends and he argued some more with me and said \"well where do we stand?\" and stuff like that. He said that me being ungrateful for the gift shows that I don't want to be with him. And he hung up on me. \n\nAm I the asshole for not being fake grateful for my V day gift? ",

      "description": "So obviously it sounds really bad just from the title, but there’s a bit more that goes into it. This is also a throwaway, although the names aren’t the same, they’re significant.\n\nI know that what we did was shitty, but i’m going to explain some of the bs that went into this before we finally caved.\n\nTL;DR at bottom \n\n\nI met “the other roommate”, we’ll call her Cori, last year, she started dating my best friend, we’ll call him Mitchell, in college, and he introduced me to her. For a while everything was cool, &amp; then one day she asked me if i wanted to live with her next year. At the time, i was still 17 because i’d graduated high school early &amp; she was 20, so i thought it was a little strange, but i figured why not? Ya know? Mitchell would be there &amp; id have someone there to kinda help me out.\n\nFlash forward to summer, Cori lives 2 hours away from where Mitchell &amp; i live. He starts making trips out there and then being basically forced “or so he said” by her to stay. I don’t care, i have other friends. Every time he does manage to come home, we get together &amp; he talks mad shit about the kinda person she is etc. says he wants to break up, you get it.\n\nHe breaks up with her for about a day, they immediately get back together. Flash forward to school starting, i meet our third roommate, call her Haley, Cori’s best friend, &amp; i’m kinda shy so we didn’t become friend for awhile. \n\nDuring this beginning period of school, Mitchell gets pissed, breaks up with Cori, and then they get back together in about a week. This goes on for a couple weeks, &amp; he tells me that they’re broken up, but it’s cordial so he can still come hang out with me, he does, &amp; almost every time Cori would say some cryptic bull about “needing to talk to him” in her room, &amp; they do that for 30 min- to an hour &amp; he tells me it’s nothing, but i’m not stupid, i know they’re having sex.\n\nFinally they come back out as dating. Now here’s where the main conflict starts, i found out later on that Cori used to go over to his house when they were “broken up” &amp; tell him that she was going to kill herself, that he’s the reason she’s not eating, &amp; all this other stuff. She gets even more manipulative &amp; controlling, &amp; Mitchell starts staying &amp; basically living at this house that the 3 of us are splitting evenly in rent &amp; utilities. \n\nDuring this kinda in between period, like september to october, she’s picking fights with me over him, saying rude comments, and generally just making me afraid to leave my room, (i actually stayed in my room for a full 36 hours at one point) and just forcing him to kinda put me out of his life. This was when Haley &amp; i became friends, along with her finding out from tons of mutual friends that Cori had been telling everyone that Haley was a slut etc., i got so angry one day that i threw all of Cori’s chairs into our backyard, put them back, then went to my room &amp; punched a hole in my door. I thought I’d broken my hand, Haley took me to the hospital, bam friendship was born. \n\nThings were iffy for awhile, just general bs. Haley would say she didn’t want Mitchell at our house, Mitchell is literally living at our house. We’d have a fight, they’d stay at his place for a week or so, but they were always back. Plus, Haley &amp; i keep the house clean when it’s just us, but Mitchell &amp; Cori are slobs, shit everywhere. Then Mitchell &amp; i started fighting, around Thanksgiving it gets really bad, i say i don’t want him in my home, Haley doesn’t want him in our home, &amp; i want his shit gone.\n\nThey leave to his house for a week. Mitchell &amp; i are no longer friends. Next week they’re back, living at our home, Mitchell, at our home. Haley &amp; i decide to move out. Mitchell’s &amp; my mutual friend, decided to move in with us. \n\nNext two months until yesterday we’re busy getting our things in order for our new apartment. We find it &amp; start moving our things a few days ago &amp; yesterday when she saw us draining my waterbed our my window, she came out &amp; started screaming at us. \n\nWe took that load of stuff, dropped it off &amp; went back to get more, &amp; they had unplugged the garage door opener, put a handle on the front door (Mitchell had broken it &amp; taken it off with the intention of fixing it a few days ago &amp; then had just left it open) , had locked my bedroom window, &amp; locked the back door. Haley had to crawl in through the doggy door &amp; push the wood cover out of its slides. \n\nWhile Haley &amp; our mutual friend, let’s call him Dawson, were moving out her wooden headboard, Cori &amp; Mitchell came to the garage door &amp; got into a fight with her where she said it was hers because it was made from materials on her ranch, &amp; Haley said fine, &amp; slammed the thing down on the floor of our garage, stepped on it, then tried to walk back into the house. \n\nHaley is not a huge fighter, but when she gets pissed she sees red, &amp; while she tried to walk in, Cori shouldered her hard, Haley automatically turned &amp; pushed her into my washing machine, and yelled at her. Mitchell has to keep them apart. About 15 minutes after that, there were two cops there, just “making sure it went smoothly.” We weren’t there for that much longer, but the whole time Mitchell and Cori were out sucking up to the policemen.\n\nFound out later that they had already figured out where our new house was, we didn’t want them to know, &amp; had toured it apparently. They’re psychos. Just want to know if AITA or not. Sorry for long text.\n\n\nTL;DR: have a shitty roommate, her shitty boyfriend lived with us despite us not wanting him there, psychological/emotional abuse, didn’t tell her we were moving until the day we were leaving.\n",

      "description": "Some context, I’m an 18 year old high school student and the friend in this post is a 17 year old student. \n\nMy friend, we’ll call her Thanos, has had a really fucked up life. She dated this guy last year who was abusive, manipulative, and just overall the worst person. Because of him, she got many complications concerning her mental health. Thanos’ depression got worse because of him, she has trust issues, she can’t keep relationships, and on top of that, she has PTSD because of it. It’s really saddening and gets me so angry because that bastard put her through all that. \n\nA few days ago we went to the mall to hang out and she said she hadn’t been to that specific mall since she went on a date with her ex. No problem, it’ll get tough for her but I’ll get her through anything if she feels uncomfortable. \n\nAround the time we start to leave to catch the bus to leave the mall, she tells me she might have a panic attack because she’s remembering the memories with her ex at various places in the mall. I tell her what I’d like to hear myself if I was in that situation. I tell her “breathe Thanos, it’s all in the past. He can’t hurt you anymore.” or something along those lines, I can’t remember completely. \n\nShe gets really mad and upset and stops talking to me and she leaves because her mom came to pick her up. She texted me today how I never support her or help her get through her PTSD, and what I do tell her is the exact opposite of what you’re supposed to tell someone going through it. She then goes on saying how her feelings don’t matter anyway and how whenever I’m dealing with stuff she helps me, but I don’t help her (which is extremely false, I drop whatever I’m doing whenever she needs comfort or anything). \n\nI’m just a high school senior, not a therapist. I’ve never dealt with any PTSD or helped anyone who has had it. I don’t know what to say to help someone calm down from it. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling Thanos the wrong things and, allegedly, making the situation worse?",

Everyone who knew us, knew that if I had a choice between 20min hanging out with N, over a whole day with someone else, I’d pick N. Hands down. she was my sister (basically). \n\nBackground info. On N: she was always the girl that guys wanted (she developed early) I didn’t mind, I was happy for her and found it fun to hear about her guy friends and dates.  She was never single for more than 2 weeks, from 8th(13) grade til now (23). I liked being by myself m, so I was never fixated on things like that, I just wanted to be happy with what I have. This meaning I rarely went to her to complain about guys and emotional drama outside of family issues. \n \nFast forward: I am about 22\nI had one pretty bad relationship but got out of it. when I realized how bad it really was, We were already 1.5 years into it and I felt that people would judge me for now having feelings for this guy who wasn’t shit (me 21 at the time, him 26 and he needed my help to pay rent and I nearly went broke and lost my own place in the process, also he was on drugs, I know -_-) so I didn’t tell anyone and it took me 6mo to get out of the relationship I was broken and a shell of who I used to be. I tried to vent to N but she was always talking about her family issues and complaining about things (that she could have easily fixed) so I didn’t want to bother her  and I just listened and supported her when she needed it. (Thinking my dumb relationship wasn’t as important as her sister getting remarried) \n\nAbout a year later, N ends things with the guy she was dating/sleeping with (guy in a relationship and living with the mother of his 3 kids, she was a side piece) A month later, she “falls in love” she is now 21 and he is 28. I begin to feel triggered but say nothing and just provide support. \n\nThe BS starts early. He has no car, she does. After a month she has to *ask him* to use her car some days. He never fills the gas. All the while she is still living away from home, and when she leaves to visit he gives her shit about having a good time with her family and not him. Plus a whole array of other BS that no 21 year old (or any woman) should have to deal with. But I support and try to help her, she calls crying at LEAST every 3 weeks crying her eyes out, all hours of the night, to complain about him. I pick up an listen, trying to help problem-solve, every time.  While also sprinkling in “you know you don’t have to put up with this, right” “ you’re awesome and he should see that, if he loves you” “ you sure you guys aren’t moving too fast?” This goes on for about a year.\n\nThen I Went to visit to check up on her because she visits home less and less. That’s when out he is now living with her and doesn’t pay rent. Continues to use her car. Forgets to pick her up from work at 5am (she worked the night shift) leaving her waiting for hours until he wakes up or she decides to call another friend). and blocks her on his social media. \n\nI take her aside and express my concerns, she denies it “it’s not that bad” “there are so many good times though” “ but he’s really sweet” etc. I don’t want to push because I know how it feels to love someone who is literal garbage. And feeling ashamed of your love so you isolate yourself from family and friends( been there done that, didn’t want her to feel the same way I did) I can tell she truly loves this guy and will do anything for him, So I continue my support.\n\nUntil.. I find out her neighbors called the police on them because an argument “got out of hand”. This is when I begin telling her she has got to start thinking what’s best for her. At this point the stress of being with him had made her fail 2 semesters of undergrad and extend her stay (and how much debt she has). She also got diagnosed clinically depressed during the 2nd failed semester. It broke my heart. \n\nSo around Jan. 2018, 1.5 years into their relationship l, I say “as a friend and as someone who loves you, I think you need to get away from this guy he does nothing for you and stresses you out, just try to go 3-6 months without needing to cry in your car because of this guy.” (because he will refuse to leave HER house after an argument because that’s where his ps3 is) she says okay, no problem, their love is getting better and stronger they can do this. \n\nI don’t hear from her until April. She is finally graduating and has a job and isn’t worrying about anything except him. \n(Around that time I am starting grad school and super stressed, don’t feel like I am smart enough *insecurities blah blah*. My debt is getting ridiculous and gives me anxiety. My family life is crazy, one of my grand parents is developing dementia, find out I have a bunch of half siblings.  I am further away from home than I have ever been and more shit that has me crying all the time) \nIn April she complains about him wasting his time trying to be a rapper -_- and I’m fed up. No energy to deal with this almost 2 year problem. I tell her straight up this is ridiculous and she doesn’t deserve all this at such a young age. He is in no way shape or form worth it. \nIn the same breathe I tell her how I had been feeling and worrying and what not and how I just wanted her to talk to me more to get some sort of feel of home and support from the only person I can call a sister. \n\nShe ignores me for months. While posting on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat every week. I text/call her, Dm, and Snapchat her but get left on read. I am once again broken, I feel abandoned. I get angry thinking about all the years I was there for her with out asking for anything in return.\nShe then sends me this obligatory birthday message (on snap chat, not even a text or a call) as if I haven’t been sending her messages for months. In anger and not wanting to ruin my birthday with an argument I write “K” \nA couple days later she asks “are we still friends” \nI basically say yes but I feel like we aren’t best friends anymore and tell her why I feel that way. She gets PISSED. Says I shamed her relationship and never supported her for like our whole friendship and that she was there for me in my “depressed stage” in April. And a whole lot of other stuff trying to make me feel bad and bashing me as a friend. \n\nAnd ends with “if we can’t be best friends then we can’t be friends at all” \n\nI am completely over it and refuse to bash her the way she did me and just say  “ok” and never spoke to her again (not like she has ever messaged me). \n\nOne mutual friend says she doesn’t even care and I’m better off. And another says I should have given her a chance. And I would have had she not bashed me like I was a horrible friend from the beginning. \n\nSometimes I feel guilty when my new friends talk about maids of honors and I think about how she was always going to be mine but now I have no one that close. And I wonder should I have just been there for her despite everything? I feel like I was right but every now and then I feel bad for the lost friend ship. \n\nAITA for dropping her like that? (Btw thanks if you read the whole thing I appreciate any and all comments if I get any lol) \n\nIdk what TD: LR is but I dropped my friend when I realized It was a one sided friend ship. \n\n(Also she is no longer with him as of Jan. 2019) ",

      "description": "Please excuse bad grammar and spelling.\n\nLet me explain: I was at a restaurant  last week with my sister. After eating I went to the bathroom (I actually announced that I was going to my bathroom to my sister before I went this will may be important later). Now there appeared to be a young man next to us and I thought nothing on it. \n\n\nSo I went to the bathroom and locked the door. Someone texted me so I pulled out my phone and looked at it.  I heard someone come inside and thought nothing of it.  Then without any indication my stall door opened.  I reached out and placed my hand out and said, \"occupied!\"\nNothing. \nWhoever opened my door left and went to another stall at first I thought it might have been a mistake and went back to my sister but then I noticed that the young man was gone. \nI felt enraged and went and told my sister that the young man followed me into the bathroom.  A few seconds later the man came out of the bathroom and I sneered at him and he looked shocked.\nMy sister looked at him and said, \"I think that's a girl.\"  I looked back at him and he had boobs. \nI was shocked and sat down embarrassed. My sister kept asking me \"what happened?\" and I told her to drop it.   \n\nI told her the story when we left and she said she might have said something if she was a guy.  I not trying to discriminate how people dress and she has every right to use the bathroom I do.  But part of me was wondering if she just might have been a pervert and stopped when she saw that I had a phone in my hand.\n\nI mean wouldn't she have seen my feet? Did she follow me in and open the door on purpose? I've done stuff like this before on accident and always apologized.  I don't even remember her knocking she just opened the door.  (Also the lock was broken and I didn't know that. There weren't a lot of people in the restaurant either). Am I overreacting? ",

      "description": "Me and my SO have been together for almost 3 years and we are very happy together. We usually help eachother with boring everyday things that needs to get done and i am happy with that, but today was a little different.\n \nI feel like she hates doing errands on her own, so for example when she has to pick up a package in the post office, i go with her, even though i have no business in town. I am ok with that (usually its just nice to spend time with her) as long as i get a heads up about it some time in advance. I dont like getting home from university and then she suddently asks me if i can go with her to do something. That happened today and for the first time, i said no.\n\nWe both came home from a long day at uni and went straight to the grocery store to buy all the food and everything we need for the week. When we get home i want to sit down by the computer for a while to check my email and then play some videogames. Then she says \"oh no, i forgot i have to hand in a book at the library today\". She then doesnt even ask but just assumes that i'm willing to take her to the town center so she can hand in the book. I realise its way easier that way, because there are few parking spots in town and it would be easier if i just held the car running while she went in. Its a pretty small favor, but i was looking forward to relaxing a bit. I said that i didnt feel like it and i guess i sounded a bit annoyed to her. She got pretty upset and left by herself. When she left she sarcastically said \"thanks for the help\". \n\nI feel kinda bad, but i also think that she shouldnt think that i will always go with her in those situations. It's her book, and she knew for months that she had to hand it in. She could have brought it one of all the other times we've been to town, so why do i have to step away from my computer and spend the next hour doing something i dont feel like doing? \n\nI feel like i want us to continue helping eachother with daily errands as it makes it more fun and less boring, but i also want us to be able to say no to helping in some situations without the other getting upset.\n\nThis is my first ever post on reddit, so i am kinda terrified, but i hope you can give me good, neutral feedback on this. Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "I’ve been talking to a guy on &amp; off since about March of last year. We were messaging each other on facebook catching up and he was trying to hang out. I asked him if he was still in a relationship (he’d been dating someone for about two months), he said no because he found out she had sex with someone else. I didn’t really believe him so I asked him to prove it. I ended up getting a message from her facebook account stating they weren’t together but she’s gonna ‘stay out of our thing’ and block both of us. I got suspicious because what girl would willingly message another girl to let them know that? Long story short, I figured out I was blocked from her account but he wasn’t. I also found out he was texting me from I assume the burner app, but originally told me he got a new number because he wanted the Galaxy phone. He got caught up when he sent me a screenshot and it was iMessage (our messages were text message but I have an iPhone). So I confronted him about everything because nothing was adding up, then I told him I was going to ask his ‘ex’ myself if she was the one that actually messaged me from her facebook. He immediately blocked me everywhere. I tried to message her on snapchat but got blocked so I assumed it was him that blocked me there too. So I messaged her brother (I didn’t know it was her brother at the time), and he asked for proof. He informed her, then she unblocked me on snapchat. Basically she didn’t believe me when I told her everything, even after I sent her screenshots of the proof because she’s with him ‘every moment of the day and has her fingerprint in his phone, so she’s not getting played.’  What’s wild is I EVEN sent her a screenshot of the message from HER facebook saying they weren’t together, and she still didn’t believe me. All she did was get smart, and stated, “you want to be me so bad.” Then blocked me. Btw they’re still together. I just tried to do what was right since most people wouldn’t, but apparently I’m the bad guy. I have to admit that dude was a pretty good liar. So ima just mind my business next time something like that happens. AITA for even bringing it up and messaging her brother so I could get ahold of her to inform her?",

      "description": "To give some background on myself, I am a mid-twenties elementary school teacher and have been at my current school for almost one school year. I moved to this new location for a boyfriend, but that didn’t work out unfortunately. Because of this, my students have become my kids. Might be a bit of an unhealthy attachment, but I feel like they give me purpose.\n\nHad the kids all lined up before going to the cafeteria in the hallway. We were doing our typical name call outs and small games to keep them entertained before leaving. As they were sitting there, the janitor walks by with his cleaning bucket and mop. He is a kind soul. One of the brighter but challenging children, let’s call him Fuck, said that he was retarded or something to that effect and his clique started laughing.\n\nFor those of you that are outside of the education environment, bullying is taken very seriously and is dealt with quickly to nip it in the bud. In these types of situations, we are supposed to report the behavior to the school’s principal immediately. However, Fuck is a different breed, as he is constantly making sexist and homophobic comments. Clearly not the best home life. But this level of assholery merited a much greater punishment than a visit to the principle and another useless conversation with parents.\n\nSo, I got the kid that has learning differences from our class and set them up as partners, expected destruction to ensue. Of course, Fuck was going to take the bait. As the class activity, I had each of the kids draw pictures of one another. My plan was to have him get in front of the class and publicly humiliate him. As a result, Fuck ended up drawing the learning differences kid as a penis, nothing special here. I have him get in front of the class, question him and he ends up stuttering and gets noticeably nervous. I can't help but feel slightly guilty for this, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "First of all: Happy valentines day, y'all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond: I would appreciate the fuck out of you if you took your time to read this, as im  so lost and confused. I know it's a long post, but right now reddit is all I have to tell me if im crazy or not.\n\n  \nBefore we start, I want to make it clear that I have ADHD and severe anxiety, both of which I take meds for. I also have depression (and i'm not faking it), and I have just started seeing a therapist. I am not having suicidal thoughts, but it is really hard for me to function. If it helps I am 14, very soon to be 15. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to see a therapist to change up my medication for ADHD So I can focus more during the day and get work done. I also was told that I am showing signs of depression, and a couple days later I really realized this. I was always tired, off task/ had a VERY tough time concentrating (more than how my ADHD usually affects me), I spent most of my time laying down in bed, I stay up late whenever I get the chance and usually don'get enough sleep, And to top it all off i'm veryyyy pessimistic and I have very little self confidence. I'm also insanely introverted, as I would rather play videogames, watch youtube, and be by myself than with other people. I usually socialise a lot at school by cracking shitty jokes that 1% of the time will get a couple laughs, but apart from that or having some conversations with classmates thats about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week or two ago I opened up to my mother that I was feeling really depressed and that I felt that it was affecting my schoolwork, as I had a giant research paper that I couldn't finish, even with an extension, and my grades which were normally in the high b's to mid A's had dropped to c's and B's. I was having fights with my mother who is always saying that I never do enough to help around the house, even though I do many chores when I get home because she tells me to do a fuck ton of stuff when I walk into the door. Then she calls me lazy when she asks me to do something else while i'm playing on my PS4. \n\nBefore I opened up to her about my depression, My mother (IMO) gotten irrationally angry one night. I believe it was a half day because we had midterms, so school let out early. The only other midterm I had was Math, which I'm really good at and have studied for. I played for around 3 hours after doing chores, eating, taking care of our dogs, etc. Afterwards, I went and did some more chores, played with our dogs, took a long shower, came back down, had a snack, did more chores, all while my brother was having his turn on the PS4. He finally got off, and my mom said while I was going down to the basement that I haven't doen my homework, which I did. I explained this to her, and she said I hadn't taken a \"2 hour break from electronics\", Which I also did. She says that I didn't do any of my chores, Which I said that I did the chores she told me to. Now, my mother threatens to turn off the PS4 (she has this bullshit wifi blocker on her phone, such bullshit) because I didn't do enough, so I explain to her that I did, and I was going downstairs to play now. Around 7 minutes later, she turns it off after I was in the middle of a game, and I lost all my progress. I go up to her and ask why she turns it off, and she says \"you didn't unload the dishwasher\" (which she never explicitly told me to, and it may have not even been my turn to do it but she always tells me to anyway.). I tell her that's unfair because she never told me to, and she says i should've done it even when I wasn't told to, even though she knows I need things told to me because of my short ass attention span. I get really upset, go back downstairs, cool off a tiny bit, and write her a really long text message about how she's abusing her power, I shouldn't have to assume what job I need to do, and how turning it off was a bitch move (didn't say that though) because I did everything she told me to do. We have another conversation, and she says we're goign to try a week without the PS4. If I don't agree, then I lose my phone, PS4, i would be grounded, and proabbly won't see the ps4 ever again, so I have to unfortunately comply. Now, the PS4 is a fucking godsend to me. Its probably the only thing in life that I enjoy. After a long day of bullshit at school, I get to sit my fat ass down and release all my stress, anxiety, and whatever. Its one of the only things that really makes me happy ATM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Up to today, things have been hell. My relationship with my parents has been deteriorating, I'm wildly unhappy, And my Mom is on my ass. Throughout the week she has been placing multiple restrictions on my phone, the only other thing I have other than the 1000 year old PC im on typing this. She wants me to do a crushing amount of chores and to not have the phone for 2 hours (basically I get it at 5). Throughout the events of this entire story, my mother has been  saying how I'm being useless and lazy, she has been comparing me to my younger brother and how he's so helpful, nice, Not lazy, doesn't argue, etc... and he always takes her side about how im a jerk. I don't think its my fault im not that helpful as I usually spend my afternoons in my bed with a dog, doing as much homework I can concentrate on, and watching youtube on my phone. Sometimes, she really cuts deep and screams at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEspecially fucking today\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, last night, I went downstairs at around 9:50 for some lays chips because I was hungry. I stayed up kind of late on my phone, like an average teen. I usually fall asleep with my headphones and my mom berates me for doing that, so i make sure not to tonight. I go to sleep at around 10:45. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wake up at 6:30 to my mom yelling at me to get the hell up, so I get the hell up. She made a list of things I had to do the night before, such as get clothes out for tomorrow, brush teeth, etc. Im not four, these wont be a problem, except for the clothes. I have grown out of my clothes, so for an early birthday present, I asked my mother to take me clothes shopping. Instead she shoves a ton of shitty ass clothes I dont want, walks off, then very soon while im changing asks me to hurry up. Im done with her shit so I just get out and shove some random shorts im not gonna wear towards her. I tell her Im not wearing them, she gets upset, blah blha blah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wake up late at 6:30 because of my mom (which she claims Im ALWAYS late to wake up adn to get to the bus, which is untrue for the most part) and Im having trouble finding clothes. She explodes and goes fucking nuts screaming at the top of her lungs, saying its because of my phone and that its going away for fucking forever. She even tries to grab it but i snatch it back from her and leave after finding some shorts that barely fit. After a shit day, she screams at me first thing when she gets home to bring in groceries and to do a ton of chores. She also demands I put my phone down again. I do chores, I wait until I get to use my phone, I get screamed at some more, and she says she's going to talk about the phone again with my dad (which means mroe restrictions). Side note: My mother usually just tells my dad somethign and he agrees with it, then attacks me constantly for using my phone, he yells at me for \"not paying attention\", etc. Think rude ass customer but personal so he can be way meaner and poke fun at everything you do. I decide not to have dinner with my family because my mom has made me wick with what she is doing, and I cant stand her. I stay up in my room, just sitting in bed because I lack the motivation to do anything else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshe later calls me into her room, and says that my grandmother has bladder cancer. Im fucking crushed. My grandmother is the sweetest person ever, and I would take a bullet for her. I love her and my grandfather to death, and they are some of the best people in my lives. I'm crushed, so to take my mind off it I ask how dinner was. MY mom explains that she was upset I wasn't there and that im always being obstinate, So i explain to her  that it's because she's making my life hell by taking away all of my electronics. She then says \"I dont want to hear it, im upset enough about my mother\" WELL BITCH ME TOO, SHE MEANS MORE TO ME THAN YOU ATM. And especially after sharing this fucking heartbreaking news with me, my mother explains that \"because I didnt set my clothes out and didn't wake up on time, I dont get my phone past 8;30\", which is 2 hours before I usually go to bed. Im livid, and try to follow her aroudn to talk to her, But she does this thing where she goes \"I dont want to talk, if you talk to me you lose your phone.\" I say to her that im wildly upset at hearing about how my sweet grandmother now has cancer and now she's taking away the last thing I have to make me feel at least a little happy. I try to talk to my mom, and even though she knows im having a really tough time wit hdepression and I explain this to her multiple times, she says\" i dont care about how you feel or not, youre lazy and don't deserve this, stop talking to me or you will never get it again\". I trusted her with my feelings and she basically threw them on the ground. Im less upset about the phone and more upset becasue I believe shes using my depression as a way to completely restrict all of my electronics, which would make me extremely unhappy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nafter crying, idk what the fuck is hapening anymore, and im ready to give up at this point. So, reddit, AITA and being an overdramatic bitch, or are my parents in the wrong and are making things worse for me?",

      "description": "Background: I’m an african american girl who is currently in highschool and has social anxiety.\n\nBasically, recently I have been trying to build more confidence and do things I wouldn’t normally do, which included changing my style. My mom, who I would describe as greedy when it comes to money, decided to take me out and allow me to buy clothes, which I was grateful for. Usually she doesn’t allow me to pick out what I like but this time she did without a fuss. \n\nAfter going shopping and getting home, I began to ask for a haircut, and she instantly got upset . She began to get upset and ask why, say that it was disrespectful, and even brought my dad in to make it into a big debate.\n\nMy dad and I agreed that since I am doing good in school and am a good kid, I should be allowed to control what I did to my hair and face (as in makeup) and that she can’t dictate or decide for me, and this seemed to make her really mad. She continues to say I’ll regret it and that I needed to stop talking about it. I asked mg dad what he thought and he said he would take me if I wanted, but she began to get angry at him and they started arguing, so I dropped it and didn’t bring it up for a while.\n\nFast-forwarding to a couple days ago, she seemed to be in a good mood so I decided to ask her again and she instantly got mad. She began to call me disrespectful and said “You look good with long hair, I wish my hair was as long as yours.” and snapping at me whenever I brought it up. At this point I was over it, and began pointing out reasons I wanted them.\n\nI told her that getting this haircut will make me more confident and happy, and that I wouldn’t be as anxious about how I looked or presented myself with a new hairstyle, but she still wouldn’t let me, saying “You have anxiety and getting a haircut will only draw more attention to you.”\n\nAfter this I didn’t think I’d get any further, so I dropped it. But later on when I was messing with my hair she began to tell me over and over that I needed to wear my hair natural (my hair is straightened but it’s naturally very curly) and that I was trying to be “white” and hide my culture and heritage. I told her that I’d refuse to do anything else with my hair unless she took me to get it cut, and I kept pointing out and sending her links to every hair salon around us, including the prices, even going as far as telling her I’ll shave it all off if she didn’t take me. I don’t really know if I was just trying to make her mad because she wouldn’t do it or hoping I’d convince her, but she then said as long as I’m under her roof I cannot cut it.\n\nAITA for wanting to cut my hair? I understand she doesn’t want me to regret it or hate it, but I want to try it. Should I drop it?\n\nSorry if this is a mess, I’m not good at explaining things.",

      "description": "My gf started a new job a few months ago. She and I had a bunch of trips planned and booked before this so I told her to tell her new boss about the trips prior to accepting the offer and she said she would. When I asked her if we were all good, she said she had only told them about half the trips because \"it was too much.\" I got mad and said that she needs to tell them about all of the trips and if they can't make it work, then we can talk about cancelling something. She agreed to tell them and said it was all good. \n\nFast forward to a week ago and I was asking her about what she wanted to do while we're on our Panama trip. She then tells me she can't go. I get really mad because she told me she had told them about the trips prior to starting and evidently it wasn't an issue since she didn't bring it up again. Then she confesses that she didn't tell them about any of the weekend trips because she was embarrassed about how many days she was already taking off and didn't think weekends would be a problem. \n\nAs I dig deeper, it turns out they had a meeting to plan the shifts for the week of our Panama trip and since 2 other people said they were gonna be out, she didn't mention anything about our own trip and decided unilaterally that she would just cancel on me. \n\nI am furious right now because she had 3 different chances to tell her boss about the trip(s) and didn't. It's not so much that she \"can't\" go. It's that she didn't even try/ask her boss, especially after she already told me she did. If she really couldn't go because her boss said so, I would be less mad (still mad because the trips were supposed to be cleared by her boss already). But her boss doesn't even know about this trip she just cancelled on me because she \"has to work.\"",

      "description": "I’m on mobile so, blah, blah... \n\nA bit of background. My aunt, who is like 70ish maybe lives in a different country than all of my family, so because of that, we’re not exactly close. Her husband, who’ve they’ve been married about ~35 years is an asshole and no one in my extended family likes him and the chooses to ignore this fact. She’s not a bad person, but she’s really annoying. Her family is super religious, really judgy and can’t stand when people (my whole family for ex) don’t go to church or have different beliefs than her. She and her husband are the literal definition of a conservative family... at my graduation party, my close friends and family are gonna be drinking and having an overall good time and they’re probably gonna be judging everyone for this... She has been asking me for months the date of my graduation, but i don’t answer her back. Just recently, my mom told me that she started asking her this also, but my mom knows that I don’t want her here, so she just tells her she doesn’t know. My aunt has a habit of unexpectedly coming over so I can’t tell her a date because she might come... \nAlso, she always lectures me about god and how he’s the one that saves lives, not me or my colleagues (medical school graduation), so we would i want someone like that on such a special day? \n\nI’m sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my native language. \n\nTl/dr: annoying aunt and husband want to invite themselves to my graduation and I don’t know how to tell them off.

The thing is we're both fairly tired - we went out last night as an early birthday celebration with her friends, and ate plenty of food today.

She's starting to piss me off now and she asks me what's wrong so I tell her \" I know you don't like Valentine's Day but you don't have to make it shitty for people that do\".

      "description": "Our mother has dementia.  I'm the youngest of 5 (one is deceased).  My brother is the next youngest and we were close for a very long time until a lie showed me how he was no different than the others. \n\nI've been trying to take care of our mother at home, rather than put her in a home like so many people would.  I hired a sitter to help when I am required to go into the office.  This has all been out of my own savings.  Last year, almost this same time of year to be exact, I was really in a dark place reviewing my finances and deciding to go into my retirement funds to make sure I keep enough money to take care of things.  I texted my 3 siblings saying I needed to talk to them about getting them to help me with our mom.  My sister called me directly and asked what was going on and I told her.  She acted so surprised and that she was more than happy to help and that I should text all 3 of them telling them the cost because we should all help.  I felt immediately better.  I texted them the cost.  My oldest brother came by the house and proceeded to tell me he couldn't give more than $50 per week because he recently retired. I told him anything would help. My youngest brother called and said he had some bills to take care of but would give me something \"when my tax return comes\".  I guess I was so lonely and hopeful, I accepted all of their \"offers\".  In the back of my mind, I knew I would get nothing because the oldest brother and sister were notorious liars (my Christian sister let my deceased brother die owing him thousands of dollars and she let our aunt die owing her thousands of dollars; my oldest brother was a womanizer who has cheated on his wife for their entire marriage).  But I was really hurt more by my youngest brother, because, while dealing with our mom's dementia, he has been the only one that actually would call and ask me how I was doing and call to make me laugh and keep me going.  So, when he gave me the \"when I get my tax return\" reply, I was crushed.  He'd used that same line on our lying sister years ago when she paid his rent and never paid her back.  He went for 6 months avoiding me because he knew I was hurt from the lie.  He called me, crying about it, and I forgave him.  But then he hasn't called again since. That was 3 months ago.  \n\nI guess I thought they all would do this for their mother, not for me. \n\nSo here it is Thanksgiving day. I've fixed a nice dinner for my mom and me and she was happy and so was I.  My youngest brother dropped by. I took him to the den and went to get her, then I just left the room.  If he thought he could just drop by and have me smiling and laughing like nothing has happened, he learned better.  I left him in the den with our mom and went to do laundry. \n\nI'm thankful I'm somehow still able to take care of my mom and see her though her happy days and confused days. \n\nSo, AITA because I couldn't let him take my joy today?

      "description": "This is a throwaway account because she follows my account. I'll give you a little background. \n\nI bought a two bedroom house about a year ago. I got a super good deal on it because the previous owners put an addition on but did not finish it. The addition would add another master bedroom and bonus room on a 2nd floor. \n\nI had two roommates moving in with me. I gave them the two existing bedrooms while I lived in the attached garage. I didnt mind because I was going to have the rest of the house done pretty soon. \n\nI took out a credit card with a special offer for the first 12 months at a suoer low APR. Finished the addition in about 5 weeks. Planned on making the bonus room a game room and living in the new master. By then my sister went on summer break and needed a place to stay and my girlfriend wanted to move in. So I shared the master with my girlfriend and split the game room in half for my sister. After my sister went back to College I turned the game room back into a full game room and stayed in the master with my girlfriend and her daughter. \n\nBut shortly before my sister left my girlfriend lost her job. The company went under, she was not fired. The company that took over wanted her to go to a training facility over an hour away. She tried for a bit but it was too much because it caused her to work 13 hour days and barely see her kid. She quit and I let her stay with me essentially rent free for a couple months while she was in between jobs. \n\nWith her daughter going on 7 we decided she needed her own room and we needed the privacy. So we let the daughter have the master while we took the game room. (If I wanted to use the game room at night I wouldnt disturb her daughter. Thats why we decided this.).\n\nNow that she has a stable job with decent pay I asked her to start paying rent two months ago. She has been at her job for 6 months now. I wasnt exactly having trouble but I was basically living paycheck to paycheck with $20-$50 extra a month. We agreed that she should pay half of all house bills that I am responsible for. Plus we go halves in on food. \n\nI am one payment away from paying the card off. I have been paying as much as I can each month to get it done with as quick as possible. While she isnt struggling herself, she doesnt have that much wiggle room every pay period. We got into a huge argument last night because I refuse to go down on her rent after my last credit card payment.  She feels that because I make more than her that I should be paying more. I don't see it that way at all. I think that would be really unfair to me. Especially because I don't even get to live in the bedroom I built so her daughter can have her own room. \n\nIts not my fault you make less than I do. This isnt section 8 housing. So why should I have to pay for more than \"my share\" when I dont even technically have half the space. I think its udder bullshit. We arent engaged. We aren't married. Grow up and pay your way. Does this make me an asshole?\n\n\n\n",

I got pissed and called her a gold digger because she only wants money from guys and she replied, \"what money lol\" AITA?",

      "description": "My roommate and I were best friends at one point and I was super excited to be moving in with her. Until I learned - the day before we moved in, mind you - that her boyfriend was going to be staying with us. Without pitching in for rent or utilities. They told me he’d be there two months max. After month three, I tell him he’s gotta go. They resented me for that right away. They think I’m a bad person for not wanting to help out a friend in need. I can’t help but agree with them and feel like I’m selfish for wanting him out, because the three of us were close and besides being messy he wasn’t hurting anything by being there. It’s just the fact that I was so excited and it ended up not being what I thought it would be at all or what I agreed to. \nIt all came to a head one night and we had a falling out over the situation. I left and went to my boyfriends and have been staying here since, which has been a few months at this point. Since I’m gone, my roommate’s boyfriend has moved back in. Again, without pitching in money-wise. AITA for asking that he takes over my portion of utilities or gtfo? I realize that they didn’t ask me to leave so it’s still on me to pay rent, but I think it’s bullshit to have to pay for her boyfriend to be living there. But at this point I can’t tell if I’m in the right or if I’m just being petty and really am a selfish person and shitty friend. ",

      "description": "\n**First time posting**\n\n\nAlright this is a pretty long story so be prepared. I was friends with a girl (who we'll name Kara) and a guy (who we'll call Ben). I've known Kara for about 7 months and Ben for 4 years.\n\nKara was a super annoying girl near the end of me and her friendship. She would always obsess over Ben, who at the time she was crushing over, and she would almost never really pay much attention to me. She was super needy about having me bike with her, begging her to tell her if there's anything horrible with her, and heck, she tried to get me to 'unfriend' Ben at one point, for lack of a better word.\n\nSo one day, me and Ben were on the bus going home, and I forget how we brought it up but we ended up talking about how she was super obsessive and needy and was talking about dating even though we were only in grade eight and stuff. \n\nAnd it almost out of nowhere occured to me that, wow, I don't have fun hanging out with her. There wasn't one exact reason why, but just a bunch of small reasons, like she would call me slow, or she always crushed on my best friend, or how she would always call me at like 11:00 on a school night and get mad when I don't pick up.\n\n\nSo I called Ben about this, and it turns out that he also realized the same kinda thing. So we stayed on the phone for around a half an hour, just venting about her and talking about wether we should tell her or not, and we come to the agreement that I should text her and tell her that i don't wanna be her best friend anymore because she was a being a pest.\n\nI texted her for about 2 or 3 hours, and the whole time she was being super guilty trippy and super mean, telling me that I'm (a bunch of swears and slurs and stuff), while telling me that she thinks I'm 'genuinely perfect', while being super self deprecating, saying she sucks and stuff. And from there, she blocked me. I felt incredibly relieved that I was officially not her friend anymore, yet that was about to change at school.\n\nThe next day, rumors went around that I bullied her, made fun of her, insulted her, and said that I had feelings for her. Not. True. My friends instantly realize this, and tell everyone about what was going on. Later that day, me and Ben went to our lockers while our other friend, let's call him Dave, was behind tying his shoe. As we're walking to our locker, we can hear Kara faintly whisper to Dave \"see!? They left you!!\" Which could only mean that Kara was trying to get my friends to turn on me. We go over and ask her what was going on, and she started buzzing on and on about us and how much of  an asshole we were\n\nThis went on for about a month, she would occasionally kick me and Ben, or throw apple seeds at us, and other dumb stuff. and no, my friends luckily didn't turn on me. Thankfully the water has settled, and nothing really happens anymore.\n \nbut ever since then, I've always kept the question. Am I The Asshole here?? She treated me like garbage and all, but I still don't know if im the Jerkwad here or what.",

      "description": "Submitting here because this is just a baffling situation to me, and I could use some help figuring out what, if anything, I did to earn the asshole title. \n\nRight. Rooming with a very good female friend for four months now. It's a pretty ideal living situation, both in terms of the place itself and how we get along as roomies. Both considerate and good at sharing space. We've known each other for two years now and are very comfortable together. I'd suspected that maybe right at the start of our friendship that she had some feelings for me, but we've been platonic buddies since then. I do still think she is quite physically attractive, although the idea of romance has long been closed off in my brain.\n\nWell: it's wicked cold last night, so we decide to stay in. Snuggled up on the couch with drinks and such. The movie ends and we're chatting, and, it happens - we start kissing. To the best of my knowledge it was a mutual-initiation thing; I don't know whose idea it was but I was very into her in that moment, and obviously she was into me. We ended up having sex. \n\n\"Awkward\" doesn't begin to describe the state of things at the moment - in truth, she's really very angry with me. Apparently I've ruined absolutely everything. She thinks we can't live together anymore - that not only has the friendship been tainted, but we can't possibly share a living space now that we've had a sexual relationship. \n\nI mean... I'm just incredibly confused, and can't really see why she's framing me as such a douche right now. Sure I could have stopped it from happening, but we were both into it, and I don't see why things have changed so drastically from 24 hours ago. If we feel like pursuing a relationship, we can; if not, that's fine, we can keep living together normally. It feels strange to say because I don't bear her any ill will in general, but right now I think she's being a bit of an asshole about it. At any rate I don't think I am. Granted if she's intent on kicking me out, obviously I'll go. And I certainly don't want to pick this hill to die on if I'm in fact a giant asshole whose too blind to see it. \n\nAITA?",

The other day I confessed and today I said I’d get her a new toothbrush. So I went and I got her one and toothpaste. I texted her and said “swing by [after work] for a gift 😎”. Which I thought was obvious it was the toothbrush because earlier I said I was getting one. She said “anniversary?” I said “that’s April dummy” (in all honestly I just realized our anniversary is coming up). Anyways she shows up in her car and I went out and said I want her to come in to show her this photo album I found and I gave her the toothbrush. Then she was pissed. I said sorry I didn’t realize she thought it was a really nice gift etc. Then she really seemed like she didn’t wanna come in and I said “do you really not wanna come in?” And she said no and she’s annoyed by me. And I said ok well I’ll see you later I guess. \n\nI get why she’s disappointed but idk why she’s mad at me. I feel like it’s just kinda to be pissed at me for that. ",

      "description": "Hey guys, I’m 20 now and last year I found out that my Grandpa that I grew up with was not my real grandpa and he was my Nana’s second husband.\n\nSo growing up, I’ve always been around my grandpa, let’s call him Poppie, because that’s what I always called him. Poppie was always there for me when I was sick, hurt, upset, and seeking advice, and he always told me the best stories and we watched Popeye the Sailor together all the time, even Naruto from time to time. Eventually as time went by, he got pretty ill and eventually passed when I was in middle school. I was devastated and I still miss him today, nothing was ever going to make me forget him.\n\nLast year, I was told by my mom that he was not my real grandpa and shockingly, my biological grandpa was still alive and out of no where he suddenly wants to meet me. I told my mom why he left and she said that my nana and him just didn’t work out. So I told her I need some time. I sat down with my dad and asked him about my biological grandpa and these were his words, “When he found out your mother was pregnant with you, he was disgusted and ashamed of your mom and didn’t want to do anything with her or even you, even after you were born, he didn’t want to be around.”\n\nSo this really pulled some heart strings in me and made me realize that this man probably didn’t want to be around at all. So it’s 2019 now and I’m still fighting with my mom and telling her that I don’t want to meet someone who never wanted to be around me in the first place, including his new family, I don’t want to meet any of them because they have never contacted me or ever wanted to be around me. I don’t want to see this man and not think of him as my grandpa, because my Poppie was someone who wasn’t even blood, and he still took care of me and loved me as if I was his family and that only made me love him even more.\n\nSo now I’m constantly going against my angry mom because I don’t want to see someone who vanished from my life because I was born. Am I the asshole for not wanting to meet him?",

He does like to eat a lot, but I don’t mind it at all for appearance. My only concern is I want him to be healthy, so whenever I make food I try to make normal portions and sometimes healthier options. I’m not trying to change his diet completely, just so that we’re both not eating super unhealthy stuff all the time. But he’ll complain about how he doesn’t like something I’ve made or it’s not enough, and once he’s done eating he sometimes wants me to make something else,\n\nI’ve told him that I’ve already made dinner and if he wants more food he can get it himself, but then he says since I’m in charge of food that I should be making enough for him because I know he has a big appetite. This can sometimes result in an argument and I start thinking maybe I should just cook extra food to make him happy. I don’t know. AITA?",

      "description": "My best friend (17f), who I'll call Marie, is a bit of a drama queen. She's also incapable of getting over her ex (who dumped her in December) and thus she seems to have a new boyfriend who she's 'in love' with every other day. It's really starting to get on my nerves, hearing endlessly about this new guy or that new guy, each one of them a lower standard than the rest. She's been with coke dealers, ninth graders, total mansluts, and guys who have girlfriends. She just keeps sinking lower and lower and it's really starting to get on my nerves, because every time she breaks up with a guy, she cries and cries and talks about how shitty her life is and promises that she's going to 'take two months to get it together' and focus on herself, but two days later she's got a new man that she's absolutely obsessed with. She stalks my instagram followers, my friends, even our friends' siblings looking for someone to date. She once drove through town (with myself and two of our other friends in the car), asking random guys on the street to be her prom date. She doesn't realize how much desperation is a turn off for guys.\n\nEverytime I bring this up to her, she either gets all sad and gives me the same 'pity me' kind of sob story, or she gets mad at me right back. It's driving me crazy, here!\n\nOn one hand, I know she's just trying to get over her ex and that she gets lonely. She's also a lovely person when she's not being absolutely insanely boy crazy, which is why I feel like TA. She takes me out on daytrips, buys me energy drinks when I've had a rough night, and generally she has been a very good friend to me outside of this insanity.\n\nBut on the other hand, this push-pull is really getting on my nerves. I don't know how to handle it, nor does anyone else. I'm thinking about just telling her that she's getting on my nerves with all of this, but I don't want her to be mad at me.\n\nSo, reddit.

Maybe for therapeutic purposes, and putting it all out there for me to see. We in general have open and honest communication. \n\nHe's talked about exes from his past, mainly drawing parallels to our current situation, probably for therapeutic reason. Some of them were very painful breakups - and I appreciate us sharing our processes that brought us to where we are now, I don't mind him wanting to reflect on these parts of his life with me at all.\n\nHowever, a few times, apropos of nothing, he'll just point out some thing's randomly, like 'I hooked up with her' 'I dated that girl' and then move on from that point. Or when we're watching some of his old holiday footage from Bali and he randomly points out a girl he had sex with. \n\nAnd it gets to me a little bit; these timeswhere he'll just blurt out these things from his past, without really having there be a bigger context or story to it.\n\n\nSo, at one point we're watching the telly and a travel ad comes on about going to South East Asia and having a Bali romance.\nHe turns to me, squeezes my thigh and says with a cheeky grin 'I've had a Bali romance', and then turns back.\nLike, what am I supposed to do, high five you and say good job, buddy?\n\nI tried to explain to him, that I don't necessarily need to hear about all of his past conquests just because he's had them and they pop up in his memory. It just makes me feel uneasy if that's literally all there is to the story.\nHe looked pretty down after I said it and we went to bed shortly after..\n\nHe's in general very thoughtful person, and we're very open about our feelings. He's helped me get better at speaking up about what I feel instead of burying things deep down. \nNormally thing bothering me will eat away at me for a while, before he'll force out of me what's on my mind and I finally share. Now I can bring these things up more organically as they occur. \nBut maybe I'm just being sensitive, since I'm ok with him talking about his exes in a more reflective way, but not just casually mentioning it - am I making mountains out of mole hills here? \n\n\nSo Reddit - AITA for asking to be spared the casual sprinkling of information of my BF's dating history?\n\n",

      "description": "2 months ago, I was in a 7 month relationship. She is a great girl! But she had horrible moments growing up (her mom died of cancer when she was 16). On a Friday, we had a huge fight because I lied about a job interview I attended (I didn't let her know about the interview, when she confronted me I lied and told her that the company called me a few hours prior to the interview. I felt bad and told the truth). We continued fighting and both went to bed mad at each other.\n\nOn the next day, we had to attend her friend's birthday party on a boat. We were still mad, but I had to pretend everything was OK so she wouldn't be uncomfortable among her friends.\n\nEventually we talk and things get better! She is suddenly smiling and upbeat, which made me more comfortable, but I noticed that she was constantly texting. I asked her if it was our principal (we're both teachers at a company) but she said it was her family group chat.\n\nI started getting really paranoid and decide to peek at her phone when she texted close to me (not proud of it, believe me).\n\nShe was texting the president of our company (she had a crush on him years before we started going out, and he started hitting on her after we started dating. But she always showed me whenever he was talking to her) the message she wrote was: \"whenever I see you, I just feel like holding your hand and smiling\"\n\nI grab a drink and confront her. We fought in the middle of the party. When I drove her home, she cried and apologized. Said that she only did it because she wanted attention from him and that she loved me, but I was feeling like shit and didn't want to see her anymore.\n\nWeeks go by and she texted me constantly, saying that I shouldn't hold that against her, that if I don't forgive her it's because I've never loved her, and how she always gets abandoned in her life (her mom left her when she died, and she claims I'm doing the same)\n\nThis is already too long, AITA for not being able to move past this? I just can't stop feeling like shit, and don't see a possibility of us getting back together. Even if there was such possibility, I feel like I can't trust her anymore. ",

She had taken a picture of us earlier. Today during breakfast, she asked if it's okay to post it on Instagram. I said no, im not comfortable with it. She got mad. Asked me why I came on an office trip if im being like this. \n\nShe told me I'm violating her rights by not letting her post it. I told her I was very reluctantly okay with the picture being taken. I'm not okay with it being posted. She still insists I'm violating her rights. She believes it's her right to post it now that she has the picture. \n\nSo my question is: just coz I said yes to photo being taken, does it make me the asshole to say she can't post it? Does she have a point in saying that picture being taken= her property? \n\nPs: she posted it after I walked off as she was getting loud",

      "description": "Some background: my (44F) mother-in-law (80F) is a very kind, dynamic woman who advocates for others and is active in her community. I look up to her in many ways. However, something that has always bothered me is that when she comes for extended visits—sometimes for 2 weeks, more often for 4-8 weeks—she never really checks with us to see if the dates/duration of visit work. She just tells us when she’s coming. \n\nI’m a teacher, and her visits tend to coincide with my school holidays. Also, they overlap with our visitation with my stepchildren, who are tweens and whose lives I have been in since they were toddlers. We have always lived a few states away from her and  for the past two years have lived several states away from the children. \n\nI do want her to visit and to have time with the children, but the visits tend to occupy most of my school holidays and most of the children’s visits. I would like to set some boundaries so that we have a week or two in the summer and two days on shorter holidays with the children so that we can take day trips (she drives, but we don’t want to leave her stranded without a vehicle). \n\nAlso, whereas she is retired, my own parents are in their late 50s/early 60s and still active in demanding careers. It’s difficult for them to get time off, and when they do visit, it’s for 3-4 days. I often am unable to have them visit during my time off because MIL is with us for an extended visit and there’s no room. \n\nLast year we moved farther away from my parents (an 18-hour drive instead of 6).. They have not been able to visit yet due to career obligations and cancer treatments (very treatable), but have given us a two-week block of time during which they would like to plan a 4-5 day visit this summer. \n\nAITA for wanting to tell MIL that any summer visits will need to be scheduled to avoid this block of time? She’s been here six weeks over the last nine months (she came less than a week after we moved in and stayed for a month), and while we now have the space to accommodate everyone, I don’t want to. I would like to be able to focus on my parents during their brief, rare visit. It’s early in the summer, so she can still visit for a month or more after their visit takes place: \n\nUsually when I ask my husband to talk to MIL about visits, he shrugs and says, “That’s just mom” or gets huffy and says she’s 80 and maybe I’ll be glad when she’s gone because then I won’t have to worry about it. I don’t want her to be gone. She’s a wonderful lady-a really considerate guest. I would just like to set some boundaries. ",

      "description": "I am moving out of my house this week. I lived here two years ago, left for a year and came back. I forgot a few things in the house including a tv my mom gave me and my Blendtec blender. By Washington state law, the property became their because I technically abandoned it the first time I left. \nThis time, I want to take these things with me but legally it’s their property. On the other hand, I have receipts for the blender ($425) and pictures of the tv in my old home from years ago. They told me I could take them at departure when I moved back in, but the climate has changed in the house. I’m nervous to ask them because they are on hard drugs and don’t remember what happened 20 minutes ago, so I wouldn’t expect them to remember something they said 2 months ago. \n\nAITA for wanting my things back? I plan to leave them my juicer which they love (also have $200 receipt) and my grow equipment which totals around $500- I left those here a while ago also. They’ve also stolen things from me since being here, so I have a hard time feeling guilty about taking things my mom and I originally paid for. ",

We basically stopped talking completely during those 2 weeks, and I took comfort in one of our mutual friends (we'll call her SF), who was there for me the whole time. \n\nThis past weekend the ex and I decided to talk about everything and he admitted to kissing SF a couple days after we broke up. They were both going through some rough emotional times, and he said they both took comfort in knowing that the other cared about them. He's the one who initiated the kiss, but SF didn't have to kiss him back (she had a bf at the time). They have both apologized to me and said it was a mistake and shouldn't have happened, but I feel betrayed, especially since SF never mentioned the kiss to me, I had to find out through my ex. SF acted like my friend the whole time, without me knowing that she kissed him.\n\nEx said he's been enjoys spending time with me since we've been seeing each other more after the break, likes being around me and is considering getting back together with me but I told him I wouldn't take him back unless he cut SF out of his life. \n\nI feel really conflicted asking this of him, because I feel like it's too controlling, but he's the one who broke my trust and kissed our friend. He said he doesn't have any feelings for her, but I think SF might have feelings for him. I get friends can care deeply about each other, but not to the point of kissing right after he broke up with me.\n\nAm I the asshole for making him do this?",

      "description": "(Very weird title I’m sorry). And I’m on mobile.\n\nBackstory: I (14F) love the theatre, and so does my mum, so I figured “let’s get her surprise tickets to see her favourite musical- Les mis”\n\nI book the tickets (£60) and picked a date that she wasn’t doing anything. I subtlety hinted ‘hey we should do something for your birthday on X day’ but I didn’t say the time (as I didn’t want to make it obvious). The original plan was to go out from 3PM or so, take her out to dinner/lunch, have a walk around London (you know, normal mother/daughter bonding stuff) and then “surprise! Theatre tickets” at 7PM.\n\nNow here’s the issue: (THIS IS PURELY HYPOTHETICAL, and not exactly what happened)\n\nLet’s say I hear her talking about stuff on that day that I booked out, and it’s in the morning, running into the afternoon (she plays sports) and then possibly the evening (5PM) or so. Because I didn’t specify the time of the event, she assumed ‘oh it’s the evening how nice!’ But it’s not just the evening, it’s all day.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to cancel all her plans from 3PM onwards that day? Or if she planned an event thinking our little day out would last only a couple hours? Then what happens if it’s semi-important work stuff and she simply can’t miss it. What happens then? WIBTA still if I asked her/made her cancel the plans? This hasn’t happened of course, but I’m kinda worried it might, as its happened occasionally, but for other events.\n",

      "description": "AITA?  I was head hunted by a recruiter three weeks ago about an opportunity high up in the sales team at  a small but reputable company in my industry.  It would be the next step up for me in job level and a bump in pay but come with a lot of travel.  I went through many calls with the recruiter who was excellent and covered the travel portion of the job extremely thoroughly.  The VP who would be my boss flew out to meet me and took my wife and I out to dinner to make sure we were ok with the travel as a family.  They flew me out to their HQ the next week (this week) and went through another round of interviews before they made me an offer yesterday.  \n\nThey had a great idea as to what I make now and made a offer about 10-12% above that.  Not exactly what I was hoping for but I was prepared to negotiate a low ball.  I spoke to the recruiter (who was negotiating the offer with me) thanked him for the consideration, informed him I wanted a little time to consider the offer against all options and it would be helpful to know if there was any flexibility in the offer and when they needed an answer back by as the offer letter did not have a expiration date.  No date was given but he said there was flexibility and we agreed to talk again in the morning.  \n\nWe spoke this morning around 10.  I told him given the amount of travel and home life impacts my wife and I agree we were both looking for more money to make the time away worth it.  I was prepared to accept a good offer but the +10% offer was at the extreme low end of my expectations.  I felt there was an extra 5-10% on the table.  Keep in mind this is for a high level sales position, speaking with the VP of sales through the recruiter.  We end the call with the recruiter going back to the VP.  At 12:30 I get an email from the HR rep who emailed the offer letter the day before closing the offer because it appears the travel is too much for me.  \n\nAm I the Asshole?",

A while later in a science class J was in, J brought up the diss track again, My friend, lets call her A, usually helped me write my music, she didn't know about the diss track, I hadn't even started because I thought J was joking. So me and A agreed to actually make the diss track. \n\nJ gets really triggered if anyone even mentions anything relating to gay around him, so me and A had planned to make the diss track mostly us calling J gay. Keep in mind J clearly knew all of this was a joke. Me and A came up with the name \"J couldn't be gayer\" (it was his name instead of J) and J knew of this. He was fine with it.\n\nMe and A were planing out merch (idk we didn't want to do work) and we decided to put the title of the diss track down. J than proceeds to snatch the paper from us, get upset at us for calling him gay, and give it to our teacher. Skip forword a few days, our teacher gets a call from guidance \"You and A are going to guidance\" (not actually what was said). The guidance asks us our side of the story, we explain what happened to her. The guidance made me and A apologize to J, so we did.  \n\nWhat bothers me is how J was fine with the name, but all the sudden he's triggered. Keep in mind that me and J had been friends for a pretty long time and he clearly knew I was joking. I'm now banned from J's discord server and also blocked. \n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I used to work at a camping facility back around 2015. The property was on grounds leased from the local state park, there were cabins and a theater etc and it was rented out to different groups every week. Usually schools on weekdays and church groups or other kinds of groups during the weekends and summer. I was there for weekend and summer groups, I was basically a slave for the group leaders and did whatever they needed such as setting up bonfires on the beach, moving the heaviest fucking mattresses in the world, unlock doors, or random stupid shit that you would never believe somebody would request. We had two different shifts, one from morning until mid-day, the other was mid-day to around midnight.\n\nWe worked in shifts, generally two or three hosts working at a time and we would often split up easy tasks to get work done faster, or if it involved heavy lifting we would always work together since it was hard work. I was 18 at the time and summer had started meaning I was there full time. During this time a few girls who worked with the school groups transferred into my department for the summer. Now this particular girl, let's call her Brittney. Brittney was rude, she was lazy, and she was sexist. I hated working with Brittney because she would always sit in the golf cart (we rode around the property on golf carts to move stuff quickly) and not do anything. If I called her out on it she would always say something like \"you call yourself a man? You should be able to do it yourself\", or \"you need to man up\". Nevermind the fact that this was always during heavy lifting. I don't care so much doing the small stuff by myself, but I'm not a big fan of doing a two person job alone.\n\nNow the thing about Brittney is that she had a nice car, and it was her baby. She put her entire pay from this job into payments for that car. It was brand new to that current year, it was far more than she could afford at that stage of her life, especially with that job, but it was her treasure and she always talked about it. The rest of us drove older cars because we were pretty young, and she would always try to flex about her poor financial decision.\n\nAnother thing I should mention is we had two parking lots at the camp. One was very close to the facilities and there were some spots along the side of the road next to that parking lot, the the other was at the top of a steep hill and quite the walk. We were supposed to park at the top of the hill and let the guests have the better parking spots. This wasn't a hard written rule but was something we did in the summer and the bosses were kind of strict about it so I was supposed make sure staff didn't park in the parking lot at the bottom of the hill, or especially along the road next to it.\n\nNow one particular day when I was working Brittney was the only other host on staff that day. That means she's sitting in the golf cart while I'm moving mattresses and water jugs, I'm setting shit up while she's telling me to man up and I had enough. I wanted to tell the boss about how she'd been acting, but the boss *loved* Brittney, and the boss didn't like me so much (I had gotten in trouble previously for reporting something a coworker did, boss blamed it on me because the coworker I reported was the son of a higher staff member) so that wasn't an option. I'd had it at that point. It was fucking hot, I had been working hard all day and I was tired of Brittany's shit. I was ready to snap but I controlled my anger. It was the end of my shift so I put away my radio and badge and headed out, ready to walk up that steep hill in a heat wave during July to get in my car and go home. And then, guess who parked at the bottom of the hill... Brittney. The timing was just too perfect. I didn't even think about it. I reached into my pocket, grabbed my keys, and as I passed her car I left a nice, deep scratch all down the side from front to back and just kept on walking. I thought for sure I'd get caught somehow. Then that same night somebody egged her. The next day she comes in complaining that somebody egged and keyed her car, she said her neighbor did it which meant I was off the hook. I eventually quit that job a few weeks later.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hiya, Reddit. I'm pretty much new here. I've heard of the many stories that this site has to offer, and it's gotten to the point where I want to try posting something. I figured I would start here.  \n\n\nAnyways. This happened about a year or two ago, so I'll be fuzzy on some details, most likely.  \nAlso sorry in advance if I make some sort of error in my post.  \n\n\nIn my Junior year, one of my friends who I known since Elementary, had one day came up to me and asked if I would go out with her. I known her pretty well, we used to play and hang out at the local park quite a bit. We actually dated earlier in those days too, but my mom had us break up after she found us doing naughty stuff over the phone (you can probably guess what that was.) She had been going to my high school for awhile, but we would from time to time talk to each other in the hallways.   \n\n\nI had agreed on her offer. We would of course talk over Facebook, occasionally go out and browse stores, hang out at her house, etc.. She of course was kind, and a sweetheart. From the last time we had dated, it did seem like she was more clingy than usual. Probably just misses me, I guess. For the first 6 months or so, I was alright with it. But I did have moments where I just didn't want to really be around anyone. I probably should also mention that I don't really like having lots of friends or interacting with people very much. I usually kept to myself in classes, and more often than not, would do group projects alone, that kind of thing.\n\nI would occasionally find myself being slightly irritated to be suddenly hugged or to have her run up alongside me in the halls on those days, but I kept quiet about it as I really don't like upsetting people if I have to. She would also try to find out every class that I went to, and any classes she did find, she would often dash her way to them when the bell rings just to catch me. Other times, she might wait at the class I go to next. Often, she will hug and kiss on me, staying with me as long as possible. Up to the bell, in the most extreme cases.",

      "title": "AITA for crying when my mom made pork",
      "description": "TL;DR: Pork is basically people and I cried when mom made pork after I asked her not to.\n\nOk, this requires a little backstory. I(29F) live with my parents while I go to school full time to be an X-ray Technologist. Long story really short, my dad was diagnosed with cancer last year and my parents offered to pay for me to go back to school if I moved back home and kept an extra eye on dad. (I own a house in the midwest.)\n\nI'm about a year into my RADT program and I've seen all sorts of really nasty stuff at clinical. Part of our program requires us to spend X amount of hours in the OR(operating room) working the C-arm. Now, to the pork thing. Ever since I started in OR I developed a severe aversion to the smell of unseasoned pork as it cooked. It might have something to do with the smell that comes from cauterizing.\n\nI'm happy to cook meals for my parents, and I am a pretty good cook. But I've asked respectfully that if they plan on making pork meals, that they heavily season it(Garlic, herbs, bbq). Mom seemed a little taken aback and asked me why. I explained that it had to do with my experience in the OR and the smells. She seemed to understand and agreed she wouldn't make pork.\n\nSo 5:30 rolls around and no one has asked me to make dinner, and it doesn't seem dinner is in the works so I figured it was a 'fend for yourself' night. I come downstairs and am assaulted by the smell of boiling pork.\n\nMe: \"So what are you making.\"\n\nMom: \"a ham\"\n\nOK I'm panicking. She opens the lid of the \\*slow cooker\\* and I see something that vaguely resembles a pale ass cheek swimming in some tan liquid. I'm sweating from nausea. 5 minutes go by and dad comes up the stairs and says, \"Can you check to see if the veggies are done?\" (I get asked to do this a lot because my parents don't know what a cooked carrot is supposed to look like, I guess.) \n\nI open the lid and I shit you not there is a pot full of pork stock filled with potatoes, carrots and greenbeans. Literally no seasoning. Just Pork Flavored Boiled Vegetables.\n\nIs there no pork-free option? The finished \"ham\" literally looks like the inside of someone's ass cheek while they do a posterior hip replacement.\n\nVoice shaking I say to dad(mom is downstairs) \"I can't eat this\"\n\nDad, \"Why not?\"\n\nMe, \"I've explained that I can't do pork...\"\n\nDad, \"When did you say that?\n\nMe, \"Around the time I started OR -\" I'm starting to cry.\n\nDad, \"Well are you going to eat it?\"\n\nMe, voice cracking \"no...\"\n\nDad, Loudly, \"What?\"\n\nMom comes back up stairs, \"Whats wrong?\"\n\nMe, actually crying now, \"I'm sorry I can't eat this!\"\n\nMom makes an indignant sound and I run upstairs. And now I'm typing this story.  So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": " Hey, using a throwaway since he uses Reddit. I know it probably seems like such a small thing that it'd be SHP or ESH for being so petty and wasting everyone's time, but this is honestly the last straw for me and I feel really hopeless and unable to distinguish which one of us is right anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're sitting in a voice channel in Discord bored just regurgitating stupid shit for around an hour or so, and I decide to ask \"hey do you have any suggestions for what to do?\" All I get is \"bruh\" as a joke answer, which I laugh off and say \"okay but really what should I do?\" I ask this 2 more times until I finally get fed up and say \"I'm looking for a serious answer, just please give me suggestions or just a simple no\" to which he lashes out and says \"You got pissy immediately and mood switched in a millisecond because I didn't conform to your mood swing at all.\" and proceeds to say \"Sorry I can't read your mind about what you want mlady because your emotions are never in check\" and leaves, proceeding to say maybe he'll talk to me later. It seems really petty and small, but I just need to give background context to say why I'm so fed up with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've known this guy for a year and I consider him to be my best friend, but there's times that he's purposely made me feel like shit and made it indistinguishable whether he was right or wrong. If he ever does get caught up in it and admit he's wrong about something, he'll apologize and say he'll change, but will promptly go back to his old ways. He takes medication for anger issues which can get out of hand if he isn't on them, which he isn't this week due to personal reasons he won't disclose (I'm fine with that and I won't prod). Some of these outbursts have led to him telling me he wishes I was dead (only once) and saying that I'm making no progress towards mental health recovery (in therapy and on medication currently for depression and mood regulative issues).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really sorry if this post seems small and petty. I'm 15, he's 19, and even if it's petty teen bullshit, I don't know what to do. This is my best friend, but he always makes me feel like shit when he's off his medication and tries to pin it off like it's my fault. We've been in an on again off again relationship (legal here) and there's nobody I'd rather be around, but I'm starting to wonder if my perception is really altered to the point where I feel like only I can do anything wrong in this. This is just a small instance in a series of things that have happened, not just this one petty stupid incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if there's not enough info, I'm just really shaken up over his reaction and it's bringing up past memories, so my recollection may not be as clear as necessary.",

      "description": "Ok so we were having a discussion the other day about gay people having children. My mum said kids should have a mother and father 🙄. I said there’s plenty of people who split up, a parent dies etc and the kid is fine. She said but having a mother and father is still better...I said not necessarily. If those parents were abusive, poor and couldn’t care properly for their kids then they’re not gonna be better than two parents of the same sex who aren’t abusive and can financially and emotionally support their kids. She then said that money had nothing to do with it and a poor heterosexual would be much better parents than a financially stable gay couple 🤦🏻‍♀️ \n\nI said that’s bullshit. I said us not having a lot of money growing up did badly affect me. It made everything a lot harder, my mental and physical health suffered because of it. I also said that my parents constant arguing and fighting with one another, plus my mothers constant screaming at me affected me badly and it would have been better for me to be bought up by gay people who could finically support me and who didn’t give me severe anxiety from the constant fighting. \n\nShe’s now not talking to me. Calling me disrespectful, saying she gave up a lot for me and I’m ungrateful. \n\nSo AITA for saying this, or is she the asshole? ",

      "description": "So im gonna start with a little bit of background information: Be me, 22 y/o male in the middle of his in-firm training (takes 3 years), who has been in a relationship with his first gf for almost 6 years. Fly to the USA for 4 weeks as a part of your training. Get your ass dumped via whatsapp after you´ve been there for 1 week because of another guy that she met (he gave her a ride from our hometown to the city where she studies for the last 1 1/2 years). Get messages like \"Cant i be a little bit happy?\" or \"You havent cared about me in our relationship\". Be sad as fuck, eat like once a day, no sleep because of jetlag + fucked up mentality. Cant enjoy the time you have there because you cant get a clear minute. Come back home after 4 weeks.\n\nThats where im gonna start. Of course she wanted to talk to me about everything and at the time i was abroad i also wanted to know why, but as i returned back home after 4 weeks full of shit i was so done with her. I didnt want to speak to her or ever see her again, even if the time we had together was beautiful and i loved her more than anything else. I can understand if you break up if you have the feeling that it just doesnt work anymore, but not like this, not after almost 6 years. Was that what i deserved? To be dumped like someone she barely knew and didnt care about? I felt so worthless for about 2-3 months. Without my friends and my parents i probably wouldnt be where i am right now and i spent the first few weeks talking with them about what happend so i could process it. \n\nAlmost everybody told me that i should not answer her messages or calls anymore, and that was just what i did. Of course she kept writing me, but i just ignored her. After a few months it started getting better and i didnt have to think about her all the time.\n\nNow, after almost 1 year (all this took place in June 2018), she is blaming me that her conscience is bothering her and that she has to think about me alot, that she cant concentrate on her studies and that the relationship with her new bf suffers from her having to think about me. So basically she states that all this happened because i didnt want to settle things with her, but i really dont give a damn about what she thinks or how she feels now. AITA for this?",

Then he said “I didn’t get that job I went for” and I text back saying “awww best of luck next time, love ya x” \n\nLater on I call him again in anger saying “this is why I can’t be with you” and I told him a few reasons why, I also told him not to come to my birthday.\n\nLater that night he sleeps with someone....  the next day I call him telling him to come over and we sort stuff out. \n\nI don’t see it as a PROPER break up just like Rachel didn’t, but he saw it as the end and wanted attention when he was dumped just like Ross did.\n\nSometimes in my head I see it as “we argued and he slept with someone” and it gives me quite bad anxiety worrying about it ever happening again. \n\n",

I gave her my opinions on it and how I felt like she was doing the right thing for herself but at the same time I felt like her and her friend should maybe have a heart-to-heart because they've been friends for a really really long time (it's also her cousin) and it was very important to her that they stayed friends. \n\nThe way things were going they were just going to not be friends eventually and she plans on moving in a little while and she considered just having that be a reset button and I was saying how eventually she's going to have friendships like that no matter where she lives and she's not always going to be able to do a full reset like that. I said it wouldn't maybe be a bad thing to try to work this friendship out before she leaves and at least try to figure something out because she's not always going to be able to just move away.

      "description": "So some backstory, in my English class we are studying a text by a Nigerian women, it's basically a collection of short stories with there own characters focused around the lives on women in Africa during certain events.\n\nWe where given the essay topic\n\n\"Jumping monkey hill highlights the pressures women are placed under at the hands of men\".\n\nI chose to do the thing that every other teacher at my school recommends and agree/disagree not completely either. So I said that yes it does show that but it also shows how men can be placed under that same pressure. (As it does, it's about a group of people at a writing conference (men and women) and the old man running it is a pedophile who harras some of the women, the story rather clearly shows the men feel pressure not to say any thing as the man can provide them with opportunity. (Very clear).\n\nI got my essay back and the teacher *corrected* my intention to be that women as supposed to what I originally said \"jumping monkey hill explores how women are pressured by those around them, however it also highlights that men can face the same pressure\"\n\nShe \"corrected\" it to not include the bit about men. \n\nWhen she came over and asked me (and the rest of the table) if we had any questions about our feedback. I in no uncertain way said that I think she's wrong, and that the point of a contention is to state your interpretation, my interpretation was that and she has no right to edit that contention if it's completely related to the essay topic as it was. \n\nEveryone at my table seemed to think I was being rude and sexist for pointing that out.... \n\nThis was a practise essay but I just got the three options for our assessed essay and all three focus exclusively on women (although the story does explore things like religion, race, war, politics, immigrants and so much else) even things that could super easily be multi gender she's chosen to say only happen to women. \n\nAm I the asshole for choosing to disagree with these topics all going along how women are the victims ect ect.\n\n*I'm not sexism I believe in just testing everyone the same, if gender isn't needed to make a point (and imo the only time it is is when talking about physical differences) I just don't think you should make things about gender, if she was doing the same thing about men my response would be the same.* ",

      "description": "My 6 year old daughter recently confided to her grandma (my mother-in-law) that she doesn’t like the coat that she currently has because it’s black and she wants a pink one. The coat that she has is a very nice, very warm, very expensive Columbia coat that is in perfect condition. It’s a hand-me-down from a family member which is why she didn’t get to choose the color in the first place and we can’t afford coats in that price range so I jumped at the opportunity to get her this one. This coat will easily fit her for the next 1-2 years.\n\nWell now my mother-in-law wants to buy her a new pink coat for Christmas and I said absolutely not. While I understand she just wants her granddaughter to be happy, I’m trying to raise my children to appreciate what they have and to not have to mindset that you can just toss a perfectly good coat because it’s not your favorite color and that she should be happy that she even has a coat in the first place.\n\nEveryone seems to think I’m being mean and I should just let her get a new coat.

      "title": "AITA for never giving to charity?",
      "description": "So when I was a youngster I did an internship in a charity. During that time I learned several things about the charity business in general. Nothing secret, things that many people already know, but they were things that made me uncomfortable nonetheless and so I decided that day that I would never give money to charities ever. For reference the things that many of you already know or can guess are that:\n\n- Only a small portion of what you give is actually used to help people.\n\n- A big portion of what you use is used to advertise for the charity instead of directly helping people\n\n- The advertisement is showing you more misery and poverty than the situation warrant to guilt you into giving more money. For instance I was in a charity that was helping orphans. They were pictured in the ads with dirty clothes in shabby rooms but in fact they were well taken care of with good clothes, good food, spacious individual rooms and entertainment.\n\n- The advertisement is sometime kinda racist. For instance a charity helping children in poor neighborhood will picture cute little helpless white kids instead of kids of colors despite the fact that they represent the majority of children in this situation.\n\n- The CEO and top managers of the most famous charities are rich AF with their huge salary paid with the donation of poor people (most people who give are poor).\n\n- Most people working in charities see it just as another business and our donation is used as a resource to extract the most efficient way possible.\n\n- Many of those charities have hidden political or ideological agendas I disagree with (some are against LGBT, some will help only a portion of the population by targeting an ethnicity, some will have unsavory links with a shady government, etc).\n\n- If I give money to one of them, I wonder if my money would not be more helpful another way. What’s more important, feeding poor people or cure cancer?\n\n- Sometime it feels like whatever the amount of money you give, it doesn’t have any impact. The world is still a shitty place and it doesn’t seems to change\n\n- When you give money, you enter a database and you can expect to receive mails designed to guilt you for the rest of your life.\n\n\nI know all about the rational and perfectly sensible answers for each of those point. Yes, charities are helpful and people should give to them. I’m not trying to convince anyone and I think that people who give are praiseworthy. But I just don’t want to be a part of it.\n\nI have given some of my time to another charity later in my life and I’m not against giving money directly to homeless people (not everyone I cross on my road or else I would join them).\n\nExcept that I discovered that most people I know have one or two charities they give to and budget for it. When I told them I didn’t want to give money to charities they acted shocked, start arguing with me and made me feel like an asshole.\n\nSo am I?\n",

      "description": "To set the scene a bit, I'm 27 and my girlfriend is 24. Me moved in together a few months ago, been together about a year and a half. I've always made it clear since the start of the relationship that I don't want to date smokers. She had told me she had smoked when she dated an ex years ago but she ended up not liking what it did to her. She had told me she never wants to do it again.\n\nLately she's been very stressed between work and financial problems. Today she told me she had bought a hooka pen. I was perplexed but said ok. Then she tells me that she also contacted someone about getting weed. Since I didn't make it clear before, weed is the one I had a problem with. Hooka I wouldn't have minded as much. Weed however is something that I don't want to do, or be in a relationship with someone that does. I didn't come right out and say that I was upset but she could tell I was annoyed and left the conversation.\n\nTurns out she went ahead and met up with the person and bought some. She came home and could tell I was upset. I told her how I felt, stating that I told her from the start that I don't like it. She said I can't be mad at her about it, it's her decision. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset here? Is it her choice and I'm overreacting? ",

      "description": "Some context: \n\nIn December, a bunch of us went on a night out for my coursemate's 21st birthday. After a great night, I ask if two of the three friends in this group want to go back to theirs or mine (they both live together) and play Mariokart. One girl (A) invites me back and the other girl (B) is fine with it, but puts herself to bed as soon as we get back. \n\nAfter talking on the couch for hours with A, and me lowkey confessing to having a crush, I then say that I'm ready to settle and sleep. She joins me on the couch, we make out, it's great. B kind of guessed what happened after seeing us on the couch together in the morning. \n\nWe both go home for Christmas and I spend most of my time talking to A, and the feelings don't go away. However, I tell A that if B is uncomfortable with this, I will stop trying to make it work. A tells me it will all be okay and to not worry. \n\nA comes back to our uni town a day before B, so I stay over after watching movies and catching up, and eventually we fully hook up. B knows I was there the night before, but we haven't told her I stayed over in fear of her getting mad. She started being rude to A after this night, because A wasn't messaging her on command. \n\nA has been spending more time with me, as there is a cycle of B getting angry, A getting stressed and leaving the house, meeting me and often sleeping over. B has spent the past two weeks trying to shift the blame onto A for this, saying that she feels lonely because we hang out as a duo more. I've tried my best to organise things to do as a group (with our other friend (C) too) but she has cancelled all plans suggested as she feels awkward hanging around with us. \n\nI invited B to my house last Wednesday and essentially told some stuff that reflects on my actions for being secretive after she told me that she feels like she's being treated like an idiot for A and I not being explicit in what we are doing. I think things will return back to normal. \n\nThey won't. \n\nB won't talk to me or even look at me. If A mentions my name, she gets defensive and acts rude to A or myself. She only talks when I'm not a part of the conversation. She barely let's A leave the house to hang out with me, and sends cruel messages to A if she's not home by a certain time. Myself, A and C have all tried to talk to B about this, and B has admitted that it's a conscious decision to be rude, telling A that she doesn't like seeing us together because it makes her feel lonely, and that she wants A to spend more time with her again. I told her multiple times if she wasn't comfortable I would stop coming onto A, but B hasn't said anything until last night, to which neither myself nor A want to stop seeing each other. But it's hurting our whole friendship group, we can't walk around as a group and I'm either silent in conversation or B refuses to hang out with us. \n\nAITA for wanting to continue to see the person I like, knowing that it is hurting our other best friend and there is a real possibility it'll tear our friendship group apart? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Me and a friend started seeing each other, our other friend is really unhappy about it and won't talk to me.

When we get there we have a good time and we both drink a fair amount, but he definitely drank more than I did. He ended up drunk while I was pretty buzzed. Next thing I know he is talking to his ex, and when I tried to stop him he told me they were just making conversation and that nothing would happen, so I let him be and talk to some other friends. I decide to go check up on him and I saw him and her entering a bedroom while holding hands. Thinking that he would definitely regret it later, I went into the bedroom and said that cops were coming to the party and we had to leave, which was the only reasonable excuse I could think of to get him out of there, and he was so drunk that I basically had to carry him to my car where we slept. The next morning he insisted that I was an asshole for not letting him get laid, even if it was his ex gf, while I insisted that he would regret it later. AITA?",

The one from our previous marriage had  not involved in any extracurricular activities outside of school so far.\n\n\n\nThat said, my husband works at a gym that teaches all sorts of martial arts, so you can imagine how excited he was when our oldest said he wanted to start practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu! The same day our kid told us, he got it cleared with his boss and told us at dinner that his boss was perfectly okay with him training at their gym for free. \n\n\n\n\nWe thought he would be excited, but he was seemingly disappointed. He said he did not want to train at the same gym at my husband, because it would be weird to get lessons from him. (My husband teaches Brazilian Jiu Jitsu every other day) I think my husband was hurt by this, but told him it would be fine if he went only on the days he was teaching the cardio classes so that they wouldn't  train together, but our son wasn't having it. He said it's not fair that the other kids were getting their activities paid for, and that we couldn't pay for his. I sort of see where he's coming from, I'm sure at his age it seems unfair, but my husband was not having it. He told him he should be grateful for the free lessons, and that he would be learning the same things at a gym we pay for anyways. They had an argument, and now our son is accusing us of playing favorites, as we pay for the other kids' stuff.\n\n\n\n\nI'm honestly torn about the situation. Like I said, I'm sure as a teenager it may seem like getting the hand me down clothes while everyone else gets brand new stuff. At the same time, my husband insists that it would be wasteful to pay for something that is being offered for free, and I see that point. The lessons he would be getting at another gym cost around $120 a month in a class setting, and $200 plus a month for the hour and a half long private and semi private lessons he would be getting for free at my husband's gym. To play devil's advocate though, I think my husband was very hurt at our son not wanting to train with him after he got so excited about it all, and at this point is just trying to win the argument. \n\n\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think? Is it fair to stand our ground and tell him to attend my husband's gym, or is it fair to pay for lessons elsewhere? I honestly want to be fair to everyone, and make sure nobody gets their feelings hurt!",

      "description": "My wife and I recently booked a 3 week trip to go to Europe this summer and have been getting new stuff in preparation. This past weekend we went to the mall to find new shoes that would be ergonomic, low profile, yet fashionable to match the few articles of clothing we’ll be bringing. Keep in mind, we’re trying to save as much as possible at this point.\n\nWe first stopped by a sports shop, saw some Nikes that almost fit the bill. I should mention upfront that when I buy stuff in-store, I occasionally check online reviews to see what the general consensus is. These first pairs we looked at apparently wear out pretty easily. So we passed on them.\n\nAfter a few different other stores and no luck, we stumbled across Vans. Right away I found a pretty awesome pair of kicks that looked great. We were greeted by a super personable associate that had the exact same pair of shoes on. He told us they were comfortable and would hold up to the kind of trekking we would be doing. He grabbed me a pair and my wife a pair of the female version. He was right. They fit great and wouldn’t look awkward if I was wearing either jeans or shorts. He continued to help us out, showed me socks that would look good with the shoes, gave us more info on the shoes.\n\nI checked out the price for both our shoes, $115 CAD each. Not bad. Could be worse, could be better.\n\nMe, being my inquisitive self, checked out the reviews on Google to see what they said. The overall average score for the shoe was 92%. But as I was scrolling through the search results, I stumbled upon a listing of the exact same shoe for $79.99 CAD through a different retailer. This wasn’t intentional, it just happened and it struck me odd the prices would be so jarringly different.\n\nI showed my wife, didn’t make a big deal of it. The associate asked me if I had any questions. This is pretty much where I should’ve stopped and thanked him for his help and left, but I made the mistake of asking if they price-matched other retailers. The guy was confused. Why would the Vans store have to price-match their own product? So I showed him. He said no, and seem pissed. Told me that this specific retailer wasn’t allowed to be selling the same product at that price.\n\nI started to feel bad. We either try to save $40 or buy the pair from the sales associate. I asked if they made commission, but he didn’t outright say. By this point, my wife and I had decided on these shoes. So we decided to get her shoes at here and buy mine online.\n\nAs we walked away, I asked my wife if IWTA in that situation. She didn’t say anything and just shrugged. Still feel like I should’ve tipped the guy for helping my wife and I, but we never carry cash on us.\n\nThis post is probably a non-issue. But wanted to get your guys’ take on this. Would you guys have done the same thing? AITA? I’ve also been in retail positions were I did and didn’t make commission. I’ve even sold shoes at one point too. Definitely felt bad about this though.",

Later on, as it was around time for my exams, I decided to like and comment on her *recent* posts, such as any pictures that she uploaded and all. Not all of them are pictures of her, but sometimes its animals and just photography, you get the point. Anyways, so I decided to like her pictures and leave witty comments to show off and all. She didn't respond, but her friends did and they were shipping us together, all's good right?\n\nThen shit hits the fan when a few days later, the chemistry teacher who I'm close with (I don't do chemistry myself) approached me and told me to stop pursuing my then crush because she and her two best friends told the chemistry teacher about my actions and dubbed it \"stalking\" and \"creepy\".\n\nI don't know about you all, but me almost getting in trouble during a critical time of my life, which is exams, could be devastating to my future, since I don't want to be expelled from school for having an attraction to someone else and showing it. \n\nAfterwards, I just stopped talking to her and to this day I still feel resentful towards what happened, I don't interact with her but I do tell people who ask \"why don't I hang out or talk to her\" this story.",

But everyone then started attacking me calling me a 'bad host' and 'its rude to leave early, before the game has finished'! I was pretty pissed off at this point  so i just left and said goodnight. \nConfronted my parents about it just now and they started saying i was the asshole and shouldn't have done that.

      "description": "Firstly, I'm very new to this sub, so please let me know if I'm breaking any rules or leaving anything important out.\n\nKinda long backstory that I apologize for, but I think is all relevant:\n\nIt's my first semester ever at college, and I meet this really awesome guy named Tyler. We end up spending nearly all of our free time together but, unlike me Tyler is an out of state student. Eventually, I learn he wouldn't be able to go home nearly all year because of how expensive airfare was. Naturally, as we become closer friends, I get the idea to invite him to my house for spring break because 1) that sounded awesome 2) why the hell not?\n\nFast forward, and my relationship with my high school friends that also go to this college is kind of collapsing. I always knew all of us were going to try and make our own lives in college, but they were also the people I had such deep relationships with for four years. And now they were now blowing off plans and and just getting so distant so fast. This set me off on the horrible idea of uninviting Tyler, because I desperately needed my home to feel like home, and as great as Tyler was, that just wouldn't be completely authentic with him there.\n\nUnfortunately, I've been going back and forth on this for so long, by now it's like three days before everybody leaves for break. I go knock on his door and muster my courage to tell him. Unfortunately, its not until it's too late that I remember him saying a few days ago that he's also been missing his home a lot more than he expected, but he can't even talk to his parents about it because he doesn't want them to know how hard it's hitting him.\n\nBut again, the deed is done, and he even gives me an out. He says he gets what I'm feeling and while he obviously would prefer to go with me, he's not going to force the decision if I obviously feel uncomfortable with it.\n\nTo come to the present, this is where it gets kind of brutal. The first time we meet up after break, I can tell the energy just isn't there. He then tells me that his break was really, really horrible. There were definitely more awful experiences, but in summary, for the first week or so, he stopped regularly eating and sleeping, and pretty much didn't leave his bed all day. He also had a panic attack and kind of an overall depressive episode over being so homesick and very much alone for two weeks.\n\nObviously in hindsight, I would've never uninvited him or taken his out, had I known how awful his break would've been, but I had to prioritize myself at the time.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm a blood donator and this discussion is dating about half a year back and is going on from when my gf found out that I donate blood.\n\nShe has her own opinion about donating based on anegdotal stories she heard from her family - and is strongly against it.\nAccording to her, some members of her family did not recive blood units that they needed and she didn't try explaining me properly why (my understanding is that they \"weren't high priority\" or some sort of that) altrough they are all alive, very well being and I saw them myself.\nShe also believes that colected blood is beeing sold thorugh gov. agencies and that it doesn't reach people that need it.\n\nEver since she found out about me donating, she's been pressuring me to stop my donations. I say \"alright I understand that you don't trust donations help people, but can you please collect some evidence about it and I will gladly discuss it with you and if you have the stronger point I will stop\". She says \"fine\". Time passes and she haven't done any research, didn't talk to mentioned damaged family members and haven't gone to any local colector institution to inform herself about donation.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is lot of foul things going on in our society and I understand that. It just sounds a little bit ridiculous to me that there is conspiracy aimed at us for milking our blood. Yes I know that system is not working perfect and bad things tend to happen for time to time, but seriously, this?\n\nI believe that percentage of donors is small and that it's the main problem with availability. It makes me happy when I help people, it makes me feel good, it's healthy for me and I want to be the part of the solution not the problem.\n\nThe climax happend today when I wanted to go to donation appointment and she says \"If you go there today I'm afraid that this will not work out and I have to part ways with you\". Which means that she set me an ultimatum, don't donate - or i will brake up with you. \"It makes me sad that my grandma and aunt are suffering and they won't give them blood\" (which I still don't understand exact cause for, since she didn't bother to explain me, they are well and don't have any health problems as far as I know). I said that I gave her the opportunity to convince me and offered my full cooperation. She tortures me with this for months without giving me any evidence and it really tires me to have arguments based on personal feelings and not facts although I really sympathisize with her relatives situation, but I cannot stop helping people just bc someone's story. She says \"forget the facts and evidence, if you loved me you will do it for me\". And it bugs me that again she plays on emotional card and condition me emotionally.\n\nI decided to stand my ground. My thought process went like this: my political and moral opinions are mine, nobody has the right to blackmail into changing them and I don't do either, you offered me no space to change my mind and didn't bring any evidence into argument - just feelings, you ask for me to make a change yet you are not open for compromise, you are ready to put our relationship on the line bc you only consider your feels, ok I will let you have it.\nI say \"If you are ready to break up over something like this, then it's a measure of how much you appreciate our relationship. If you are ready to extort me emotionally for anything let alone this simple situation then I won't stand this. I am going out now and you have time to calm down and think\".\n\nI later returned and asked her if she changed her mind, she continued to try and make me feel guilty bc \"I don't respect her feelings\". At this point I am broken and can't handle situation calmly anymore so I say it's over and that I'm sorry it had to come to this..\n\nSo am I really TAH for respecting my self enough not to let someone emotionally extort me and ignore red flags or am I trippin?",

Another hour goes by and Jake has still not taken the hint that I don’t want to talk anymore already saying I’m going out to get food, which he then invites himself to. We get back and he’s still talking my ear off while I’m eating. At this point it’s been almost two hours and I’m sitting on the couch because I know if I go to my room he will follow me unless I say I’m going to bed , which I had no intention to. I am giving him almost no responses with a head nod every once in a while to not be completely rude. Eventually he finally leaves because my roommate grabs his attention , but this is not the first time this has happened. \n\nWIBTA for telling him to shut up so he knows it’s not ok to talk my ear off for hours ?

      "description": "Freshman in college. I'm in a group with nice people but end up doing most of the work (used to it from high school too). First presentation only one other person made their slides, I did everything else. Well I think the others did some things like 10 minutes before that preso. For the first one though the others somehow researched their parts and what to say well. So, second project is here. Before I got to it only 3 slides done, including title. So knowing what happened last time I added like 7-8 slides. But it's a big project, worth a lot. I realized I had nothing more I could add but we still wouldn't meet the time requirements. I was still pretty upset at them for doing the same thing the time before so I message the group chat like this:\n\n(Also right before someone said they made a reference slide- they literally left an empty slide saying reference and I then went and filled it in. That was kinda what did it)\n\n\"Please try to add some stuff guys. I added the references to the empty reference slide, and I've done most of the slides we have now. [Girl] is fine, did a couple good slides, but I haven't seen you others do anything, same thing happened with the previous one.\"\n\nMessage pt 2:\n\"I do understand that with the last one though you did do some research for your speaking part, but I still expect you to add things\"\n\nSo now I feel kinda bad, and also that i should have started earlier too. But luckily that worked and they all (well, almost) got to it and we're going to meet all requirements now. I still wish I was less harsh and I'm not surprised if they're all a little upset with me. So AITA?",

Anyway, I've been married a year and a half, and when I'm with friends I like to make wife jokes, like you'd see on Married with Children, the ball and chained, no sex kinds of jokes, you know what i mean.  It's been no issue between me and my friends, they make the same jokes about their GFs, its just banter and venting mild annoyances about our partners.\n\nAnyway, I tend to keep my time with her and that with my buddies separate, just like it that way. Cause of that she isn't up to speed with our inside jokes and when we started making wife jokes she sort of sunk into her chair. I made one about her, looked over at her and she was sort of crying. \n\nI took her outside and asked her what the problem was and she went on about how \"it's not cool for me to shittalk her, and that I seem to hate her or something\" when I make \"slightly offensive\" jokes about her to my buds. I told her it's all jokes but she said \"it's disrespectful to make fun of her like that\" and that we were sexist for all joining in joking about our GFs. \n\nI sort of got annoyed and told her this is why I don't bring her out with my friends, she got pissed, called a cab and went home. I went back to my friends, but when I got home she wouldn't let me touch her. This was yesterday, since me and my friends had a few days off at the same time, and she's been kind of off ever since.\n\nI personally think it's no big deal that i make simple jokes, but she thinks they are really hurtful apparently, and she seems upset with me.

      "description": "My girlfriend and her mom have been wanting to get out of this shitty house they have lived in for the past 10 or so years. I am up for that, I want them out of a house that is falling apart.  My girlfriend started looking at house a few months ago and this is where the fights started. Her family is not financially well and our looking at $100,000 and above houses. She asked if I could put the house under my name, i told her i'm not sure. There where some small fight about it as we dealt it out. She applied for a house herself, and got rejected due to being a DACA, she applied to a program for DACA and got rejected for not having credit. Her mom can not apply due to her credit and status, her sisters credit is shot, and her dad is not going to help. I was the last choice for them to get a decent house. I said yes that i would do it and started the process. She said we will sign a contract to make sure that they will be liable for the house payment ans that it would only be under my name. Today i came to her and told her i would like to add a condition to if it was going to be under my name, that they only put what money was necessary in the house to live in and focus more on the payments then redoing the whole house as she wanted to do. She got upset and told me that it was there house, that i don't trust her family, and im covering my self as that's all i care about. She said forget it and are now looking a breaking up. I want them to get the house, but i have let her family borrow around $5,000 and have not seen but a little of it back. Im not worried about getting the money back as i known they don't have it. I just don't want my credit to go down and them to lose another house. \n\nThere is more it then this, but this was the best way i could sum it up. Thank you.  ",

For my dear old gramps I got a few woodworking chisels and stuff because he loves to do a lot of wood turning, but I also needed new chisels for some of my personal projects.

By the time she went back into her bedroom the food was here, and I got it and went into the kitchen to have some time to myself. I just needed some time alone to just eat my lunch. She stumbles out of her bedroom and into the kitchen, looks at me, and starts crying again. This is the part where I really wonder if I was the asshole. She starts asking me if she was a bad mother, like over and over again, telling me to say yes, and I just got sick of it. I told her I didn't have the headspace for this shit and that I'd like to eat my lunch by myself. She just mumbled \"ok\" and went back into her bedroom.

      "description": "So, I own a Discord server and there is a lot of arguing on the server. So there are three main people in these arguments, Me and two other guys. Let’s call them Bob and Joe. So Bob is involved in every single argument on the server. Usually when there is an argument between Bob, Joe, and I I tend to side with Joe. It’s not necessarily because I don’t like Bob but I genuinely agree with Joe. Bob has recently been getting upset because me (the owner) has been siding with Joe. He says I always take his side and I abuse my power during arguments. What he’s talking about is when he starts spamming the chat and I turn on slowmode. Joe is a mod and Bob isn’t so Joe isn’t affected, and Bob thinks that I’m doing that to allow Joe to get his arguments in without Bob being able to say his.\n\nAm I the asshole for picking sides on the server that I own or not?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little while now and it’s very serious and we have made a lot of future plans together. Before we started dating I only had a few friends and my “best friend” lived in another town about an hour away from me so it wasn’t too far but it wasn’t like I could just go to her house at anytime and stay for a couple hours and go home. All my other friends either lived in that same town or I wasn’t close enough with them to really invite them over or go to their houses. Since I met my boyfriend and we started actually getting super attached to each other we’ve been spending ever day together when he isn’t working and even when he is he usually comes over to my house when he’s done (I’ve pretty much stopped seeing that specific friend all together for distance reasons and for other personal reasons). The thing I’m most worried about is that I’m also not spending enough time with my family. I don’t live with my parents (long story) so my grandparents took me in and they’re very supportive of mine and his relationship but at the same time I feel like I’m taking them for granted a little bit by not coming home after school and getting home pretty late at night. Again they’re very supportive and really like my bf however the only time I spend time with them is when he is working. AITA for not seeing them very much?\n\n\nTL;DR- I only really spend time with my bf and feel like I might be taking my grandparents for granted ",

We'd been spending more time together, flirting, etc and hinting at each other, so I thought this would be the obvious time to ask her out. Full disclosure, we'd already slept together multiple times at this point. When I brought it up, she said no, that she's not ready for a relationship, and would like to keep things casual. I told her that I'm not interested in casual, that obvious feelings have developed, but that's okay, because we're both adults and can make decisions. I haven't really spoken to her since, and it's starting to make me wonder if I'm being an asshole for avoiding her, as she has been my closest friend for the greater part of a decade. One of our mutual friends also went behind my back and told her that I've slept with an old FWB since the weekend, further poisoning the well.",

The sister says “I want her to enjoy the concert with one of her friends which is why I’m reaching out to you can you help me plan”. I say yes, I’d be happy to go and I can also host friend since I live in a major city where artist will be performing. Friend’s sister then asks if I’d be willing to pay for my own ticket. AITA for saying no? I haven’t responded yet but I felt like the sister’s first message made it sound like she was covering both my friend and I’s ticket. Also some background: I’m a current student working to cover living expenses and it’s not in my budget currently to drop $200+ on a concert I wouldn’t have gone to if the scenario wasn’t what it is. Friend’s sister is much older and established so to her this probably doesn’t seem like an issue. Friend has no idea yet, this is a surprise. I want her to have a good time, but I don’t want her to think (if she finds out this was an option and I said no) that I don’t value her friendship. She’s also a student so she understands the struggle but I’d appreciate some objective feedback, thanks!",

      "description": "The 'award' story reminded me of this incident. Somewhat similar. And I imagine I'll probably be met with more backlash compared to that. Disregard the username though it's a throwaway from a while back when I didn't really know what the word meant.\n\nThe full story definitely won't fit, but the watered down version - I was one of those unpopular kids back in middle/high school, invisible to girls. People used to make jokes about 'why don't you hook up with FNI', as well.\n\nAround senior year, four girls from middle school randomly 'reconnected' with me, one of which feigned interest - it didn't go as far as a fake relationship, but they were particularly seductive and flirty and one of them actually did feign interest, which I ended up falling for and pursuing. Long story short I found out they did it all 'for kicks', due to an informant showing stuff being said.\n\nSorry to do this, but anyone who asks INFO - full detailed story [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/8rryrc/i_had_an_incel_mentality_all_through_highschool/e0wu90b/?context=3), since I know it won't fit.\n\nSo, without giving too much detail, 'Natalie' from my story just became somewhat famous. Well I don't know if that's the word, but she does have a slight following and is looked up to, in certain circles, mostly local but some not. She presents herself as a 'virtuous' type giving the image of someone with compassion for others.\n\nThat kind of is unsettling for me and while I know it's not the same, I imagine it's the same kind of 'unsettling' when women from the MeToo movement see someone who wronged them having a following. After all, actions should have consequences, especially cruel ones. I know it's a silly story that few will care about, but there's always those outlets that will look for a story out of anything. I know I will probably get backlash as well and it probably won't be effective, but at least it will be satisfying to have some people know that and to have that story come up on the second page when googling her name, even if few will care.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "Back in October, my great aunt unfortunately passed away due to complications with bone cancer. She was in her seventies though, and she had accepted her death. Before her passing was actually really sweet, but we're not here to talk about that. Obviously I'm heartbroken, but I still need to go to school. Now keep in mind, this is my first year in high school. I was never a very popular kid, and only one of my close friends came to the school I went to, so I was kinda buddy-buddy with everyone, but there was this particular girl I was close with. We'll call her Rose (not her real name). Rose was strange and not the brightest bulb in the bunch. She is still childish and once threw a full on temper tantrum in gym, flailing limbs and everything. But I liked her. I told her about what happened, and she offered condolences, etc. \n\nCut to gym. We're warming up and I'm messing with her, maybe annoying her, idk. Then she turns to me and says \n\n\"Why can't you just be sad about your dead aunt?\"\n\nwhich I interpreted as \n\n\"I'm glad your aunt died.\"\n\nI was PISSED and told her so. She was already integrated in my small clique with a few other people I connected with, so I couldn't just ignore her. We were close-really close-and we totally lost the connection after that. But while recounting the story to a friend, I realized something. Maybe she didn't mean that with any ill-intent. Like I said, Rose is weird. I don't think she's autistic, but if she said she had some sort of high-functioning autism, I would only be mildly surprised. I'm wondering if I was being over-emotional and misinterpreted it. Rose isn't the most well-liked at our school, so I wanted someone with no bias. So reddit, AITH?",

      "description": "What's going all everyone, long time lurker, first time poster in this subreddit.  \nYa'll always end up making the front page, so it's not to actually have a reason to jump into the mess. That being said, let's get to it.  \n\n\nI'm in paramedic school at a private college, this is my second time attending. My first attempt through I had been out of school for years (I'm late twenties), and was a garbage student when I was attending high school, so I was figuring out a lot of kinks on how to study, what was even my preferred method of studying, and so on. Plus the passing mark is an   \n80%, so the shit is no joke.  \n\n\nAnyways, this is my second time in. I'm busting my ass, feeling good, and doing well on my tests. Because it's a private college it's kind of run like a high school class, with a class representative to bring things to the facility vice everyone going at once (there's usually some test questions debated and I think this is their way of narrowing the amount of people who harass them about it). That being said, there's two classes in the school right now, each with their own respected class representative. Unfortunately, the class rep in the other class likes to get his ego stroked. So he challenged our class to a bet that \"whoever gets media coverage through volunteering in the community wins.. something\", they didn't actually decide what up for grabs, but it's not important.  \n\n\nSo our class representative comes back to us, all gung-ho about the idea. People are rallying behind it, thinking it's a good idea - except me. Volunteering isn't apart of the course load. This course has an insanely high passing mark and we only have 6 months of class time to learn everything about the role, and then we're onto ride-a-longs with career medics being assessed. It's insanely stressful. I don't want to volunteer the little time that I do have for mental sanity to try and combat some asshole who has an ego issue. Not to mention we don't even have our uniforms yet, so it makes our options very limited. At this point, I was debating posting on our Facebook group (dead platform, I know, but it's the easiest form of communication), basically saying I'm against the idea and I'll donate money just not my time, for reasons stated above.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole if I don't want to volunteer for media coverage + a bet, and use my time to study or enjoy my own free time?

      "description": "So I turned 18 almost a year ago, got my licence and bought a car with the money I saved up from working while studying high school.\n\nI started college and decided to quit my job as the hours were too much and I wasn't able to focus on my studies. I found a different job that pays a lot less but I can choose when I want to work and for how long (as long as I meet the minimum hours required each month). Now this job pays just enough for me to be able to afford gas and food and occasional buy something for myself.\n\nIn the first few months, my mom would ask me to drive her to the city as we live in a village 17KM (10 miles) away. It was usually only once or twice a month and I didn't mind doing it, so I never complained.\n\nThree months ago, my mom went to the doctors and they discovered she has something wrong with her kidneys and needs dialysis 3 times a week. She feels fine and everything, she doesn't really talk about it with me so I don't know much, but she seems to be doing just fine.\n\nIn the first month, my mom made me drive her to every single appointment. Now dialysis can take up to 4 hours, so I had to drive her there, drive back home, drive back to get her and drive her home. Already in the first month, I felt the strain on my finances. I had a bit saved up so I was fine and didn't tell her, after all, she was sick.\n\nAt the end of the 2nd month, I ran out of money, couldn't afford food and had to take the bus to get to school, which takes about 90 minutes (almost an hour longer than when I drive there). I told my mom that if she wants me to keep driving her, she has to give me money for gas, else I won't be able to do it anymore. She told me that she's my mother and she keeps a roof over my head (even though she told me she doesn't want me moving out until I'm done with school) so I can't ask her to pay for the gas as well. So I kept giving her rides.\n\nLast week, I got held up at school working on a project and got home a lot later than I usually do. My mom freaked out and spent 30 minutes screaming at me about how irresponsible I am and that she missed the appointment because of me. I told her that she could've taken the bus, which she doesn't have to pay for because she qualifies as a retiree (anyone over 65 in my country). I told her that if she wants me to keep giving her rides, she has to pay or she should take the bus.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since, my sister sent me very angry messages about how selfish and spoiled I am, how this behavior is unacceptable and how I should try and be a better son. \n\nSo, AITA for not driving my mom?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr my mom wants me to drive her to the hospital 3 times a week, refuses to pay for gas and I can't financially handle it so I told her to use the bus instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Slight backstory in that we became friends 5 years ago but stopped talking, then for just over the last year we began talking again.\n\nWhen I say terms on the friendship it’s because it seems very one-sided, any time I ask if they want to go see a movie, get food, or hangout in general it’s always met with different excuses. \n\nWe talk on snapchat and WhatsApp but at times they seem to just disappear for a day, maybe 2 and sometimes as much as a week before either replying or starting a new conversation.\n\nAnyway, onto the asshole part, around Christmas I decided ‘if they want to be friends they’ll make the effort’ and it worked because I got a message about a month after I stopped putting in my effort asking ‘did you die?’\n\nFor a while it changed and now it’s back to the same but this time I think it’s about to be at the stage where I metaphorically die and just stop trying to be friends with someone who only wants to meet up when it suits them, they don’t want to be alone, or have nobody else to talk to ",

      "description": "It's fucking long so skip to the end for a tldr. \n\nOkay okay this just happened. Met this girl on tinder, we both had rainbow flags on our bio. We matched and had a great conversation! She invited me over to have a smoke (Mary Jo) and I told her I'm looking for people my age to hang out with and chill cause I'm in a new town and I got  no friends. She was like omg yeah I would love to hang out with you etc etc! We met up after work and I felt her good vibes! I was happy, she was happy!\n\nWe kept talking all the way to her place and she tells me she has a distant cousin who lives with her who's a guy and whether I'm okay with that! Hell yeah I'm okay with that, more friends the merrier.\n\nSo, we get to her place, the guys isinteresting enough. He asked me for my birthday and coincidencently it was the same birthday as his. I called him a liar jokingly but he said he can prove it and if he proved it I'll have to kiss him. I was like er but I was stupid and I agreed. He showed his birth certificate from him phone and it was the same birthday so he kissed me and said I can't go back on my word. So we kissed and then the girl who went to take a shower came out and I excused myself to talk to her.\n\nAnyways it wasn't a smoking session that was planned apparently but instead a drinking session. Okay fine, we had a shot of tequila and then he told her to make some more drinks like being the ice, pour that much, cut the limes, wash the cups etc etc. Of course she did everything without a word. It's not my place to judge their relationship so whatever.\n\nSo things get heated, he tells her to kiss me but she said she needs to get tipsier and I told her it's fine I'm not gonna force her, then he goes \"don't be pussy and just kiss her\" so she does. Okay fine, I don't mind kissing a beautiful girl. Then his hands are on my boobs and he squeezes them so hard it really fucking hurts! I broke away from them and asked them to chill out.\n\nDoesn't last long, he's back on me and so is she. I get that it's their kink or whatever but I just don't feel good about it. He bites my nipple really hard and she moaning on top of me and I feel his hand edging down my pants. So I pull his hand away and tell them both that sex is off the table and nothing below the belt is gonna happen.\n\nThey agree and more kissing takes place. He suggests we go to the bedroom. I say no no no no bedroom,.lets just chill on the couch. There's a good roast chicken waiting for us so I just wanted to eat and hang out like normal fucking people. But he carries me to the bed and at this point they're both kissing me all over and he hurt me again so I pushed him away. At that point he started taking my pants off.\n\nThat's when I lost it. I told them that was enough! I got out of the bed and told him he was a fucking weirdo and yelled at both of them. Told her to get out of such a toxic relationship and told him that his doctor title doesn't give him any right to do whatever the fuck his wants. She was clearly embarrassed (for me I guess since I was just yelling) and he started yelling at me like \"what the fuck is wrong with you you bitch stop being such a loser etc etc\" and told me to gtfo. I said I would gladly. Told her that all I wanted was a friend not a threesome two hours after I met her. And then I left.\n\nBefore I left, he told me that he had connections where I worked and that I shouldn't yell. I asked him if he was threatning me he said \"no. I'm just saying\". Told him to have a good life. As I got into the cab he tells me \"I'm not on social media because I'm on Google\".\n\nOkay wow this was long sorry. Anyway, I feel terrible. For me, for this girl. For the way I acted. For the way they acted. I know I walked into this situation but.. I just didn't want to do anything. She texted me and called me an asshole. I feel some form of guilt but at the same time, I don't.\n\nSo? Am the asshole for yelling at a couple (who didn't identify as a couple, they said they were distant relatives) who wanted to have a threesome but I didn't?\n\nTldr: was invited over to hang out by girl, ended up in bed with her and her \"distant cousin\" who wanted to have sex but I said no, leading to a heated aruhemt and me leaving ",

We have been friends platonically, but we once tried to be in a relationship, but it did not work out. He moved to NY while I moved to TN. I have always been in love with him while we both started dating other people. We remained best friends. We shared jokes, long phone calls, we shared our deepest, darkest secrets. For him, it was on a friendship level. For me, I was still in love with him while approving all of his relationships.\n\nHe finally met this new girl and they dated for only six months. He proposed to her after 6 months. Now I can tell you that I became bitter. After the engagement, I immediately blocked him everywhere and removed his cell phones. After a month, he called me on a different phone— I was shocked because I did not expect him to call. I honestly told him that I did not want to be around and I sent him a text to watch “my best friend's wedding”. I think I nurtured the friendship hoping he would choose me at the end. I did not make any drama about it, I just simply stopped reaching out and communicating. \n\nWhere I am coming from is that I still feel guilty about this. Did I make the right choice? That day I felt so envious and so bitter that he did not choose me. I told him not to invite me to the wedding. I am being selfish— I know. I don’t know what I am looking for precisely, but what do you think? Do you think I should have handled it better? Am I the asshole for not talking to him anymore? Be as honest as possible. ",

      "description": "So basically one of my closest friends since I was a young child was another child a few doors down from me. He has quite severe learning difficulties, but not that bad. For example he can hold a conversation easily but has no hope of ever reading or writing that well (he can text as long as you keep it very simple) and can't really understand concepts.\nMy family looked after him and I spent a lot of time with him growing up along with my other friends. However he has few hobbies, he can't read and doesn't understand television. One thing he loves however is going out drinking and going to nightclubs now that we are adults .He is extremely social. He has a full time menial job with no outgoing expenses, he lives at home with his mother who doesn't make him pay rent and he doesn't get taxed. So he has lots of disposable income and likes to dispose of it drinking with me.\nI however simply can't afford to go out with him as much as he wants. I can pay for it but I want to save money and don't want to spend all my money drinking and going out that much. But when I tell him this he invariably responds with 'don't worry about money'. Due to his condition I'm never sure what he means by this so he will tell me that he will 'buy me a pint'\nI tell him my money concerns are not limited to one drink and wouldn't be willing to spend money on all my other drinks, plus the cost of taxis/cover charges etc so I can't go out, to which he will then respond again 'don't worry about money mate'.\nBy this point I'm getting a little infuriated so just straight up tell him he will need to pay for all my drinks and costs and that I consider it too much so again, I can't go out, to which he will respond 'that's sweet mate' and will proceed to beg me to come out.\nI am now left in the situation when I am doing him a favour by going out to a bar/nightclub, something I enjoy, and having him pay for all my costs. This makes me look like an asshole but I don't think I am. He really wants this.\nThe first time we did this, after buying me the first drink he said 'don't worry about money, you can pay me back next week'. Due to the misunderstanding, I did pay him back but since have explained to him that it's not a matter of not having the money, it's a matter of saving money week to week, and going out this much isnt a luxury I can afford. Therefore I told him I couldn't do it again.\nHe wasnt having it, and continues to beg and implore me to come out with him and not to worry about money. Even after I stress to him that I couldn't afford to pay him back he will still do it.\nThis has been going on for a while. Anytime I actually want to go out I of course pay my way, I would never pretend to not want to go out to get him to pay for me. But when I decide I can't afford to go out, if what he wants is to pay for me as long as I go out with him, I accept. Which means I am getting a very vulnerable guy to pay for all my drinks on a regular basis without every paying back a penny. AITA?",

L has a dog who is a high energy mixed breed. He’s notorious for destroying things around the house (doors, socks, etc.). On average, she walks him less than once per day. Maybe 3 times a week. He is a mess imo. Has no manners, the lot. \n\n\nL got into dog fostering in the last 6 months and that’s been okay. She’s only had one dog aggressive foster so it’s been fine with my dog (cattle dog mix— obedient, decently well mannered, and walked 2-6 daily). \n\n\nL got a new foster that’s a hound mix (call it S) a few weeks ago. As you would expect, S is very vocal and follows it’s nose like nothing else matters. L has claimed this dog is anxious and has started giving the dog anxiety medication. However, L has only walked this dog once. S is taken outside twice per day for 10 minute periods in the backyard on leash. She spends the majority of the time in the kennel and is out for short periods of time when L is home. S and L’s dog have gotten into many scuffles and S is sent back into her kennel (not usually caused by S). \n\n\nImagine my surprise when L claims she wants to adopt S. L has been wanting to adopt a black dog that’s been in the adoption system for a long time. That does depict S, but L is so sedentary that I think another high energy dog is a mistake. \n\n\nMy SO wanted to stay completely out of it and let L adopt S. I wasn’t able to accept that and emailed the adoption agency my concerns anyway. I know it shouldn’t have been any of my business, but I feel like that dog deserves a home where she will get to use her energy and live life to the fullest. \n\n\nAITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for just wanting to live my life and support my politically-minded friends the best way I know how, which is not wanting to go full-on socio-political about everything myself?",
      "description": "I was always brought up to look at both sides of issues before coming to my own conclusions. And while I agree that there is quite a bit wrong with the US political system, I also don’t feel the need or compulsion to voice or express or proselytize my personal beliefs about political or social issues. If someone asks me directly about an issue, I’ll tell them, but otherwise I keep myself to myself.\n\nAll that being said, I went to a  ***VERY*** politically active and socially-conscious college which skewed ***VERY***. My experience there in terms of social/political issues was that it was more or less an echo chamber, or at least that’s how it felt to me. Anyone who expressed an alternative point of view was either berated or shot down with links and articles and sites and citations about why they were wrong to think that way. But my personal practice was whenever someone would get going on a political rant, I would just let them finish, nod, and then move on. To me it wasn’t worth it to try to go into detail about anything.\n\nI’m posting this today because my facebook “memories” page showed me something that reminded me why I grew to hate that environment. Two years ago, Trump was sworn in, and I posted something along the lines of “I’ve never been an overly political person, and I’ve never been a crusader for any particular causes, but I want you all to know that I care about you and I will support you as best I can, even if it’s just a laugh or a joke here and there.” I’m paraphrasing here, but the core message was that I was acknowledging how angry and upset and frustrated people would be in that moment, and that the best way I knew to provide support or relief was to be a clown. I feel I can best help and support my friends and people I care about by giving them a laugh or a smile. Even if it’s just for a little bit, if I can make someone laugh, they aren’t thinking about their problems. That’s always been a keystone of what I believe. I’ve never been vocal about my political beliefs, and I do my best to keep it that way.\n\nThe only other comment (apart from my grandmother, who knows my personality and tendencies pretty well) was from someone from my college who said that what I was saying “wasn’t enough”.  Being comic relief, or just a neutral party apparently “wasn’t enough.” She prefaced it with “As much as I like you and respect you, veggieleezy, what you’re saying here isn’t good enough.” She said I was “giving myself an out” for not doing anything to fight against what was happening. She then listed what I should apparently have been doing all along, voicing my disgust and anger and frustration and campaigning and actively rallying against what was happening, rather than just “being there to support”.\n\nBut the thing is, I’ve never felt strongly enough about *ANYTHING* to feel the need to actively campaign or protest or rally or fight or recruit or what have you. I don’t feel that way about any issue. While I hold my own beliefs fairly firmly, I just don’t feel compelled to debate or argue or try to convince people of my views, or show them why their views might be wrong. If someone brings it up to me directly or personally, I’ll probably discuss it and see what we can figure out between each other, but I have never felt the need to, for lack of a better term at the moment, “campaign” for any particular beliefs or ideals.\n\nSo I want to know for sure, or at least get a general consensus. Am I the asshole for just wanting to live my life, keep my opinions to myself, and be a clown to help people get through their days? Because that‘s all I’ve ever tried to be, and all I’ve ever presented myself to be. Am I wrong for not raising my opinions and actively fighting back? Was I really “giving myself an out” rather than stepping up like I apparently should have been?\n\nAm I a bad person? I really hope I’m not... I just want to help people the best way I know how, and while that may not be actively campaigning for a particular cause or belief, I just want to make people laugh.",

      "description": "I know it sounds horrible, but I just can’t convince myself that her being my sister is a good enough reason to keep being in her life. I know her Aspergers is partially to blame for some of the issues I have with her, but just because there’s a reason for the behavior doesn’t mean I should just have to be ok with it.  She is legitimately one of the meanest people I have ever met. She takes genuine pride in saying the most hurtful things she can to others. She is completely narcissistic to the point where she has ruined our younger brother’s relationship with our family by interrupting him so often that he’s completely given up on trying to have conversation with anyone. She is violent and has caused my father to need stitches several times from biting him. She’s hit us with dining room chairs, stabbed people with pencils, and over Christmas threatened to maim my boyfriend. \n\nOur parents have never done anything to stop or correct her behavior, simply saying that she’s special needs and can’t help herself. She once punched me in the face so hard that she broke my glasses, and instead of disciplining her my mother told me that if I ever hit her back or tried to defend myself against her she would call the police on me and disown me. \n\nI know my parents are a big part of why she’s like this, but she does know better. She’s not stupid by any means. She doesn’t do it when she’s around her life skills instructor, because he would (and has) chewed her ass out for bullying another student. \n\nSo for the past few years I’ve been distancing myself from her and this holiday season has really cemented it in my mind that I no longer want anything to do with her. I’ve decided to have a conversation with my mother and let her know that I have no interest in seeing my sibling anymore and to please not ask me to attend events that she will be at. I’ve tried for the past 15 years to look past all that and get along with her, but I don’t think I care enough anymore. I used to ignore it and think I was being the bigger person, but at this point I’m not willing to let these things go and I’m tired of fighting every time I see her. \n\nI hoped so badly that as she got older she’d become a nicer person, but she’s just gotten meaner. We’re both adults now, and I’m at the point where I am really starting my own life and my own family. I am not willing to deal with the stress and anxiety of hoping she doesn’t decide to insult or assault me or my loved ones every holiday. ",

      "description": "My math class has all-or-nothing quizzes that you have to retake until you get everything perfectly correct. On the most recent one (which was relatively long), one person in my class turned in their quiz, which the teacher promptly looked over and returned, asking the student to re-examine for mistakes (to save them from having to completely redo the assignment).\n\nThe student had a little trouble finding the mistake, and kept on asking for help until the teacher pointed out the exact place the mistake was made. It seemed pretty unfair to me, as this kind of defeats the entire purpose of an all or nothing quiz, and most of the class was not afforded the luxury of getting a second try on the spot with help from the teacher. Being a relatively blunt guy, I asked the teacher out loud if I was allowed to cheat on the next major assignment as soon as the student in question turned in their revised quiz. I was half-joking, but I got a dirty look from the student and the teacher confronted me about it a little later.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So my (22f) partner (24m) has to get up early because he starts work early. He aims to be in bed by 9. \n\n2 months ago I spent a month going to bed at 8 so we could have a bit of a snuggle before bed. For that whole month I would make sure I was in bed early and he would just continue to do his own thing (video games, phone games etc) until he was ready and this started stretching past his 9pm bedtime. Sometimes I would even fall asleep before he had got into bed. \n\nI told him this makes me feel neglected, I come up to spend time with him and go to bed early just for him and he wasn't even coming to bed or acknowledging my efforts. (I would cut activities short to go up to bed early for him. Even if I had work to do I would push it to the next day because previously he expressed getting a good night's sleep was important to him.) \nThis continues for a few weeks of me telling him it was hurting my feelings and him doing his own thing. \n\nEventually I decide enough is enough and tell him to come down and spend time with me if that's what he wants. I'm not going to wait upstairs being ignored when I could be doing something I enjoy. \nI carry this on for a month. I will admit he told me he wished I would go back to being in bed earlier but I told him that I had put effort it and got nothing in return so now it was his turn. I made sure I was going to bed the same time as him so I wouldn't disturb him but I wouldn't go up early to wait anymore. This continues for a week and yes I did feel like we weren't spending enough time together but I was tired of wasting my time for someone who really didn't seem to care. \n\nToday he says that he feels like I don't give him any love anymore because we don't talk or cuddle before bed like we used to. I explained to him why I stopped coming in early and reminded him that I had said if he wants to spend time with me he just needed to say and I would have come to spend time with him. He said he would have tried if I started coming to bed earlier but I didn't so he felt like I didn't care and that it's my fault we haven't been spending time together.\n\nI feel like he's ignoring what I'm saying and trying to blame it on me because he was too lazy to make the effort. But a part of me wonders if straight up refusing to go to bed early for a month was just petty and I've just justified it to myself. \n\nSo I brought the issue here to some nonbias judges (because I know my friends might just side with me out of bias) and ask if I was the asshole here??",

      "description": "AITA for not getting my license while my wife drives.\n\nThis is a topic on my mind a lot, and I get judged quite a bit for it by my(29M) wife's (28F) family, as well as my own family.\n\nWhen I was in high school, like most teenagers, I was looking forward to getting my license and driving. At 15 I started in drivers ED, and ended up passing the written test just fine. After that I began doing the driving practice, and I really struggled. Practicing was hard, specifically driving with my parents. My mom would freak out really easily, and I felt really nervous around my dad and definitely made a lot of mistakes. I eventually took a road test and failed, and that discouraged me for a few months, but then I got really dedicated to practicing, and tried again. I failed a second time due to the parallel parking.\n\nI got really dedicated on the third time. My parents hired a private instructor, and I really tried my best. At this point though, I still did not feel like I was a good driver. I knew my weaknesses, and in certain high risk situations, my instincts were often incorrect, leading to a couple close calls.\n\nOn my third road test, things were going fine for the most part, but near the end, I ended up getting into a collision. On my road test. It was awful. It was entirely my fault, and I was extremely ashamed. Since then, I have not reattempted to take a road test.\n\nThe rest of my life has been largely unaffected. I lived on campus in university, so I had no need for a car (and no access to one to practice again for a road test) after that, I moved downtown and was within walking distance of my job. Currently I take public transit and it's not really an issue for me, and I'm pretty self sufficient without a car and can take Uber if I need too. I am a successful well adjusted adult.\n\nI don't want to get a car, or my license, because I am concerned that I will get into an accident, harming myself, someone else, or potentially members of my family. The issue is that my wife has a car, and does all of the driving. Now, a part of me feels bad, that I should be sharing that responsibility, but I am legitimately concerned for our safety if I was driving. I don't want to deal with the judgement of our families, but I also don't want to put our future kids at risk while driving with me.\n\nOn the other hand, that will be a lot more responsibility for my wife if she has to drive the kids everywhere. I'm hoping that either I can find other ways to help out in the future.\n\nTLDR; I'm a bad driver, and probably a risk to be on the road. I don't think I should get my license for my own safety, and the safety of others. I feel bad though, like I am not contributing enough by not getting it, and face judgement from extended family.\n\nAITA for not wanting to drive?\n",

      "description": "Me (17M) and my friend, who I'll call T (18M), have been friends since freshman year, and are seniors now. We've both been through some traumatic shit through the years and bonded through that, as well as music and memes. Junior year, T moved out of his grandparent's house with his mom, switching to independent studies in the process. Instead of helping his mental health, he told me it's been worse.\n\nAt the end of junior year, we started hanging more often, usually with other friends and a guy who I'll dub R (important). At the start of senior year, me and R have a falling out and the next day I cut ties with him. T texts me saying that I'm immature for not wanting to be friends with R after we almost fought in class the previous day. I respond with telling him to not call me immature for just steering clear of R. \n\nA few weeks later (on Halloween) T comes back to school and we \"make up\" despite there being a very apparent awkwardness and tension whenever we talk. T's mental health has since started to act up again, and has since missed 3 weeks of school on end with no updates. Whether or not comes back, I'd just call it quits on this. Friends always drift apart throughout school anyways. AITA? ",

      "description": "I (19F) drove two hours to see my long distance boyfriend (21M) and he has pretty much spent the whole afternoon playing video games and hanging out with his roommates. I have just kind of silently hung out because I’m very shy and don’t know them very well and all they have been talking about is the video games they play. I have no video game interest or knowledge at all, but try and be supportive because I know he really enjoys them. \n\nAs of right now, I have been awkwardly laying in his bed for two hours while he plays a game on his computer at his desk, only being able to talk to him when he turns around to give me a kiss or tell me he loves me. He plays video games every day after school and I only get to see him once every couple of weeks. I’ve tried to emphasize that I miss him very much and I’m even leaving at an inconvenient time for me tomorrow because I just want to be able to spend a little more time with him, but he seems to think me sitting a couple feet away on my phone for hours is spending time together. \n\nI know if I told him I didn’t want him to play then he wouldn’t, but am I the asshole for wanting him to WANT to not play, and to spend time with my instead.

      "description": "OKAY so about a month ago I reconnected with an ex from a few years back after we bumped into each other on Tinder. Since then I have invited him out on three different occasions to hang out with some of my friends as we all got along very well back in the day. Everyone had a great time and it was entirely platonic as far as I knew. \n\nOn the first night of hanging out we both discussed our deep lack of interest in each other sexually, as well as our recent sexual endeavors with others. I also mentioned that I was in an exclusive sexual situation with another one of my friends and was very much enjoying it. He seemed supportive and I figured that meant we were just friends in his eyes and all was well. \n\nThis past weekend I invited my ex to come hang out at a bar with my usual group, as well as the guy I am boning. Everything went on fine as usual and my ex offered to drive my roommate, my dick appointment, and myself back to the apartment. He has always offered to drive us home in the past and never comes in to hang out afterwards. While we were waiting for the other two to use the bathroom and close their tabs, I mentioned offhand that the other guy was my fuck buddy because he’s real cute and I like telling people (i’m annoying). Upon mentioning this, things took a turn. He got very offended and said that he wouldn’t have offered to drive us home if he had known it wasn’t going to end with him and I “doing stuff”. First he said some very unkind things about my friend but then ended the night by saying “It’s ok that you’re doing that stuff, I just didn’t expect to be so sad about it”. \n\nNow I feel like a giant asshole but my roommate says I’m not. I’m just trying to decide if it’s worth reaching out and apologizing. ",

While I can drive, I'm unable to drive myself back because it's our only car, I do not have a parking permit to park near the college, and my mom comes back on tuesday, so she'll need the car when she goes back to work.\n\n\nBefore my mom left, her friend said to tell me that I can ask her for anything if needed (food, a ride, etc) however it may just be a kind gesture. Today, I have no friends available to drive me back (nor have I ever asked any to drive me back) and so I asked my friends mother if her son is there, who also goes to the same college, if she'll be able to drive me back along side him. She said that she would be able to drive me and what time would be okay for me. After saying 6ish and constantly denying food from her politely, the call ended.\n\n\n I then found out her son did not come back for the weekend, and she would be driving me 25-30 minutes to the college, and then 25-30 minutes back, meaning I will be using up an hour of her sunday. My dad then said that I should've declined her offer to drive me as her son wasn't there, and that I should spend $20 on an uber rather than use up her time. \n\nTl;dr: I asked my moms friend to drive me 30 minutes to and then 30 minutes from the college, while my dad said its wasting her time and that I should uber.

We do not work for the same company and this was so far the only interaction I've had with them since being at my company for nearly a year. \n\nThis person works for a company that for all  works in the same industry but in a different department that is run by a separate company from my own. He had to call me yesterday to discuss a job that we had done for a customer he is attempting to work with. \n\nAfter asking him for some additional details he started to get hostile with me over the phone. Yelling, being demanding and demeaning to me, arguing, etc. It had me in tears by the time the 20 minutes of me dealing with him had ended. \n\nHe did eventually give me the information I needed, but not before more arguing, yelling, and demanding.\n\n My question is: would I be the asshole to attempt to get in touch with someone higher up from the company he works for and complain?\n\nPart of me feels it's better to just let it go, attempt to keep it civil when working with him, and possibly going as far to just let him know if he starts to get hostile again that I would not be helping him until he could act more professional.\n\nHowever, I feel as though he is a professional, for all intents and purposes representing the company he works for. I kept a calm and level tone, asking multiple times for the information I needed and trying my best to explain, and I feel as though he should have equally tried to handle the situation in a more professional manner. To tell someone higher up I feel would be warning them that he is prone to this behavior in case of a more serious situation when it may come up for future clients of theirs. \n\nThanks in advance guys 👍",

Soccer. \nKid's ages? 7 &amp; 8 year olds. \nThe guy in question is one of the coaches for the team my son's team played against. \n\nPlot twist: It's the team my son played for last season.\n\nLast season, the coach on my son's team yelled at lot, and not in a \"I yell when I'm excited\" way. That's the reason my son no longer plays for that coach. \n\n That exact coach found himself an assistant coach who yells just as much. Like, the WHOLE game. He was on the field when he shouldn't be, he was yelling crazy stuff at the kids (\"No! Don't you dare cry!\" and \"I don't EVER want to see that again!\" among the highlights), so I and a couple other people started joking about it. Things like \"He's gonna stroke out!\" and \"Holy crap, who talks to 8 year olds like that?!\" Turned into a thing when his wife turned out to be sitting next to us. I wasn't involved in the actual confrontation, but she asked us to stop talking about her husband and one of the mom's I was talking to told her that her husband is embarrassing. There were some more words said, we all got called snowflakes, and that was it. \n\nNow for the Lifetime TV Movie level plot twist:\nCoach McYellerson has an older son who turns out to be on MY older son's team this year. So... I'm definitely going to see this guy and his wife again. \n\nSo, I don't feel bad about what I said. Not at all. None of it was that bad, and for crying out loud, he sounds like the \"Winning is everything\" coach in a kid's movie about teamwork and compassion. \n\nHowever, I did ridicule the guy's behavior in front of his wife. \n\nAITAH? \n\nSecond question: Should I apologise anyway, or let it drop unless it becomes a thing?",

We live in a busy, highly trafficked area where people are known for being late, and the rep who did our initial assessment was bang on time and super professional. The next week, our trainer started. She was about five minutes late, but no big deal. We saw immediate results and started recommending her and the service to friends and co-workers. The second week, she was ten minutes late. Whatever. We get it. Third week, about 20 minutes late. Lateness aside, she's doing a great job, our dog is responding incredibly well, and we're happy. We looked up what we should tip a dog trainer, but there isn't much out there online, and we decided upon $100. (Training cost was $600).\n\nWeek 4, she's closer to 30 minutes late. A little annoying, because we try to go to bed early and this is starting to cut into our evening, but it's all good. Week 5, past 30 minutes late. We find it frustrating, but whatever, we only have one session left.\n\nShe reschedules week 6 at the very last minute to the next day. The next day she cancels. The company calls me and asks if we can do a different day the following week, as that would be more conducive geographically, and this would allow all of her clients for the day to be in the same area. Fine. Good. No problem. We've now lowered the tip to $60.\n\nThe next week rolls around and the time comes that she should be there. Ten minutes pass. Fifteen. At 30 minutes we text, only to be told she's across town and still at least 25 minutes away (we assume more). We reschedule to this week. At this point we're contemplating not tipping at all, but we are most likely planning to give her something.\n\nToday it rained all day. Fifteen minutes after we're scheduled to start tonight, she texts to cancel due to rain, but says she's close. We ask if we can train indoors. She relents and shows up 20 minutes later. She stayed less than the full hour, then kind of hung around at the end and said something like, 'remember the tips' on the way out. We didn't tip.\n\nAm I the asshole for not tipping?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my brother to propose with my mother's ring?",
      "description": "So my parents are divorced, and my mother has 2 rings from the marriage: her engagement ring and the ring she got for her 25th anniversary. She told my sister and I years ago that she wanted us to have them when she's gone one day, just like her mother had given her her engagement ring.\n\nThen there's my brother. He met a girl last year that he wants to put a ring on ASAP. He's also currently getting his doctorate so he's living off student loans. Just as an aside: there is no logical reason he needs to propose to her immediately, he just \"has the urge\".\n\nHe sat down with my mom last month telling her he didn't know what to do because he can't afford an engagement ring, but he's sooo in love and wants to propose super soon. Mom said she would help him a bit financially. She told him to take her rings to get appraised so she had some sort of benchmark for the price of an engagement ring.\n\nSo he gets them appraised and then asks my mom if he could disassemble the 25th anniversary ring and use the center stone instead of getting cash for a new ring. My mom doesn't like the idea, but told my sister and I she doesn't know what to do because he's making her feel guilty that he \"won't have a family heirloom to give her,\" whatever that means. My mom said she was very willing to help him by giving him money, but she didn't want to disassemble the rings that she promised to my sister and I unless we were ok with it. According to my mom, he responded with something along the lines of, \"don't you realize I can't accept cash from my mom... It would make me feel like less of a man.\" 🙄 Give. Me. A. Break.\n\nMy mom has also expressed to me privately that the whole proposal feels strange and rushed and she doesn't really feel comfortable with giving this girl her diamond when she isn't entirely convinced they're right for each other, but she obviously won't tell my brother that because it's his life.\n\nHere's the thing: this girl comes from a very wealthy, traditional southern family, and he told my sister he REALLY wants to impress them so he feels he deserves my mom's big ring because he claims my sister and I \"can have the rest of mom's jewelry.\" I KNOW the reason he wants to use that diamond is because it's bigger and more $$ than my mom is willing to give him.\n\nThe other thing: at the end of next year he's getting a HUGE chunk of money from our grandparents for his 28th birthday (enough to buy her a big ass rock if he wants to). I also received this money for my birthday last year and I offered to lend him money for a ring until he gets his next year and can pay me back, since for some reason he can't wait until then when he can actually afford a ring to propose to her. He won't accept this either because he says I \"don't get it,\" and keeps saying, \"why do you need that ring so bad? I need it more than you do,\" which feels so manipulative to me.\n\nIt's getting in my head though... Are my sister and I being entitled for wanting my mother's rings that she told us (and still agrees) were meant for us?\n\nTl;dr: AITA for not wanting my brother to have and disassemble my mom's diamond ring that is sentimental to my mom, my sister, and I when he has the means to buy a perfectly good engagement ring?",

      "description": "Me (26F) and my best friend (27F) are going to Tomorrowland winter in France for a music festival. Initially she added two guys onto our party group so the price would be cheaper, so we payed 1K each for 4 days of raving in the Alps. She has a history with one of them (they are two brothers) - they have a sort of sugar daddy relationship where he’ll pay the plane ticket and accommodations and the two of them will go to Ibiza, Santorini etc.\n\nAnyways we each payed 1K for the experience with him paying only for himself and his brother. When she mentioned he would be coming I let her know that I wanted her and I to do our own thing. I love meeting people at music festivals and I feel like when we go with guys, people just assume we are together and I don’t have as much fun or get as approached. Also they ALWAYS bring unwanted drama and problems. It also doesn’t help that the two of them are Pakistani, and when they party they go overboard and get possessive, sloppy, and loud (her words not mine, I haven’t met either of them). \n\nWe are leaving next weekend, so when talking to her today she mentions how she won’t be ditching him because he’s still paying for some of her food and other things. I immediately get irritated. We’ve raved together and I always have a good time - with her. When she brings other people along they ruin it with possessiveness, bad vibes, sloppiness etc. Also with her being with one of the guys, it creates a couple vibe which I am not interested in nor did I sign up for.\n\nAm I the asshole for being annoyed? And low key planning to ditch them all? I payed 1K and no ones have paying for my shit, so this arrangement isn’t beneficial to me at all. Also I’m well aware that this is THE MOST superficial &amp; inconsequential post....😅. I promise I have a real career, this is just how I blow off steam.  Anyways thanks for any advice and for a change in perspective.\n",

      "description": "tl;dr at bottom\n\nSo I'm visiting my family because my mom had surgery the other week and one of my parents' friends was there, who I had never met before. He's a pretty nice guy, and pretty funny. Anyways he somehow ended up cooking for us (I think he offered), which I thought was nice, and he was saying how he's cooked a lot supposedly and he's learned a few cooking tips and tricks from his \"travels\" that he might be able to show me.\n\nSo when it's all done we're all eating in the living room and there's a bunch of common food like corn, mashed potatoes and whatnot, all tastes the same as any other that I'd had, but the thing is is he cooked big hamburgers for everyone. The one I got was thicker than most but not as wide. Just from the habit of other people not cooking my food thoroughly before I cut into mine to make sure it was done, and obviously it wasn't, like at all, in the middle. It wasn't really a big deal to me, I've undercooked things for my family before, other family member have, but we all know to check and we generally just laugh about it because it doesn't happen too often.\n\nSo since mine was undercooked I just ate everything else and then I went back into the kitchen and started cooking my hamburger. I could hear over the sizzling hamburger for 5 minutes, the friend asking what I was doing and my dad said that I like them burnt, which he knows I don't. They then talked for a couple minutes while I was cooking it about how weird it was I like them burnt. Then my brother came up and told me it was disrespectful to do that, but he like to give me a lot of shit though. Anyways this ended up in a small-scale argument between my dad brother and I about it.\n\nSo, AITA? If I undercooked something I wouldn't feel disrespected at all if someone did that, especially if it was as pink as mine was.\n\ntl;dr my parents friend cooked for us and didn't cook my hamburger thoroughly so I cooked it more on the stove and it apparently insulted him.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nMe and my friend of 15 years moved in to a rented house back in 2017, he was a bit flaky with money for rent and bills so I covered it, then he caught me up as promised back in July. Since then I've had precisely nothing from him and had to try to pay it all myself, getting behind on some bills (for the house and myself) in the process. He's \"self employed\" in a job under contract to a single company that in reality doesn't pay a lot but always has money for beer, cigarettes and online gambling. The problems with pay were evident a few months in to the job but he insisted it would start paying soon.\n\nThen coming up to December 1st (bill day) he said he would pay enough to cover all that month's bills plus a bit to pay me back. Great! So I merrily went and did all my Christmas shopping free from the burden of paying any bills this month. Then comes the 1st. Nothing in the account. First he said he had transfered it. Then he said he accidentally paid it all to one of his numerous creditors (note: he said he'd done a bank transfer but you can only pay this particular creditor with a debit card). I had enough to pay my half of the rent but that was it.\n\nI told our letting agents the situation and they agreed to me paying my half and they'd chase him for his half. He still hasn't paid it. I covered the bills again on January 1st but come February 1st I just don't want to. I could cover it but only with financial problems for myself. If I don't pay the full rent then our landlord is likely to demand he moves out and offer a new tenancy to me and another person (my step brother is after a place to live). He would have literally nowhere to go and to make matters worse he's just quit his job (which he should have quit a year ago) with nothing on the horizon.\n\nTL;DR: Friend of 15 years hasn't paid for rent or bills for 6 months because no money. Owes me thousands. Don't want to cover him anymore but if I stop he's on the streets.",

      "description": "I'm friends with 2 guys, we'll call them Andy and Marco. We're all currently 18. Us 3 have been friends with each other since we were very young, and we've always thought of each other as our best friends. This has been changing recently. Andy met a girl online who lives in another country, and they fell in love. She lives very far from where we are, and I'm doubtful that they'll ever get to meet in real life. I'm very glad he's found someone that makes him happy, except he basically puts all of his time into her and spends much less time with us.\n\nHe would pretty much ditch me and Marco. As an example, we'd ask him if he wants to get in a call and play a game, and he would decline saying he's not in the mood because \"he wants to relax.\" Minutes later he would start a game with his girlfriend \"because she asked.\" This kind of behaviour has gotten on our nerves a lot, and we feel both very hurt and like he's being a bad friend. We even sat down with him and talked about this before and he acknowledged everything and apologized. Well, that apology meant nothing apparently because he hasn't really changed at all. On one hand I can understand that he has very strong feelings and is infatuated with this girl, and I can understand wanting to spend as much time as possible with someone who lives so far away, but I don't think having strong feelings serves as an excuse for disregarding your friends.\n\nIt pretty much feels like a giant slap in the face and a big \"fuck you\" to me and Marco that he rather ignore us and spend this much time with someone he's never met before over his lifelong friends, even after previously apologizing and saying he'll change. But on the other hand I want to stay understanding and sympathetic to him as he clearly has strong feelings. WIBTA if I get pissed off at him for this (as I think he's being inconsiderate), or do I stay understanding of his feelings?",

      "description": "Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI'm currently a senior in high school, and I made my friend \"T\" in 6th grade when he was in 8th. Over my 7th-8th grade summer, I lost touch with him, before having him call me when I was at my Grandmother's for that summer. We started hanging out again over my 8th grade year, and we had fun hanging out. \n\nFF to my 9th grade year during summer, where he tickled me until I was kicking and accidentally broke his laptop. Or when he pinched my cheeks as I was 4 foot nothing and adorable according to him. Or when he asked to borrow my grandma's birthday present to me, and stepped on it by accident. Or when I stop texting or calling him, waiting for him to talk to me in anyway, letting weeks go by without any meaningful conversation.\n\nNow, let's talk about T. He's extremely prideful, assertive, confident, he's 6'7 or 6'8, he's muscular, and he's honestly a pretty good guy as far as being friends goes. But that pride causes major strain on basically everyone around him, more on that later. The one real relationship he was in was awful for him, with a girl we'll call \"S\" for now. T gets what he wants, and does what he wants, and he doesn't like it when other people do that same thing.\n\nSo, T sees S on the bus during his Senior year. He's 17 and she's 14. S is in a rather abusive relationship with someone, T intervenes. They only make out for the first 8 months to the first year. T and S don't even know what French Kissing is and call me to ask. Then when S's family is extremely happy with T, treating him like a son-in-law already, the now 17 T and 14 year old S bone. Mind you, Romeo and Juliet laws are a thing, and I do joke to him that he's a pedo whenever I'm slightly annoyed at him as it annoys him. And T describes it in detail against my wishes. Over and over. Literally two days after Christmas, his pride got him kicked out of his house, so he spends until Valentine's Day, roughly, with me and my family, S breaks up with him for this amount of time. One of his brothers offers a place to stay. S and T start dating again. About a month later, I go over to his house during his 18th birthday, he and S go to his room. He fingers S, and forces his fishy, not even joking, fingers in everyones face, other than mine, as I prepare for it by outright stopping him. He nearly gets in a fight, and I'm forced to deescalate the situation since T doesn't back down ever. Cops are called after the fact, but nothing happens there. FF to summer, and he and S break up, since S was boning other guys. I considered her dead to me, as per my ethical and moral code, but he had loved her, so when she came crawling back T said yes. They lasted two more months before T had to move again, about a half hour away by car. Then S cheated on T with T's other best friend at the time. During this time, I had gotten out of a relationship of my own, and that's about it. He and his friends were the only people I hung around, at the time. He eventually got over the break up, and she's back saying \"Oh, but you're like a brother to me, we should be roomates and stuff.\" \n\nI always get him a joke gift and a real gift for his birthday, so one birthday I got him some My Little Pony Binoculars, Nail Polish, Lip Gloss, Shampoo, etc. and a Rebellion sword replica from Devil May Cry. I've spent nearly $800 or more (a 3DS, a 2DS, a literal box of DBS Cards, the rebellion sword, multiple DB Figures) on things I've gotten him, or let him have. He's spent around $400-$500, and that's including things he's taken back, like a laptop.\n\nRecently, we've only been hanging out when he has time, even if I have to skip school, so he can tear apart my DBS deck for a specific card, or bring my PS4 so he can play games. That's literally it. Over the past two months.\n\nTL;DR Friend for at least 5 years might take advantage of my friendship, so I want others opinions.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to hang around him anymore?\n\n",

      "description": "Diving right into it\n\nI and a group of my friends (6 people total) have gone on summer Vacation together a couple of times. We are a very tight Friend group as we have known each other for 15 years since we were around 5 (this will be important later).\n\nImportant Background: the main organizer of our previous trips suggested a trip to East Asia this year. Nonetheless, due to the fact that that only one other person wanted to join him, the idea fell through and defeatedly he said that someone else should plan another vacation. I decided to plan the next vacation. The rest of the guys agreed with me and we booked an Apartment for 6 people with an additional ability for someone to sleep on the couch (again important later). \n\nThis brings me to yesterday when I get a text in the group chat from the original Organizer of all the previous trips that he's bringing two additional people on the trip with us and that it is final. Because he's the one whose account we paid from and bears responsibility and thus it's his choice. He then followed up by saying that one of the friends is our old time friend (someone I had no problem with) and the other is his uni pal, who we have never met and doesn't even speak our native language. This didn't sit well with me and A. because I didn't want 8 people in a six bedroom apartment and B. I didn't want some random guy who I never met on holiday with me. I then attempted to call the main organizer who didn't pick up his phone and had his roommate text me that he's busy and can't deal with this situation. Then this morning, I finally got in touch with the trip Organizer who said that his decision is final and that I get no say in this and that since the payments are in his name. This prompted me to send an angry text to him saying that we had a verbal contract and that he should remove the stranger or I'm not going to go on the trip and that I want my money back (3 people in the group disagreed and 1 agreed with me). He ignored my text saying I have to deal with it, so I threatened to write an email to the AIRBNB host saying that there will be too many people and that his apartment will be a mess if he allows it. Then I texted the stranger (found on FB) and said hes welcome to come on holiday with us but he cannot gonna live with us and will have to find other accommodation with the Organizer elsewhere while we will stay as a core group in the main apartment.\n\nThis evening I got a text saying I won (sure don't feel that way) and that it's down to the original 6 of us as well as that I am a toxic person.\n\nTL;DR My friend invited a stranger on holiday with us, I threatened to ruin said holiday if he isn't removed",

Although I know it is not illegal for him to park in front of my property it is a bit annoying to come home everyday seeing his vehicle parked in front of my house. They have 4 spots in their driveway that are constantly being utilized with those cars rarely moving. Along with that they have a 2 car garage which from what I can see is probably just being used for storage and not parking vehicles. Their other vehicle is parked in front of their home. The last vehicle they own is usually parked in front of my home or around the corner on other street parking. I am tempted to try and have a civil discussion with him about this issue but am not sure if I would come across as the asshole for asking him not to park in front of my home. As a common courtesy I was brought up to not park in front of other peoples homes as this was rude. I would extend this same courtesy to him by not parking in front of his home.",

      "description": "Back story; his wife hasn't worked in years, he's always been the sole income. A year ago, she complained she didn't have any input in he budget, so he let her take over.\n\nThey moved away from the big city, because \"the public schools are better out here for when the kids (6,4,2) start school\" In the space of 3 months, their $5k savings had disappeared, they'd financed a new $36k car for her and he had to sell his motorbike.\n\nFast forward 6 months. He's working extra hours to offset these extra costs, she's seeing more money coming in and proceeds to put the kids through private primary school (huge luxury and expense, also note above) and take out private health cover (there are no private hospitals where they moved to)\n\nSo he gets depressed. Working ridiculous hours (60-70 wk, 6+mths) will do that to someone\n\nShe tells me \"I told him to stop being depressed or I'll leave with the kids\". Things mellow out, he deletes Facebook and messenger, where he would chat with me and his brothers.\n\nHis brother makes the effort to drive out there yesterday afternoon, not more than 10 minutes after he arrives, they're out back having a vape and she comes out \"hell no, you're not leaving me alone with the kids\"\nBrother asks \"why not?\". \"Because no, that's why\" and walks off. Mate instantly clams up and doesn't talk for the rest of the evening. Brother goes home.\nI send mate a message;\n\n&gt;Hi. I'm gonna say some things you're probably not going to like; the situation you're in is domestic violence. Specifically emotional and financial abuse. If you ever feel like this is true, give me a call. I've got friends who have contacts in both family law and family mediation, whichever route you wish to take. &gt;You're in a better position than you probably realise.\n&gt;I miss the old you, the positive comments and the outlook you had.\n&gt;You've got my number, I'll be disappearing off her Facebook shortly. Peace out.\n\nShe instantly replies from her mobile (because he's never allowed to buy credit).  I presume at this point that he's forwarded the message to her\n\nSo she's chewing me out, I'm replying sensibly \"I don't hate you or your marriage. I just miss seeing my mate happy\".\nHe gets home (maybe? I dunno, I presume it's him)\n\n&gt;I'm way busy. She's not abusive. I'm the cunt and the abusive one. It's no wonder she hasn't left me. I'm unhappy with work. I have no people with my interest on my area to hang out with. I'm depressed that I work 70hrs a week. I don't see anyone. I'm too tired to drive 3hrs to spend an afternoon with people. I've got friends I've known for 20 years, I haven't seen them in years. I've got kids that are tired that I need to take care of after we do stuff is the city, without making them sit at a friends place for a few hours. She's the only one who stuck around to help me through. Who's pushing us to move to the city so I'm closer to friends. Everyone else said go to therapy or fucking pills that I won't take. I appreciate your concern, but it's unfounded. What I'm like at home isn't what I'm like to friends. I admit that. I'd have already left if it was her being abusive.\n\nSo. Turns out I can't read a situation, lost a mate I cared about and have been blocked on social media.\n\nTldr; I thought my mate was being controlled, but turns out he likes being under the thumb..?",

      "description": "Grad student here. Our class size is small, so we get to know our classmates well compared to other grad programs. Since we started seven months ago, I've noticed one of our married students (Sally) hanging out a lot with another guy in our class (Jake). Sally's husband (Terry) is back home working, and they've been married for over a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSally and Jake always sit next to each other in class, walk between classes together, and even hang out just talking when class is over. When they hang out, they talk for about an hour, sometimes more. Their body language when talking is usually flirtatious. For example, Sally will sometimes punch Jake in the arm when laughing, or they'll get super close when showing each other something on their phone. Other times, their conversations appear more serious. I first noticed them hanging out five months ago, and they do this 4-5 times a week. I also saw them on a walk together late at night, and they often go to the lab together outside of class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of my close classmates have also noticed their behavior. It became super obvious when Sally and Jake recently practiced one of our clinical skills on each other for two hours during class; everyone else was able to get it done and swap partners after half an hour. We started making inside jokes about them and will take pictures of them together as a way to confirm our theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's bad enough that I wonder if I should send Terry a message (anonymously) saying that Sally may be emotionally involved with her classmate. It takes a lot of trust to spend months at a time apart from a spouse, and from what I've seen, I believe Sally is violating that trust by spending a lot of time with Jake. If I were Terry, I'd want to know if my spouse may be emotionally involved with someone else. Also, If I were Sally, I wouldn't spend one-on-one time with someone of the opposite sex nearly as much as Sally is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA if I send Terry an anonymous message with a couple of pictures telling him Sally may be involved in an emotional affair?",

      "description": "Alright so story time. First time posting so excuse any fallacies within my post. I’m 19 and I live with my parents and two younger siblings. My parents and siblings bank accounts were placed on a hold due to some bills that my parents had been neglecting to pay. My account is in my own name, so it wasn’t affected, and unlike the rest of my family I’ve had access to my money. The whole issue should be cleared up for them by the end of the week, but lately they’ve asked to borrow lots of money. Earlier it wasn’t a big deal, I understood things were a little rough and the payments were for necessities. But lately they’ve been asking for money to use on things that could wait or weren’t really required purchases. They’ve also been somewhat last minute and too abrupt to be considered comfortable (Im sort of meticulous with finances, so I like having at least a few hours in advance to either get cash or plan my own transactions around that kinda stuff) And tonight, we went out to a not so cheap restaurant to eat. Prior to tonight I had assumed that things had been cleared up, but when their card declined I had to yet again borrow out money to cover the check. Now, I love my family and all, but I also have my own expenses (transportation, student loans, phone bills, etc) to pay, and working 35 hours a week on 12 bucks an hour doesn’t leave room for huge expenses. I’ve had to dip into savings and have loaned out almost $1100 to them. They intend to pay me back in full, but because of the last minute and one sided expectation that I cover certain expenses, I’ve thought about charging a 10% interest fee on some of the more unnecessary purchases they’ve asked me to make. I love my family and all, but they haven’t really considered my own financial needs or capabilities in some of their borrowing, nor have they bothered to be frugal (why eat out at a nicer place when you don’t know that you can cover it??) or considerate given my budget and financial needs. In the real world you can’t borrow money without some sort of interest or strings attached, but I don’t want to come off as an asshole.",

      "description": "So a few years back I was hanging out with my best friend's brother (we'll call him Adam) who was just going on and on about how much of an asshole my friend (We'll call him Billy) was. I asked him if he really believed that stuff and if he wanted to reconsider his words given the severity of the accusations and the fact that he was talking to somebody who is definitely not amused by this. He said that he really believed that his brother Billy was an asshole, a stupid, arrogant douche and other insults like that. After we got done talking, I told Billy what had been said and he decided to cut off all contact with Adam. \n\nSo now, five years down the line, Adam has had a few kids, and has tried to patch things up with Billy, in order for the family to be cohesive and get to see each other. This year, Adam and Billy's parents, who are divorced, put aside their differences to have a family Christmas dinner for the first time in over a decade just to be with Adam's kids. Billy was invited but opted not to go because he's still mad about what Adam said all those years ago. \n\nGiven the situation, Billy is now blaming me for cursing him with knowledge and ruining his chance to see his niece and nephews grow up, because it's my fault that I told him what Adam said. He's threatening to end our twelve year friendship over this and I am wondering if I'm really at fault.  \n\nSo tell me, reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Context: I'm 24m, my younger sister, whom we'll call \"K\", is a few years younger. \n\nWe've had this Macaw in our family for about ten years. She was originally purchased by our mom, but has always been closest to K, as well as an older sibling whom is no longer living at home. This Macaw lives outside in a large cage during the summer, and inside on a perch in a closed room during the winter. She doesn't see any interaction most days aside from feeding and changing her water, fixing the perch and replacing toys that she's broken out of boredom, and cleaning up the enormous piles of bird droppings she creates. For years my mom and I have wanted to sell this Macaw because she's messy, temperamental, and honestly living a neglected life right now. We are aware we aren't paying attention to her, and we want to find a home that will take her off our hands - but K ardently refuses to go along with this. K would like us to keep the Macaw forever, but K barely interacts with the Macaw, just like we don't.\n\nNow today, as has happened countless times before, the Macaw flew off her perch and pooped in another part of the room which does not have floor pads laid out as under her perch. At one point I had to access this room to retrieve something, and chose not to clean up the mess at that time - she isn't my pet, and I'm taking care of our other animals as well as feeding the Macaw. I left the door open on accident, and K saw the mess. An hour later she's comes to criticize me for not cleaning up after the \"family pet,\" at which point I tried to explain myself to her concluding in a shouting match where both our tempers rose.\n\nLong story short, K feels that even though I'm not the bird's owner it is EVERYONE in the house's responsibility to clean up after her, no matter what. I, on the other hand, feel that since I am not the bird's owner (and neither its owner or myself WANT the bird) it is not MY responsibility to snap on rubber gloves and scrub bird poop off the floors. Am I being an asshole?",

I'm not going to cheat or anything I just miss one of my closest friends. ",

      "description": "Ok. Back story. I work at a climbing gym. I met a girl there in September who is also my coworker. We started hanging out/hooking up for about three weeks. After a night of climbing with her and another female coworker, she ghosted me. I now know it’s because she thought I was flirting with my other coworker but in reality I was just being nice because she was new.  She also posted a photo on Instagram with another dude a few days later so I thought she had moved on. So three weeks, I was ghosted and she had a pic on Instagram with another dude. \n\nWhen she ghosted me I tried to reach out to her but she wouldn’t respond or communicate with me at all. If she did respond, it was just vague answers. So, I moved on. A few weeks rolled by and she wasn’t talking to me, but guess who was talking to me? The OTHER girl from the night of climbing. So, she and I had a one week fling after that girl ghosted me. \n\nWe stopped our fling just because. But things are chill between us. We are friendly to eachother and actually are decent friends now. \n\nSo from September -End of October I hooked up with two of my coworkers. Then I met another girl and we had a little fling from November - December. But that ended because of distance. \n\nMiddle of December, the first girl (who ghosted me) just randomly starts talking to me again. Like completely out of the blue. So we start chatting again. In January we started hooking up again and have been until last night. \n\nLast night, everything I have just typed, she found out. I told her everything because I want to date this girl. So I told her. And she was so mad. She couldn’t believe I would hook up with our other coworker and another girl within our 3 months of not talking at all. She said she was pissed. She said she always thought I was a guy who could just “move on from one girl to the next” and that my story had “proven” her theory. But if she already thought that,why would she come back to me? AITA for hooking up with other girls? I honestly am pretty distraught about this and want to know if my point of view is insane. I just don’t know.  \n\nDISCLAIMER: Me and the girl who ghosted me were never dating. Just hooking up. I want to date her now, but I highly doubt it happens because of everything I just typed. AITA?

      "description": "So I (F, 24 y. o. then) worked in this company where I was introduced by my friend when they were looking for a copywriter. My friend Ann was already working there and she was friends with Dan, the guy who ended up being my boss (not the CEO, just a manager). Normally I wouldn't befriend a boss, but because of Ann we hang out in the same group and naturally became friendly towards each other.\n\nOne day I, Dan and some other coworkers were coming home from work and had a discussion about POC/LGBT representation. Dan said that seeing obligatory black people in every movie annoys him and feels unnatural. (I must clarify: this happens in Russia with little to no black people in real life, opinions like this are default among most people here). I tried to explain how representation works, we kept the discussion civil and said goodbye on good terms. \nOn my way home I kept thinking about it and was upset by this convo. So I did what felt natural to me - I vented on twitter, saying \"dude, if you have to say \"I'm not racist, but...\", you are racist\". I did not say his name, he'd never read my twitter, I have less than 300 followers and none of them know this guy, so to me it felt impersonal.\nNext day Dan added me on other social network and I tweeted that it felt weird considering I had some gay art on my wall. Some things he said earlier made it clear Dan wasn't a fan of gay stuff either.\n\nI came to work after the weekend. Dan seemed gloomy, he asked me to see him in a conference room. There he pulled out printed screenshots of my twitter, of tweets I wrote about him. He miraculously found my twitter by googling my art page URL exactly the day I wrote about him. He acted very offended by the fact that I called him a racist based on his opinions. He did not try to ask me why I thought of him like this. Instead he asked me to quit, otherwise threatened to fire me for \"loss of trust\" (later I found out you can be fired for loss of trust only if you work with money and you steal something). He also threatened to sue me, but not for slender, rather for extremism because extremism clause in Russian law has something about derogatory comments and Dan said that my tweets were just that (once again, later I realized it was tremendous BS). It felt very surreal, but it got even more surreal as I tried to explain myself and confessed to him that race/sexuality stuff has so much meaning to me because I am bisexual myself. This is where he suddenly confessed he was also bi, that's why he was upset by in your face representation - because it made straight people annoyed and didn't help the cause. I was disarmed and confused.\n\nThis conversation ended up in me begging for forgiveness, promising to be on my best behavior. He agreed but promised to keep an eye on me.\nHe never got to fire me, couple month after that the whole company fell apart, everyone was let go. Last time I saw him was in the said friend group, he acted like we were friends. To this day I can't feel anything towards him but repulsion.\n\nI told this story to some of my friends, everyone predictably was on my side. But lately I had told it in a more neutral group and surprisingly one girl said that Dan was absolutely right and I got what I deserved for calling people racist without proof and talking shit behind their back. This made me wonder if I'm really the asshole in this story so here we are.\n\nI personally think I was probably in the wrong when I tweeted this stuff instead of talking to him directly. But he was in the wrong when he decided to make it a work matter instead of a personal relationship matter and blew it out of proportion.\n\nTL;DR boss said there were too many black people in movies, I vented on twitter and called him racist, he found those tweets and wanted to fire me for offending him.

A few times they've tried to get fiance to break up with me. Once fiance told them about our engagement they stopped talking to him for about a month. Things seems to have settled down. They had stopped insulting me to my face. A few days ago fiance was out with his brothers and I guess the subject  of sex came up. He ended up sharing that we haven't had sex, and now  they're bothering me again. While we were all over their parents house for dinner, I was told for all that I \"put him through\" I could have at least \"given it up.\" They thought sex was the only reason why he \"put up\" with me. I found to bullying to be burdensome and ended crying in the bathroom. Fiance's grandmother walked in on me. She expressed that she was shocked because she has never seen me cry before (I would have rather been caught on the toilet) and demanded to know why. I told her, and after that she threatened to remove fiance's brothers from her will. Unfortunately, fiance's brothers used this to claim that I have manipulated their grandmother and now fiance is having his doubts about me. He found that it was highly suspect that I just happened to \"show emotion\" while his sensitive grandma was around. I don't think I've anything wrong. It's not like I have sought her out, she just found me. ",

We live in a fairly small town, and we know people who work at the stores she has stolen from, and Kate would (without my girlfriends knowledge) use her a distraction letting her talk to her friends for minutes while she would go and shoplift. She will also go and scout out stores for security cameras and guards. What I'm saying is this girl is not just doing it in the spur of the moment, she is purposely making plans and using people as distractions so she can do it. She has admitted that it gives a rush.\n\nI am disgusted by what she is doing, but not only cause she is stealing from people we know and are friends with, but she is also using my girlfriend to do it, Amy only just found out the other night about what has been going on for months. She is not poor or by any means struggling, she has a full time job and lives with her parents rent, food, and gas money free.

He has dated girls who had horses and he just couldn’t deal with it.\n\nWe have a 13 month old daughter and my MIL is constantly talking about how she is going to get her crazy about horses and riding them and all of that. We don’t want her to. We want our daughter to be involved in more extra curricular activities like karate and baseball and soccer and the like. \n\nI understand that it’s a hobby. I understand that it’s loved by a lot of people, and that it isn’t hurting anybody. But what this mostly comes down to is that my MIL expects us to pay for it, and I know that is an expensive hobby because she can barely afford for her daughter to do it. I don’t want to pay for something she is insisting our daughter gets into, especially when our daughter isn’t even old enough to tell us what she wants to do. We don’t have a lot of money, just like MIL, so I would rather put this on the back burner and wait until our daughter is way older to even consider her doing it. When I told MIL this, she said we were being unfair and inconsiderate of our daughter.\n\nAITA for telling my MIL we don’t want our daughter to get into horse riding and for expecting her to pay for it if she wants it so bad?

      "description": "There's going to be a lot of context here so feel free to skip to the TL;DR. It's one of those memories that keeps me up in the evening and I want to make peace with it.   \n\n\nI had an ex-boyfriend (call him Dave) who I dated for 2 years. We had been friends in the same close-knit group since high school and ended up dating during university. It all fell apart and we split \"mutually\", only for Dave to ghost me for a long time. It was pretty tough and made the getting-over-it process quite difficult. I did manage to make peace with those feelings for the most part, although it was always painful and awkward for me to speak to him - whilst he got to have a relatively \"pain-free\" friendship with me. He got a new gf (Ella) and got to not really suffer much emotional fall out. I know this from the one or two times I managed to actually speak to him after we broke up.\n\nFast-forward a year and Dave and Ella have split it up. It turns out Ella was really paranoid and toxic, she had essentially banned him from hanging out with me after the first few months of them dating. The ghosting from Dave is partially explained away. In the same year, actually moved to a new city and got a really cool new job and ended up living with a different high school friend, from the same close-knit group, call her Lily. It is the summer time and I choose to take a small vacation away to USA for 2 weeks to meet up with old time friends and enjoy my birthday. On the day I return to the UK, I plan a big birthday party and invite all my friends from high school to come over and stay in the city. I tentatively invite Dave, as we reconnected once he and Ella split, and let him know that I am glad we are friends. \n\nThe party day arrives and my friends all arrive through the afternoon and evening, we drink in our flat and it's great to have the gang back together. We head out to the club and party a little more, drink a little more. Once we get home, I make the front room into like a giant pillow-y nest for all my friends with sofas and mattresses for everyone; I cook a big  batch of pasta for everyone to have as their drunk bedtime food. I fucking love trying to be the hostess with most-ess, can you tell, lol? Lily (housemate) offers to put Dave up in her room (as well as one other friend of ours, who declines). This itched my anxious brain a bit because she \\*always\\* flat out refuses to have people stay in her room when we've hosted people in the past. But, whatever, we are all friends and have been for years - if Dave wants a comfy bed instead of a sofa, who am I to stop him, eh?\n\nThe next night I couldn't sleep. I had that \\*feeling\\*, y'know, that Lily and Dave had got up to something. I actually had a panic attack about it and feel like such an idiot - they're both single adults who can do what they like. Over-reacting x2000. I went for an early morning walk to clear my head and messaged another friend from the close-knit group once it hit an appropriate time; asking if she knew whether Dave and Lily had done anything. She said yes, she knew Dave and Lily had kissed once they had gone to bed together. Dave and Lily had both just come out of difficult relationships and were surely in need of just some good old human affection.\n\nHere's where I want to know if I am the asshole; I flew off the handle. As everyone had left the city already, I made a group chat of me, Lily, and Dave and demanded to know why they thought it was ok and told them they'd really, really hurt me. They responded, as anyone would, that they're lonely and single and it was just a drunk kiss but also with a classic \"sorry your feelings are hurt\". I rebutted with that doesn't stop my feelings from being hurt and I would like an apology for their actions, not because my feelings hurt, trying to force them into confronting what they'd done as if it was an OH-SO-TERRIBLE-EVIL thing. I mull this over a lot, because Dave actually refused to talk to me because my response made him so anxious and upset that he'd done something wrong. Lily apologised after a bit of prodding and poking, but it took a long time for Dave to understand why I was upset and for him to apologise.\n\nThey were both single. It was just a drunken kiss. I made them both very upset for calling them out, and I could've done it more tactfully. But also, it was my birthday, I was trusting Dave for the first time in 2 years, and they snuck off to bed to kiss. AITA?  \n\n\nTL;DR: Ex and housemate kissed in bed at my birthday party, after I was welcoming the ex back into my life after 2 years of hurt. It was a drunk kiss and we were all single adults at the time. When i found out, i got really mad at them, flew off the handle and then demanded an apology in tactless and hurtful way. AITA for being mean to them after they shared a kiss?",

Since then, my ex will text me periodically and send me memes and messages on Facebook. I have told him before that I thought it was better to not talk that much, and I feel like ex half-respected that. He would text maybe once a week, and send memes almost everyday (it slowed down to every other day). In the last few months, I started dating someone new. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt weird that my ex was still contacting me even though it was about neutral topics (we never discussed our relationship or anything sexual and I stuck to relatively short responses or I wouldn't respond at all). I felt like I couldn't tell my new boyfriend about my ex because I didn't want to unnecessarily worry him. And I felt weird about telling my ex I was seeing someone new because I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

      "description": "Hi, reddit. I became friends with this girl about a month and a half ago. I really like her, she’s super fun to be around and we have a good time. When we first started hanging out, she would honor plans and usually stick to them, but lately she hasn’t. I have reached out to hang out with her multiple times and she has said she can, but then on the last minute bails. This has happened 3-4 times. Every time she does this I see on social media she is hanging out with another person. The last time it happened we had plans to hang out with a mutual friend, who also has noticed this pattern. Me and the mutual friend were at my house when we get a text from her saying that we should just go do something without her and that she is busy. I was a little stoned at the time so I said “Ok, see you later I guess” which I admit was passive aggressive. The next day I shoot her a text apologizing for the comment and let her know how both me and the mutual friend feel, and she replies with something like “No, I love you guys! I’m not flaking it’s just sometimes things happen. We should make plans soon!” At this point I’m frustrated, so I respond with “It seems like you are always hanging out with someone else when you cancel” and she said “I just go with whatever happens, I don’t know why people get mad when I don’t hang out with them.” Then, I say something to the affect of “Because we have plans and we’re excited to see you, how do you think it makes us feel when we have plans and then we see you hanging out with someone else?” and then I never got a reply. Maybe my virgo is coming out but this is one of my top pet peeves because I think it’s rude and inconsiderate of her. Am I the asshole?\n\nThanks for reading my petty social problems. ",

Long story short we only have one car so my girlfriend drives me to work for my shift and my mom comes over to watch our 3 month old daughter so we don't have to drag her out of the house too.\n\nShortly after it looked like the fight (and us) was over, my mom texted me something about her daughter. I responded that i didn't need her to come over because my girlfriend and i weren't together anymore and i wasn't going to work. My mom immediately calls me twice then starts texting me, sending me multiple texts in a row about how i need this job for my daughter, as if i forgot i have responsibilities.\n\nAs calmly as i could, i told her \"Please stop, this isn't helping right now\". She responded with more of the same; \"Think of your daughter!\"\n\nMe:\"I need you to stop when I'm upset\"\n\nFollowed by five texts in 2 minutes about how i need to do this for my daughter. I called her and tried explaining to her that i was very angry and needed her to leave me alone and she proceeds to start saying \"That's fine sweetie but you-\" so i hung up and texted her so i didn't yell at her, reiterating not to come over tonight.\n\nAgain, another text about my daughter, followed by \"Am i coming over?\" And\"??????\"\n\nI sent back about ten No's. Another text from her and i said \"I'm going to ask you one more time. I need you to stop\". She apologises, tells me she loves me...\n\n... Then says \"Seriously your daughter needs you\"\n\nAt this point, i lost my shit, texting back in all capitals that i need her to stop and i don't understand why she can't just listen to me. She sends back \"Wow... Loud and clear...\"\n\n... And then ten minutes later \"For the last time, that little girl needs you!\"\n\nI sent back a text asking her not to contact me for a couple days and that I'm baffled that she cannot listen to what i ask of her or respect me as an adult (long history of her still treating me like I'm 13). After this, i turned off text notification for her.\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "my one roommate wants me to stop buying paper towels because he says they're bad for the environment. I don't think I use an excessive amount of paper towel, I usually use it when microwaving stuff like bacon or for picking cat puke up off the floor. when I said I'm going to keep buying it he stared getting a little annoying about it, asking me over and over again and pouting a bit when I would say no. he said that I'm a hypocrite because I asked our other roommate to use the recycling. I didn't do it for any ecological reasons (tho helping the environment is definitely a bonus. I mostly asked because I'm the one who takes out the garbage and we'd fill up a big garbage bag at least twice a week and it was annoying. am I being a hypocrite? I feel like I'm kinda mad because he keeps telling me to how to live my life but I guess that's kinda what I did to my other roommate.\n\nTLDR: eco-roomie wants us to stop using paper towel and won't let it go",

      "description": "Hold on to your butts.\n  \nLast weekend I went to a local Christmas Festival with family that I hadn't seen in a long time. We were there for the food and fireworks from Noon until about 8pm and afterwards went back home.\n\nBecause we felt we left early, we started a good fire in the burn pit and called over some friends from the festival. Immediately I knew something was off.\n\nThe couple shows up, they've been married for 10 years, and the guy who has been drinking since noon, now has a bottle of Vodka and is drinking it straight. No one else is drinking like this as we're all just having simple mix drinks like crown and coke. \n\nThe guy is 30yo, maybe 6ft and an easy 245lbs and he is going at that bottle. At one point he went to piss and his wife actually poured a little out of the bottle. I later asked for some, just to empty the bottle a bit, but it was no use.\n\nHe gets to the point that he stands up to walk into the house, loses balance and falls, barely stopping himself from face-planting.  I see it as it happens and try to get to him. Well he doesn't get back up, he didn't hit his head, but obviously he was only barely conscious prior to falling because of the alcohol, and the fall was the breaking point.\n\nSo we carry him inside and lay him on a bed. We didn't just leave him, but stayed there and made sure he didn't roll off the bed, made sure he was on his side in case he puked, waited until he did,  but he wouldn't stop rolling around, so we put him on the floor and he fell asleep. \n\nAt this point, it's 1am and everyone is tired so we go to sleep. Well an hour later his wife wakes me up and says she needs help. I ask why and she responds, \"He shit himself.\"\n\nIt was at this point I noped the fuck out and called 911 because that was above my pay grade. His wife was mad because now they have to pay an ambulance bill and for everything for the hospital. Her argument is that it should have been her decision, since she is his wife.\n\nMy argument is that at that point, he was spitting dry, had shit himself, was still not coherent, and I wanted to sleep. I recognized he needed fluids and professional help. I've had *some* first aid training, and I've taken care of people who were black out drunk before, but I was not prepared for this.\n\nSo, should I have let the wife decide when to call 911, or was I right to make a judgement call that he needed professional help. Alcohol poisoning is serious and I didn't want to risk it.\n\nTldr: Man gets so drunk he shits himself, wife is mad I called 911 against her wishes.\n\nBonus content: While at the hospital he started saying another girls name and saying he loved the other girl while still drunk as a skunk.",

      "description": "Detailed version: When I am driving in heavy traffic, it pisses me off when I am approaching an exit and I queue up in the right lane to exit. Undoubtedly, car after car will zip past me in the next lane to my left, and then try to squeeze in right at the exit, like their time is more important than everyone else's time. They saw traffic was backed up. They just zipped past a quarter mile of cars lined up to exit, and squeezed in right at the ramp.

      "description": "Hi AITA. I’m having a situation with my roommates and would really appreciate some outside perspective on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved in with two friends in August. I wouldn’t say ‘friends’ as much as they were ‘acquaintances’ - one I really had never hung out with; the other I hung out with a few times. Granted, I’m VERY introverted and find socializing really draining. Usually I enjoy just chilling by myself. Still, we were friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight off the bat there were some things that I addressed. One of my roommates would leave dishes in the sink for over a week at a time. She would overfill the trash can and then just start piling up trash next to it. She was being really careless with some of my belongings and was damaging/breaking them. She left water in her rice cooker &amp; it started to grow mold. There was an open (but empty) chicken cutlet package face down on the floor one day. One time the garbage bag broke and made a puddle on the kitchen floor because she tried stuffing so much in it - rather than saying something or cleaning it up, she just left it &amp; I ended up stepping in it. So I tried to address this all as gently as possible because it was getting to the point where I couldn’t use the kitchen &amp; the kitchen always smelled like death. Generally, it was received okay-ishly, but I still felt like an annoying hall monitor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other important backstory: when we moved in, we thought we’d have equal rooms. But one of the rooms had a terrible window (it faces a cement wall and never gets any sunlight). So we agreed that the two with good windows would pay $25 more on their rent and the one with the bad window would pay $50 less on her rent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past two months, the girl with the bad window has essentially moved her boyfriend into the apartment. He sleeps here every night. Eats here. Cooks here. Sits at the kitchen table and chairs (that I brought - they brought pretty much no supplies/common area furniture) and studies here alone. Etc. And my other roommate’s boyfriend basically lives here also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a utility bill each month. So, now that this has been happening for at least two months, I floated in the group chat that I’d like their guests to pay a portion of the utility bill. This would be a pretty small amount, probably $5-10/month. Whether this is reasonable or not I don’t know… but they certainly don’t think so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight I heard her (bad window roommate) basically ranting about me to my other roommate and my other roommate’s boyfriend. They all participated in the discussion. Couldn’t hear exactly what they were saying, but here are a few things I picked up on: since her window is shitty, she’s depressed and having the guy around makes her feel better; I’m always in the apartment (I’m pre-med and study pretty much exclusively in my apartment because I have IBS and feel most comfortable when I have access to a bathroom - but they don’t know that), so that makes up for their increased utilities from their guests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy view: it’s just common courtesy to communicate with roommates if you plan on having someone else sleep in the apartment. They never even gave a heads-up that these guys would be around all the time and sleeping here. And I pay a rent and utilities each month to have access to an apartment 24/7. How many of those 24 hours I spend in the apartment is irrelevant (and frankly, none of their business) because I pay my fair share. These guys pay nothing. Still - I do realize that it’s nice to be home alone every now and then, so the past few weeks I’ve been making an effort to use the library as a study spot instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I’m kind of just so pissed and frustrated. I feel like this (bad window) girl is just so immature to think that she’s entitled to have a guy basically living at our apartment without running it by anyone just because she has a bad window. I want to go back to $800/month in rent, tell them they can’t use my expensive items (kitchen table and chairs especially - one of which the bad window girl took into her room for her desk without asking), and maybe keeping separate trash. And we can continue splitting the utilities 3 ways. I'm pissed as I'm writing this though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I completely wrong here? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Long history of having to be the ‘hall monitor/bitch’ roommate because my one roommate is unhygienic/inconsiderate. Roommate thinks she’s entitled to have a guy living at the apartment because the lack of sunlight in her room makes her depressed. I floated him paying $5-10/month on the utilities. Now everyone hates me.",

      "description": "My husband and I are living in California where my family lives and his family was originally from. And he wants us to move to New Mexico where his family lives. He is currently finishing up his bachelor's degree and wants to move as soon as he finishes. Which only gives us less than a month to pack if we don't renew our rental lease.  \n\nSome background, when my husband was 16 his parents left him to finish highschool because he was set to be valedictorian. So they left him in California while they moved to New Mexico. They left him to sleep on couches at friends houses until he eventually ended up living with some of my family members. They basically abandoned him with no financial support in a different state. Though there were reasons it was still shitty to abandon your kid. My husband ended up getting a full ride scholarship to a university and has been going since he graduated highschool. \n\nFast forward 4 years later and my husband calls them every week. They constantly say how much they miss him and want him back there with them. They never ask how school is going and what struggles and stresses he goes through. It's always \"when are you going to be finished with school so you can come back here\". But, when we visit them or they visit they act like he doesn't exist. They would rather sit around and watch TV than visit with my husband. \n\nMy husband and I were talking about what is going on to happen after he graduates. And he still wants to move I believe his main reason for wanting this is due to his parents constantly pressuring him to do so and not by his own free will.\n\nWe have good jobs in California, no jobs in New Mexico and no reason to drop everything and uproot our lives. It isn't that I'm against moving it's just that I don't want to rush for no reason other than to be closer to his family. I would rather attempt to get our affairs in order before we move instead of rushing. I feel like he is forcing me to leave because he is being pressured by his family and not standing up for himself. \n\nBut am I the asshole for thinking that we should wait to move? Thoughts? \n",

      "description": "This is the most trivial of trivial matters, but one that we've been going around and around on for the past eleven years. I'd like some impartial third-party input.\n\nMy husband has occasional acne flareups. I've asked him to go to a dermatologist, but he always puts it off. In the meantime, he's living with me - a compulsive picker. I see a zit, and I just have to pop it. When he gets a bad flareup, I feel a bit like a stalker; I find every excuse to come up behind him when he has his shirt off, and when he's lying on his stomach, I can't help but run my hand up his back and start picking.\n\nObviously, this behavior annoys him. \n\nNow, I'm convinced that it's my right to pick on him because he's refusing to see a doctor, and is thus knowingly tempting my obsession. He thinks I need to knock it off, because of course, it's irritating to him. I should mention that he doesn't mind me popping the big ones, and he'll often ask me to, but I just can't help myself. I'm almost always scraping at his back. \n\nNow that I type it out, I think I know that I'm being the asshole, here. But I'd like you to weigh in. AITA? Or am I completely justified, here? I feel like I'm doing him a favor by cutting down on the acne.",

      "description": "So reddit is probably not the best advice resource but i'm done asking for friends advice. Here's the background i met this girl in my college club, she was chill, we have a number of mutual interest and we later end up hitting it off. We spend the entire week hanging with each other, she comes over to my place, we smoke, she is vibing with me and all seems well. I feel a strong connection but not too invested. Anyway we make plans to meet up on friday(further context she wanted to repay me for something by smoking me out on friday but i ran into her two days earlier so we hung out then) but i thought it was off since we had already smoked before. But she text me asking what am i doing? i ignore it due to the fact she had ignored my previous text the day before after replying to the previous text before that one and not wanting to seem to desperate.   \n\n\nAs i'm walking to my next meeting, i happen to run into her and she of course ask if i got her text, i say no, she ask if i'm doing anything i say no and she bypasses me visibly upset so i ask her what she is doing and she says nothing. I tell her text me after 1 when i'm done with my meeting(she assumes this means she can come over later), we end up meeting again around 1 and she says she will be over after 3pm. I readily agreed despite being completely unprepared(apartment is not clean enough, no food in the fridge etc basically i was struggling) but i run home get everything nice, she comes over. She is vibing and dancing, but we quickly hit a road block she wants to watch a movie or play a game, my xbox live is off at the time, which is cool for me i was busy playing rdr2 which she has but doesnt want to play because spoilers and i didn't have netflix due to some other issues. I did have amazon prime but none of the horror films she wanted to watch were available, finally she tells me to look up youtube vids and she plays on her phone.   \n\n\nSo at this point her jackets back on, she is on the couch but i'm in the chair away from her and it's not going well. She however ask me to come with her to pick up some weed, from her ex room mate/guy she thinks is madly in love with her/suburban plug i agree but she has severe anxiety issues and i make the smart decision to make an offhanded comment about her driving ability(to be fair her turns did scare me) and where did she learn to drive which she took offensively. Que long spiral of annoyance, her yelling at me to just stop talking, other issues and eventually me getting kicked out of her car. She brought me back home, apologized for yelling, i got all into my drake feelings and said it's cool in hopped out. So at this point our chill session is a flaming hellhole of disaster, i basically call it quits on the entire thing and just try to go full relaxation with her hoping when she gets back maybe i can salvage it. She came back because i invited her to a house party later that night, we smoke a blunt, play a little music but i can tell from her general vibe she is done with me and vice versa her attention is nominally on my room mate and I'm a after thought.   \n\n\nI accept this and focus on the party ahead. So we roll up to the party with drinks and weed, her and my room mate don't know anybody(neither do i) so they crowd around me as i make my way into the kitchen and luckily run into some fellow club presidents from the school i had literally met the day before but they show me love. I immediately get into the right state of mind and pull out drinks to start mixing. She ends up downstairs smoking weed for the night talking to this pothead(really cool guy), i end up getting wasted and becoming shot bros with every one, my room mate gets the wall flower treatment(which is shitty on my part, i should have tried to chaperone him more effectively but i didn't know anyone at the party and i was too drunk at that point to introduce him people, plus he was not smoking or drinking so i had no avenues open to get him into the right mood) and i end up taking weird drugs for the first time ever and having a lot of fucking fun. Which later turns into me being a drunken asshole apparently according to the people i brought with me, i end up getting in her face about some weed, which she says i tried to take out of her hand, i was aggressive, asked her to drunkenly dance with me and some other bullshit. Oh i also apparently whined or cried like a bitch to a couple people at the party about \"relationship issues\" which she caught ear of and put me further on her shit list.   \n\n\nI also said i would never fuck her, called her by a different girls name, said the girl who invited me was awesome and totally dtf which i forgot how but it led to me saying i would never fuck her. I then spent like 30 minutes drunkenly yelling at my room mates door trying to cock block him, out of a deep insecurity he would make a move on her(he didn't he is totally uninterested in her but i was drunk so eh) and finally he told her to sleep in his room. Which i should've done but i fucked up. So she spends the night, the next day she still wanted to hang over and smoke but she did not have a lighter. I apologized, but i also denied the extent of me being a drunken asshole to them both. I sent a apology meme which was hilarious, she has since been ignoring me for about a week or two now. I saw her once since then but quickly looked away, not sure if she saw me or not, positive she did and maybe she is mad even more because she thought i ignored her idk. Anyway i have come to the conclusion yes i was being an asshole but i did send a heartfelt apology. Maybe i don't deserve forgiveness but i'm desperately thinking about calling her and i just need some advice. Should i?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This post is more for my roommate since it was the job he applied for but here's the backstory. I have two roommates we will refer to them as Chip and Dale. Chip, Dale and I are all about to graduate college this semester and are applying for jobs. Chip and Dale are the same major and have many classes together. For the last year or so whenever Dale would apply to internships and jobs, Chip would go and apply for the same jobs, sometimes even without telling Dale. It was not too much of an issue before because neither would usually get these jobs/internships. Recently Dale told us about this job that he really wants and how it's one of the only jobs he's applied for that he can really see himself doing. Chip then went and applied that same day, which was also the deadline for the application. A few weeks pass and Dale finds out that he didn't make it to the next round of interviews. Chip on the other hand found out that he's getting flown into their headquarters for an interview and chose to gloat in front of Dale. Dale does know what to think of Chip applying to jobs that he is applying for. I think that since Chip and Dale are the same major from the same school, just with different GPAs, Chip's application directly affected Dale's. Also he should not be competing with his friends for employment. WIBTA for freaking out at him about this? ",

      "description": "I’m self-employed with an online business and very much DIY. I’m not an expert at everything, but I’m a quick learner when it comes to, say, doing my own graphic art or editing my own podcasts. It may not be the most polished job, but it does the trick.\n\nMy boyfriend loves tech and I used to say some things in passing like “someday when I get the time I’ll learn how to use this camera” or “it would be cool to animate my logo in the future” but I’ve stopped saying that around him because he will drop everything to help me do it, or just do it for me.\n\nProblem is, it’s just not a high priority right at that time, or I don’t want him wasting precious time (he’s in med school and he barely has time as it is). If I catch him doing these projects for me, it makes me feel awful that he’s not using that time for better things — his parents already hate me (unrelated reasons; they’re racist and they want him to be with another doctor) and think I’m a distraction and waste of time, when in reality I’ve been trying to respect his space and give him as much time to study as possible.\n\nToday we finally had an argument about him needing to “fix” everything — he always has suggestions for how I can improve my business or little things here and there. I will hear him out but usually “no thanks, it’s not a big deal/not a priority/I don’t have the time” and he will interpret that as “you just do it for me” and he’ll drop everything to help. I don’t want his help. And oftentimes the work he tries to do for my business is a surprise (meaning he doesn’t consult me on the details) and the result is not “on brand”, it sticks out like a sore thumb because it’s not consistent with my usual aesthetic. He sulks when I “reject” his gifts.\n\nI told him that I don’t want to seem ungrateful, but he’s overstepping his bounds. I never asked him for help, and I don’t want to mix my business and personal relationships. Most of all, I don’t want his input in how I run my own business, because he thinks he can watch a few episodes of Dragon’s Den and automatically knows how to run a company. I’ve been running my business just fine for years before we got together.\n\nHe thinks that I’m closed minded and I could be making more money by presenting myself in a more professional way, I think he’s being pushy and telling me how to do my job and he’s not respecting my boundaries. I finally put my foot down and told him any more “help” from him is a waste of both of our time and I won’t be accepting any more of his “gifts” involving changing my brand.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Leaving work yesterday, I was following a marked company vehicle. We got on the freeway onramp behind a tractor-trailer. Suddenly, they darted across the apron between the onramp and freeway over 100 feet before the merge area, accelerating heavily and showering my brand new vehicle with small gravel pieces. I spoke to my supervisor regarding it and reported that there was no damage to my vehicle. A third party informed them that a customer had reported them. Of course they knew who was behind them last night and came in here and lied to me about the tractor trailer suddenly braking, shouted at me and called me a liar for saying it was a customer. I didn't, that was the 3rd party's lie. \n\nAITA for not just dropping it when an inspection showed no damage to my vehicle? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my ex he needs to take his dog when he moves?",
      "description": "So my ex and I were together for 5 years and we broke up in January. We have two dogs, mine (C) and his (K). We got C in June 2017 and K in March 2018. It’s kind of always been the agreement that C was mine and K was his. He’s going on a month long trip to Europe from Mid May to mid June, and I’ve already agreed to watch over both dogs for free while he’s gone, since he’s gonna pay rent for the whole month of May, but not June. I’m planning on getting a roommate mid-May or the start of June, but I don’t know who it’ll be yet so I have no idea if I’m going to have extra pets around or anything like that. When he gets back from his trip, he’s planning on moving straight back in with his parents, who live in a small suburb about 30 minutes from where we currently live. \n\nHis parents have a dog that doesn’t get along with any other dogs so he can’t take K if he moves in with his parents. However, he only is planning to live there until August, so he will move out and get his own place before the semester starts up again. He wants me to keep both dogs by myself until then. \n\nHere’s the thing- K is an extremely anxious dog. He’d get really bad separation anxiety when we’d leave and would bark incessantly, go through trash, destroy stuff etc.  He is also very emotionally attached to both myself and C. He can’t stand being locked out of rooms or separated from C in any way. C isn’t really the same way though, C is a very independent dog. I feel like if K spends from May-August with me and C, he’s going to get very used to that routine and be exponentially more anxious when it’s time for him to go live with just my ex. \n\nSo my ex is telling me that I’m ruining his living arrangements by telling him he needs to take K right when he gets back from Europe. I think he’s being irresponsible by leaving him for so long in the first place, but he’s telling me he’ll come do walks and play dates over the summer when he’s living with his parents. I just worry since they live pretty far it’s not going to be enough and it’s just going to make a stressful transition even more stressful. I love both dogs and don’t want to cause either undue stress. He said he’ll get his own apartment close by so they can still see each other though. \n\nK is also much more hyper than C. He needs significantly longer walks, needs more attention and is generally just more high maintenance. He also has very bad leash aggression so it’s really hard to walk both dogs at once by myself because of K’s outbursts at any dogs we pass on walks. So, I think it’s not fair of him to just leave me alone to deal with both of these dogs when I’m working and taking classes because it’s a burden on me as well. C is an emotional support animal for me so he is calm and easy to deal with. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying he needs to find a way to take K with him once he’s back from Europe, even if that means not moving back in with his parents?\n",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend because he forgets everything I tell him?",
      "description": "Like the title says my boyfriend will forget everything I tell him even if I told him an hour earlier. The reason why I’m mad now is that on the 15th before bed I told my boyfriend that my dad was supposed to call me for his birthday since it was the instructions given to my dad as a birthday gift from my mom he had to call each of his kids to get the next part of his present. I had been telling my boyfriend this since my family decided on the gift for my dad about a month prior. I kept my boyfriend in the loop on everything that was happening. \n\nSo the 16th comes and I get home from work exhausted. I still had around 3 hours until my dad was supposed to call and I was just going to stick through it and wait then go to sleep after the call and wishing him a happy birthday. I tell my boyfriend this and he just tells me to sleep for a bit and he’ll wake me up if I sleep to long. I said okay but only after making sure he knew that in 3 hours or if my dad calls he had to wake me up immediately. I even set alarms on both his phone and mine and placed them next to him in the living room where he was playing a game. \n\nI fall asleep in our bedroom only to wake up 5 hours later to my boyfriend saying my mom was blowing up my phone I had about 10 missed calls from my dad and my mom was calling me nonstop the last 2 hours and sending texts saying I ruined my dads birthday because he can’t get the next part of his gift without me since no one knew what my part was.\n\nSo now I’m livid at my boyfriend and ask him why he didn’t wake me up when my dad called.  His exact words were “I didn’t think it was that important so I let you sleep a little longer.” \n\nNow I’m fuming and telling my boyfriend that this entire month I’ve been telling him that today was my dad’s birthday and that he was supposed to call me to get my part of his surprise gift.  My boyfriend just says he forgot. And I don’t even think I can properly explain how angry that made me. I wouldn’t have fallen asleep had I known he would forget something I was practically hammering into his head for more than a month.\n\nNow I’m just pissed because after this incident I realized that this isn’t the only time my boyfriend has forgot something I told him. If it’s anything about me or my family he will conveniently forget but will remember something if it has to do with him or his family. As an example my boyfriend’s grandparents are having their 40th anniversary in March and my boyfriend has been telling me constantly- since about December- that I needed to get the ingredients for the food I’m bringing over to the party.\n\nApart of me just wants to wait until March and conveniently forget to go shopping the week of the anniversary just so my boyfriend gets that his selective memory is a real issue and it isn’t nice to be on the receiving end of it.\n\nI’m sorry this was so long but I’m basically pulling my hair out at this point trying to reconcile with my parents and my boyfriend giving me the cold shoulder because he thinks I’m overreacting. Am I the asshole for being mad at him?",

      "description": "A little back story on me before I start this story, I’m an ex-muslim girl.\n\nOne of the most challenging issues of leaving a religion that a person has been raised into is changing lifestyles \n\nWhile everyone has different disorders to deal with a problem that girls from that religion usually have is; body issues/anxiety over getting caught/fear of harassment \n\nGoing from wearing a cover from head to toe to the causal summer shorts is a huge challenge for most of them\n\nIf I were to move somewhere further from my family I would definitely start wearing them without a problem *I’ve been secretly wearing causual clothes for a long time now*\n\nWhile posting about my experiences on the subreddit r/exmuslim, a person sent a message to me, telling me about the situation they were in\n\nShe got to move in with her less religious relatives in the U.S and had the full freedom to wear whatever \n\nHowever anxiety got in the way, so she kept on wearing the full cover despite the summer heat\n\nAs a result she fainted from heat strokes, three separate times..the walk to her college is long \n\nShe wanted me to text her as she went about in causal clothes as a distraction/emotional support \n\nI was more than happy to help\n\nI told her everything I used on myself back when I was in her shoes\n\n*make it through this time, the second time won’t feel this nerve recking*\n\n*listen to music*\n\n*focus on this screen instead of the on lookers*\n\n*Those passerbys won’t recognize you without your cover*\n\n*wear large sunglasses if it makes you more comfortable*\n\n*it’s okay you made it far enough, you can go home*\n\n*you can try getting used to a slightly longer short before wearing that one*\n\n*you should see a psychiatrist, fainting from heatstrokes is dangerous*\n\nI repeated this over and over until she finally made it \n\nThe first time I helped was during the walk to a nearby laundry service\n\nShe kept repeating the same lines about worrying people would know her etc. very repetitive lines is a sign of clinical anxiety plus the self-harm\n\nI tried my best to comfort her and it seemed to almost not work sometimes, so I would ask her to go home halfway then try a little bit more the next time\n\nI tried recommending a psychiatrist but I didn’t get to hear an answer back on that..\n\nThe conversation went on for two and a half hours? I skipped dinner when my parents called me. \n\nMy typing thumbs were never this exhausted before but I was glad to help her finally make it there\n\nI must’ve written a whole book worth of text bubbles or more\n\nHer Frequently going over the same worries over and over had me typing the same advices just as repetitively\n\nI recommended a psychiatrist/psychologist  again after using up everything I could think of \n\nI didn’t get to hear back on her reasons for not seeing one \n\nShe was capable of making the walk back on her own\n\nI was glad, tired and guilty but most of all glad to help somebody who used to be in my situation \n\nShe will probably be better off the second time\n\nAbout a day or two later, I got a DM from her\n\nShe was going to a nearby store to buy groceries and wanted some support \n\nSo I went with it\n\nShe started repeating about people staring and feeling over exposed\n\nI repeated the same advices from last time\n\n*people dress like this normally*\n\n*they don’t recognize you*\n\n*focus on the screen*\n\nI felt like I was walking in the same circle like last time but felt immense guilt Simultaneously for it\n\nI really did want to help but that was hours upon hours, she really needs to seek a professional \n\nI tried to talk to her honestly about it\n\n*I want what’s best for you but I’m starting to get tired of hearing the same conversation. How about we talk about what you’re planning to buy? You have to try avoiding thinking about people*\n\nI wanted to shift her attention away from people as much as possible. That way we can have a good conversation while avoiding thinking about other people\n\nFor a while it worked\n\nShe told me about what stuff she needed to buy then mid conversation she switched back\n\nwe went back to square one\n\nIt took at minimum 30 minutes of texting to convince her to get to the front door alone \n\nI was at my limits ,I felt extremely horrible for feeling that way too. I decided to firmly tell her to seek professional help and that I’m sorry before hitting the block button\n\nSo am I the asshole for leaving this person?\nI hope she doesn’t see this post.. or maybe does to let me know she got the help needed. I worry that she might’ve went back to wearing that again...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Obligatory sorry for formatting issues on mobile and for then length but I’m a bit of a rambler. \nBasically friends and family organised a surprise bachelorette party for myself, my sister and my friend got into a bit of a heated argument during the organisation of it all and they couldn’t let it lie on the night. \nI wasn’t aware of any of the underlying issues until halfway through the night when they began arguing. I don’t want to go into the details of the argument but I know both are at fault. \nI spent the rest of my night on eggshells going between both parties and trying to spend time with both of them as well as the other groups who all came making sure everyone was having a good night.  It all became too much for me so I left early and broke down as soon as I got home to my fiancé. He spent the entire next day trying to comfort me and was completely angry on my behalf. \nI haven’t spoken to either of them and haven’t even heard from them since this all went down on Friday night, but I plan on contacting them myself and telling them that if they can’t be civil we won’t be having a wedding. My fiancé and I will just go to the courthouse and get married without the party afterwards.\nNot inviting them isn’t an option because by dis-inviting either will cause a huge ripple effect from both circles of friends and family and just leave a huge cloud hanging over everyone on the day. My fiancé is in agreement with this because we would both rather lose the money we’ve spent than have a bad atmosphere at our wedding. So WIBTA if I gave them this ultimatum? ",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I'm on mobile, so there might be some formating errors.\n\nDisclaimer n°2: bit of a long story, tl;dr at the end\n\nSo a little bit of backstory here: My (16) parents divorced when I was 7, and I've been alternating houses beetween the two each week since. I've never had any issues with it so far, mostly because I can't remember what it was like before, so here's that. \n\n\nNow forward a couple years, my father met a woman 5~6 years ago and she's been living with us since. At first she was nice with me and all, no problem whatsoever. 2 years ago, they got married and all, and that's when shit began to hit the fan: at the ceremony, all my father's friends began to trashtalk my mom behind her back (although they were her friends too), and everybody had a good laugh, except me of course. At first it was just during the ceremony, but now, every now and then, my father's friends or my mother in law start to badmouth my mom or her family (my mom's family tree's a bit complicated and they often make fun of it), and when I try to tell them that the fact that they do it in front of me irritates me, they shrug it of or say it was \"just a joke\" and tell me to relax.\n\n\n And that was only the beginning... \n\n\nNow, my mother in law is starting to take over my father's household: when my father and I want to do something together (ie playing games together, doing sports or watching a TV show), she tells us that we can't, because it's eirher \"stupid\" or that she just blatantly doesn't want us to do it, for no apparent reasons. She also comment my dressing style, saying it's ugly or unfashionable (I don't have the pretention of being a fashion specialist, but i'm dressing like your average teenage guy). We live in a decent sized appartment, though I have a rather small room, and my mother in law litterally invade my room by putting her stuff in my closet, putting MY stuff away. I tried asking nicely, but everytime I was talking to a brick wall. Even worse, when we talk with my father about something, she just drop in to say things like \"what would you know of that, you're only a kid\" and always belittles me as if I was five. Also, when my father and I are disagreeing on something, she will always, always side with my father, doesn't matter the time or subject, even if i'm right, i'll always be wrong because \"he's your father and you're only a child\". It's always things like that, little things now and then that bothers me in the end. And since there's some fight you can't win when you don't pay the bills, I've always kept a low profile.\nMore recently, I've got myself a girlfriend since about two month, and I shared the news with my father, who was happy about it, but my mother in law kept saying \"I'm impressed that a loser like you could get a girlfriend, she must be blind\", and at that point I kinda lost it. I said that she has no right to say this to me and that I didn't ask her opinion, and she replied whit something that angered me over the top : \"stop being insolent to me! You know, when I chose to be with your father, I chose because I love him, not you. I'm making an effort by accepting you!\". At this point I was just in shock and went to my room to think about it.\n\n\nNow, as when I'm typing this, it's m'y birthday in two days and i'll be 17, which mean I can appeal the divorce judge's decision and decide to live only with my mom, who's got a nice flat and is much nicer to me. \n\n\nThe only thing holding me back from doing it is my father's reaction to this, I feel I'm kinda betraying him by doing this, cause the only things he did was to marry a bitch and being blind to the struggle I'm living even when I explained it to him. I'm affraid he'd fall into depression, because when my mother and him divorced, he took it very badly and almost like a betrayal, and I fear he'll hit rock bottom if I go live with my mother full time.\n\n\nTl;Dr: my stepmom's a bitch who's regulating m'y life to make it what feels like a living hell, but if I go to my mom's, it'll probably destroy my father who's only guilty to have bad taste in women and be oblivious to my struggle.\n\n\nSo, Will I Be the Asshole if I move out my father's house?\n\n",

I have the wall opposite of the co-worker in question, separated also by the door between us.\n\nI'm the new one in this office, I've been with the company 4 years, but promoted to this position a year ago and moved into this building. I've never shared an office before, so I've been trying to get used to boundaries/etiquette hence why I've been quiet. We each do our own stuff at our desk for example me and one of the co-workers both have a bottle of unscented lotion and use it usually when we get to the office as the cold weather is harsh on hands.\n\nThis coworker in question comes into work 2.5-3 hours before the rest of us show up to work, so he has that whole time to himself alone in the room. He's got plenty of other bad habits that I've put up with, like his short temper, constantly playing loud videos on Facebook, constantly looking at half naked girls online, or being overly open about his sex life. (He's also an older guy like 50, short, fat and balding.) \n\nHowever for some reason his habit of clipping his nails, everyday, about twice a day (morning and afternoon) at his desk is bugging me. I get it's his own area, but he does it over the carpet not even a paper or anything to throw it away. And the noise of the nail clippers are just frustrating me. \n\nWIBTA if I asked him to take care of his nails at home instead of the office? Or should I instead take this up with the supervisor? Or is it not my place to cross as it's on his side of the room. \n\nThanks",

She hasn't vacuumed in months, and she isn't here on the weekends. When she does go shopping, it's for herself only unless asked.

A lot of people have misconceptions about it and even if you are living proof that their misconceptions aren’t true they will ghost you or just do the slow back out of your life.

Part of me feels like if even for only a few dates or days together they  will be able to see that there’s no outward signs and that I have it under control without misconceptions just shutting it down.  The other side of me feels like if this is a hard pass for someone that should be their right and I shouldn’t waste both our times.  \n\nI’ve been using apps to get back out there.

      "description": "My sister and I have always had a rough relationship.  We just don't get along and I percieve her as controlling, with a habit of giving unwanted advice.  Sis is older and moved away from home at 18.  I stayed in the family home as an adult to care for our mother, who had a multitude of health issues and passed away this year. \n\nOver the years Sis has said many things that just rubbed me the wrong way.  She always seemed to be implying that I wasn't caring for mom adequately.  She lived way across the country, yet still wanted to offer 'advice'.  For example, we had a real issue getting mom to eat.  Her doctors were all aware and we did what we could to encourage her.  Sis would tell me to offer mom foods she liked...as if I was giving her things she hated.  She would remind me to tell the hospice nurses about it.  Like if Sis wasn't around I would not have the sense to tell her medical caretakers about this major issue. Stuff like that was constant.  Every conversation I had with sis for all the years mom was sick was her telling me how to do things better.\n\nI should note I DID push back against this and have at times cut down communication with her or directly told her she needed to stop.  It never changed things for long.\n\nI let a lot of this go because i understood part of it was Sis feeling disconnected.  At least she cared about mom, unlike some of my other siblings. \n\nSo now the question.  Sis said some things while mom was in her last stages that really bothered me.  Part of me wants to confront her.  Part of me knows that emotions were running high.  \n\nFor one, she implied that a fall mom took at the start of the year was my fault.  Mom and I were standing in the kitchen together when it happened.  I was within arm's reach of her, but she just dropped.  Sis kept asking over and over how it happened and then summed it up by saying \"Right...it happened when you weren't paying attention.\"  \n\nAfter mom's death Sis was going through mom's old writings and emails, many of which talk about her health issues.  Sis wanted to talk about how things would have been different if mom saw different doctors or had a different diagnosis.  Which first...none of that is relevant.  Two, mom was an incredibly noncompliant patient who constantly blockaded her own medical care and progressively narrowed down her own medical options to basically nonexistent. I loved my mom, but she was the absolute WORST when it came to helping herself.  I spent so much time and energy in my life BEGGING her to follow medical orders. Sis claims to understand that, but also said \"I dont know if things would have been different if I'd been there...\"\n\nI want to tell her blaming me for mom's fall was a really shitty, unfair to do.  I want to tell her that she wasn't here, and thinking that things would have gone differently is again really shitty and unfair.  It's been six months since mom died and I still can't stop thinking about these words.  Would I been an asshole for confronting her now and using things she may have said while grieving as evidence?

      "description": "Happens kinda regularly enough to become very frustrating. Generally if I bring a concern about things which are unacceptable, I'm ignored and dismissed. For record, I'm also female, we are both.\n\nOne example that really pissed me off, my partner was at the very early stages of pregnancy (a few days) and said, \"after birth, I'm only going back to work 60%\". My response, \"well I think we need to discuss this between us both\". At the time, the birth date was looking to be exactly when I finish my PhD and can get very decent unemployment benefits for 12 months in my country after graduation. I was explaining, for financial reasons, perhaps I can be a full-time parent for sometime at the start of the child's life and then we can decide on a different arrangement when I need to get a job. While I'm being paid by the social system, she could still work full-time.\n\nThis line of discussion was just completely ignored. We were driving at the time and she just simply pretended like I wasn't speaking, would not engage in discussion, and looked away out the window. Obviously, being ignored escalated my tone dramatically. It still sticks with me that she thinks that she can simply ignore what I'm saying in the hope the discussion goes away.\n\nAITA for expecting my partner to engage in discussion, even if it isn't what she wants?\n\nAlso, the pregnancy didn't last past another few days.

      "title": "AITA for wanting to get rid of a shitty cat?",
      "description": "My girlfriend (22F) and I (25M) adopted a young cat on a whim from the local shelter about 10 months ago, and he's been a really good cat, up until he start shitting outside the litter box. At first, this seemed like a one-off event due to the harsh, chemical smell of the litter we were using, so we did some research and started taking precautions and extra measures to try and prevent this from happening again. We cleaned more frequently, played with the cat more, got him a massive cat tree, took him to my mom's as a getaway every 2 weeks, and just generally spoiled him IMO. But none of this worked, because this stupid cat shit in the wrong place another 4 times, each time testing my sanity more and more. \n\nMy girlfriend generally likes animals more than I do. She had 2 dogs living with her family, and when we moved in together into an apartment at the start of the year, she had no pets to love anymore. I wanted a cat when i was younger, but my parents never got me one despite that; i figured that now that i have a stable job, i can easily afford to take on a little extra responsibility and fulfill a childhood dream of owning a pet for my first time. I now know that I should have done more research, I should have pushed back on my girlfriend's excitement at the shelter, and insisted that we prepare ourselves before diving into such a commitment. \n\nWell, 10 months and 5 shit-surprises in, I can admit that this experiment was a mistake and owning a cat isn't for me. We're all about to head to bed last night, when my girlfriend yells my name in alarm and points to the massive deuce in the middle of the comforter. I lose my shit - partly because I don't want to fucking deal with this at 10 pm, but mostly at the thought that this idiotic creature can so innocently ruin my things and cause us both distress with 0 consequences or awareness. My girlfriend is in tears too, wailing \"Why would he DOO this!!???\" In my rage, I take the cat and stick his face in the poo in a horrible and useless attempt at forcing a mental connection between \"you're shitting here\" and \"we're not happy about it\". My intention was to immediately wash it off, but my girlfriend freaks out and initiates a mini tug of war that amounts to shit being thrown everywhere. \n\nAfter spending 4 hours cleaning everything, I announce/decide that i cannot fucking have this cat in my life anymore, and that i will be seeking to rehome him ASAP because i'm not mentally equipped to deal with this kind of behavior. Well this didn't go over well with my girlfriend, who proceeds to repeatedly deny this as a possibility she's willing to consider, because of the \"heartbreak\" it would cause her and because she wants to find alternate means to fix the behavior, which really amounts to throwing money at the problem or expending even more energy keeping the cat happy. Personally, I need a guarantee that this won't happen again, and the only way that's possible IMO is by not having the cat in my life anymore. \n\nThis argument has extended to today, and whereas I'm standing my ground and genuinely trying to explain my rationale, she complains about my unempathetic and cold attitude and has made some hurtful jabs in an effort to get me to reconsider, even alluding to a breakup because she doesn't \"see a future together\". Mind you, we've been together 4 years. \n\nAm I the asshole, or am I justified?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been living together for three years and dating for four. He works a fancy real adult job, and I'm still grinding away (for now) in food service. I'm in management so I'm required to work on Christmas Eve and have had to for the last two years. There's just no exception unfortunately. \n\n\nMy boyfriend's family lives in another state, about a six hour drive away. He's not that close with them and Christmas has become just about the only time he sees them. The first two years we were together I was able to visit his family with him for Christmas, and it was great. They made me feel like I was a part of the family and I really needed that. But of course work put a damper on that. \n\n\nFor the past two years my boyfriend has gone to visit his family without me, and besides a little bit of sulking about how I'll miss him, I've been okay with that. I get out of work on Christmas Eve and spend the night with my two cute kitties, and then on Christmas I have dinner with my family. \n\n\nI'm just not that close with my family. It didn't used to be that way, but things have changed. I've spent a lot of my adult life so far feeling kind of sad/lonely during the holidays. What I really want is to spend this Christmas waking up in my home with my boyfriend. I want to have presents under the tree for each other and make us a holiday breakfast and all the dorky Christmas stuff. I want him to be here with me. We haven't ever had a Christmas together in our own home!\n\n\nI told him this and he didn't respond the way I hoped. He says that he sees me every day, and the only time he gets to see his full family together is on Christmas. He says we could have a late Christmas, pretend a different day is Christmas when he gets back. But it's just not really the same. I'm upset because I wish I didn't have to fight him to spend the day with me. I wish that it was important to him too. \n\n\nHe's spent the last two Christmases with his family while I've woken up alone. Am I the asshole for wanting him to be with me this year? \n",

      "description": "So I’ve know this guy... we’ll call him Bruno. Bruno and I have known each other since middle school. He’s a year below me in high school and he got a girlfriend maybe 3 or 4 months ago.\n\nVictor is incredibly talented and a wizard on the guitar so I work with him for song writing and getting performances together. We’ve got one coming up so I’ve been talking to him a lot more.\n\nLast night his girlfriend posted a nice photo of him on her story and I responded and said “my boy Bruno hella cute wow.” Note that I said this ENTIRELY platonically as I am also a straight dude.\n\nBruno then hit me up and said something along the lines of, hey that’s not cool that you’re making her uncomfortable, stop that shit it’s weird. So I backed off and explained.\n\nI’m in the choir/theatre kinda clique in school and we’re very affectionate towards each other, I often eat lunch with my friends and their significant others and I’ll be like “haha yeah Elliot is cute” or I’ll nap on someone on the couch because we’re literally all like that. I explained that to him and that that’s just how I am but if it makes her anxious or uncomfortable I’ll back off. He said he understood but continued to drone on and on and on about it.\n\nLater that night he posted: “if you see two people in love do NOT fuck with them” which I’m assuming he directed at me.\n\nAITA?",

This kid is highly liberal, however we tolerate it because you should be exposed to different political opinions, right? Anyway, my tables interests also include video games and wrestling(it’s big at my school) while his only interests are fortnite and basketball, which I don’t hate him for, typical teenager stuff right there. Anyway one day I was talking to one of my friends about Doom Eternal and he starts trying to interrupt me and tell everyone about his fortnite wins. I told him “shut up, wait your turn to speak”. I instantly felt bad, but he got really angry saying he was going to “knock me up” and stuff like that. The next day I was relieved as he no longer sat by us, however I felt bad for making him leave. From that you may think I’m the asshole, however the story gets more intense. A day later, he told all the black kids(my schools about 30% black, 70% everything else) that I had called him a ni***r, which, no I did not. Racial slurs are not to be messed with and no way would I call him because of anger. All of the kids he told wanted to beat me up, however my table was able to diffuse the situation and tell them that the kid lied. Everyone at the table was outraged at him, and he no longer sits by us. So AITA?",

Sadly I wasn't doing very well at this time (severe d*pression, s*lf harm..). Two weeks before the trip I was so done, that I checked myself into hospital. I was released a few days later and was also doing a lot better plus I was very excited for the trip.\nWhen I was back in school my teacher told me, that I wasn't allowed to go to Barcelona because of my mental breakdown. Somehow he was afraid, that I'm going to k*ll myself on the trip. This was absolute bs.\nHe even wanted me to bring a doctor's note, that I wasn't allowed to go on the trip. Instead I brought him a note, that said that it would be the best for me to go on vacation. He didn't care at all and shrugged it all off. \nSince this happened 2 weeks before the trip I wasn't able to get all my money back, so I spent 100€ for nothing.\n\nI don't know if this is the right subreddit but I just feel like that it's my fault, that I wasn't allowed to go on the trip.

      "description": "I have been friends with a girl with autism (I'm not sure whenever it is severe or not, but I'm pretty sure she is high-functioning autistic).\nI have been friends with this girl for around 1 and a half years, but in the recent months she started to make my friends and I really uncomfortable.\n\nWe are in secondary school (Year 10), not sure where in American school system. \nI have C-PTSD, and I am sensitive to touch. I have explained this to her many times but she continued to try and touch me and push her limits. She also did this to my friends who also don't really like it. This included getting her face extremely close to us, jumping behind us to scare us, and asking us gross things. \nThis went as far as her asking \"Can I puke in your mouth?\" and other gross questions. \n\nAlso, she kept complaining how we are never there for her and she doesn't like it that she always has to initiate a conversation first, but in the past, when we shared our issues, she never comforted us in any way, and didn't provide much support. Whenever my friends or I started a conversation in a groupchat (which was often), she never replied properly, but only ever said \"lol\", or sent us the okay thumbs up emoji or the rainbow emoji (it was always the messenger emoji you had on the right of your screen).\n\nMy friends and I have recently made a \"cult\" as a joke and we made a little support system with our own inside jokes and such. We sometimes go out together, and do random stuff. She called this stupid and basically insulted all of my friends. \nShe also lied about my boyfriend (back when we were not together), and said that he said I should kill myself, of course this wasn't true and I hope it is justifible that I got a bit angry. \n\n\nI know this does sound mean but she has a really not nice odour, she smells like musty rotting wood which is not pleasant to be around, and I know this might be because of her situation, but I think she rarely washes her hair. Which normally I wouldn't have an issue with, but due to her always getting close, sometimes was too much. \n\nWe have explained this to her many times and most of the time she used her autism as an explanation, but refused to attempt to change. Although she had started to ask for permission to touch us (which still comes off as creepy). \nI think I should be allowed to choose who I am friends with and who I am not, and shouldn't just accept what is going on simply because of someone's autism, especially when it just makes all of my friends uncomfortable. \n\nI only really talk to her sometimes because of a mutual friend who doesn't want us to argue. \nI hope I am not too much of an asshole, I just want to hang around people who get my sense of humour and I feel comfortable around. I'm not doing this simply because she's autistic. \n\nTl;dr : She makes us extremely uncomfortable, insulted us, and has double standards. : /",

      "description": " \n\nLong story short, my boyfriend had a falling out with some of his friends a while back. They are currently roommates because the splitting events occurred after this term’s lease was signed. They’re no longer on good terms, and don’t speak to each other unless it’s something house-related (like chore reminders and things like that.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m not going to go into detail of what happened between them, but there is no question that his ex-friends were at fault. They invaded his privacy, belittled him when he was upset, and were extremely manipulative. They really shattered my boyfriend for a bit and because of that, I obviously don’t view them in a good light either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is though, I still talk to them. I don’t go out of my way to carry out a conversation, but I’ll still politely ask them how they’re doing and how their day went if I bump into them in the house. Even though they aren’t good people, I still feel the need to be civil towards them. I would feel like an awful person if I didn’t, especially when they initiate the conversation first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis greatly upsets my boyfriend. He doesn’t get why I still treat them “like friends” even though they hurt him so much. He wants me to cut the civility and says that they’re undeserving of it. He justifies it by saying that he would never let anyone treat me the way that they treated him. I understand where he’s coming from, but I personally find it to be a very difficult behaviour to change. And besides, I’m hardly treating them like friends — I don’t go out of my way to talk to them and I don’t invite them to do things with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe’s disappointed that I don’t change even though I know my current behaviour upsets him. I’ve really tried, but sometimes, I just need banter just to fill the uncomfortable silence when I’m alone with his roommates in a shared space of the house. So lately, I’ve been feeling incredibly confused about the situation. Reddit, IATA?",

      "description": "Normally I wouldn’t even question this decision but I inadvertently caused some drama at my workplace today.   \nBackstory: I live somewhere that gets pretty cold. And like most of the country I live in we’ve been hammered with snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures. Not wanting to deal with the hassle of my daily commute, and definitely not wanting to stand outside to wait for public transportation, I used a rideshare service both yesterday and today.  \nI thought nothing of it until a coworker arrived today and said “Oh G-What I didn’t know you were here. I didn’t see your car in the lot.” I replied that I took a rideshare today because I didn’t want to deal with the weather.   \n“Well that’s a selfish thing to do!” She accused.   \nI was floored. When I asked for a reason why, she told me “You shouldn’t make someone drive you around because you’re too lazy to do it yourself. Everyone else drove in today.”  \nNow the way I see it, nobody that works for Uber/Lyft/whatever is *forced* to work in poor conditions. By my understanding they get to choose what hours they work and they can choose not to pick up riders. I wasn’t making anyone drive that didn’t want to. I also picked the option that allows other riders to book, so I allowed to have fewer cars with fewer drivers on the road, so shouldn’t this actually be the safer and *less selfish* decision?  \nI really don’t feel I did anything wrong, but tomorrow is going to be a record cold day and most of my office already thinks I’m an asshole for doing this. Are they right? ",

      "description": "So almost my whole family has never maintained contact to my Grandma since my mother (her daughter) had several disputes with her and my grandpa divorced her.   \nI was too young back then and have no recollection of that.\n\n  \nSince i am an adult now she tried to get in touch with me and we had a very long phonecall.\n\nShe asked my like two or three personal questions and after that just went on how my family is mean and how hard-working she was in the past. How she has therefore earned her alimony and she told me very much about her current physical health issues.   \nShe ended up promising me money which i tried to talk her out of but she was still determined to do it.\n\nMy family denies the accusations she is making since there are some quite heavy ones for example that my grandpa hit her in the past. But there are also some smaller ones which i just cant accepts are true. For example she said my mother was always very ungrateful and personally i know my mother and she is a very sensitive person so i can't accept that she is telling the truth.  \nA few months later she called again and essential just went on about the same stuff as last time spew hate about my familiy and didnt talk about me at all. She brought up the money she promised me and apologized saying she had some expences and will send me some soon. As last time I neither brought it up nor did i really want it since money isnt a problem for me.   \n\n\nWe havent talked since then.  \n\n\nSo by now I figured out i dont want any more contact with her because it doesnt seem like she actually cares for me and her toxicity towards the rest of my family is really putting me off . Her also promising stuff she doesnt hold up to seems to me like a big red flag especally since i never ask for it and im also always telling her that she really doesnt need to.   \n\n\nSo am I an asshole for choosing that i dont want any more contact with her?   \nAfter all she is still family but i have lived years without her and i dont really feel like having contact with her is positive for my life.  \n\n\n  \n",

      "description": "The TLDR is this, my sisters have been annoyed at me for weeks because I said I don’t want to do anything for my birthday (in a few days) and they planned a whole big thing for it, which I said to them to cancel. They now haven’t spoken to me since, after weeks of being ignored I said to them last night to just not even bother anymore. I’m now being accused of spending all my time with my boyfriend and ignoring them instead.\n\nThe long version: I will edit this after and post the link to what my sisters did, but basically I said I don’t want to do anything for my birthday this year, I’m turning 25 and quite honestly the last 5 years have been so crap that I just can’t be bothered to do anything. Instead I’m seeing my boyfriend on Monday and we’re going out to see the Lumiere Lights (as I’ve wanted to see it for years).\n\nSince I said that I don’t want to do anything they have purposely left me out of all their plans and just ignored me, one of them literally goes past where I live 5 days a week, as it’s on her way to take my niece to and from school, so it’s not like they’ve not had a chance. They are both constantly at my parents house (a 15 minute bus ride from me), despite the fact that back in August I had to call police on my dad, after he beat my mum (who dropped the charges), they’ve just acted like he’s done nothing. I have barely spoken to my mum since it happened, and I haven’t spoken to my dad at all, I made plans to introduce my mum to my boyfriend and my dad decided to show up and completely ignored us both.\n\nObviously there’s only so long you can be treated like rubbish by people before you snap, so last night I just texted them both (we had a group chat) and said to them to just not bother anymore, and then I left the chat. This morning my older sister texted me and said that I’m just being selfish, and that she hasn’t spoken to me because she doesn’t want to be accused of anything. She also went on a long rant about being in and out of hospital with her pregnancy, and that she doesn’t want to be accused of anything (all I heard about was her ‘miracle’ baby and I’m waiting to find out if I can have kids). My younger sister (20, not that young) hasn’t even tried to talk to me, and everytime I have tried to call her the last few weeks all I’ve heard is ‘I’m with my friend/boyfriend/friends family. I’ll call you tomorrow’, the last time she said that was Monday and she still hasn’t called me.\n\nTheir main accusation is that I have spent all my time with my boyfriend (I haven’t seen him in nearly a week), and that’s all they hear about. I rarely talk abut him, because I’m not that person. However when I do see him he stays with me for a few days, as he lives far away (at least an hour by train) so it’s pointless for him to see me for one night and then go home. He also stayed a little longer last time as I was on my period, as they’re really bad due to the problems I have related to why I might not be able to have kids, and because it was so bad I actually had to take time off work because I had worked myself to the point of nearly collapsing when I got in from work one night. He stayed longer as he had to call in sick to work for me, and he was making sure I was resting so that I didn’t end up in hospital with it (it has happened before). They have totally ignored that though and instead focus on the fact that I’ve spoken with to him more than them, I refuse to try to call them first now because I always have to, and my younger sister lives far away (but constantly goes to my parents), and the older one lives in a really gross house which just smells constantly so I avoid it.\n\nI have now just cut off contact with them as a result of all this, and I genuinely can’t see how I am the asshole in this.\n\nAlso side note for boyfriends: my younger sister is almost always with hers as he lives down the road from her, and my older sister sees her boyfriend so much that she actually tried to invite him to a mutual friends birthday brunch, and then cancelled when our friend said no (because she doesn’t know her boyfriend very well and it was a girls only event).",

There are still lots of people out there who, despite using modern technology each and every day, have yet to learn how to solve simple issues by taking a look at their settings or via a quick google search.\n\nOne of those people is my mother. Now, I do love my mother very very much (of course!) but sometimes she just drives me insane with her questions on \"how do I do this on my phone?\", \"where do I change this setting?\", \"why is this not working?\" and her immediately trying to hand me her device so that I can fix it.\n\nI do not take her phone/tablet when she holds it out to me. If it's not a simple \"turn it off and on again\" issue, I usually tell her to just show me where the problem is and we'll look at it together. She should be the one making the changes in her settings or whatever else needs to be done. That never fails to make her instantly annoyed, though. Apparently I \"don't want to help her\" if I don't just do whatever she needs done. No amount of me explaining to her that I want to teach her to do things herself can ever appease her. She doesn't have to be afraid of breaking anything, most devices are actually quite foolproof. But no, it's just that I \"have no patience\" and \"can't even do a simple little thing for her\".\n\nThis doesn't usually create a huge conflict but it happens so often that it's really bugging me, and it makes me question if I'm inadvertently being a dick, even though I have good intentions.\n\nAITA for not just sucking it up and fixing things?

The first submission, members of the group used the excuse of midterms for their other classes and i ended up doing 70% of the project. The second submission, we had a group meeting in which everyone had to leave at someone point and i ended up doing the whole assignment alone. Afterwards, i talked to my professor and he gave me the option to separate from my group. I proposed a plan to my group members that the rest of the group and i would write 2 different papers and we'd combine it at the end. My group members told me they dont like the agreement and i threaten to leave. Am i the asshole?",

He texted me pretty late asking if i’m ok with having two of his friends (both girls) over bc they had nowhere to stay. I said sure because obviously, i trust him. Well, one girl tried to kiss him saying it’s not cheating. The other girl helped trying to get him. From what he said, he told me he hid in the extra bedroom all night. I trust him but i felt a punch in my stomach. I told him about how i felt about those two and i told him that i trust him but i don’t trust his friends. he respected my view of his friends. Yet, i’m still a bit iffy about the two friends he has.\n\nI have a bad feeling when it comes to those two girls. We know each other &amp; it’s not saying i hate them or dislike them, i just have a gut feeling towards them. One of my friends told me about them and how they have bad personalities and such. It made me feel even more iffy about the whole situation. I keep telling myself it’s in the past and i need to get over it before my jealousy gets pretty bad.\n\nOne girl, he known since freshman year of high school. The other girl he known because at that time, it was his best friend’s gf. \n\nEven my own boyfriend tells me how horrible his best friend’s gf is. He told me how she went to every guy in his friend group and tried to get at them. I’ve convinced myself that it’s okay to feel a little distrust towards her.\n\ni feel like the bad guy in this but i’ve been told that i’m not the bad guy and it’s okay to feel a bit of distrust towards them. my boyfriend was just trying to be a good friend and lend a roof to his friends. am i the asshole?

      "description": "This is really long and I'm sorry lol.\n\nMy best friend of almost 6 years is obese. She's about the same height as me (5'4 - 5'5) and has to weigh about 3 and change, if not, close. (Not meant to sound derogatory at all). \n\nShe's into this whole \"lose weight quick\" BS and has been very interested in taking diet pills again. These diet pills specifically, keep your appetite down, boost your metabolism and give you energy. Which sounds sketchy as fuck to begin with, but I let it go for the sake of the conversation. So instead of just instantly preaching to her about diet pills, I just slid in some suggestions like eating healthier (which she doesn't do) and working out a little bit, even if it's just taking a walk around the block. \n\nShe just excused it off with \"I get enough exercise at the hospital lol\" (she's a patient sitter). Then continues with how she wants to get down to at least 130, so she'll take them for awhile and then quit so that she doesn't (quote) \"get too dependent on them.\" This set off immediate red flags, so I said \"And that's why I don't mess with them.\" \n\nCompletely excuses it with \"but bruh imma be skinny af tho\" (yes she said it like that) \"like dude can you imagine how awesome imma look at about 130 or less?\" So I responded with something like \"And how shitty you're gonna feel physically? :D\" \n\n\"lol actually probably feel the same, just skinny af.\" \n\nThis is where I sent her how I felt about it. I basically said that what's the point of being skinny if you're just going to feel horrible? Nobody knows how those things are going to make her feel a couple months down the road. She really is not taking her health into consideration, she's more worried about how good she's going to look. Losing weight should always be about your health and well being, not the fact that it may make you \"skinny af.\" I ended it with saying that I'm not trying to tell her what to do because it's a free country and she can do what she wants, but I don't want her getting hurt or depriving herself of anything she needs.\n\nOf course she excuses it again with \"I know, mom always watches me when I'm on them anyway to make sure I'm taking them right, so.\" I just stopped the conversation right there and didn't escalate it further. She's so damn hard-headed sometimes. I really am concerned for her and would love to help her but she just keeps making these excuses and brushing off the suggestions and risk factors. I 100% agree that being skinny can be beautiful and raise your confidence, but at what expense? Your health? I just don't know what to do anymore. \n\nAm I a genuinely concerned friend, or Am I The Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We live in NW Florida. \n\nSix months ago I met and fell madly in love with a new guy. We have a ton in common, including our love of theater. He is moving to LA to start a small theater company with a rather large inheritance he got from his dad's estate. He asked me to come along. It is literally everything I dreamed of doing in life and I have a chance to make it come true. It is my dream job to say the least. \n\nMy ex says he encourages me to go but begs me to leave kids with him.

My kids don't want to to either but I feel like this is my one shot to make my dreams come true and I have to take it. \n\nEven my parents and grandparents who usually stay out of my business are telling me I'm a \"jerk\" and uncaring mother (I guess that equates to being an asshole) for moving my kids away from thier family.

      "description": "I’m almost 28 and after some surgery I got addicted to prescription painkillers like oxy and Percocet. \n\nI eventually graduated to heroin and got clean when I was 26 but relapsed after only a couple months. At the time I was more or less homeless but me and this other guy “Jack” squatted together in this abandoned building for a little while. We looked out for each other and we always had Naloxone on us in case we needed it because the local needle exchange would give it out to known users in the city. \n\nI ended up overdosing after my relapse because I over estimated how much I could actually handle at that point and luckily Jack came back at the right moment and saved my life. \n\nAfter this, I have been fully clean for a little bit over a year now. I haven’t seen or heard from Jack for a really long time, I’ve moved into my own decent apartment, I have a decent job and I have always just assumed that he was dead by now. \n\nWell we live in a medium to smaller sized city so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised that I would run into people I knew eventually. \n\nI was out going to my bank, which is in a sketchier part of the city, and I hear somebody call out my name. I turn around and it’s Jack. \n\nI can immediately tell that he’s super strung out and he goes, “Wow look at you. Guess you finally managed to get better.” \n\nI’m feeling nervous as fuck because I don’t trust strung out junkies because I was that strung out junkie not too long ago. \n\nHe tells me that he has been trying to get sober for the past year but nothing has been working out. Then, as I expected, he asks me for help. He asks me if he can crash at my place or if I can help him out with some money to go to a rehab since he says that I now look like, “I can spare it.” \n\nI had nor do I have any desire to let an actively using heroin addict stay at my apartment. And I don’t want to give him money because I know for a fact that shit will not go to a rehab. \n\nI tell him that I don’t think I can do that for him but I wish him luck.\n\nHe says I’m a “fucking asshole” and that I’d be dead if it “wasn’t for him”. To be fair, he is right. I would’ve died without him. He then just spits at my feet and walks off. I left feeling pretty shook up. \n\nI thought at the time that I was making the right decision but I don’t know anymore. He did save my life and I could very well be in his position or dead instead of where I am right now. But I also don’t think I am ready to be around people like that at this point in my recovery. I’ve lost all of my family, who want nothing to do with me and my only friend left helped me get clean and I don’t want to drag him back into this world so I don’t have a lot of people to talk to about this besides my sponsor. \n\nAITA for refusing to help Jack? He saved my life but I don’t know what I can really do for him. \n \n\n",

      "description": "So a little context, \nMy fathers health has been declining since last year. Last June we moved everything over into a trust and got his will in order, and set up a full power of attorney for me. We put me as a co trustee so I can add things too it and manage it should the need arise. I took full control of his finances and accounts. In September he had a stroke and this exacerbated things with his health even more so. \nHe is currently bed bound un able to walk but still has his mind and wits about him, even though he’s a little slower. \n\nWe always had a family plan and he paid for my grandmas phone bill also, but I always paid him for my portion. Through the years he’s given me several small loans for things, and we had a book to keep track of it. I always paid it down and kept up to date with it. Closer to me taking over his finances and basically entire life, he wasn’t tracking things as much or not really worried about me paying him right away or anything. \n\nI switched the phone account into my name so I could make necessary changes but kept the bill to his account. Since taking over I haven’t paid it back in several months, but keep diligent track of all other transactions. \n\nI set him up on state disability, social security, take care of all his insurance issues, found him an assisted living place, and am currently getting his house ready to rent (insane amount of work) so he has more income coming in when disability runs out. I brought my roommates over to help clean out his house and took them out to dinner and paid with his card to say thanks.\n\nHere’s the AITA part. I’m doing all I can for my dad, and have his best interests in mind, but I also don’t want to take advantage of the situation. He’s absolutely fine on money and did a great job setting himself up for retirement, but I’m also not trying to feel entitled because it’s his money, not mine. I asked my mom about it and she said I shouldn’t worry cause I’ve already saved him a ton of money anyway and it’s a “cost of doing business” type of thing. But I’m not sure if it’s a bias with me being her kid. \n\nAdded info, mom and dad are separated but still good friends, also am an only child.\n\nTLDR: Haven’t paid back my dad for phone bill, but have complete POA and am helping him out with his entire life.\n\nEdit: talked with him about it. Go figure, the simplest conclusion didn’t cross my mind.\nHe said not to worry about it and to keep my conscience guilt free.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I just followed the terms of mom's will as it was written, 12 years ago?",
      "description": "I've shopped this problem around at r/legaladvice and r/personalfinance, and now know that I am only obligated to fulfill the terms of mom's will. Hearsay changes outside of the will, especially the ones you only hear about after mom's dead, don't count.  I guess what I'm looking for is some sort of absolution for what I'm about to do.  \n\n\nMom died and my brother and I are supposed to split her estate 50/50. He's a moocher. Not only has she provided 100% of his support for the past few years, she let him live for free on her property ever since his divorce 20 years ago. I've never asked her for a dime, and even arranged for her to meet a nice guy with a good job, which gave her health insurance (as a young widow), along with an annuity upon his death, which ended upon her death.  \n\n\nHere's the sticky part: Mom's health took a nosedive a couple of years ago. She had major heart surgery, survived, even thrived briefly, then went noncompliant on her meds, took up heavy smoking again, and just did whatever she felt like, whenever she liked. I know that even as recently as a year ago, she was having to remind him to do simple tasks (renew driver's license, pay electric bill), and confided to me that she just wished he would move, she wanted to move into an assisted living apartment.  \n\n\nCutting to the chase, during her last hospital stay last fall, she was diagnosed with dementia. Neither one of us know when it started. Yes, that's right: Once she went non-compliant on foods and meds, I distanced myself a little. When she took up heavy smoking again (he smokes, too) I was very distant, and usually just called. In an effort to motivate my brother to take better care of her, I offered him her land and home. It didn't work: His genius idea, and hers (she loved to smoke) was to just tell the Uptight One that everything was, \"Fine, just fine. No need to visit. We're doing very well.\" She wasn't. Her death caught me completely by surprise. The way my brother and niece now act, I don't think they were nearly as surprised.  \n\n\nSupposedly, a couple of months before her death, she told my niece to just sell the place, and move her dad (mom's son, my brother) in with her. While mom lay dying, my niece told me she DEFINITELY didn't want to do that. They've also gotten really crappy about a couple of CD's they say were purchased for them. Mom has three $5,000 CDs, the oldest of which names me as beneficiary: the two she bought last year have no beneficiary listed.  \n\n\nAfter all the yadda and accusations (\"I never saw you there!\" says my niece, who visited rarely, from 100 miles away), I'm just about ready to split the entire estate right down the middle, 50/50. WIBTA, even if I gave them the chance to buy me out, or partitioned some of the  acreage away from the home, or otherwise tried to make up for the fact that for the last few months of mom's life, I basically bailed? My brother and I were both pretty crummy kids, but he didn't have a job or income, all he was supposed to do was care for mom, and I feel like he didn't do that. (As she lay dying, \"Tried to feed her a chili cheese dog last night. She wouldn't even eat two bites!\")",

At about 2 AM I hear my boyfriend call out my name softly but I ignore him because I don't want to focus and stop drifting off. He calls out again a few more times and I pretend not to hear him. He goes to poke me but I don't move because I'm in too deep now. He sighs and leaves the room. \n\n\n  I hear the engine of the car turn on and he leaves in it. At this point I was wide awake and was wondering where he was going. At first I thought maybe he was... I don't know, taking in the scenery in the dead of the night? But then I recall how he made sure I wasn't awake before he took off and it didn't take long before I thought of him cheating on me.\n\n\n  I intended on staying awake and confronting him when he came home but I fell asleep some time later. Today I wake up and see him getting dressed. I look him in the eye and ask him where he was last night, he froze and left the room without saying anything else. I chased after him and he wouldn't give me a clear answer, said it's none of my business and to stop being so nosy and leave him alone. He said all of that in an angry tone yet he was crying too. I don't know what to think. Was I out of line? \n ",

We've always talked about how much we're looking forward to spending the future together and I genuinely meant it when we had the conversation.. However I'm starting to feel like that's out of reach.\n\nI feel like we are unable to have any conversation with the slightest bit of common knowledge or intelligence applied.. and before you all jump on me for being up myself hear me out! I told her I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody yesterday and she proceeded to ask me what that was, after I explained all she had to say was 'who is Queen?'. Just to give a few more examples, she's never heard of: Morgan Freeman, Marilyn Monroe, Barack Obama (from the UK), Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. I know it sounds like a petty thing to be mad at but she genuinely has no reference to any pop culture or the desire to have a conversation that isn't about the current affairs of other people in her life. Whenever I try and talk about anything that isn't 'gossip' she shrugs it off. \n\nWe were out for drinks the other night and I'm a pretty sociable person and like to chat about things that interest me from planes (she's cabin crew) to animals or machines, I was talking about everything possible that had an interesting thing and the best I got all night was a 'Hmm' before she reverting to complaining about how somebody in her life was doing something wrong inevitably. \n\nI'm not saying she's a bad person because the idea of losing her kills me, I just feel like we're incapable of having a conversation about anything that has any meaning. \n\nI know I'm going to get replies about how she may not be interested in the same things I am but we really do have a close bond and I feel like there really isn't anything she has as a hobby other than judging other people life affairs.. and I'm not down for that. \n\nAs far as she knows everything is perfect in the relationship as I have been trying my absolute hardest to make things work, but would I be the asshole to break up with her out of the blue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I figured that on my 18th birthday my parents wouldn’t deny my request to go and do something with him, so it made it even more special to me. \n\nHowever, he recently got invited on a trip with his old boy scout troop and it happens to fall over the day of my birthday. When he first told me I was visibly upset, because I really was looking forward to spending that day with him. We got into a rather big argument over it and he claimed I was being inconsiderate. He also mentioned that it was his last trip with all his childhood friends and old troop leader and that we could do something for my birthday as soon as he got back. I eventually just let it go and told him I was fine with him going, even though it still really makes me sad. I tried to not be selfish and understand that we can just celebrate my birthday when he gets back. \n\nBut AITA for being upset/mad in the first place?

( knowing it’s her birthday we can discuss it some other time) \n\nHer - again if u don’t like it I don’t care u know where the door is. \n\nSo naturally I use the door and on my way out I say “ I don’t even have control over my own life, I feel like a puppet” but now she’s crying saying I’ve ruined her birthday and how I always seem to do this.

      "description": "Obviously a bit deeper than the title alludes. Basically on New Years a friend made matching sweaters for a lot of people in his friend group. I’m new to it but he made me one when he didn’t make one for some other people who have been there longer than me. He told me not to wear it because it might hurt their feelings so I didn’t. It got really cold later into the night and I finally caved and put it on around 2AM when there only about seven us left hanging around. Evidently, one of them was someone who was not supposed to see me in the sweater. \nHe just texted me now (almost two months later) saying that it was very uncool of me to wear it when he told me not to. I guess the person either confronted them about it or something else so I guess it was a bigger deal than I thought. \nI don’t really have an excuse other than that I was cold because he did tell me not to wear it. Although I don’t see it being as THAT big of a deal. But I feel pretty bad. So am I the asshole for not listening and potentially made someone else feel left out? Or is this whole situation not a big deal and I’m really overthinking it? Both?",

      "description": "I know immediately that people are going to assume I'm racist. I don't believe I am though. I have nothing against any races at all. However, I don't find darker skinned chicks attractive. It's not about race or ethnicity. I find many lighter skinned black women attractive. And I also don't find very dark skinned Indian (just as an example) women attractive. It's not a choice, or anything I can help, it's just the way it is.\n\nNow to the actual story. I use Tinder frequently and I have in my bio \"No very dark skinned chicks\". Whatever, it's rarely been an issue. But I matched with this chick, let's call her \"Sandy\" and she was drop-dead gorgeous (and from the best I could tell, she appeared to be light-skinned African American). Anyways, we started messaging a bit and things were going fine, when she asked me if I had something against black chicks. I told her no, I'm just more attracted to lighter skinned chicks. She flipped out on me, calling me a racist and a few other names. I admit, I lost my temper and called her some names too (no, not the kind you're thinking). After a short back and forth we haven't been in contact again.\n\nI'm not sure how to feel about it all tbh, at first I felt okay with it but now I feel like maybe she was justified. Was I the asshole in the situation? Is it wrong to not be attracted to a certain complexion?",

      "description": "Okay, so this literally just happened and I am simultaneously livid and scared. A little bit of backstory, I work part-time as a Grubhub driver, and I mostly work late at night. My market is pretty new, so I don't usually get many orders. While I'm waiting for orders to come in, I usually fire up the POGO app and drive around to some of my town's PokeStops and gyms to battle, get stops and catch new Pokemon (don't worry, I'm not playing while driving). My wife is usually with me during my late night shifts because buddy system and all that jazz, and sometimes my sister and her husband will join us on the really slow nights.\n\nTonight was one of those slow nights where the four of us were out during my shift. Right near the end of the shift, we drove around to a few stops and got some gyms. We pull up to one of the gyms and park. It's owned by a Valor player (the four of us are Mystic). Cool, he left like a tiny little CP 160 or something Skorupi to guard the gym. We take it over, pull closer to some of the surrounding PokeStops, everything is peachy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter nearly two minutes, my Pokemon has returned to me. The four of us are joking around and my sister says jokingly \"let's defend our honor!\" So we pull back around to the gym and see that the same player had retaken the gym and left yet another low CP Pokemon there. We start battling because why not and this dude is standing outside the store where the gym is located, notices that we're the ones taking over the gym, and says \"you know it's rude to take over a gym just after someone got it.\" We thought he was joking around with us so we all four just laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt should be noted that none of us, save for a few select friends each, know any other Go players in our town. We were all initially happy to have seen the guy because we were just surprised to finally have met another player. But it turned out this guy was not being friendly. He was *pissed* at us. He started ranting to who I think was his SO that works at the store about how none of us knew basic respect. We didn't engage cause we were just shocked. So, we left our Pokemon at the gym and pulled away. We went to another couple of gyms still a little upset that this guy was that butthurt, but after about 15 mins or so, we'd kind of gotten back to our normal routine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a half hour, we decide to do some final stops on our way home, which allows us to pass by some of the gyms we'd already taken earlier. One of these gyms had been retaken by the dude from before. Now, this gym was fairly close to the one where we'd been at earlier, so we just figured maybe he'd been walking home and had taken it on his way. Then, I noticed one of the Pokemon I'd put at another gym had returned. This gym was a couple miles away from the gym we'd been at, but it was just close enough that we could see a small outline of the gym texture. We checked, and once again, it was the same guy. Just after that revelation, another set of our Pokemon came back from a gym we'd recently been to that was even farther away than the last. So we pull around to the gym where the dude had been, in an area where you couldn't actually see the store to make sure the dude couldn't see us and we started to retake the gym he'd gotten pissed at us over, so that we could see if he was still there or if he was tracking our movements and following us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we're fighting, a car pulls up behind us and parks, headlights still on, and just sits there. Then we notice that the Blissey he'd left there began being healed. After our battle was over, he sped around us and yelled at us (not sure what he said), and then pulled back into the store's parking lot, got out of his car, and stayed in the same place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it turned out the dude had followed us around the town. We still don't know if he'd actually followed us or if he just went around town looking for gyms taken by us, but I still think it's creepy and totally uncalled for. None of us meant any malice to anyone while we were playing, we were just having fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My wife, my sister, my brother-in-law, and I all went around my town playing Pokemon go, took a gym from a dude, he got pissed and followed us/tracked our movements for the next half hour, taking gyms from us in retaliation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I need to know, am I the asshole in this scenario?",

      "description": "My dad has always been hard on me but he’s always seen to it that I’m taken care of. He’s allowed my girlfriend and I to live in a home that he owns, rent free. I’m working on getting my own place soon but since I just graduated from college it’s kind of hard to afford my own place. My girlfriend adopted a shelter dog recently. Her previous owner neglected her and she spent most of her life in a cage. Since she was neglected she was never house trained and she can be destructive around the house. When my girlfriend and I leave for work she’ll claw at the door and leave scratch marks and leave bite marks on some of the furniture.  My girlfriend wasn’t aware the dog had these problems but she did know she needed to house train it. When my dad learned about this he was pissed and he told my girlfriend to get her dog under control and that until it’s trained she either has to cage it or leave it outside in the cold because he doesn’t want it messing up his house. Since she spent most of her life in a cage my girlfriend doesn’t want to cage her dog but he told me to make sure this rule is enforced. \n\nYesterday my dad told me he was coming over to talk to me about some things and to check on the house. My girlfriend has been slacking on training her dog so she still not house broken and destructive and I haven’t been enforcing my dad’s rule. I tell my girlfriend that she’s going to need to cage the dog until my dad leaves but she refuses. My dad comes over and sees the dog not caged and he asks me if it’s trained and she tells him it is. Things are going well until my dad sees the dog chewing some furniture. He yells at the dog and this causes her to pee herself revealing that the dog is still destructive and not house broken. My dad begins going on a tirade calling my girlfriend a lying bitch and telling her that he’s going to throw her and her damn mutt out. Throughout him yelling at her I stay quiet and don’t intervene. He tells me he’s disappointed in me because I betrayed his trust. I tell him I’m sorry and that from now on the dog will be caged. After he leaves my girlfriend is in tears because I didn’t say anything while he was yelling at her but mostly because I sided with my dad and will now be enforcing his rule. I think caging a dog who spent most of its life in a cage is cruel but it’s my dad’s house and he can make the rules.",

If we leave everything aside, she has a thin unibrow that most people don't like about her appearance and ridicule her.\n\nOne day, in a lesson she was absent at, i heard a boy from our class say something along the lines of \"Miri should shave that unibrow, it's ugly as hell.\" I of course got mad but i didn't want to get in a fight so i didn't say anything. I was boiling the whole lesson. \n\nAfter Miri came back, i told her: \"i don't care if it's gonna hurt you, i need to tell you this.\" And i proceeded to tell her about that boy's comment. She looked hurt but i knew that she was hiding it and she just laughed it off. That laugh was artificial. She didn't talk that much to me that day and told me that we should go separate ways to our houses, instead of going together. \n\nAfter school, she texted me that she shaved the part in between her eyebrows, but she didn't sound so happy about it.

Alright.\n\nThen they bought him a tablet, because he didn't want to watch his anime on his Macbook so he could watch it on his tablet instead. Okay. College is stressful and he needs time off. \n\nYesterday, they got him an iPad, because he said that the iPad had a thing where he could touch the screen with his fist and it didn't spaz out like the tablet does. That's the only reason. \n\nI have a seven-year-old Dell that can hardly load a webpage or open, and has a difficult time connecting to the wifi when I need to do my homework.

She isn't hard for cash and is extremely picky about how things are done to the point that she will kick workers out of the house or call their company and complain if they are even 10-15 minutes late. This had made getting people to complete the repairs from the poor inspection increasingly difficult to complete due to her high standard.\nNow with that background out of the way comes my conflict of moral. She calls me crying tonight asking for help and demands I come home asap to fix the house and reduce the clutter. She demanded that I take 1-3 weeks off to help as a weekend wouldn't be enough time. When I asked her to explain what needed to be done so I could ask for time off she told me not to worry about it till I get there and to take a leave of absence if I don't have the vacation time. This means it could range from filing papers for her business to recarpetting the basement of her house.\n She didn't like that I needed info to plan and told me that I was a disrespectful child who never supported her and that since my dad died I have been \"too busy\" to come home, which in all fairness finishing my degree and starting my career did take a bit of a priority.\n I have been out to see her a couple times but it ended in fights between us due to her wanting me to put in 3 10-14 hour work days and not see any of my old friends I grew up with.  To her, my visits are purely for me to make up for not doing chores for her since I moved out and she expects me to solve all her problems without telling me them first. I still plan to get out there, but I am not trying  waste vacation time on it since it will most likely turn into a weekend of her emotionally abusing me followed by months of phone calls saying that I am a failure as a man and a son cause I couldn't sacrifice my career for her happiness. \n\nTLDR; mom lives across country alone, calls asking for help with ridiculous terms, I say I'll help but need to know what's in store for me, she gets mad and I decide to put little to no effort into going home.\n",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom.\n\nSo I'm a freelance graphic designer who trys to do my best juggling design work, full time job, marriage and two dogs. I'm a procrastinator but I'm passionate about my art.\n\nMy best friend of over 15 years has only worked for 3months in her entire life, comes from money and has a husband who takes care of everything. She's an awesome gal, just a bit... Spoiled? \n\nYears ago I did the invitations for her wedding and never got a dime for it. I lived on my own and was struggling financially with bills, college and general living expenses. I considered the design work for those my wedding present to them since I couldn't afford much else. Then the printing cost came up. I ended up spending over $160 in printing and specialty envelopes that she wanted. I ate a lot of ramen for the next few months.\n\nAbout a year after the wedding she wanted to try to get together a business plan and approached me about branding. I was upfront about the cost thing this time, she agreed and I did my thing. After creating a Mascot, Logo, Icon, Color scheme and business card concept... She decided she didn't want to do that business anymore so she didn't see a point in payment. \n\nNow on the newest gig. Again, she has a business idea. This time shes already started it so I know it's happening. I've revised the logo for her around 6 times now and have kinda lost my drive for it. I told her revisions cost extra after the first 2 times (if its the customer changing their mind constantly, i fix my mistakes for free) and she kinda got huffy about it. \n\nShe asked if I charge my family for things and saying 'it's just small touchups so why charge extra?' I mean, I know she's my friend and practically like family to me at this point, but am I an asshole for treating her like a regular client? Should I give her some slack as my friend and just except it as just another piece to pad a portfolio??\n\nTL;DR Have a friend who wants design work, things I shouldn't charge her full price for it since we're good friends.\n\n",

      "title": "WIBTA if I shunned one of the dogs that I lived with in order to keep another dog happy?",
      "description": "I wasn’t quite sure how to phrase the title but I’ll give a little background information. \n\nBack in November 2011 my family (me, mom, grandma, aunt, and cousin 1) got a 5 month old Silky Terrier names Barley from my other cousin 2. My cousin 2’s boyfriend had gotten her the dog but her mom didn’t want a dog at their place so they asked us if we could keep it and we said yes.\n\nI had never had a dog before so I instantly fell in love with this little. This dog would pee on top of the staircase when anyone got home because he got so excited. He’d run around and make you chase him with his toys. He’d play hide and seek with me and then would lick me when I was on the ground. He was a good boi and I have a lot of good memories with him. He’s a gentleman now.\n\nThen in Dec 2014 we moved to a different house. My cousin 1 that lived with me moved out because she got married, but then a year later moved back in. Then out of the blue, without asking anyone she just brings home a dog, a Terrier-Poodle mix named Sammy, around 4 months old at the time. We couldn’t say no, nor would we because she’s our family.\n\nFrom what I was told, Sammy had been “returned” by her previous owner so when my cousin got her this dog was all about getting attention because she had been traumatized since she was abandoned. So much  that whenever my cousin 1 would try to leave for work, Sammy stands in her way so she won’t go.\n\nAnyhow, Barley had never really interacted with another dog and so when Sammy came about, she absolutely just bullied him. She was a puppy so she nip at him and just bark and harass him. We tried to get her to stop when we saw her, but obviously we’re not always with the dogs. Every toy Barley had or got from now on was *hers.* If he got a toy, the moment he’d drop it she would take it and wouldn’t let him have it. Any time that Barley got attention, she’d shove herself between Barley and who was petting him and make you pet her. She would just tire him out and he couldn’t do anything. Whenever I saw it I would tell her to stop and force her away so he could have space since she always got in his face. We figured that by 2017 he was just starting to get old so his energy levels were evening out and he just didn’t want to play anymore. I will accept full judgement for this lapse in judgement.\n\nI’m sure you’re probably thinking “Oh jackthejot is just a bad owner” but the thing was that Barley was OUR dog and Sammy was my cousin’s dog. I was the one who had trained Barley, my cousin basically trained Sammy for a few weeks and just let it be. It’s basically now that Sammy pees everywhere, poops everywhere, eats Barley’s food, etc.  We’ve spoken with my cousin 1 but it feels like she doesn’t care about her anymore. Sammy will go months without a haircut, she’s pretty fat now, and unfortunately has just become another inconvenience that we live with. I personally feel like I can’t say anything because I don’t pay rent (because I was going to college and I paid out of pocket then got cancer after I graduated so those bills were my concern) and my cousin 1 does, which she has brought up before.\n\nAnyhow, back to the present.\n\nYesterday I noticed that Barley was alone in the living room. I sat on the ground and I called him over, and he came wagging his tail looking pretty happy. I started to let him and scratch him and he just looked pretty happy so I grabbed a toy and we played “Keep Away”, the first time in years. He was growling at me, tail and butt in the air, ready to jump and run around if I got close to him. After we played I laid on the ground and he came to lick my face and my hair, just like the good times. I even called my wife over so she could see this since it didn’t really happen anymore. We played a little more where he chased me and it was like I was a teenager and he was a puppy again. Then, we accidentally squeaked the toy and suddenly Sammy came running out of the basement to grab the toy. Toy in mouth, she barked at Barley and he just sat there. I used my arm to force her away so he could have space, and tried to pet him but again she got in between. Barley walked away, jumped on the couch to his spot and just laid down, looking as sad as ever.\n\nThen it really hit me, I had my suspicions, that Barley can’t enjoy himself with Sammy there. She is a total attention hog and just bullies him and my family just plays it off as “dogs will be dogs” and I resent her for it.\n\nBut I feel terrible that I do. She’s just a dog, but I just want to love and play with Barley. Today I sat next to him and just started to scratch him and he was loving it. Sammy then came over and looked at me. I ignored her. Then she laid on my leg, inched closer, rubbed her head against my arm, I continued ignoring, then she jumped on my arm and I felt so bad I had to pet her too. I mean, she’s just a dog after all.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I purposely shunned Sammy to make sure that Barley got the attention that he deserves and obviously still wants?",

      "description": "Context: me and my friend are in highschool. Our school does trips to places (usually Europe) for like 2 weeks over March break. It costs around 5,000$ plus some spending money. We both signed up for this trip a couple months ago, and she just told me she wasn’t going. \n\nWhen she told me she wasn’t going to be going on the trip, I was surprised and honestly angry, and I think my anger was sort of amplified because this came out of the blue. \n\nSo I asked her why she wasn’t going and she told me that she was worried she wouldn’t be able to find a job in time (the trip is next March) and that “she didn’t want to get to comfortable in a place where she wouldn’t be staying for too long”. Her words, not mine. \n\nI, admittedly, didn’t take the time to think that maybe she wasn’t being entirely honest, and I told her that those reasons were horseshit. \n\nShe then said, and I quote, “well sorry but my parents aren’t just forking over 5000$ for me” \n\nI’m paying for a lot of this trip myself. My parents aren’t just giving me the money. I think she has it in her head that I’m rich, which I’m not, at all. And whenever we get in an argument she passive aggressively mentions that I “get everything I want” which I don’t. I’m definitely not poor, and I am in a position of privilege, but not rich by any means. \n\nWhen she said this, I took a minute and realized that her parents might not be able to help her pay for the trip at all, and she just didn’t tell me. \n\nSo I apologized to her for “freaking out” and told her it was fine if she didn’t want to go on the trip \n\nBUT \n\nI’m still kind of mad.

      "title": "AITA for waking up my flatmate in the morning",
      "description": "In January I moved to a new apartment with a girl who I knew and we were kind of friends but through weird family connections and university. I worked full time until recently so I would usually wake up until 7.30/8am.\n\nI woke up around that pretty consistently and my flatmate would complain about filling the kettle in too loudly so I changed that and she already complained to me that her previous flatmate was too loud in closing the door in the morning so I shut the door as quiet as possible. This past weekend I got up a bit earlier because of a competition and she's been slamming doors because I woke up too early and woke her up too (like bottling the kettle, using the microwave and using the bathroom).\n\nYesterday she gave me a talk and was like we need to change things and hinted that I shouldn't boil the kettle and I shouldn't use the microwave because they're both too loud and I'm shutting the door too loudly. I explained to her that I need some food in my stomach before leaving and usually I just drink a cup of warm milk and boil some water to take to work. But she wasn't happy with that explanation and just said is there no way we can fix this and tbh I had no idea at this point what I can fix since a lot of sounds are beyond my abilities to control. I told he I'm sorry I wake up early but that I preferred waking up earlier and suggested ear plugs would help and I'll definitely be more considerate. I also explained that I get woken up by her when she leaves earlier than me and she just said 'well I knew you were awake so I was loud'. She continued hinting that this is her last year of bachelors and she wants everything to go smoothly. She explained that I'm negatively impacting on her life when she gets woken up she's angry and she doesn't feel happy even if its 10-30 minutes earlier and then she'll oversleep because of me being so loud and it impacts her whole day and she can't study well.\n\nShe then said would you take the apartment and I'll move you and I politely declined because the apartment is pretty filthy to the point of irreversible damage (sun damaged carpet, kitchen walls with oil stains and things stuck, parts of kitchen ventilator broken etc.).I told her that I'll move out by June and she looked very unhappy so I'm already looking at the apartments available and I'm set to move probably by next weekend.\n\nThis is my first time flatting and I didn't mind having to do the chores because she never cleaned or vacuumed or anything in general. She'll leave unwashed dishes in the sink/dishwasher for days or weeks even if she's home all day. She'll cut her fringe in the bathroom and leave pieces of hair all lying around and I just don't bother telling her and just clean it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Would I be the asshole for waking up my flatmate too early and then wanting to move out because she complained to me and gave me a talk hinting that I'll be the reason that she's gonna fail university?",

      "title": "AITA - For getting upset at my coworker about his cat story?",
      "description": "Some background info - I am young in my field by 20+ years. My colleague's are all old enough to be my dad's and as such, I put up with a lot of teasing and razzing from them in that spirit. \n\nRecently, I adopted two cats. I have never had pets before and I have been so excited to have them in my life. This was my first time working since we adopted them so I was excited to share the news about them. \n\nThis lead my coworker (Bob) to say how much he hates cats and essentially saying that I am silly for caring that much about them. He's aware that I'm not really up  for having kids, so this is as close as I'll get. He has dogs, children and grandchildren, and talks about them a lot. I had mentioned them maybe 3 times in 18 hours. \n\nLast night we were walking back to our hotel, and my boyfriend sent me a video of one of the cats coming out and exploring and I got so excited and said \"Awe he's coming out exploring! That's so good!\" \n\nBob then tells me how his SiL had a cat and it scratched and bit his Grandson so they let it out in the woods for Coyotes to get it. \n\nI was appalled. The rest of the conversation goes as this: \n\nMe: What the hell? You killed a cat because it scratched your grandson?\n\nBob: Well I didn't do it, my wife did! I wanted to shoot the damn thing. [Laughs]\n\nMe: You could have rehomed it! Some cats don't do well with kids because they are grabby. A childless person could have given it a new home.\n\nBob: Well it scratched my grandson, so it had to go\n\nMe: Fine, I get that, but sending it out to die because it doesn't know better?\n\nBob: It's just a cat\n\nMe: It's a living domesticated animal! Should we send you out to die when you do something stupid? No!\n\nBob:[Laughs] \n\nMe: And that's why people don't deserve fucking animals to assume that a cat would just do well with children and let it out to die because you're a fucking idiot. \n\nAnd I stormed off. Haven't seen or spoken to him since.\n\nI got upset. Him and I have worked closely for two years. He knows I'm an animal lover. He knows how excited I am for these cats as we've been looking to adopt for a few months now, but that I am also very nervous that we won't do a good job. And to follow up my good mood about my cat with a story like that upset me to no end. I had shared my adoption news with a few coworkers who have cats to ask questions and had been dealing all day with people telling me how much cats suck and they hate them. This pushed me off the edge.\n\nI called my boyfriend after and he tried to reason with me that Bob's Grandson is important to him and would do anything for him. Bob probably doesn't understand someone's love for an animal he doesn't care for and that maybe I was a bit harsh because I don't have kids.\n\nBecause of that convo I'm starting to feel bad, and that I'm an asshole for getting mad at him.\n\nSo, am I?",

      "description": "Long story short: my father is an alcoholic. I don't know when that exactly began, but my first memory is of him when I was like 8/9 and had to help him in returning back home (mom was on some sort of work trip). He used to drink a lot, especially when he lost his work, it was like all drink-sleep-drink. Now that he has a new work, it sort of improved but he is still drinking in the evenings and during weekends. He loses his shit often during the family meetings (I live in the region where alcohol is customary for such meeting).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just think my mom could do so much better. She's intelligent and she still has much to live for. I realize that leaving father would be difficult because she lived with him for so long, and it's sort of constant in her life. I recognize that it's not always that bad but I wish she could know she doesn't have to put with the constant suspiciousness from father (i.e. he thinks that she must have multiple lovers) or generally that she could lead a more peaceful life, without having to put up with his insults, drinking, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, I like appreciate that it could be worse and he doesn't beat and stuff, but it's still uncomfortable. I just like sometimes push on mom to consider the divorce and then I feel guilty for that. I would love to know if I am an asshole on that or not.",

      "description": "My sister is going to be 24 this year and I just turned 19. For the past couple of years no matter how difficult the task, my sister would always ask me to set up things for her when it came to technology or manual labor. From setting up her iPhone with her new sim card to fixing her IKEA desk. I usually help her out when it comes to actually difficult tasks cause she's my sister but most of the time its for something extremely basic that everyone should be able to do. Examples being resetting the WiFi, plugging/setting up her printer, along with having to install whatever new thing she had just bought. But today I actually broke. My sister's usual response to  me when I say \"why don't you do it?\" is \"I don't know how to do it\". It seriously pissed me off because that meant to me that she hasn't really tried and most likely wont. I fully understand her response when it comes to something difficult like a bed from IKEA but today she told me to set up the wii for her to which i replied \"no\". This then led to her yelling at me and telling me to do it, in which i replied the same way again. AITA?",

The other day one of them yelled at me for putting his stuff away. He claims that he has \"trouble finding them\" after I put them away in our cabinets and that \"putting them away [himself] would take too long\". It's not that we don't have enough cabinet and drawer space he just refuses to clean up after him self. I'm completely fine cleaning up after them and even suggested re-organizing our cabinets so he could find them easier. However he said he talked with our other 2 roommates and I'm apparently \"outvoted\" as they refuse to let me clean up after them as well. I posted a link to what I feel like is an average representation of what our kitchen looks like with me not cleaning. Would I be in the wrong with going ahead and cleaning up anyway.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Qr05TGk\n",

      "description": "Disclaimer: i’m not sure if this kid has autism per say but it’s clear that he has some kind of social disorder. I’m not very knowledgeable on disorders or anything like that so forgive me if I mislabel something. \n\nI’m taking a physics course on college and it requires me to pay attention as I am trying to apply for medical school later and need good grades. \n\nThere is a kid in my class who I believe to be slightly autistic or something in terms of social behavior. He’s a super bright kid though and i’m not mocking his intelligence in anyway. \n\nHowever, though he may be intelligent, he constantly disrupts class by interrupting the professor either by proclaiming out loud how he did the work while the professor is speaking, telling us his every action (i.e. going to the bathroom), solving the problem before the professor is even finished explaining it to the rest of us, constantly bragging about how he is in advanced level math classes and physics is easy for him, or telling us pointless information that isn’t pertaining to the lecture. \n\nI want to perform well in this course and I enjoy physics but this kind of disruptive behavior really drags my attention away from information I need to know/learn. He’s not a bad kid but he’s just extremely distracting to the rest of the class. With my schedule, I have no opportunities to switch class times. AITA for wanting him to not be in my class? \n\nTL;DR: A kid with some kind of social disorder in my physics class is very distracting to the rest of the students and it’s prohibiting me from learning to the best of my ability.  I don’t want him in the same class as me because I need to perform well for med school.",

      "description": "So my (17F) brother (19M) is pretty unhygienic. if I don't tell him to wash his hands, he won't do it. Sometimes he'll stroll into the toilet and leave the door wide open while he shits, when our mom and I are in the next room over and I'll have to yell at him to close the door. Sometimes he even doesn't flush the toilet and our mom and I have to be the unsuspecting victims.\n\nHe NEVER washes his hands after using the toilet and when I hear him come out of the toilet straight after flushing I have to ask him to wash his hands, and often he'll throw a strop and barely run his hands under water for 2 seconds. The other day I told him to wash his hands and he called me a whiney bitch and said he was going to shower in a few minutes anyway so it didn't matter. I've tried numerous times to tell him to make it a habit to wash his hands, I even hung a sign saying \"Please flush &amp; wash your hands\" on the door.\n\nAnyway my older sister who's moved out gave me a custom-made mug as a gift, one of those that has an image appear when it's filled with a hot drink. I was showing my brother like \"yo this is so cool\" and he said \"let me see\" and grabbed it out of my hand to look at it. I immediately got disgusted, took it back and said \"don't touch it\" and my mum was like \"whoa you're brother and sister, why can't he see?\" and I said \"I don't mind [brother] looking but God knows where those hands have been, I'd rather he not touch anything of mine.\" He got offended and said he hadn't even used the toilet today and his hands were clean. First of all I didn't mention the toilet once. Secondly, you see earlier that day I had gone to the toilet and saw piss in it with the toilet seat up and he's the only guy in the house so I kinda assumed he was lying and said \"So not only are you disgusting but you're a liar too.\" He stormed off and has been pissed with me since then.\n\nI didn't think I was out of line at the time but I do feel guilty now and my mom said I was absolutely the one at fault here and because we're family it shouldn't matter whether he touches my stuff, and I overreacted and treated him like an outsider. My sister said I was at fault for \"insulting his pride\" instead of trying to help him improve himself. Sorry if this is trivial. AITA?",

He promised me yesterday when they broke up that he wouldn’t get back with her because of it. I called him last night and he is still with her. I went through him about how disgustingly he is treating her. He said I was a bad friend because he wouldn’t judge me for that sort of thing. I have no loyalties to her so I don’t want to tell her but I’ve been cheated on too many times for me to agree with it. I just can’t get out of my head how heartbroken she will be when she finds out. He’s playing on her insecurities to make her stay with him. I may have went at him a bit too hard but I’m just so disgusted in his actions. He literally slept with this women he’s been seeing (she also has a boyfriend) and then slept with his girlfriend less than 6 hours later. I dunno what to do. He is my closest friend but I just cannot be friends with him if that’s how he treats women.",

We had a lot of mutual online friends (of which I lost contact with most of them) and we had been friends with up until the 22nd of January last year.\n\nAt first things were going well but things seemed to be quite off. She'd make me worry constantly by making it sound like she was going to commit suicide, she'd interrogate me if I didn't message her first (we are in different countries and it seemed like she didn't notice the time differences), she'd constantly cry that no-one cared about her and she'd test me and one other mutual friend who I spoke with often and I still do. Despite all of this I stayed friends with her, even though at some points I genuinely felt threatened as she would always want to voice chat or see a picture of me to 'know I was real' and stuff.\n\nI was talking with my mutual friend about this worrying behaviour and they told me about how 'H' told them that they would grope them so I got mad.\n\nNext conversation with H, she was complaining that everyone around her seemed to be in a bad mood today and she was blaming herself, as always. I exploded in anger, I told her that she brang me down constantly and that she has no room to complain and then I told her off for her saying she would grope our mutual friend, I made them cry.\n\nOur argument happened on the 5th of January, she messaged me everyday apologising up until the 10th. I didn't respond. She tried once more on  the 22nd and she left the chat on the 20th March.\n\nShe now has no profile picture and her name is now just a full stop.\n\nTL;DR A long term online friend made me feel uncomfortable so I yelled at them then ignored them, they are no longer on the social media platform.\n\n",

(Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile)\n \nEarlier today my friend desperately needed to get out of the house because of family issues, and I offered to take her to go see a movie. We decided to watch a movie at 12:20 PM, and as it was only a couple of hours away, I had to do my chores first, or my Mom wouldn't let me go out anywhere. I hurried and did them, and did a few extra chores while I was at it to incentivize my mom to let me go. After I finished, I asked my Mom if I could go, and she said no. I didn't talk back or argue, and I accepted the answer. I texted my friend and told her that I couldn't go. As the day goes on, my mom starts to notice that I cleaned the house. She then asks me \"Did you just clean the house just so you could go watch that movie with your friend?\" And me, not trying to lie, replied with a \"Yes.\" I would've cleaned the house either way, but not as thoroughly and not as early in day. And now, throughout the day, my Mom is acting incredibly passive aggressive, and is being honestly kinda rude in general. She keeps saying things like \"Oh, let's see the next time O do something for you,\" and \"Let's see my what my answer is gonna be next time when you ask me to do something.\" I didn't want to lie to her, and I genuinely don't know if I did something wrong. \n\nAITA?\n",

You can see into your neighbor's yard when you're looking out the second floor deck. The entire community has green grass and then looking into their backyard, all you see is completely yellow dead grass with loads of dog poop on top. It's a minefield. Now that it's getting warmer, if you're outside playing, you can smell the poop. \n\nWe've lived here for over ten years and have always been friendly. We're not close friends, just smiles and waves if we see each other outside but not a friendship. My husband even mows their front grass in the summer because our front yards are connected and they are very thankful, as the owner is older (but has grown sons in and out of the house). \n\nAnyway, I'm afraid potential buyers will see the minefield and be turned off from making an offer. WIBTA if I asked them to clean up? I'll even offer to do it myself but I feel like I'd be insulting them and they'll be defensive and angry.

      "description": "Hey reddit, so this took place today after my last class (im in college) of the day, I was about to be heading home after a long day of difficult classes.\n\n\nI pop my headphones in and head down the main staircase to get to the exit. After the first flight down I hear what sounds like a group of girls talking, which in itself is not unusual at all.\n\n\nI round the corner and 'lo-and-behold' there are 3 girls, standing in the complete middle of the stairway. I was in no type of mood (nor did I have a Pokeflute) for this bullshit so instead of asking them to move, I say fuck it and instead make the mistake of trying to squeeze in between the little amount of space between the rightmost one and the railing\n\n\n\"Umm, excuse me!?\" the Girl closest to where I was trying to pass thorough says to me before allowing me to get to close.\n\n\n\"Yeah?\" I replied, taking out one of my headphones \"What?\".\n\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" Same girl says, this time I notice her friends are giggling.\n\n\n\"I mean.. trying to go down the stairs? What does it look like?\"  I admit, saying 'what does it look like' may have been a bit unwarranted...\n\n\n\"Look, can you move? It doesn't make much sense to talk in the middle of stairs why not go to the cafeteria or something?\" I say before giving her a chance to respond \n\n\nSnorlax is now silent and her friends aren't laughing anymore, instead all three turn to each other with a 'get a load of this guy' look on their faces until 1st girl says. \n\n\n\"Whats your issue? Go down a different set of stairs\" says the girl.\n\n\nI was shocked, flabbergasted. How the fuck don't they see how selfish and inconvient standing in the MIDDLE of a fucking staircase is? Now im usually a pretty stubborn person, so maybe a different day I would've waited until they let me through, but at this point in the week, I was just tired and wanted to go home.\n\n\n\"Stupid bitch...\" I mumble under my breath semi-defeated, turning around to exit on the floor nearest to us\n\n\n\"What??\" The girl says to her friends  \"Did you just call me a bitch?\"\n\n\nI begrudgingly respond \"Yeah, you're kind of being unreasonable, and rude so...\"\n\n\n\"Haha says the \"guy\" (she actually did air quotes with her fingers) that was to nervous to ask a group of girls to move.\" *her and friends proceed to explode with laughter*\n\n\nNow im furious. She somehow had spun this on me, Not gonna lie I shouldve held back from saying what I am about to say, but try to put yourself in my shoes, I was too fed up and her insult got me 10x more angry.\n\n\n\"Whatever you say, fat bitch. You know theres a gym a few blocks down right? Maybe I would've been able to get down the stairs if you weren't so fucking fat.\" \n\n\nThe 3 girls are all now standing mouth agape, with the one I had just insulted getting very visibly angry/upset or something yo. I turned around and started to leave for good this time. She or one of her friends yelled \"Fucking douchebag!!\" as I exited the staircase but idgaf that feel good. ",

      "description": "I’ve made some mistakes in life. Primarily, I was an active and self-destructive alcoholic for about 10 years and I’ve gotten things a bit more on track now. 2 years sober :) These details are important. \n\nSo the sister in law... basically it went down like this: I met a woman on a dating app, we’ll call her Erin. That’s actually her name and no one I know will read this. We hit it off and in the process discover that she used to work with my brother and his wife and the three are good friends. Erin and I hang out a few times, get along really well and eventually start dating. My SIL decides she’s not having this for whatever reason. And so begins the campaign. She tells Erin all sorts of sordid details from my past (failed relationships, addiction, jail time, etc). Mind you I’m very upfront about the things I’ve done. It’s not who I am, but I refuse to hide who I was. \n\nMany of these details would’ve only been gained second hand (via my brother) because I don’t share much with those who I’m close with, let alone someone I rarely see. This goes on and on pretty much anytime my SIL hangs out with this Erin. She even goes so far as to tell Erin’s mother things about me in a hope it will stop us from dating. \n\nNow, she never said anything to me save for telling me Erin was “crazy”. She wasn’t the most grounded person, but she was fine and I legit enjoyed her company. Finally, I get it out of my brother that his wife simply doesn’t want Erin as her in law. Because obviously two months of dating automatically leads to marriage...\n\nEventually, Erin and I split up. It wasn’t directly because of my SIL, but shit really poisoned the well. \n\nHere the AITA question: My family is well aware I have an issue with my SIL. We were never the closest people but I always made and effort. But after that, I shut her out completely. She’s never made any effort to apologize, or even address what she did. At family events I ignore her, and pretty do the bare minimum when I have to. The likelihood of her apologizing is pretty slim. I know this as much as everyone else in my family. AITA for continuing to hold a grudge?\n\n  ",

      "description": "Hello! My name is Riley and this is my story of my middle school art class. So there is a couple of people in this story that I will address with fake names. Marissa, Elena, Abby, and lets say Audree. I am still in this art class so if you guys have any advice that would be great.\n\nIt was a new semester, I was so excited for art. I’m not very good at art but it was still very enjoyable. The art teacher gives us are assigned seats and  tells us we can move after she takes attendance. Now this is fine with me. After she takes attendance I go find my friends and we all laugh and play around.\n\nTwo weeks later Elena takes my seat. She knows that I have sat there for a while but she still sits there. I ask her if she could move because I have sat there for a while. I realize my tone of voice was a little more bitchy then I wanted it to be so I kind of just awkwardly laugh it off. She says no. I get really mad and just go sit somewhere else. \n\nThe next day I apologize and ask if I can sit back where I used to. She says yes and I sit there. Once I sit there she takes one good look at my art work and kinda roasts it. Now I want revenge, badly. So I start being a little annoying. Now I will admit what I am doing is childish but I am only 13. I annoy Elena, Audree, Abby, and Marissa a little bit my singing and by copying what they are saying. Surprisingly Abby gets the most angry. Audree continues to criticize my art and Elena starts to call me ugly and say I am a bully.\n\nThe next day I step on the back of Abby’s shoe and puts her hand around my throat. I am a very short and weak eight grader (about 4 foot 8 inches and only weight about 80 pounds) This girl Abby is a basketball player and her friend let’s cal her Jamie tells her to STOP! She does but now I feel like I am the asshole for sure. Please give me advice.",

      "description": "So, basically this all happened the last few days.\n\nMy company throws some really great party every year, and after being unable to attend a few times I was really excited this time, given that I am not the best at socializing with people at work so I was kind of hoping to get some good drinking with colleagues going on. I was really seeing this as a great opportunity to get into some groups and circles I am usually too shy to approach. My girlfriend knew that. And also, the parties are usually really big and lush, because my employer really wants us to have a great time. \n\nAs it turned out, while I was being driven there, my girlfriend texted me that her grandpa was having a bad time, he seemed to be bedridden and not really able to talk too much. Of course I tried to comfort her and trying to calm her down. Maybe a bit of context here: She is usually the type of person who tends to overreact when it comes to medical conditions, and I on the other hand already lost both my grandparents a while ago, so I know the likes of which medical conditions tend to appear on old people.\n\nAnyways, she tended to respond really rude in my opinion, just some quick one liners, not really providing me and information or proper conversation, even though I tried to cheer her up and consolidate her. I was having a great time at the party, and I kind of didn't want to let this drag me down, so at some point I also only responded with some quick answers.\n\nAs the night progressed, I was getting kind of drunk, but not in a super bad way, I was just having an amazing time with my colleagues. At some point she told me her grandpa was brought to the hospital and I once again tried to consolidate her, but it was noticeable that my messages were getting less readable given my state of drunkenness.\n\nFast forward to the morning after, she was super pissed and disappointed that I didnt take proper care of her and consolidated her. She did not really care about what I did or how my party went.\n\nSo, AITA for getting drunk and kind of leaving my girlfriend aside in order to have a great time with colleagues at my company party?",

      "description": "Title may sound a little simple but the issue is pretty complicated and I would appreciate some input.\n\nI am a uni student living on campus and about four months ago, after a night out, a few friends and I went back to their accomodation. We were hanging out in their kitchen for a bit and when they said they were going to sleep I excused myself and headed out. On the the way out of the kitchen I saw a bottle of teriyake sauce and I just decided to take it with me for whatever reason.\n\nIt sat in my kitchen for a couple days, I didn't use it and didn't really know why I took it but because its only worth a couple pounds I wasn't really bothered about it. Then my mates messaged me telling me that the person whos it was wanted it back and so I went back and gave it to them.\n\nNow four months later I recieve a letter telling me that I bullied this person by taking their sauce and they reported me and I must attend a hearing with the disciplinary committee. Well that was yesterday and whilst I thought I would get a slap on the wrist boy was I wrong....\n\nThey called me a thief,  said how would I like it if someone did that to me and even equated it to murder somehow to which I laughed and the police officer ripped into me for not taking the issue seriously. At the end they told me that I would recieve a university and a halls warning which I was blown away by. If I get one more of those it means I'll be kicked out of my accomodation and likely kicked out of uni.\n\nSo theres the story, and I was just wondering if ITA? I know I shouldn't have taken the sauce and being drunk isn't an excuse but I did return it and this sort of thing is always happening at uni, people use eachothers food and breaking stuff is a common occurrence. I really think this has been blown massivly out of proportion and don't think that a bottle of sauce should be threatening my place at uni. It means I can't really drink while I'm here because I might do something that I think isn't a big deal and get kicked out.\n\n",

      "description": "Hi, Reddit. This morning (before work) my sister was missing her phone apparently. I left the house and went to work. When I get home, many of my valuable possessions were missing from my room. (Total value about $450 worth, which I paid for) I called my mother, who said \"I don't know, look in the bookshelf.\" I thought that was a strange response, but ok. I looked everywhere for them, and only found my guitar stand in the garage. I thought it was some dumb prank and forgot about it. Luckily my laptop was still there, so I browsed Reddit (hi) until they returned. When they did, I asked where they were. My mother got furious. \"You don't get to ask for that after what you did! We will talk about this later!\" That sort of thing. I was confused, and taken aback. We got in the car. I asked why she reacted that way. She explained that they had found my sister's phone in my bookshelf after I left for work. I didn't know how this happened (I didn't do it, Reddit) and asked how the two were related. She said she knew I did it and that I wouldn't get my stuff back until I confessed. I got defensive, because I needed that stuff for school, projects etc. Also, I owned them. I explained how I couldn't have done it, and I knew that my sister was trying to frame me. She wasn't buying it. My sister also chimed in saying \"we know you did it, just say it.\" They called me a liar, and said how disappointed in me they were. Am I the asshole for wanting my stuff back and defending myself when accused of something I didn't do and couldn't have done?",

      "description": "Background: I am 16 (pro-vax) and my grandma is 56 (anti-vax). My first mistake was adding her on Facebook and I’m sure I made others. Simply put, it started when she posted an article about the recent measles outbreak in Portland and how it was mostly kids who were already vaccinated. This immediately sounded like bs to me so I checked the article and it’s sources said just the opposite. So I commented that the posted article was misinformed and that it’s good to stay up to date of real information. This developed into a small argument in the comments. She later then sent me a huge text explaining how I was wrong and that it was disrespectful to challenge what she says. I told her that I disagreed and that I could be persuaded by some scientific evidence that was properly peer reviewed. She then sent me source after source and I would fact check them and read multiple peer reviews on them. Not a single source she sent me was factually correct. The argument heated to a boiling point when she eventually said this “Did I say creepy. Oh yes. I already pointed that out. Please do not contact me again.  I’m done with you.” I was a bit hurt and it kinda took me off guard that she would just cut me off like that because she is normally very kind and loving. I normally would not have gotten into a huge argument but she is a huge proponent in the reason my niece isn’t vaccinated even when we live in a state with measles outbreaks. My concern is mainly for her safety and I genuinely would change my opinion given the evidence, but I believe strongly in the scientific process. AITA for the situation escalating the way it did. ",

Sometimes dishes don't always get done straight away so there is a 48 hr deadline to them. It's fair but it's always been a bit of a struggle to get the third flatmate to do his dishes.\n\nThen he got a gf. She's loud, kind of annoying and smelly. Not nice smelly. She has basically moved in. There is an agreement on the lease that if someone is a relationship, that person can't stay the night more than 3 nights a week unless obviously communicated. It's reasonable. But she's basically moved in. She hangs round our house like a bad smell some days, like alone. It's fucking wierd. And guess what, she can't even be bothered to clean up ater the both of them.\n\nI've repeatedly had to ask them before they leave the house to do their dishes. The dishes are there for more than 48 hours. I asked them to do the dishes before I got back from the supermarket, still not done. She started doing them when I got in the shower after training so my shower was running cold. I got out and asked her to do them once I was done in the shower, it may seem petty but it's about boundaries for fucks sake. I'm an angry person by nature and I have been trying really hard not to blow up at them. I'm going to put the dirty dishes in his room next time he leaves the house so he gets the message. He'll be lucky if I don't put them in his fucking bed.",

Yesterday I went on my first date with a guy, and I didn’t really tell anyone except two close friends. Today someone I know walked up to me asking if I was gay, I said I was bi. I assumed one of my friends told them. I asked both of them and they said no. I just finished my tennis match and I open up my phone with a text of friend one saying I think I know who said, with a screenshot of this https://imgur.com/gallery/Kr9aPYa along with around 11 more about me being “gay”. This person that outed me on their story was someone I used to “talk” to in 7th grade. From then to rn(my freshman year) she continuously tries to ask me to hangout. I always denied it because she was toxic. She goes to a 40k+ a year private highschool, and I go to a pretty “sketchy” highschool(weed , fights, xans etc). So obviously snitching is taken pretty badly. I want to know if I should report it to her highschool, and how should I do it. Today I cried to my mom for the first time in 5+ years, because now I’m not known as smart sam, or cool sam, or tennis player sam. I’ll be known as gay sam. I don’t want people to just see my sexuality, and that’s why I didn’t come out.  So should I report it and how do you think it will be taken?\n\nTLDR: I was outed on someone’s story in a very negative context, should I report it but will I be a snitch?\n",

It was a small space so we were all sitting together, and I had no where else to hang out so I was just on my phone not contributing to the conversation since it was work related. My boyfriend has never had a drink in his life (parents were alcoholics so he never touched it, but is ok with me drinking around him). I didn't know his friend, so I offered her a glass of wine since I knew we'd be there for a while and I was getting kinda bored. She replied with a very quick \"I'm sober.\" I guess she had recently quit drinking, since I had heard her earlier telling drinking stories. I then asked, \"Would I be an asshole if I had a glass of wine?\" already on my way to the kitchen. My boyfriend politely said \"of course not\", and she basically cut him off with \"Yes.\" \n\nI sat back down and ended up not having a drink feeling guilty for even suggesting it, but I was pretty point blank told I would have been an asshole if I did. I'd especially like to know from the non-drinkers of reddit, is it assholeish to drink in front of you? ",

I fell asleep and while I slept one black girl put her hoodie over me to keep me warm which was quite nice but others (girls I should add) mimed doing sex acts on me and posted pictures of this to social media with hashtags #Blacked or #Blacked. In reference to a porn site. I feel a bit creeped out about this. I am quite glad it was girls doing it as it looks less weak and not gay. The boys are friendly with me but they maintain respectful distance because of the untrue (but not going to tell them that) rumour that my dad beat a black guy and gave them brain damage.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to find other people attractive, but if I’m honest, it feels disrespectful to say it to me/in front of me? I find other women attractive, but I don’t advertise it to her. What good does that do? I told her I didn’t like that she would just blurt that out in front of me and she agreed not to do it again, but we agreed it’s normal to think others are attractive. Fast forward about 2 months and she continues making similar comments while we were having dinner at a restaurant. I got annoyed with her and didn’t say much after because I don’t feel like saying anything when I get upset. She asked me what the problem was and I told her it annoys me when she does this. She got defensive and said she was joking, and when I asked her if she forgot that she agreed not to do that or if she just didn’t care about it she said I was overreacting and that she was making a joke. I really don’t understand how that’s a joke though? I have trouble trusting her because of this to be honest.\n\nI get that I’m being insecure, I accept that, and I should work on that. But was I an asshole here? Have you had a similar situation in your relationship? What do you think? Should partners just tell each other they are attracted to random strangers on the street? Am I being unreasonable for thinking she might cheat on me because of this? (I didn’t say that to her btw) \n\nEdit: fucked up the title, please forgive. ",

      "description": "I've recently thrown myself into the dating world  and I'm really enjoying meeting a variety of different people. \n\nI've been seeing someone fairly regularly for about a month and he's a really cool guy! We have a lot of the same interests and he always has fun date ideas. I like him as a person and I want to remain in touch with him but his phone is driving me fucking crazy. \n\nWhat really bothers me is how his phone will send me the same text message about 4-5 times. Having a text conversation with him is nearly impossible and incredibly frustrating. I'm really busy during the day so having him send one text (which ends up being 4 of the same ones) is really distracting. \n\nA week ago I told him I don't really want him to text me anymore until he either figures out what's wrong with his phone or gets a different one. But he sends me good morning texts every day and- as a sweet as they are, it's annoying as hell and I'm kinda bitter about the whole thing. \n\nSo, reddit, WIBTA for ending things with this really sweet guy because of his stupid phone?

      "description": "My husband and I eloped in 2017 as we were moving across the country and I needed health insurance. We were getting married later that year anyway, so we figured it wouldn’t be a huge problem.\n\nThen, his mother suddenly (and horrifically) died. My husband could no longer stomach our plans since his mother was supposed to be there. We cancelled them. He hasn’t been in a good place mentally since. I realized a wedding reception wasn’t going to happen, and I’m okay with it. I’m 30, I don’t care. I didn’t want a wedding anyway.\n\nMy parents absolutely love him and cried when he called to let them know he was proposing. I joke they’d trade him for me, but I do know it’s semi-true.\n\nI decided we should just tell them we eloped and get it over with, especially since my mother has been getting particularly cruel lately. Our relationship has always been strained, and she loved to call and tell me that my husband clearly didn’t want to marry me anymore and he was going to dump me and take all our resources at any moment. She doesn’t understand why it was hard for my husband to watch his mother die. Her only words of comfort to me were, “Are you going to cry this much when I die? I hope you’ll cry more.”\n\nAnyway, we told my parents during Thanksgiving. My dad was PUMPED. He hates weddings and spent a lot of money on my brother and sister. My mom was very polite and upbeat, but I knew it was a sham. She has not spoken to me since. My husband sent her a handwritten letter apologizing (again) for the secrecy, and acknowledging that she was allowed to feel hurt, and we wanted to hear those feelings.\n\nWhen she’s mad at one of her three children, she takes it out on the rest. She won’t talk to my siblings either. She would do this stuff when I was a child, and my dad would force me to apologize over and over, even if I didn’t do anything wrong. He said it didn’t matter, but we had to appeal to her ego for family harmony to be restored.\n\nI’m tired. I’ve called almost daily to make her feel special. She won’t call me back. I think I’m done calling. My sister thinks I should keep calling her daily, like has been. I’m sure eventually she’ll decide to stop “punishing” me, but I don’t really feel like enabling her manipulative actions anymore. She’s allowed to be pissed, but I’d rather she talk about it with me so we can move past it. The silent treatment is tiring after all these years.\n\nAITA for waiting for her to call me after weeks of unreturned calls? Common phone etiquette says the ball is in her court, but I’m probably an asshole for eloping in the first place. (My life-saving meds would have been several thousand dollars without it though.)",

      "description": " \n\nLet’s take it back six years to 2013. It’s the day of my college graduation. Since the ceremony begins fairly early, my eight fraternity brothers (I know) and I decide to get up even earlier to get properly tanked. After a couple hours of drinking, we get together to pose for group photos in our grad caps. \n\nDuring the last photo, I decided to it would be hilarious to surreptitiously hang my flaccid wang over the waistband of my shorts--the idea being that no one would notice my exposed Johnson until after the picture came out and we’d all have a laugh. It worked, and we did (though one of my friends was annoyed that I ruined the photo.) \n\nI didn’t think much of it until later that morning when I realize one of my friends has posted the photo on Instagram! Naturally, I freaked out and made him delete it immediately—but at this point had already been up for an hour or two and garnered it’s fair of likes and “haha omg” comments. Needless to say, I was pretty fucking pissed at the time and to be honest, it still irks me a bit to this day. But when I confronted him about it, he basically said if you didn’t want this on social media you shouldn’t have done it.  \n\nSo look, I know how incredibly immature this was to do in the first place. And I know, that real lesson here is to keep your dong in your pants at all times. That said, this was a photo was taken in the company of solely my closest male friends—not intended to be shared with the world. So did I have this coming? Or was my friend being a major dick?",
