      "description": "So obviously my girlfriend loves her dog very much. Today she gave him a bath and so he had his collar off. Her mom came over and I answered the door. Her dog was excited to see her so when I opened the door he started jumping on her. Her mom moved to the side leaving a big opening and the dog bolted out the door and down the stairs.\n\nLong story short I chased after him getting several bystanders including a policeman involved. They corralled him back to the apartment. He is now safe and sound however my girlfriend is not currently talking to me because I let her dog out. \n\nI apologised but did not claim full responsibility apparently this upset her. She was finishing in the shower when this all happened. I feel like her mom is just a big a part of why the dog got out but also feel like it will get much worse if I express that feeling. I mean she basically side stepped the dog allowing him to bolt. \n\nSo 1. AITA 2. How should I go about solving this? I have sense apologized again and asked about having dinner to no response.",

      "description": "So, this morning, me, my mom and my dad took a ride in the car together to a doctor's appointment when I told them I'd like to sleep over at my friend's place on friday night and asked if they'd be okay with that.\n\nMy mom immediately bursts out with something along the lines of \"Well, absolutely no, you can't!\", which I respect, but I calmly ask why, as I at least want to know the reason for her decision.\n\nMy father immediately follows with scolding me \"Your mother said you couldn't go and you will respect that!\"\n\nI absolutely hate when either of them does this. It infuriates me to no end. Makes me feel like a literal idiot. Like I, for some reason, cannot comprehend the reasoning behind most of their complex decisions. I get it, it sounds bratty and teenage-angsty, but I think I am old enough for my parents to finally indulge me in what they actually mean by \"no\" and not just expect me to follow orders. I live far away from my parents throughout the week (boarding house) and they trust me with other things that require adulting, so I really don't understand why this particular thing is such a problem.\n\nBut anyway, my father also says something about me crossing a line or something, which, again, I don't get. Now I'm getting visibly and audibly irritated, but I still mostly manage to keep my cool and ask why they wouldn't tell me, as I think I'd be able to understand, if they'd just tell me, to which he replies that he doesn't care what I think and I lose my cool. Now we're arguing in the car, but it's mostly just being pissed at eachother, so we don't really move forward from that point on (obviously).\n\nMe and my mom get on with our doctor's appointment and later grab lunch together, where we bring the topic up again, this time both of us calm. She explains to me why I can't go (I won't go deeper into that, since it's an old friend from elementary and both us and our parents have had various personal issues) and I agree that that is indeed reasonable and I will respect that, but also tell her that they could have just told me in the car in like three sentences and we'd avoid the whole stupid arguement.\n\nMy mom explains to me how my dad has just returned from a night shift and was kind enough to drive us to town so that we don't have to take the bus, and it's understandable for him to lose his cool like that, but at the same time I think that I didn't do anything to prompt him to lose his cool like that.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA For Putting my Foot Down regarding my ONE DAY visit?",
      "description": "I live in NYC, and my brother lives with Mom in PA. They can't stand each other. Their arguments are venomous and spiteful, usually with both of them simultaneously being in the wrong. Spending time with them both means dealing with A LOT of toxic drama, but I deal with it because I genuinely love them.\n\nThe condition being, I've stopped spending more than a single day to visit.\n\nI've only visited for more than a week twice, but on both occasions the random petty arguments were constant. To the point where plans we'd made were canceled because of a fight they'd have earlier in the day. Basically I was going on a vacation to do nothing but play mediator for a week.\n\nToday is my brother's birthday, and I've just gotten home. Mom asked why I wouldn't stay for more than a day, so I told her frankly that it was because I didn't want to deal with their constant bitching at one another.\n\nI arrived at 2 this afternoon, and would end up leaving for NYC around 6:30pm. Bro wanted to take a quick nap as he'd just gotten home from work, and Mom wanted to run a quick drop-off errand. She's in crutches right now due to a foot injury, so I tag along in case she needs me.\n\n2 and a half hours, down the drain.\n\nDuring this time:\nMom had to get the file she needed to drop off printed out. \nShe had a strong craving for a Mc'Cafe, and stopped for one.\nWe bump into one of her work friends, another ten minutes down. \nWe finally hit the doctor's office (the reason we left in the first place) and the doctor had left for home. For all the time we wasted she may as well have waited until Monday.\nWe buy my brother's cake and go home.\n\nMind you, Mom knew exactly what time I had to leave, and that we didn't have much time. I don't know if this is what she's doing, but I thought she was just intentionally wasting time to try and guilt me into staying longer. Wouldn’t put it past her.\n\nDuring this time, Dad calls for some reason. It's now 4:30, Mom and Dad are tag-team grilling me on why I won't just stay a bit longer -- with Dad going \"It's not like you're doing anything?\"\n\nI didn't justify to either of them anything other than the fact that I do, in fact, have shit to do and I told them both how long I planned on staying.\n\nWe get to Mom's house and bro is livid. Now he and Mom take their turn to try convincing me to get on a later bus. That wasn't happening, so I put my foot down. We kill what little time I have left to spend time with him by taking pictures, getting them some chicken from a restaurant down the road, and passive aggressive remarks being tossed back and forth between them.\n\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole because my brother genuinely didn't do anything wrong, and Mom pretty much robbed all of his time with me intentionally or not. I didn't want to seem like they could pull these shenanigans to get me to stay longer, so I held on. ",

      "description": "I apologies for the long story and grammar, today was crazy. My mom and her boyfriend came into town today and had a few problem checking in to their hotel. After 2 hours of waiting around for there system to fix they get checked in, and head up to their non-smoking room which wreaked of cigarettes and had  trash so complain. My mom says the place doesn't feel clean, so I decided to check the mattress for bugs as boyfriend comes in. I lift the sheets, look in the seams, and then pick the mattress corner up. I see a little black purse toward the end of the bed and call my moms boyfriend over. He grabs it, opens it, and takes out the first thing in it. It was a bloody rag full of blood, a needle, and heroin. He immediately packed everything up and stormed off to the desk. I was extremely upset about all this because my child was in the room to witness everything and could have played in it if not found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI head outside by myself to calm down and I see a car with a mother and her to small kids outside the lobby with the husband checking in near by. I go over to the car and knock on the window and smile. She opens the door a little and I say \"Hello, are you about to stay in this hotel?\" She looked and me and said yes in a European accent. I then told her \"My parent just recently checked into this hotel and we just found heroin in between the mattress, please check between them. I don't want anything to happen to your children.\" The husband notices and start approaching me and I tell him the same thing. I then head back to the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell the GM granted a full refund after they offered my mom 25% off and they declined. We all head to the lobby to check them out and when finished I approach the desk  front desk lady and say \"You guys really need to be more attentive with the rooms this was totally unacceptable.\" Well the lady and the front desk snaps like I am personally attacking her, \"You are going around harassing guest!\" I looked at her and raised my voice as well and say \"We found heroin in between the mattresses with my son (pointed and my son) in the room that is what is fucking ridiculous!\" She stands there deer in head lights staring at me. I just shake my head in disappointment and walk out. As I am walking out the door someone else with a young child stops me and asks what happened and I tell them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell as my mom called corporate to report what happened and she mentioned everything about our experience except the lady at the front desk yelling in my face. I mentioned it to her when on the phone and she shook her head. I think it was something that should have been added to the shit pile. I just though it was odd she didn't say anything. Was I the asshole or something?",

Almost all instruments that we use are rented and are given back at the end of the year, so we all make sure to take good care of our instruments so we don’t end up having to pay any damage fees (renting the instruments is already kind of expensive I’ve heard). But since around December, one of The clarinets (call her C) has been using an instrument locker right next to me. I thought nothing of it until I noticed her at the end of class simply throwing her clarinet in her locker. Anyone who knows instruments this could be harmful to it. I’ve asked C about it before, only to have her sass back at me “what’s the point anyway” or something along those lines. She’s been simply throwing it in since she started using the locker next to me.\nWIBTA for telling my director about the way C is treating her instrument? I don’t want to sound like a snitch. ",

      "description": "This is an ongoing issue with my vet that I have.  Me and my SO adopted a cat from our local humane society 3 years ago.  She was return after being adopted out to a family that had other pet/children and was labelled as needing to be in a home with no other pets or small children.  Once an animal gets this label it is much harder for them to be adopted out, and she was already a year old, so we took her in and have provided a warm and loving house for her.  In November I woke up on a Saturday to find her hiding under our futon gasping for air.  I quickly took her to the closet vet that was open for them to check on her and give her medicine.  $1000 vet bill later they gave me some meds that she will have to take daily for the rest of her life and the news that she has congestive heart failure which is causing liquid to accumulate in her lungs..  It was roughly explained to be that there could be 2 causes and in order to determine which cause it was they would have to do another test that would cost \\~$700 and I asked if we did the test would we be able to cure her, the vet said \"No\"  The medicine she is on is helping her heart and clearing the fluid from her lungs, if we did the tests they cold give her a more focused medicine that would raise her expected life from 6-12 months to 12-18 months....maybe.  I told the Vet at the time that we wouldn't do the more expense tests and just give her these meds to make her as comfortable as she can.  I've been getting bi-weekly calls from the clinic asking me to bring her bring he back in for more blood work and more testing.  At first I would answer the call but they would always make me feel like a terrible owner for not doing everything they suggest for my cat.  I just got another call from them that I ignored and the voice mail  is them asking me when I would like to book an appointment for some blood work and more tests.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for any run on sentences.",

      "title": "AITA for warning the wife about my best friend's cheating married ex without her consent?",
      "description": "Confusing title, but I didn't know how to clarify it given the rules regarding the title. Anyway, my best friend dated this guy for almost a year. Turns out he was already married, living out a crazy double life, and cheating on her with a bunch of other girls too. This absolutely devastated my friend - he made her believe they were in love and had a future together. In the 4 years that I have known my friend, I have never seen her so destroyed. She was a wreck for weeks, crying non stop. \n\nFast forward about 3-4 months after their breakup, I end up seeing the guy having dinner with his wife (they were both wearing rings, so I presumed this wasn't one of the other \"side hoes\") where I work. I waited for her to go to the bathroom, and told her about my friend's situation and warned her that he was probably still cheating on her with many other women, as he had done previously. The woman furiously stormed out and they started having a screaming match outside, I am not sure what happened afterwards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I get home and tell my friend about it, and to my surprise, she goes ballistic on me. She started telling me I had no right to do that, to invade other people's lives, that she was starting to heal and now I ruined her process given that I unnecessarily got involved into a situation that was already done. We had a huge fight about it, and I honestly believe she is wrong to get mad at me. I feel as though I had an imperative to warn the woman, as much as I would if I were seeing someone getting blindly robbed or taken advantage of. Was I wrong to do this without her consent?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA For trying to save two seats on a Southwest flight?",
      "description": "As the title suggests, I wanted to save two seats for my wife and 17-year-old son. Let me set the stage so that your decision can be rendered with all the facts:\n\nBWI to MHT, Sunday night (yesterday). Southwest flight... yes, I get the rules of boarding. For those that don't know, SW boards in groups only and you don't have assigned seating. You are simply assigned a group and then a number. Groups are A, B, and C and the numbers go from 1-65 (or so). If you are given A 25 you are typically the 25 person aboard the plane, give or take (but the exact numbers aren't important here).\n\nOur meal was a little late prior to boarding so I went ahead and decided to board ahead of my family. As we have done countless times before, I'd just hold a couple seats for them as I know they were right behind me. I had boarding letter/number A45. Southwest flies nothing but 737s with three variations. You either have 143 or 175 seats available. \n\nI sat down in an aisle seat and threw my jacket over the middle and window arm rest. Two minutes later a young woman stopped at my seat, looked at me and said \"I want to sit there.\" pointing at the window seat. I politely said \"Oh, sorry, I'm trying to save these for my son and wife who are not far behind you. Her reply - \"So?\" I said \"But, 60% of the plane is still empty. You literally have the entire back half of the plan to sit wherever you want?\" \n\nShe moved her way in and that was that. Given the characteristics of the players involved, me uttering a single word would have lead to an international incident - that I am sure of. \n\nAITA for moving here? Should I have stood my ground? I get it - open seating. But the plan was, again literally, less than half full at this point. I have been flying for business for over 25 years. I'm quite sure that I have flown more than 85% or more of the general population. Not a fact I am proud of, just a little background to say that I know flying sucks, I know the rules and I also know that sometimes common courtesy supersedes some of the basic rules of boarding. \n\nI am also quite sure that this young lady feels that this was a major victory for the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, stupid old people... whatever battle she is waging (that nobody even knows she is involved in), but, seriously?\n\nTL;DR - Tried to save two seats (middle and window) on a Southwest flight for my family. More than half the plane was empty when someone pushed their way in to seats that I was saving and I decided to take the high ground and just move. AITA or should I have dug in?",

Today I went shopping with my dad at the same place as she was coincidentally going shopping with her sister. She didn't want her sister to know she had a boyfriend, so she texted me saying I shouldn't say anything if we saw each other. She told me she was looking out for me, because it would be cool to see her. I did see her, she was about a yard or 2 away from me, we made eye contact, but she just looked away without acknowledging me in any way. I figured this was just her pretending not to have seen me, but when I called her later she said she actually didn't see me at all. This hurt a bit since we've been dating since the summer and she just looked straight through me as if I was a stranger. I didn't get 'annoyed' annoyed, but I was a little pissed that she just didn't recognise me at all. I told her about it and she said I'm being dumb for getting annoyed. Am I? ",

      "title": "AITA for trying to set boundaries with my toxic sister in law who has stirred up so much drama that resulted in not being invited to my wedding?",
      "description": "My husband and I just recently got married back in September. The past few years I’ve had a really rocky relationship with his sister in law which is unfortunate because we used to be friends and we used to get along well. In the past we have had arguments about her childhood home (we were offered to live there and rent from his mother who still owned the house and I can only assume that she was upset for not being offered to live there first) where she started treating me differently and being rude almost always until I couldn’t take it anymore so I decided to call her out on it and ask her what her problem was. That blew up and we didn’t talk for about a year. \n\nSomething tragic happened and she lost one of her friends and I swallowed my pride to reach out to her and offer my condolences. We started to talk a little bit after that and I thought things would be back to normal. Nope, I was wrong. After that brief period of peace and quiet I found myself in a situation where she felt it was necessary and completely okay to coordinate a “combined birthday cookout” for my husband and one of his friends (he’s 27 now and we’ve been together for 7 years) without including me in any of the planning process and just decided to text me one day with an invite to the party as if I was random guest. \n\nI once again expressed my feelings to her and was met with a casual response about how it wasn’t a big deal and was just dismissed. My husband, being super non confrontational tried to get me to let it go and assured me that next year would be different and that it wouldn’t happen again next year. Welp, it happened again the next year and this time she didn’t bother to invite me directly - she went straight to my husband to try and coordinate dates and plans and this time he tried to get out of it nicely and told her we had plans and were unable to attend the day that she had wanted to plan for. We actually did have really big plans for that entire weekend that involved working at two markets for the first time that required a lot of attention and time. Then began the manipulating where she turned it all on me, claimed I didn’t want her to have her cookout (not true, would’ve just liked to have been included in planning process for someone I love) and that she only gets to see her brother maybe once a year (guilt tripping him) and that the other friend wanted the party so badly and that they do it every year and don’t understand why they can’t do it anymore. There was a bunch of miscommunication and she ended up calling me names and throwing a hissy fit because she wasn’t hearing what she wanted. \n\nOnce again, I reached out directly to try and smooth things over and we talked it through. She apologized, I apologized - everything was cool and chill. Fast forward to the end of summer where my husband proposes to me. We had talked about getting married for a while and knew it was something we wanted to do for a long time. We had plans to elope with just our parents and my 2 kid siblings (4 &amp; 9) and then have a large reception another day. We told our parents the next day about our engagement and what our plans were. SIL lives with his father so she was there when we announced the news. All is swell and everyone is happy until later that night where I get a text notification in a group chat between me, my husband and the sister in law. She is asking for clarification on the wedding day and why she’s not able to be there. She expresses she wants to be there but is not understanding or respecting our decision to not have anyone else except for parents and my two younger siblings there. My husband has 3 full siblings who are older and then 2 other half siblings who are older. All of the other siblings were aware of our plans to elope and were respectful with our desire to keep it as small and intimate as possible. None of them cared about what we wanted to do, they only cared about whether or not it made us happy. She finally comes out and asks if my siblings will be there and that’s when her demeanor changes from being bummed out and being sweet to trying to convince us to let her be there (she offered to help pay if money was the issue, and tried to find ways to offer something in order for her to be present) to being a complete and salty bitch. She is now offended and sees me as the sole reason as to why she is not allowed to “witness her baby brother getting married to his love on his wedding day.” I felt bad at first because I can understand how and why that would make someone upset but I reverted back to how I originally felt which was the feeling of not wanting to give in to her selfish needs because it was MY wedding and I wanted to do what I wanted to do. My husband and I had talked it over throughly and he didn’t see an issue with not having his siblings there and was fine with having my siblings present as they played certain roles, like the flower girl and ring bearer. I will admit that part of me did not want her to be present because of our rocky past but that is my decision to make and I have every right to chose who I want to see when I’m walking down the aisle to marry my partner. Children are pure and innocent and my husband and I both adore my younger siblings so it wasn’t a hard decision to make to include them. So, SIL throws a temper tantrum, bitches us out, blames me for everything and proceeds to block me on everything...social media (after she posted a congratulatory post about our engagement) and phone. My husband had fallen asleep when most of the shit hit the fan so he didn’t catch up and respond till the next morning. He tried to respond only to find that he too had been blocked. A few days go by before they talk and she explains to him how he’s changed so much and how she doesn’t even know who he is anymore and how she thinks I control him and everything. She insults me and just expresses how hurt she is by all of it and basically tells him he’s no longer her brother but will always love him. A few more exchanges were made but we’ll never know if she actually received them because she had blocked him after sending her message. My husband then decides, that until she apologizes - she’s no longer invited to the wedding. We never received an apology and she never made any effort to mend things so she never received an invite. We got married and had a beautiful time without her, her baggage and negative aura. \n\nFast forward this past weekend...I received a text message from her telling me to tell my husband to text his older brother to check in on him (recovering addict going through a hard time). We communicate with him quite often and so I decided to check in on him myself - he turned out to be completely fine and sleeping, just had a bad weekend filled with panic attacks and tried to reach out for help and in turn did not get the actual emotion support and help he was looking for. I waited a day and debated on whether or not I should respond. I questioned why she had only texted me instead of texting my husband directly and why she couldn’t reach out to her brother herself if she was so concerned. The next day I decided to respond but it turns out that yes, again...I was blocked and my message did not go through. This infuriated me because I felt as if she had an open line of communication and was able to talk to me or bud into my life whenever she wanted but always blocked me off from responded so I could never react or respond. It just doesn’t sit well with me. I believe I have every right to respond to someone when they contact me - especially directly through text. So I decided to text her through a text messaging app to get my message across to her. The following messages are what conspired after I sent my message. I apologize in advance for the graphic language. Am I insane for reacting/feeling this way or am I actually the one who is the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to eat with my friend who likely has an ED?",
      "description": "I (22F) have a same-age friend (22F) in college. She's a great friend in many ways - outgoing, bright, and caring.\n\nMy friend has a history of ED (eating disorder), and based on what she described, I think she suffered from bulimia. She also mentioned that she still occasionally binge eats at night but that it wasn't serious. I don't judge her at all for it, and was just happy that she trusted me enough to confide in me.\n\nNow, the problem I have is the stuff she says and does when we're eating together. We frequently have meals together at our university cafeteria. Recently, she's been getting a salad for every meal and compares it to what I eat (usually some bread, soup, meat, rice - I like diversity), saying things like, \"You eat so little!\", \"Look how HUGE my salad is compared to your food!\", or \"You should eat more like me, I'm so stuffed!\" Granted, her salads are pretty big and fills up her entire plate so visually they do look 'bigger' than my food. However, her meal is basically just a ton of lettuce and veggies with no dressing - I can't imagine it being more filling than what I eat. \n\nMy frustration hit a peak yesterday when we dined out for dinner. Again, she ordered a salad while I got a steak gyro. I wasn't really that hungry so I ate half and packed up the remaining to eat later. As soon as I asked for a box, my friend made this shocked expression and said loudly, \"Why aren't you eating more?? You hardly ate anything, girl!\" I was kind of embarrassed and told her that I was full to which she said, 'Yeah right, you ate so little! I'm really worried about you.\"\n\nTbh, I felt (and still feel) so annoyed by that. My friend is around the same weight, if not thinner than me so I don't know she feels the need to constantly judge the size of my meals and feel 'worried' that I'm not eating enough for her standards; after all, without wanting to sound insensitive, I'm not the one with a history of ED!\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I feel strangely guilty if I don't eat a lot in front her. I hate stuffing myself, but I make an effort to clean off my plate every time I dine with her just so that she won't nag me to eat more.\n\nI'm tempted to just not eat with her anymore, though we'd still hang out in other ways. I'm also tempted to say something like, \"Your salad really isn't more filling than my meal. If anything, you should be the one to eat more\" to her the next time she compares our food. Would I be TA if I said that?\n\nAt the same time, I feel like I should be more sympathetic towards her because her actions suggest that she's still suffering from ED, though she hasn't explicitly said anything. I don't want to say anything potentially hurtful or triggering to her.\n\ntltr: Friend who likely has an ED makes annoying comments about how little I eat compared to her (when the opposite is true) and implies that I'm lying when I tell her that I'm full - AITA for not wanting to eat with her anymore and not sympathizing enough?",

I harbour such a dislike for this man it’s unreal, here’s a few reasons why: he’s alluded to a threesome between me, my cousin and him (This was a few months ago my cousin was 17 and I was 16), he already has two kids that are almost my age, he does drugs and has tried to pressure me into doing them at his place, he’s living at his parents house as he gambles away all his money, he has threatened to murder me before if I ever hurt my cousin and there’s even more than I can’t list. \n\nSo anyway, my mum invited my cousins family round as usual and she said that my cousins boyfriend could come too (baring in mind she doesn’t know half of the stuff he does) and he’s coming round now. AITA for telling my cousin not to bring him although he was invited? I’ve really fallen out with her have vowed not to talk to her if he arrives. \n\nI realise this sounds childish, but i would hate tradition to be broken by allowing this guy to come into MY house.

We’ve broken up once before because of this and other issues, but the other issues got better. I just can’t do the whole no sex thing while she still has 4+ years of school left with no idea when marriage will come. \n\nI asked if we could still be friends because I truly value her friendship, but she declined because it would be hard for her. That’s the part that upsets me a bit because we were really good friends before we were ever a couple. The lack of sex is driving me insane though. I watch porn and masturbate damn near every day, multiple times a day and it’s a nice serotonin boost, but I feel shitty afterward. ",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nAlmost everywhere I go people seem to find a way to ruin my day and I'm afraid that it's getting to a point (or maybe it's been there for awhile?) where it negatively affects the relationships in my personal life as well as my self esteem.\n\nA few examples:\n\nThis past week my girlfriend and I took a trip to Disney World to celebrate her graduating her masters program.  If there's anywhere on Earth where I've encountered more inconsiderate, clueless individuals I cannot remember.\n\nFrom what my parents tell me--as I was too young to remember at the time--Disney has really stepped up their game as far as making things quick and accessible for their guests to enjoy the parks and resorts.  We had free shuttles to essentially anywhere we needed to go and could monitor wait times for the various rides through their app.  I was really impressed.  But I was much less impressed with their patrons.\n\nOn one of the busses to a park one morning, a girl maybe seven or eight years old and her parents took the three seats next to us, with the girl sitting directly on my right.  As the windows were behind us and my girlfriend pointed out something off in the distance I had to turn my head to see.  As soon I did this girl turned toward me and coughed the phlegmiest fucking cough straight into my face.  I don't mean a loogie or anything but I was definitely hit with some spit and a lot of her hot ass breath.  I kinda recoiled and the girl seemed to realize what happened but wasn't really mentally mature enough to respond in an empathetic way.  It annoyed me mostly for the fact that we had just gotten there the day before and I really didn't want to spend the rest of the trip sick.  But that's not what got to me.\n\nIt was a complete accident and something I would normally try to save face for but after I'd gotten my face dried off this girl continues to hack up slugs without covering her mouth on the extremely crowded bus.  Her parents sit there chatting and say absolutely nothing to her as she just holds her tongue out her damn mouth and wheezes while I try to hold my breath for the next ten minutes until I can breathe fresh air again.  I'm just sitting there stewing in anger and already feel like my day has reached a breaking point.  When we were exiting I kind of gave the girl a dirty look which she noticed, but it was like a reflex not even an intentional thing.\n\nThere are definitely some things at the park that pissed me off, too.  People stopping walking in the middle of busy areas.  People on scooters driving directly down the middle of narrow foot traffic lanes and lanes for the rides which they then get off their scooters for and immediately hop back on to depart (and I don't mean people with actual handicaps that need assistance for any of this, I mean the ones that seem to fly solo dolo).  Parents with fucking newborn babies out in direct sunlight.  These things may not individually bring me down but they seem to compound into anger that gets directed unfairly towards my girlfriend.  And I don't mean that I get pissed at her directly but just that my anger will sometimes prevent us both from having what should be a good time.  I think what gets me the most is that the people around me don't seem to get annoyed about these things either.  It's like I'm the only one getting upset and now I'm starting to think I may just be the asshole and everyone else has accepted reality when I can't.  The trip was barely spoiled by any of this and we did have a really great time together.\n\nThe bus situation may seem very one-sided so here's another.  On the plane ride home this morning my girlfriend and I each had an aisle seat across from each other.  It wasn't ideal but it was fine for us in case one of us had to go to the bathroom we could just get up and go, no problem.  Well along comes this family of four, taking up two of the seats in the row in front of me and the two seats next to me.  I let the father and younger son climb in and his son takes the window, saying something along the lines of, \"You know how often I have to pee.\"  I just figured maybe I'd just have to get up a few times throughout the flight to let this kid piss.  It was a 2 1/2 hour flight and liquids can travel fast.  \n\nNow, I have to mention that flying has always made me uneasy despite the evidence to its safety and I do tend to get a bit motion sick.  So, we take off and just reach cruising altitude when the flight crew announces like always to remain seated until the seatbelt light goes off.  Well about thirty seconds later I hear the kid say that he has to go to the bathroom so his dad asks me get up.  I point up to the light and say, \"The seatbelt light is still on.\"\n\nHe responds, \"Well he could get up or just urinate here on you,\"\nlike I'm the one being unreasonable.\n\nI just muttered, \"Jesus Christ,\" to myself and got up because I didn't want to deal with a confrontation two minutes into a flight with a decent length.  Well about a minute later the guy's other son who is sitting in front of me also gets up and follows his brother to the back of the plane and not two seconds later the flight attendant is on the horn with the reminder about staying seated.  But they don't actually do shit.  These kids just walk by them through the aisle.  The seatbelt light was on pretty much the entire flight and people continued to get up and use the bathroom with no reprimanding or anything.  We definitely hit a few bumps along the way, too.  Luckily the kid came back and held it for the rest of the flight but why the fuck do people think that it's okay to do that?  I don't want to have my seatbelt unbuckled and then all of a sudden smack my damn skull on the ceiling of the plane.  I get that people have to pee but I don't want to risk a concussion or worse for that shit.  Again, I just kinda stewed in my seat and mentally shook my head at these daredevils until we were off the plane.\n \n So am I the asshole here?  Is it a dick move to let these things get to me?  Occurrences like these are frequent in my life, where I think I'm being fair but somehow it comes back on me like I'm the one at fault.  Should I just have gotten up and let that kid piss?  Do other people just take coughs to the face with an \"oh, well, things could be better\" attitude?  I really don't want to be the asshole at the happiest place on Earth but if I am I need to know.",

      "description": "This all started in August when we moved in and I don’t at all believe in love at first sight, but when I first saw him he took my breath away. \n\nBefore my roommate and I had moved in together, we, along with our five other roommates had never met, so we were all trying to get to know each other. “Sara” and I clicked right off the bat and became close pretty fast which led to me spending time with her brother occasionally. Every time I saw him or talked to him my heart sped up and I also found him popping up in my dreams. It wasn’t long before I found out that he was interested in me too. I don’t have strong feelings towards people very often, and this is one of those times so I was very confused on what to do. In the past when I be been interested in someone and they’ve been interested in me, I haven’t been able to pursue anything with them because of the situation we were in. I ended telling Sara that I have feelings for her brother after a month and she took it really well.\n\n\nHe and I ended up going on two dates which went really well and we talked about how to handle the whole thing. I hadn’t told her that he and I had gone out for several reasons being; I didn’t have time since she was working and going to school so she was never home, I wanted to see what direction he and I were headed in, and I didn’t want to tell her because it wasn’t serious yet. He is 23, I’m 20, and she’s 18. He and I both agreed we could be mature adults if it didn’t work out. \n\nA week and a half after our two dates, he told her that we had hung out a couple of times and she flipped out. She was mad at me for keeping it from her and I explained that since I had barely seen her for longer than two minutes in the last week and a half, that we hadn’t really had the time.\n\nHe went a bit radio silent after that for a couple weeks before messaging me again. He invited me over and I decided to end things because I don’t fuck with that kind of hot and cold bullshit.  When I went over to his apartment, I was dead set on ending things with him but once I got there and he had given me a valid explanation for why he hadn’t really been talking ",

This is my first post and it’s kind of a long sorry.  \n\nSo, a little background, I am currently a university student and I live in the dorms. My dorm is set up in such a way that there are two bedrooms shared between two students each and a bathroom and a kitchen that is shared by all four. My roommate and I met online and decided that we were gonna live together before the beginning of the year. The other two were completely random. \n\nMy roommate, one of girls in the other room, and I have all become very close friends and are planning on living together again next year. The last girl hangs out with us,  but it is pretty obvious that we are all much closer. We also have had some problems with her the past semester and that is something we really don’t want to deal with again. \n\nLately, our school has been sending out emails about applying for housing. Me and my other two roommates have been discussing our housing options and have a pretty good idea of where we are going to live. \n\nToday, the fourth roommate approached us about living together and things got awkward. We pretty much just said that the rest of us would be exploring other options. She then asked if we could live on the same floor (our school has a special program that lets up to 20 people choose the same floor). I said that I don’t know if it would work out because that might only be offered in certain buildings. I also know if we lived in the same floor nothing would change from what it is now because she would constantly be in our room. \n\nAITA for not wanting to live with her while continuing to live with the other two?\n\nTL;DR I am friends with two of my roommates who I am living with, but we are not going to live with our fourth roommate who still wants to live with us. \n\n",

C) He doesn't trust me when I say getting a small tattoo on my lower arm is really not a big deal, and that my previous one was only inconvenient for like 10 minutes when I washed my hair. D) I'm being selfish planning something for only me when we're going somewhere together. E) He thinks that I tend to be somewhat impulsive and choose things based on aesthetics rather than pragmatics. This is not entirely false, to give him credit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him very much, but this fight is making me question myself a lot. I feel upset that I'm not \"allowed\" to do something, and feel like he wants me to babysit him 24/7 while we're overseas. He also hasn't come up with any things *he* wants to do, which means that I'm tasked with finding over a week of activities, for the two of us. And he doesn't want to go on a bunch of tours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not being satisfied just letting this go? It's moderately important to me, but I also feel guilty for bringing it up after he's said he's against it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I want to get a tattoo while abroad, SO is very against it.",

      "description": "Ok so I have two really close friends. One of them got a new GF and his behaviors drastically changed. He became flaky and unreliable combined with lack of interest in anything I had to say to him. His GF started making his career/education choices for him. This GF, in my opinion, does not appear to be a good choice for my friend. Having been friends with him for 15+ years I figured I wasn't just bullshitting around. He also lived with me for awhile but moved out very recently due to the following. Bring up how he never cleans up anything. I would talk to my other friend about the choices he was making. Expressing anger and frustration in his change of character and allowing to be manipulated by this new GF (they're engaged btw; they dated for 7 months; he's 24, she's 18). Well the friend I was complaining to decided to go behind my back and tell my friend getting married about all the things I was saying. Naturally he's not going to take that lightly. I also have no idea how he said it to him, but as it sits now neither one of them are talking to me. I found out this happened because for some strange reason they went and complained to my brother about me. MY BROTHER. Obviously he goes and tells me what happened. Now I simply want to know, was I in the wrong for complaining about the choices my best friend was making, because I felt they were wrong for him. Or is my friend in the wrong for betraying my trust and going behind my back to tell the other? Is this an attempt to start drama? Just let me know what you think guys, thanks.",

      "description": "Am at college right now. I'm not usually a complain-y person and am very low-maintenance. Usually I tolerate noise as I live in a cramped dorm and things get loud on the weekends and I get it.\n\nBut for the past few weeks my neighbors (whom I don't really talk to very often but are mutual friends) must have gotten a new speaker or something because they've been BLASTING music, to the point where it's almost shaking the walls. I put up with it for a bit because they're friends of friends and I didn't want to give them a hard time. But finals are rolling around and I couldn't focus (or really sleep for that matter, will get into that in a sec).\n\nLet me clarify: Quiet hours for us are 11pm on weekdays and 1am on weekends. Usually my neighbors will turn off their music around that time (give or take half an hour). But, along with not being able to focus, I find myself not being able to sleep with it on (even if I have earplugs in, it's THAT LOUD).\n\nLike a civil person I texted them and asked them to turn it down, they said sure, and apparently moved the speaker away from my wall, which helped a bit. But the next day the music was back on again.\n\nI realize I probably should have mentioned it again, but other people had started complaining about it (when I was talking to them) so I decided to message one of my RAs asking her to just talk to them about it. She said sure, the music soon stopped, and then the next day my good friend (read: not even them) came to me saying they're really mad at me.\n\nThey're mad apparently because a) they weren't playing their music during quiet hours (which is true) and b) because now the RAs are on their back when their room reeks of weed and has a ton of it in it.\n\nMy argument is that I didn't know about the weed and they shouldn't really be blasting music so loud it shakes the walls anyway. Am I the asshole for approaching my RA?",

      "description": "I have known this certain female for 8-9 years and we have always both had other romantic interests, but have always been good friends and get on like a house on fire.\n\nRecently (circa 18 months ago) we both found ourselves single and I drunkenly messaged her and we embarked on a sexual ‘relationship’. \n\nI was clear from the outset that I did not see the relationship progressing into anything other than ‘friends with benefits’ as the ‘spark’ was just not there, probably because of the fact that we were friends for years before.  She agreed with this.\n\nIn honesty, I suspected for some time the she harboured deeper feelings for me and wanted more in terms of a future, but have admittedly brushed it aside.\n\nI did however reiterate on several occasions my initial position about the future and direction of our ‘relationship’ and that I could not envisage that I would ever want to progress things.\n\nOn these occasions, she denied having further feelings and expressed she was happy with things as they were (basically with no commitment) and to see what the future held.\n\nRecently, she told me in a text messages that she loved me. When I confronted her about this she denied she was in love with me and said that she simply meant she was fond of me and loved me for how happy I make her.  \n\nI was not convinced by this, however, and told her that I was discontinuing our sexual relationship because I suspected that she was being dishonest about her true feelings and I did not want to mislead her and continue knowing that she truthfully wanted more.\n\nI suspect she was testing the water with saying she loved me to see my reaction.\n\nHer position is basically that she is a big girl and she has no ‘future plans’ so why cant things continue as they are in the present if we are both content and if it fizzes out in the future, so be it? She is against the abrupt end I have called and got upset.\n\nThe disagreement has led to an end to all contact between us, which I am unhappy about.\n\nTl;dr : I stopped sleeping with a regular casual sexual partner (who i was previously good friends with) because she told me she loved me and i suspect she wants more. We have now fallen out.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n",

      "description": "My younger brother and I don’t get along well. \n\nHe’s said some really hurtful things to me and my best friend and is always mean to my mom and I. \n\nHe really likes to start shit for no reason, like today I asked my mom, “Hey, is (brother) coming with us to the show tomorrow?”.\nShe said yes and I guess my body language gave it away, I kind of slouched and sighed. It really wasn’t on purpose, I was genuinely upset because I didn’t want to deal with him when it could be so much more fun without him tantrumming over nothing.\n\nHe saw me and said something like, “Oh, oh, you don’t want me to come? Huh? Don’t want me to come??” while getting right up in my face.\n\nI said this exactly - “No, because you aren’t being nice.” Then I backed away from him and went upstairs.\n\nHe blows up, screaming his stupid little head off and my parents both start on me as well.\n\nI don’t understand!!! My mom’s favourite thing to tell me is “Worry about yourself, just walk away”, but when I do it, everyone freaks out! My brother can get physical and I didn’t want to get into it. \n\nThe reason I said “No, because you’re not being nice” is because he honestly doesn’t understand how rude and mean he can be without being told. He will seriously bring up stuff he KNOWS hurts, like he’ll use my friends, school, even my cat who passed away against me and it really hurts! It’s stupid that an ignorant little kid can actually make my heart hurt, but he can. \n\nAITA?\n",

So we went Monday to Friday and on Monday after travelling all day I made food then jumped in the shower, so did hubby and we had a chilled night. Tuesday rolls round and it returns to business as usual going in the shower of a morning, there was a hot tub so sometimes of the evening too, to get the chorine out of my hair and then again in the morning. \n\nMy friend took a bath once and on the Wednesday and her boyfriend once Thursday, I even said if you guys want to use the shower in ours feel free thinking there wasn’t one over their bath. She said oh there is on in the bathroom I prefer a bath. (that I get, not for me but each to their own) \n\nAm I wrong in thinking this is scruffy, they don’t look very clean and tidy and over the years I think it has gotten worse. There were other things that I thought was strange but I was thinking is it a holiday thing like we weren’t doing much so was it so chilled that they were just going to stink it up for a few days being lazy? My husband said nope its gross. Then commented on them bringing snacks to keep in their room and not share? Like going into their room of a night and coming out with bags of sweets and not sharing. \n\nEverything we brought the shared shopping (proper food) and snacks that we had brought were just put in the kitchen, offered and shared same with the beers. I know I don’t have it in me to uposet her be saying anything but husband feels like he doesn’t really want to go away with them again.\n\nAm I the A for thinking I’d rather not going away with them again",

      "description": "Backstory, my friend and I have been close for a long time, since we were kids. After we graduated from high school we both went to our local college. I ended graduating but he ended up dropping out.\nNow my career isnt the most well paying job but it is a career i enjoy. While my friend now has been jumping from job to job, going through periods of unemployment. He does not have his own car so every now and again he asks me for rides and normally I say yes unless I'm working or busy.\nOne time when he asked me to drive him about 3 hours to go pick up his lady friend. After awhile i reluctantly said yes but on the condition that he pays for the gas. He agrees and we head out on our way.\nNote that my job doesn't pay very well so taking a 3 hour drive with no benefit for me isnt in my budget.\nLong story short he \"forgot\" his wallet so ended up paying for the trip and it took him almost a year to pay me back. And of course this made me very angry because the trip put me in a hole.\n\nFast forward to just the other day, me and couple of my other friends plan to go see a concert. My \"forgetful\" friend also says that he wants to go and we were all okay with it on the condition that he \"PAYS FOR HIS OWN TICKET\" \nWe all order our tickets online but my friend insists on paying at the door. We all knew where this was going. So we tell him again that none of us were going to pay for his ticket and that we not pay for him if he came up short.\nIts the day of the concert and we part ways with my friend so he can buy his ticket while we stand line to get in to the show.\n\n5 minutes later he comes back and says the magic words \"i forgot my wallet\".\n\n\"Well sorry, we told you that none of us would pay if you didn't have the money\"\n\nHe goes on for about 30 minutes begging for us to cover for him and that he would pay us back, but we all stood our ground. Of course he's not happy about it but hey i could barely afford the ticket myself. \nSo we end up leaving him outside for the whole 5 hour show and he wasn't happy. But the show was great though.\nI've talked to him since then but he's still mad about it.\n\nAITA for ditching my friend and not paying for his ticket?",

The girl was two years my junior, we were friends as kids, but grew apart, and she became an entitled jerk.\n\nCue Friday.\n\nThe college was hosting a party, and like in most colleges, with \\*redacted\\* being no exception, alot of us went ahead and got wasted.\n\nIt's honestly a blur, but i have some memory of great times being had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome Saturday, the day after a party. \n\nI get out of bed and grab a bite to eat.\n\nI notice there's a bit of a commotion in the hallway leading to one of the girl's rooms. \n\nI overhear something about one of the girls having had an 'accident'. So i move on, and as i leave the building i get pulled to the side by one of the teachers saying they found anon (16 year old college mate) asleep in the local graveyard (the poor kiddo had too much to drink) and as it turns out, he stole my 500ml vodka bottle from my room as i was sleeping.\n\nThis wound up taking more than an hour, with the principal of the college also being called, and basically threatening me, that because someone got my alcohol, i might have a chance of getting expelled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. I get to the house, and as i enter the room, there's this girl who i used to be friends with when we were young, but we grew apart, and at that time, was a jerk towards me.\n\nShe somewhat whispered to me as i entered \"throwawaymcbobbins what are you doing here? You're fat, ugly, and nobody likes you!\" \n\nTo which i reply (in a voice much louder than intended) \"Well, at least i don't piss the bed\".\n\nAll my friends in the room heard the remark, and burst out laughing.\n\nShe ran out crying, i felt sympathetic, but at the same time, felt it was a fair reply to what she'd said to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat incident still mildly irks me to this day, yet I've bumped into her on a few occasions afterwards, and we had decent little talks.\n\nI hope she's doing well in life.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I asked my guest to leave after telling her she could stay as long as she wanted?",
      "description": "A friend asked if we were free this past weekend for her to visit and stay with us. I am 8 months pregnant, fatigued, and we still have a lot to do to get ready for the baby. Initially, I told her honestly that no, we're too busy so maybe after the baby is here. She clarified that she was coming down to spend time with someone she had met online. She only needed to crash at our place two nights and only see us for one afternoon. That sounded doable to my husband and me so I told her she was welcome to stay at our place.\n\nAfter she arrived, I think she realized the guy she had been talking to wasn't really her cup of tea. However, it seemed she enjoyed her time with my husband and me and asked if she could stay longer. My natural propensity towards hospitality immediately led me to say that she was welcome to stay for as long as she wanted.\n\nSome incidences have occurred that have made me regret saying that:\n\n1. On the first afternoon, I treated her to somewhat pricey lunch, as she was our guest. However, for dinner, I paid our bill thinking she would give me the balance for her half later. I was surprised to hear her say \"oh, I should have gotten it. Thanks again!\"\n2. In the evening, my husband and I were resting quietly doing our own activities. However, she seemed to push watching a movie with us even though my husband was clearly watching something on TV. We ended up not doing that and she slept early.\n3. On the second day, since her guy works night shifts, it seemed like she expected to spend the day with us. So we drove to an interesting neighborhood with her for lunch and shopping. She ends up meeting up with the guy just for dinner so ultimately spends only a few hours with him before his work starts.\n4. My husband lent her an unlimited subway pass in case she and her guy needed to take the train more than once. When she got home, she said apologetically that she had lost it. She asked my husband how much was left, and he said two weeks. She said, \"oh no, I bought you another pass for one week. I'm sorry, these things happen.\" I felt miffed she didn't offer at least to pay for the other week.\n5. She has been battling a cold and I'm nervous being pregnant and having a lowered immune system.\n\nIn my mind, she's overstayed her welcome by not being considerate with our time and money. We feel pressure to entertain her (if we're on our laptops, she'll ask what we're doing/reading/looking at and pursue conversation) and she doesn't seem to care to spend time with the person she came down to see or make plans on her own. She also seems to keep adding days to her stay. My struggle is that I made the mistake of telling her she could stay as long as she needed. My husband says that I can't ask her to leave and it's not like she will stay forever. WIBTA if I did ask her to? I don't even know how I would phrase it.",

      "description": "A few weeks ago I ruined an amazing friendship with someone I greatly loved and admired. It was because of my unhealthy behavior entirely and I do take blame for that. Essentially, I struggle with mild drug abuse and it is my go to when I’m extremely anxious and depressed. For the last year or two I’ve had a great friend who was extremely supportive through all this. One night, while mixing alcohol and ambien to cope I mentally disconnected and walked to my friend’s house and just entered their home without their knowledge. This is a horrific thing I did and I feel profound remorse and guilt for it. They cut me out and we haven’t been friends since. \n\nNow we have three classes together at university, so I see them fairly often. We also live just two doors apart from each other. We agreed to act normal in person, and thus far we have. The other day we ended up just sitting and talking for half the day while we did school work in the lab. We had normal personal convos and shared shit. So that part has remained true. \n\nBut today I asked if we could have a smoke tomorrow and that I’d bum them one. They snapped and said “We are not friends. If playing chess is too familiar I will stop.” (Because we still play chess together on the phone). To which I just said “Jesus Christ. I know we aren’t friends. If anything Chess reinforces that. I wasn’t asking out of friendship or some shit so dont treat me like I’m some monster. I dont deserve that” Blah blah blah. They just said “So don’t ask to hang outside of a professional setting” I explained I just had a question to ask and I figured a smoke would be fine because its quick and we’ve smoked together a few times since we stopped being friends. \n\nBut then I followed up and asked for clarification on just how bad I fucked up (not worded in this way but essentially the same thing). Like we once actively expressed love for each other and we’re very caring and supportive of one another. I know what I did was bad and unhealthy, but I didn’t think it was enough to kill everything we ever shared and to fill them with enough hatred and anger that it killed the love and care we once shared. Is this an asshole thing to ask? They left me on read here and didn’t respond. But I’m thinking about asking again next time the chance permits in person. \n\nBut I just don’t know. I feel guilt, I know I fucked up, I know I’m unhealthy, but I dont think I deserve to be treated with the same level of hatred that they give to the people that have literally assaulted them in the past. So the level of guilt and pain I have isn’t to that level, but if they feel that what i did was that horrid then they deserve for me to know that. ",

      "description": "Hi, all. My bf (25) and I (26) have been together for 3 years. We live together and have a pretty solid relationship. We rarely fight, have the same interests, etc. and we are pretty open about a lot of things. I’m bisexual and will often point out cute girls I see. Sometimes we bond over it as we both like the same type of women. He does the same, he will point them out to me, too. However, we are only committed to each other. We have a monogamous relationship. I don’t easily become jealous or upset if he likes other girls’ pictures or anything, because I do the same. And to become upset about it would be hypocritical, I think. And I know he would never cheat on me. \n\nHowever, although we knew we both had a reddit, we never shared our usernames with each other (this one is a throwaway). Not that we were trying to hide it, it just never came up. But, a few months ago, he sent me a screenshot of a funny comment he made on somebody’s post, which gave me his username. I went to his page, not to snoop, but I genuinely wanted to see his other comments, as he is really funny and it was merely for my own entertainment. I wasn’t trying to find anything. However, about 75% of his comments were on other girls’ posts telling them how pretty they are, hot they are, asking for them to post more, etc. And it wasn’t exactly what he was saying that bothered me, but it was how much he was doing it. As I said before, we have pretty solid relationship, but sometimes I feel like he forgets to make me feel wanted. Our sex life is almost non-existent due to medications he’s on, so sometimes my self-esteem takes a hit. I don’t blame him one bit for that, but seeing those comments just made me a little sad, because I wish he would say those things to me. \n\nI confronted him about it by just bringing it up causally. I had said something along the lines of “I found your page..wished I kinda regret scrolling through your comments! Haha!” After I said that he told me how horrible he felt about it, and apologized a dozen times. He told me he realizes that he can get out of hand, and it’s disrespectful to me and he shouldn’t do that stuff. I told him that it was fine, that I just wasn’t expecting to see so much. He again apologized. And told me he should be making me feel good, not strangers. And apologized for lacking in that department with me. A few days later I went back (I know, I shouldn’t have) and noticed ALL of the comments were gone. This was about 3 months ago and today for the first time since then I went back to look (don’t know why. It’s stupid of me) and he has barely commented on any posts in general. And I feel bad because I feel like I may have made him feel so guilty that he stopped using reddit in general. AITA? ",

      "description": "I’m a 25 year old woman, and I grew up as an only child. My parents split when I was 6 years old. My mom never dated, with the exception of briefly getting back together with an ex boyfriend who was living with us when I was around 8 years old. My mom is now 69 years old. \n\nI don’t have a very solid memory of my childhood. I remember certain days or events, but not much. What I do remember from him living with us is not so great though. I remember him yelling at me and my friends pretty frequently over things that didn’t really warrant yelling. \n\nFor example, a friend and I were jumping around having fun in the living room and he told us to stop and we didn’t (because we were 8) and he spilled his coffee in the kitchen across the house and went nuclear on us for it. Claimed it was our fault that it spilled.\n\nAnother time he was yelling at me (don’t remember why) and I went into my room and locked the door and he followed me and kicked my door in (permanently breaking the lock) so he could keep yelling. \n\nBecause of these incidences I’ve pretty much decided how I feel about him. I never really talked about them in much detail with my mom because when he moved out he went to a different state. \n\nNow, I’ve moved out and live across the country. She called me out of the blue one day and told me they were back together. I voiced my concerns and shared my memories and tried to tell her that it made me uncomfortable. \n\nShe said she doesn’t remember those things happening, but that we could talk more the next time we see each other in person. \n\nNow we’re on vacation with our entire family and one of the first things I noticed when I arrived is that my mom is wearing a wedding band. I had to confront her about it and she assured me that it’s just a commitment ring. He asked her to marry him and when she said she had been married before and wasn’t really wanting to do it again, he backtracked and said he didn’t really want to get married either. \n\nI brought up my memories again, and tried to tell her how I felt without making a stink. I basically said that I can be happy for her, but that I’m not sure I want to have any sort of relationship with him myself. \n\nAt this point, she brought up the possibility that my memories are “false memories,” which concerns me because, as her only child, I want my mom to believe me and care about my feelings. \n\nShe mentioned that she spoke with him about what I told her, and he said “hopefully as adults we can work it out,” but he has not attempted to contact me in any way. \n\nNow our family members are coming up to me raving about how happy they are for her and after confiding in one of them about my experiences and having her completely brush it off, I just answer with “she doesn’t talk to me about it” to anyone else who says anything. \n\nI just can’t help but have a seriously bad feeling about this whole thing, and everyone seems to be acting like I’m in the wrong and like my experiences with him from my childhood don’t matter. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "For a little context, I don’t use FB at all. I have an account but I have not logged into in over a couple of years. My friend invited me to her bday party over FB, and didn’t decide to text me about it until 2 days before. During this time I was petsitting for two different owners as well as preparing for finals so the last minute invite took a toll on me since I didn’t want to just not go. \nTo make matters worse, one of the cats that I was taking care of has diabetes and AIDS. For a couple of days, I would walk into the house and find throw up in different spots of the house. The third day that I saw the throw up, I had a talk with the owner and we decided that I’d stay there to make sure it wasn’t the diabetic cat that was throwing up since it’d be a serious issue. \n\n\n\nWell, that day happened to be the day of my friend’s bday party which was in the middle of the day. So due to this issue, I texted her and let her know what was going on as well telling her that I’d definitely make it up to her another day. \nWell, since then she’s ignored two of my texts that was me apologizing and asking me to make it up to her. I don’t know if it’s just the hormones that she’s taking that’s making her this way or if I actually fucked up somehow. I just need different perspectives because I can’t see her perspective in this situation at all. I don’t want to lose her friendship but I also don’t want to keep texting her apologizing for something that I had no control over. \n\nTl;dr: I ended up not being able to go to my friend’s birthday party for what I think was a pretty good reason. However, she’s ignored my texts and hasn’t reached out to me in weeks and I don’t know what else I can do to fix this",

      "description": "TL;DR: I think my FWB might be catching feelings after talking about him moving in for sudden financial reasons. \n\nDetails:\n\nMy landlord informed me over Christmas that since my current roommate is moving out, she wants to start renting out the whole place together instead of the two bedrooms separately. She gave me my 30 day notice to choose if I want the whole place or to move out. It is very expensive where we live. It was not fun to hear after splurging a little more this year on gifts and travel for the holidays.\n\nI don’t have any other friends who are looking to move, I like my current place, and I’m tired of living with strangers.\n\nWell, I told him about my situation and I already knew he didn’t like where he was staying (on a couch.. like I said, expensive). He has been working a new job for the last few months though and we started talking about it. I did view 8 or 10 places and see hundreds more online. There were a few places that caught my eye but nothing that would be better for a price I was happy with.\n\nSince then, I am starting to think he might be catching feelings for me. Just little things like a certain joke or putting his hand on my back while walking somewhere. Nothing serious though. We texted today that yes, he’s gonna move in here. Month to month leases for both of us. He texted me a little later saying he has a gift. \n\nI know some guys don’t like talking about feelings or would maybe be afraid to bring it up. Do I have a responsibility to ask him directly if he likes me? And if he does like me, does that mean I have a moral obligation to not, I dunno, let him get attached? I know I’m not going to want a relationship. I am planning to move out after the upcoming semester is over and I will be able to work full time, and I can look at a slightly higher price range. He knows this is short term. \n\nWhat do you think, Reddit? AITA?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I’ve never had an easy relationship with them- they are several years younger than me. Because of other reasons, there was an extended period of time where we didn’t speak, a number of years ago.\n\nWe’ve very slowly reconciled over the last few years and after my boyfriend proposed to me, I suggested asking them to be bridesmaids as another way of bridging our relationship with his sisters. So we did. This was several years ago.\n\nThe wedding is in the next 6 months. Over the last few months, our relationship with his family has really deteriorated. FH’s grandpa refuses to talk to me and on occasion has completely ignored me (but won’t tell anyone what I did to piss him off. It’s been like this for about 6 years). \n\nIssue 1) FH’s sisters have said if Grandpa isn’t invited to the wedding they wouldn’t come either. After many tantrums and FH’s enabler parents getting involved, Grandpa is now invited. (Not what we want.)\n\nIssue 2) Bridesmaid 1 recently obtained an unofficial boyfriend. 6 weeks ago. She asked if he could be her date to the WHOLE day. We said no (don’t know the guy) but he could come to the evening. She cried and behaved extremely rudely and disrespectfully. Again FH’s parents come into it and suddenly unofficial boyfriend is now somehow invited to the whole day. (Again not what we want).\n\nI feel I have zero control over my own wedding. Neither of the two bridesmaids have been any kind of supportive of helpful. They don’t want to come on my bachelorette party. \n\nI can’t stand to be near them right now. I am not speaking to either of them. As far as I’m concerned they were given a great opportunity and have totally thrown it back in our faces. \n\nFH isn’t keen to de-bridesmaid them because WW3 will kick off. I’m at the point where I empathise (as shitty as this is for me, they’re his family and it’s ultimately shittier for him), but actually I don’t want to spend my wedding with people I can’t stand that have zero respect for us. I’ve put huge amounts of effort in over many years and it is not reciprocated in anyway. \n\nI’ve missed out a lot of detail because I’m frightened of being identifiable. Please assume that throughout all of this they have cried, made unreasonable demands, had a horrifying sense of entitlement, and been downright rude, difficult and disrespectful.\n\nI really appreciate any advice- if IATA please help me to move forward from this without feeling shitty on my wedding day.",

We get along great and I genuinely love to chill with them. But recently I've developed feelings for their partner, strong feelings. I don't want to be /that/ guy and spill my heart out and make everything uncomfortable but hanging out with them just bums me out these days. So I'm thinking of coming clean, and cutting ties with them. I feel like that's the better alternative than me turning bitter and jealous and resenting either or both of them. ",

      "description": "My long-term partner and I just moved to another country. We want to get married within the next year for visa reasons (and because we also just want to). \n\nNeither of us want a “real” wedding. We don’t want to spend the money, we don’t want the stress, we hate being the centre of attention —we just...don’t want any of it. We want to go to the courthouse and have a quick ceremony, just us and a witness.\n\nBefore we came to our new country, my mom and grandparents made it clear they would really like to be a part of our wedding if we get married. I told them I didn’t think we would really have a wedding, we just wanted to elope or have a very simple ceremony by ourselves, but they insisted that they didn’t care how simple it was, they wanted to know when because they will fly out for it. \n\nI’m touched that they care this much but my partner and I kind of just want to do our thing and announce it after. The trouble is that if my mom is coming, I have to ask my dad if he wants to come too, and my parents aren’t on the best terms. Then if my dad is coming he’ll want to bring his wife, who detests my mom and whose presence I could do without. My partner has similar qualms about telling his mom — then he would have to invite his aunt (they live together), etc. It’s complicated and we didn’t really want to deal with any of it in the first place. \n\nAlso, even though they insist they want to come, it feels stupid to me for my family to spend $2,500 on round-trip flights for a 10-min no-frills ceremony, especially my elderly grandparents who are not supposed to be on long-haul flights (though they could solve this through an extended layover). \n\nI love my family and the last thing I want is to hurt them or make them feel excluded. I am also an only child and an only grandchild on that side which puts a lot of pressure on me. \n\nWhat my partner and I are leaning towards doing is having our quick, simple ceremony with just the two of us and announcing it after the fact. We will tell our families we can celebrate with a reception-like party next time we are back home for a visit. Unfortunately my grandparents will counter that by saying “we might be dead by then!” And I can’t exactly refute that. \n\nI know that’s a lot to process but.....am I being a selfish asshole? ",

      "description": "Yesterday while I was in a phone call with my girlfriend (LDR), while she was at her college cafeteria, I heard a man's voice asking very politely as if they've known each other for a while (on a first name basis) if he could sit down next to her. After an exchange of words, she stammered, and after a while, she declined. After this, I asked her who this mysterious person was and she told me his name. Being in a long distance relationship, I expected to at least know who she speaks to, for my own insecurities sake. After finding out I had no idea who this guy was, and finding out that they've been talking one on one for a while during school, I flipped out on her. So, the next day, after getting in another phone call, instead of asking how my day was, or just asking about my well being in general, she asks, why do men have urinals. This makes me really angry, so I yell at her about the guy. I yelled repeatedly, why did she do this (not telling me about the guy) and I wondered why she hid the guy from me for so long. ",

Because she doenst dare to go in every rollercoaster she asked me and my SIL to come with them. \n\nWe got to the park 10 min after openingtime so it was not really busy. Before we would go deep into the park we decided to go the the restroom so we were ready to go to the rollercoasters. \n\nThere were two restrooms at the beginning of the park wich were both pretty small. Mens restroom had 2 places to sit and one too stand. The standing one was right next to the sink for washing hands. I think the women’s restroom was the same size maybe a little bigger.\n\nSo my girlfriend and SIL go into the women’s restroom and my BIL and me go into the men ofcourse\n\nWe had no line at the men’s restroom and there was a line of 3 women at the women’s restroom.\n\nAs soon as i walk into the men’s restroom a woman walks out. Wich i thought was odd since there wasnt a big line at the women’s. BIL goes to the standing one and i choose the seated ( i always pee seated dunno why) \n\nI was done and there was another woman who came in when i got out and one was washing her hands at the sink. Right next to my BIL! \n\nI then said to my BIL pretty loud: yo Daniel (his name) I wonder how the women will react if we just marched into their restroom?!\n\nMy SIL heard this ( she was waiting in the line by the women’s restroom) and litteraly started screaming at me: “Wtf you can’t say that! You should really behave! Fuck off!”\n\nI got mad and said that so was a bitch for screaming at me for no reason. Me and my BIL were really uncoformtable with all these women in such a small place where we were peeing.\n\nAITA for saying that?\n\nTL;DR: said loudly to BIL wich the women in our men’s restroom heard: “Wonder what the reaction would be if we just marched into the women’s restroom.” ",

Slowly, however, i started to socialize, branch out and hang out in a bunch of different circles, and, one thing lead to another and i ended up trying weed one night while at a friends house. I get what i did was wrong, and I know that i got a good forewarning, seeing on how my girlfriend constantly threatened that if i ever did she’d break up with me, but what happened afterward was well, in my eyes, complete betrayal. I would have respected it if she kept it between us, but she didnt. She gave me a choice. either I tell my parents, or she does, and of course feeling threatened and scared, i shamefully tell my dad over the phone. I understand that its my fault for trying it, and shes told me many of times (well after the fact) that its my fault, and that if i didnt wanna tell my parents i shouldnt have done it, but I still feel like what she did was very wrong. Im still with her and i still really like her, but she basically blackmailed me into outing myself to my parents, (luckily just my dad as he understood my youthful idiocy and didnt inform my mother) and made me lose my circle of friends that i finally socialized and did things with. i feel like i have a right to experiment and try things i want to try, and i also feel like it was out of her bounds to tell my parents like that. Im fine with an ESH or YTA but i just want some clarification. Am i the asshole here reddit?",

      "description": "So, my younger brother and I both lived with our dad until about two years ago, when he and our dad had a massive blow-up about something, and he went to live with our mum. I'm not precisely sure what the argument was about, but I've gotten the idea that it was something relatively minor or to do with normal parenting (?) from some passing things that have been mentioned by mum and dad, and occasionally my brother. Dad and mum do not get along, at all. They had a messy separation.\n\nMy brother refuses to meet, talk to, or answer the messages from dad in order to talk out the issue. Dad keeps sending him expensive gifts on his birthday and Christmas, and my brother refuses to thank him, refuse the gifts, or talk out the issue (if he finds there is one) with sending the gifts. From what mum has said, my brother refuses to talk about the issue with her, and he refuses to listen to her when she says that he should respond, or thank, or refuse, or talk it out with dad. Dad's bad relationship with mum has contributed, because they can't even speak to each other without having a massive argument, and dad blames mum somewhat for what amounts to, in his eyes, harbouring my brother, instead of forcibly sending him back to my dad. In dad's eyes, I'm basically the only avenue of communication, at this point. Dad has been getting desperate, and sometimes he gets upset and shouts and demands I go and speak to my brother about how he's in the wrong and being childish, and how dad just cares about him and wants what is best, and we get into arguments over it.\n\nI keep telling him no, because I think that would put me between the two of them in the argument, and I don't want to be the go-between for an argument that obviously has them both very emotional, that I don't think I'm equipped to mediate due to how terrible I am at dealing with emotional problems, and that doesn't involve me. Privately, I do think that, regardless of whatever the original quarrel was, it wasn't significant enough to warrant two years of no contact. However, I'm not close enough to my brother to get his whole side of it. Regardless, I don't think it's my place to get between them.\n\nTLDR; AITA for not wanting to be the go-between for a catastrophised familial argument that I am unequipped to mediate and that doesn't involve me, despite the distress it's causing my dad?",

She has always been a **very** high maintance friend. Always complaining, getting mad for nonsense or acting like our mother.  Once she got mad for not being able to go to her house for which is a 1 hour drive to get to and she has also yelled at me because I electrocuted myself trying to charge my phone (I guess she was worried but that isn't a reason to yelled at me for like 2 minutes straight). She can be very agressive when it comes to different opinions and if she gets mad at you, you better be a psychic cause she won' tell you. I've had to bring her back to earth multiple times because of tinder dates or once hooking up with a guy in a relationship.\n\nAlthough, I've shared amazing moments with her. I've brought her to family trips, we've had tons of sleepovers and shared a lot of \"teen\" moments. Sometimes I feel like I'm being a fake friend but, even thought she makes me go through a hard time most of the time, I still love spending time with her.  She is also very sad about leaving to another country but I'm not, or at least I'm not as sad as I thought I'd be. \n\nI don't know if this happens to everyone or if I'm being a fake friend, but I just think our relationship can grow healthier and happier if we're far away from each other. We still talk every other day and I get excited to hear what she is seeing and doing. She has also tried to videocall me but for some reason I don't feel like it. I wanted to know what you thought about this because I don't have a unbiased friend to talk to about this, so thanks for taking the time to read this :)\n\n(Sorry again if I make no sense, I struggle with writing.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA (18F) for not sending pictures to my boyfriend (18M)?",
      "description": "Hey.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were on the phone today, and asked me for a picture (sexy/suggestive picture, but not a nude). I did send him (only) one last week, and that was it. I surprised myself, because I typically don’t like to show that much skin, or take suggestive pictures. I’ve been self-conscious about my body for years, but he wanted to see. He really liked it, and it made me happy that he liked it. But he wanted another one. I wasn’t exactly keen for sending another, because then he would be expecting daily pictures, and I thought the first time would just be a nice thing. \n\nI told him that I didn’t feel comfortable sending it, and that I’m insecure about my body. He kept pressing for a further explanation when I told him that and attempted to comfort me, say how he loves me, I’m his girlfriend, that I look really pretty and amazing etc. This continued for about 1.5 hours. I asked if he was mad at me, and he said that he wasn’t angry at me, but angry that he wasted his fine and, I quote, “literally got nothing out of it.” \n\nI felt awful because I don’t like making people sad, but I’m sure he was trying to manipulate me to a certain extent. I really do love him, but this isn’t the only way to express your love. \n\nI told him again that I simply didn’t want to send one, and the cycle repeats. Eventually I started crying (although I don’t think he noticed, I tend to be good at hiding it). He asked me one last time if I was going to send him a picture. I said no. He (finally) accepted my answer, and that he won’t ask me anymore until I decide I want to send it. \n\nI had to end the call due to dinner plans, so the end went like this:\n\nHe said, “have fun” \nI said, “yea, I’ll try.” \n“What do you mean ‘you’ll try’? Please don’t be sad.” \n“Too late, I already am” \n“Sorry for making you sad, I really am. I shouldn't have even said that..It was my fault” \n“It’s okay” \n“No, I don't want you sad. But I don't know what to do. What should I do?” \n“Not your fault that I’m insecure about my body, I can’t really explain it, I’ve just been that way for years. But, I think just please give me some time” \n“You look amazing. But that’s just my opinion. Ok sorry, I will give you some time now. I love you, please, have fun honey” \n\nHe has asked me for nudes before, but I clearly set my boundaries and did not let them down, and he respected that, so I feel this should not be much different. But still, it was only just a picture, maybe I was too bitchy and overreacted? I did speak in a normal tone throughout. But, other than this, our communication and transparency with each other is very strong, so I’m not stressed that it will hurt the relationship. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend asked me for pictures over the phone and I refused-I clearly explained why and expressed why I was uncomfortable, but he kept pressing for further explanations and “why”. Took him awhile to accept my answer, but I feel that I could’ve handled this better.",

      "title": "AITA For suggesting we go to a vegan restaurant?",
      "description": "So I've been vegan ever since I could cook for myself, coming up to 13 years now, nearly 14. I'm a bit of a foodie, I love going out to eat and seeing what new up and coming veg options there are because it's 2019 - times are changing and I'm living for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 25th birthday is coming up soon. My mum created a group chat on Facebook that was family and about 20 of my closest friends so we could discuss some birthday plans. We all (most of us anyway, it's a lot of people to get in one place at one time) decided on a date fairly easily, and when it came down to venues etc, I was asked where I wanted to go. There's a new vegan restaurant in my city that I haven't been to yet. They've got veggie steaks, chicken, roast mock meat, pretty much anything you'd get at a fancy restaurant, but vegan. And it's cheap, maybe $30 for a meal and a drink. You'd be looking at $50+ anywhere else. So being the food obsessed being I am, I suggested it. I tried to sell it a bit, linked the menu to everybody and pointed out the diversity of it and that there was something for everyone - even people with allergies and intolerances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMum called me up seconds later and yelled at me for not being inclusive of everybody, and that I needed to pick somewhere else. I asked what she meant about being inclusive, and she screamed down the phone that I was being insensitive and nobody wanted to eat my \"rabbit food bullshit.\" I told her anybody can eat vegan food, and she babbled on a bit more and gave me three options for my birthday - two of which were steakhouses, and the last option being a restaurant with nothing vegan on the menu except a quinoa salad. And honestly, if I wanted a quinoa salad I'd make it, not buy it for $28. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me I can forget the idea of having a vegan cake - they were going to make a \"normal one\", and then buy me a cupcake from the local vegan bakery and stick a candle in it while everyone else had \"normal\" food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 Family members and 9 friends left the group chat too, right after complaining about my suggestion??? Honestly, I feel sick to my stomach. It feels like my own birthday has been taken away from me, and nobody's respecting my boundaries. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, but the fact that all these people have taken an aversion to this event has me doubting everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Vegan wants vegan food on her birthday.

      "description": "So I have a male friend (I'm female) that I was close friends with for over three years.  I help him through his first breakup and depression, and later he says he was thinking of killing himself if it wasnt for me. We get even closer and get to the point where he says he loves me and wants to date me about 6 months later, of being best friends. Now I liked him so much as well, but the timing was really bad for me, so I said i couldn't then, and we both promise that we will still be good friends, because we matter to each other as human beings. After this is when i start to realize it was my fault. He started a new job and had a full courseload at school, and got really really busy after this point, I am fine with that of course, but when he would talk to me it just felt like he didn't care anymore, and i felt so used, and like our previous friendship didnt matter (when in reality i still loved him, and was probably having a really hard time adjusting to not being romantic anymore, and I know he was too).  \n\n\n I started getting upset, and would ask him if i had done something wrong, and that i felt like he was fading away, and didnt care about me or our friendship, and he would respond less and less, as this went down over the course of a week due to sparadic replies. He said that he felt like i was always upset with him, and it made him not want to reply, which made me more upset, and that he was just having a hard time and was shutting down. And thats fine, but he really didnt feel like he cared, and would reply less and less, and i ended up telling him that \"if we are still going to be friends, we need to talk in person.\" he said okay, and we didn't speak for 2 months  \n\n\nAfter this, I see him in person, and take him aside to talk. He says that he just didn't think i wanted to talk anymore, (respecting my wishes i guess) and that he HAD really valued our friendship, and was okay with trying again. But again, it was like there was no warmth or connection at all, not what you would even feel with a friend :( like he was doing it to be polite. So i invited him to the movies with our friend group later that month, and he bailed due to tests, and we went to see him later that day, talked for a bit and left, but again, it was like we were strangers. I talked to him over message, and told him i still liked him, and he told me he didn't like me at all anymore, but that it would be okay.  \n\n\ni waited a few days, and asked him if he wanted to play a game with me online.  \n\n\nHe just never responded, or to any of my 4 messages after.   \nA month later he said he could talk to me at a event we go to in three months after i send him one last message asking to talk.  \n\n\nTLDR:  \nClose guy friend and I like each other, it doesn't happen, our friendship after romance is hard for me, and i think i screwed everything up and lost a close friend because i pressured him to still be friends. :(  \nAm I the asshole here? Is this my fault :( ",

They have torn up the grass at the end of our front lawn from driving/ parking on it and also stuck their mailbox on our property. \n\nA few days ago they started to bury their electrical lines/ telephone lines and had to dig up the front of our driveway to get to the telephone pole in our front yard. No big deal, as long as they fix it. They kind of did, they threw dirt over top and called it a day. Now there is an inverted speedbumb and dirt is everywhere. Our driveway is gravel and now that's gone. They also leaned scaffolding on our fence and it's leaning in from the weight. \n\nToday we wrote them a letter asking them to respect our property after months of them driving on our grass and parking on the end of our lawn. It was respectful. We said we're happy with what they're doing with their property but just ask that they respect ours. \n\nAnyways, AITA?",

(example: he wanted to get 2 glofish. i had to tell him they're schooling fish and have specific requirements.) i'm the one with the water chemistry tests and fish forums and bloodworms and daphnia and the spreadsheets of eating habits and everything. I've always picked the fish and the only reason i put a tank in the loft was so people could enjoy my fish. he said all the fish i pick are ugly and blah blah.\n\ni didn't say anything, but once we were in the car, he started to yell at me because he said he could tell i was unhappy. i didn't respond, which made him angrier. he dropped me off at home and said he didn't like my energy and left.\n\ni guess i didn't realize he wanted us to pick a fish together. my mom said he was excited and i feel bad. but i also feel like it wasn't right for him to straight up tell me i wasn't allowed to have the fish i wanted when i'm the only one who cares about fish or ever takes care of them. \n\nidk.

The first time she caught me, she kind of made a joke about it since the girl was white and said \"Are you trying to satisfy your fantasy?\" And \"I guess you settled for me\". She caught me watching porn again yesterday and it was a white girl again. She just started crying. My immediate reaction was laughter. I said \"Would you rather all the porn I watched be of black girls, why do you care if they're white? And she explained that she thinks I desire features she doesn't have and never can. I told her she was being a bit of a baby, because she was crying about something that wasn't that serious. After that, she just walked away crying. I did feel bad and apologized. I tried explaining me watching porn of white girls has nothing to do with preference or anything like that. She's one of the most gorgeous girls I've seen, and I love her. I just watch a lot of porn and don't care what race people are, lol. She still seems hurt about the situation though",

      "description": " So “Mark” was one of my good friends in high school, though we’ve drifted apart since. I went to university far from home while he went to university in our home city. He started dating a guy named “Alex.” I hung out with Mark and Alex occasionally when I was back for holidays. They end up living together, and as far as I could tell, it was a caring and functional relationship.\n\nAfter several years, they broke up. I didn’t know Alex that well, but we are facebook friends and over the years since the breakup I’ve seen plenty of posts about Alex’s struggles with mental health and allusions to past trauma and abuse. I get the impression that he had previous issues with mental health that became worse with an abusive relationship, though he didn’t name anyone.\n\nThen recently Alex made a private post that doesn't go into much detail but names Mark as having abused Alex sexually and emotionally during their relationship. He goes on to say that Mark also abused several other people, and he threatens to start tagging people who remain friends with Mark.\n\nI don’t doubt that Alex has been hurting, but I don’t know the details of what happened and it doesn’t feel right to block / cut off a friend without knowing more or hearing from them. However, at this point we all live far away from each other and I don’t really keep in contact with either of them. AITA if I don’t do anything right now? If I’m ever in town with Mark or he started making contact I’d want to know more, but as it is I feel like I’m not actually a part of either of their lives so I’m inclined to just mind my own business, but maybe that’s just cowardice since I don’t know how to evaluate the accusations and judge my friend.",

We broke up August  of last year and ended up stop talking to each other altogether at the end of the following October.\n\n\nMy ex recently came out as being a bisexual. This surprised me as she never even hinted towards the fact that she was even as the such. It bothered the absolute crap out of me to know if it was something she had kept a secret from me or not. Not long after I found out, I messaged her asking when she knew this was who she was. Long story short, she was hostile throughout the whole conversation and she ended up saying that she knew for sure for the last 3 years at least.\n\n\nShe said that it wasn't my business, and honestly I wouldn't have pushed so hard if it were with someone that I didn't have so much history with. She also said that the reason she didn't say anything was because I would've made her feel bad. Now I'm not going to sit here and say I was a perfect angel, because I wasn't. It was both of our first relationship and we both made our fair share of mistakes. For the first couple of years, we did make each other feel bad about who we were, but I at least thought it got a lot better towards the end of it all.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to know if my ex-girlfriend was bisexual during our relationship?

      "description": "Warning: it's long. I also apologize for the format since I'm on my phone and have spent several days trying to type this out. \n\nFor some context, I (22f) and my husband (24m) have been married for almost 4 years now, and together for 7. His cousin (25f) *was* my best friend in HS and is the whole reason we met.\n\nThis is where I probably should provide some backstory. Her parents were already older when they married and had her, so she grew up surrounded by hospitals and medical problems and never really had a childhood. She's an only child who was basically raised to care for her parents from the start, while battling many medical issues herself (she had scoliosis as a kid and it caused permanent nerve damage and she has rods in her back). Going to college was the only chance she ever had at an escape, and even that was ripped from her after her first year when her father was diagnosed with cancer. \n\nA few years later my husband and I found out that she and her father (her mother was in a nursing home at this point as her dimentia worsened and she stopped allowing help) were in a rough spot financially so we decided, since we were able, that we would take the opportunity to help out. A month later her father (my husband's uncle) passed away. \n\nUpon news of his passing, her landlord immediately evicted her from the only home she's known, leaving her only 30 days to gather all of her things by herself while her hoarding mother is screaming in her ear about every gadget and knick-knack she should save. My husband and I immediately took her in to our home as at this point we're her only living family and he feels responsible for her. \n\nThis is where it gets tricky. As previously mentioned, she's older than both of us, yet has absolutely 0 actual life skills. In the past year and a half she has lived with us, we have become her parents, while she barely lifts a finger. We coerced her into getting her first ever real job working maybe 15~ hours a week (we don't need her money, we're just trying to do what we can to get her on her feet), made her get her driver's permit (that she \"loses\" every time we ask if she wants to drive so she demands we drive her), and cover absolutely all of her living expenses except for her phone. I do her laundry unwillingly as she mixes it in our basket, wash all of the dishes, and do generally every single bit of the household cleaning, minus changing her cat's litter box as I'm allergic to them (I have photo evidence of huge piles of poop just sitting and rotting on the carpet in \"her\" room). We also buy all of the groceries and do all of the cooking for 3 grown adults.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to leave? We've sat her down before and tried to talk about her helping out, and she started crying about how much her life sucks and generally acts like it's our responsibility to fix.\n\nTLDR; crappy roommate/cousin/best friend walks all over me but has a super sucky life so I feel guilty \n",

We were having a good time, she was getting along well with everyone until I noticed that Jess had been drinking constantly throughout the night and was getting drunker and drunker by the second. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot really wanting to expose her in such a state to my friends, I decided I'd take her home, but she managed to slip away and I couldn't find her for a while before Tom found me and said Jess was throwing up in the bathroom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so embarrassed seeing my drunk girlfriend emptying her guts in the toilet, while my ex-girlfriend, Mandy was holding her hair back, both covered in vomit, while Tom, another few friends were also covered in her vomit. When Jess was better, I dropped her at her older sister's place (her parents would kill her if she came home drunk) and went home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon awkwardly asking my friends what they thought of Jess, they said they didn't care if I stayed with her, but they didn't want to be around her in situations with alcohol. However, they believe I've \"downgraded\" considering my new girlfriend ruined the night for a bunch of people while she was drunk, while my old girlfriend held her hair back as she practically threw up all over her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get that what happened with Jess was embarrassing, but she apologized to me and said that she was nervous to meet them so she thought alcohol would help, but obviously went too far, and promised it wouldn't happen again. Still, after what my friends said, I'm thinking that staying with her in spite of that might be a dick move. So, WIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: new girlfriend threw up on friends because she got so drunk because she was nervous to meet them, friends don't want to be around her, and claim I've downgraded.

The doctors recommended they wait until 16 weeks to see if there was improvement before making any decisions. The 16 week scan revealed that things had gotten much worse instead of better. The doctors are pretty clear at this point that they do not believe this baby will survive birth. My friends continue to get scans every two weeks which keep painting progressively worse outcomes for their baby.\n\nUltimately they decide to ignore the medical advice and continue with the pregnancy in the hope that everything will work out. They did not consider abortion due to religious beliefs.\n\nThe baby did manage to survive birth but predictably passed away naturally as life support would only prolong the inevitable for this baby.\n\nAs a father myself, I cannot comprehend putting my partner through a full term pregnancy and birth while also having to support my daughter as she witnesses her three day old brother die. On top of that having many medical and funeral expenses which I can't afford. The doctors were crystal clear, this baby would not survive.\n\nThe invitation to the funeral included a sentence about preferring donations instead of flowers to presumably cover medical and funeral costs as my friend is not well off by any means.\n\nI could have gotten the day off work unpaid to attend but chose not to and instead of donating I wrote them a card and made some sweet treats for their 3 year old daughter.\n\nAITA for not attending the funeral and helping with medical/funeral costs?",

      "description": "I usually use Uber but it was a long wait and there was a taxi driving by so I waived him down and my friend and I got in. I'm only a 6-8 min drive away that usually results in a ~$6 taxi but I did what I usually do and offered the driver $10 flat. I do this because most drivers resent such a short fare so I ensure that they know they'll be getting a good tip. Well, the driver puts out his hand and I (stupidly) think he's trying to give me a high five so I oblige him but then he demands I give him the $10 before we move which has never happened before. \n\nI was a bit taken back so I said nevermind, just turn on the meter. He tells us to get out of the cab. I was shocked but ready to get out when my friend just throws him a tenner and says lets go. During the short ride, I find the Blueline number and as I'm getting out, lodge a complaint. I get passed around a few different customer service agents but one tells me that drivers are within their right to demand payment up front. I asked, without knowing where we're going or what the meter will read in the end, how do you know how much to demand up front? No answer and no explanation why for the first time in my 20 years of taxing taxis (never owned a car), I was suddenly subject to paying up front for a service yet to be rendered. I definitely felt like my complaint fell on deaf ears so it just seems to me like the traditional taxi services are not willing to adapt/innovate compared to Uber. Anyways, I never asked him to keep the meter off, just that I'd be giving him $10 for the short ride and it's actually against the law for him to take a passenger with the meter off, so I feel like he's definitely in the wrong but I posted this identical story on another sub and got roasted... so, AITA?

      "description": "So for some context I’m a 16 year old guy with pretty extreme social anxiety. My first hour is Spanish, and I basically have no friends in it except for one to two people I’m slightly acquainted with. Anyways I’m kinda nervous because today we are supposed to learn how to do the salsa, and that spikes my anxiety. I walk in, and go to sit alone. Our teacher starts talking, and actually gets my hopes up because she says she knows we don’t all want to dance, and gives us three options.\n\n1: work on a worksheet\n2:learn the dance\n3:talk in Spanish \n\nI pick option one, and get to work. The rest of the class basically picks the dance, and I’m left alone doing the worksheet, which I’m totally cool with. I finish pretty quickly, and start working on AP chem instead. My teacher notices and gets upset, saying I should work on Spanish instead. She also asks me why I’m so shy and reserved, I just say idk. She says I have to stop being so quiet. I say ok, what can I do?\n\nShe asks me to do a slideshow for her showing many variations on the salsa. She says she will Show it to the class on Monday. I’m already nervous cuz I don’t want anybody in my class to think I’m a suck up or anything, but I figure whatever and finish it in class and send the presentation to her. I was already kind of annoyed by that but then at the end of class she announces that the people who picked each option will be teaching the other options there part.\n\nSo basically the salsa people teach the people who didn’t do it how to do it, and the worksheet people have to teach the others what it’s about (so basically just me and like one or two other kids). I don’t like this because I get nervous in front of a lot of people, so I’m already kind of in a bad mood. I’m also afraid she’s going to single me out in front of everyone to do the stupid salsa dance.\n\nSo AITA for being upset with my Spanish teacher? Am I taking it too far or am I right in my thoughts?",

      "description": "Sorry, I'm not quite sure hoe I should have named this post, but that was the best I could come up with.\n\nAnyways, for some background, I met this guy in my first year of high school and our first interaction didn't give me the best impression of him. Let's call him Shane, for simplicity. Shane was in my P.E. class as a freshmen, and that was the extent of it for a good while. That was until I heard through the grapevine that he was tangled up with two of my other friends, John and Mary.\n\nJohn and Mary had been a couple since the 5th grade, or at least that's what I'd heard; so they had been dating for over three years at that point in life where relationships last three weeks. I heard through John that Shane had been telling everyone that Mary had sent him a handful of nude pictures and a video message of her moaning and calling gout his name on Skype. That was something that Mary would never do, and John felt the same way, but It rocked their relationship none the less. He wanted to believe his GF, but asked me and a couple others to see if we could see the pictures for ourselves. Shane was more than happy to brag to us, and show them to us and whoever was in the pictures it clearly wasn't Mary. Mary then asked me to talk to Shane in the one class I had with him to try and make him stop spreading this obviously fake rumor around. I really felt bad that something so shitty happened to them, so I agreed.\n\nI found Shane the next day before class started and I tried asking him to stop, because the girl in the pictures clearly wasn't Mary, and he shouldn't be showing nudes around claim she was. He got furiously mad at me, almost comically so. He tried making some threatening gestures, leaning over me (As he was taller than me), and warning that he'd beat me up if said he was a lair. A friend of mine, Mike, overheard what was going on and tried vouching for my character that I wasn't a lair (Super nice of him to do BTW. he didn't have to step in on my behalf) Long story short, he threatened to beat up both of us and stormed off. \n\nThe problem resolved itself after about a week and John and Mary are still going strong all these years later. Regardless, towards the tail end of that year, rumors started going around that Shane had assaulted a girl at school. I know how back the games of Telephone work in a high school, so I tried getting the general Idea for multiple people I trusted. All the common threads said that he had (somehow) forced one of the girl's in our school's mentally handicapped class to send him nudes. I didn't see him again the rest of that year, or the one after that. I though he'd been expelled or something.\n\nBut in the middle of my Junior year of high school at lunchtime, I suddenly saw him and a girl standing right outside of the classroom I eat my food in. Shane immediately came over and talked to me. He profusely apologized for how he treated me before, and said he was so sorry for all the trouble he put John and Mary through and all the nasty things he said. He claimed to have seen a therapist and gone through a year of anger management, and moved to a new school. Because I'm never one to start a fight IRL, i just accepted it and let him talk. Shane introduced me to his new girlfriend Abby, and offered me his Snapchat and Instagram to chat on sometime. I took it without question. He seemed so genuinely sorry for what he did, so why wouldn't I at least accept it?\n\nOut of some sort of obligation, I added him and just texted a 'Hello, this is ~~BLANK~~ from Mr. Armo's room\". He very quickly started a conversation, and I actually found out that he had some similar tastes in show, movies, game and the lot. I actually started to enjoy talking to him after a while, he really did seem to have changed. He got me into fitness, and some weight loss, and was actually very supportive about it. But that all changed when he just went dark for a year or so, and I didn't hear a thing from him for that time. \n\nThat is until recently when he started texting me again. Instantly he started talking about his break up with the girl Abby that I had met in passing that time before. I tried being a good shoulder to cry on, telling him that it'll all be fine, and that he shouldn't get so down about a high school relationship. But things got wierd. He started talking about Abby like she had planed this break up from the start, saying that she manipulated him and used him like a puppet on a string. He said that she had been playing him while sleeping with two other guys behind his back, and lied to him; telling Shane that her parents knew about their relationship. It sounded off to me, but then he said that she had called the police on him, and she had told him to kill himself. Advice he had apparently tried taking.\n\nI was horrified that these things had apparently happened to him, and tried by best to try and be a good friend for him in this troubling time. But as the week went on, he started getting weirder and weirder about it, and started obsessing about Abby's actions. He started adding to his story and kept saying that he'd die just to be with her again, even though she had apparently ruined his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's when I realized that in my senior year, I actually had a class with this girl. I was curious about it, as the things that Shane had told me had grown more and more outlandish. I confronted Abby one afternoon and asked her about her relationship with Shane. She was more than happy to tell a story similar to the one Shane had, but with the details different. She had slept with two other boys, but only after Shane had insisted they have an open relationship (after he was caught sleeping with another woman). She had used him for money, but only because he insisted on paying for literally everything, regardless of if she wanted to pay for herself or not. And she had called the police on him, but only after she had broken up with him and he had made threats of breaking into her house and raping her. \n\nI was disgusted, obviously. From the very beginning I had thought his story was suspect, and after what she told me and showed me; there was no denying that Shane was either flat-out lying for sympathy, or was delusional. I texted him one last time, saying that I wasn't judging him for his actions, but I couldn't speak to him anymore. And I deleted his Instagram. But, he still had my Snapchat. Shane began texting me there, demanding to know why I would stop talking to him. I explained in every way I could that after all the things he had done to me, my friends, and those two girls over the years, I just couldn't anymore. We texted back and forth for nearly a half an hour, him very fast and angry, calling me 'fake', and saying that Abby was slandering him and his good name and caught me in her web. That she was manipulating me. After dozens of messages; I said that I wished him the best of luck on getting the help he needed, and said that I believed through the good times we had together, that he could become a better person eventually.\n\nHe said he didn't need help, that the pills weren't working, and that the therapists' never listened (So much for what he told me that day he gave me his info) and said that I was making shit up just because he had depression. I threatened to take screenshots of our messages and take them to his police officer uncle and have me and the girl Abby arrested for \"Slander\" and \"Verbal Harassment\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brain tells me that I should be confident that I did the right thing by blocking him and unfriending him. But I need to know, as it's been clawing at me; Am I the Asshole here? I butted in on a relationship that I wasn't a part of, and brought up his past actions that he said he had already made amends for, I just don't know.",

      "description": "My husband is very sweet and kind. He seems to care about me very much. However, throughout our 5 years of marriage I have given up a lot so that he could do what he wanted, including changing my career, moving across the country, and losing a lot of friendships I held dear for years, not taking care of my disabled mother... He has not done anything of that magnitude for me and considers it a sacrifice on his part just to do the dishes at night. We were briefly sort of separated a year ago while I worked on a different state and I hate to say it, but I preferred being alone and speaking to him on the phone only. \n\nI feel a strange, sad resentment when I consider that this is just the beginning of our relationship. Forever is a long time. \n\nOn top of that, I've had a lot of men interested in me over the past few months, including a guy I'd been friends with for years whom I've grown to care for in a different way. The sexual attraction I'd long lost for my husband was rekindled for my friend. I'm not a cheater, though. At least I dont want to be.\n\nI'm finally in a position where I can support myself without any assistance. I want to leave him and be my own person. But I dont know if this resentment or boredom (whatever you want to call it) is enough. It's not that I dont love my husband... it's that I'm not convinced he understands what love is... or that I really feel happy in the bounds of marriage in general. I dont want to lose him as a friend but I dont want to be married. \n\nSo. Am i the asshole?",

Sam's not our in-house counsel, but we called him in recently because we're undergoing a merger and he's a mergers &amp; acquisitions expert. Today was his wedding. Beforehand, I told him I'm still keeping him on-call because something important *might* happen, but it's unlikely and 99% I wouldn't be needing to call him. \n\nAnd like I said, it was 99% likely the day would go down with nothing important happening. But unfortunately, that 1% chance came through, and we had an emergency. I won't get too much into the actual legal aspects of it, except just to say it was a *really* big emergency. So I called Sam.\n\nHe was understandably pissed off at first. I still expected him to make some calls and talk to the other company we're merging with, but at first he refused. I told him I understood he was pissed off, but it is his job. He still refused, and I told him I'd let him go if he didn't get on the fucking phone with the other company right now. \n\nHe was really angry, but did it and fixed the emergency. Later, I called him to tell him I was sorry for interrupting his wedding and that he did a great job, but when he picked up, he just called me a huge asshole.\n\nAm I? I mean, I don't think I am, since I told him there would a chance, however miniscule, of something going down and just asked him to do the job I'm paying him to do.",

      "description": "Mobile formatting, English is not my first English, all that bullshit.\n\nI can’t... I just can’t anymore.\nSo, I used to be really close friends with A and B, still am.  The first year, we were all cool, and the second year, (this year) A and B started dating. I have no problem with them dating, but what pisses me off the most is that it just seems like they don’t care about me anymore. Like before, we used to all be one friend group, and we would all get the same amount of attention. B then, this year, it was like they just started to care about each other and completely ignore me.  Like, I’m no attention whore, but then at least respond to my fucking question when I ask you where to eat and stop making out in front of me.\n\nEvery single time we went out, A would start crying for whatever reason, and B would tell me to just go away when she comforted A, and I just wasn’t supposed to participate in any conversation until A stopped crying, but they wouldn’t even let me know whatever the fuck A was sad about, and I was just expected to sit there and think about whatever the fuck I did wrong this time.\n\nThat was when I met C. C was the definition of perfection. She was always there for me, and would actually give me attention whenever we went out, She was nice, really kind to me and whenever I had a mental breakdown, she would always understand how I feel. She was the girl of my dreams, and I soon developed a crush on her, therefore, I started hanging out more and more with her. I foolishly told A and B since they were still my best fiends at that time. \n\nThen D. D isn’t really related to this story, but then A and B dragged D in too so I might just as well tell you her story too. I wasn’t really close with D last year, it was only this year that I finally became close friends with her and really knew her. Turns out, she had a really bad teacher who would constantly bully her. A was her best friend, but since she started dating B she started ignoring people around her, causing D to have no one to turn to. This year, the dating got even more worse, and since she trusted me, I felt obliged to stay with her.\n\nThat’s when all the shit started. One day, A made a snarky comment about how I apparently valued romance over friends and that comment really pissed me off since bitch, what the fuck are you talking about? I value romance over friends? And you don’t? Plus, C already found a boyfriend at that time. (Yes, ouch) I hang out with her since I enjoy her company more than yours. But then I thought, just one comment isn’t gonna ruin our what’s left of our friendship. I’m just gonna let this slide.\n\nAnd then, one day she texts me. \nA: Don’t ignore B.\nM: ???\nA: Don’t always go to C and D and leave B alone. Think of B. Notice B more. Play with B more.\nM: I’m sorry...?\nA: Don’t always say sorry. Do something to prove you mean it.\nM: Do you guys want to do something tonight then?\nA: No.  Do you think something good has happened if I’m saying no?\nM: What happened?\nA: Don’t ask.\nM: Can I help with anything then?\nA: No.\n\nAnd I’m just like bitch what do you want me to do, you told me to care about B more yet you won’t give me the details so I know what is going on and how I can help? Plus, C and D both need my fucking attention more than you do. C was going though a lot of shit at the time and D was is a problematic relationship. So I quickly texted C about this whole situation, and she told me to just put on a mask;pretend like everything’s fine, and just give B more attention. I’m really guilty, as she has been there for me a lot of the times and this time, no matter how much I want to, I still can’t be there for her. I’m sorry for making her go through all this shit.\n\nI’m mad at A and B cause I feel like a healthy friendship is supposed to be mutual attention, you can’t expect to give nothing but just receive attention and get mad when it doesn’t; honey, I’m sorry to tell you, but the world doesn’t work like that. But, I’m also a bit guilty as I’ve never gotten that mad at them and I feel like maybe that’s just not how friends are supposed to be. Plus, I do admit that I’ve changed a lot and I know that A has been feeling sad for a while now because of how much I changed. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago but it came up again recently, so I'm curious to get some outside perspective. If this sounds like petty drama, it totally is, but I'm working on being less oblivious in social situations so I'm willing to accept a judgement as TA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my best friends since middle school, Leah, got married to her high school sweetheart in November and I was a bridesmaid. Obviously over the years our friend group has changed, but a group of four of us from high school – me, Leah and Tom and John – has stayed very close, with me, Leah and Tom attending the same college and even being housemates for a while. Another one of our old friends, Jess, also went to our same high school and college, but she drifted away from the rest of us. All of us, including Jess, were at the wedding, and me and Tom were in the wedding party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some context, Jess and Leah were best friends for a long time, even before I met them. I always clicked better with Leah, but I was also friends with Jess because we were in the same clubs, classes and friend groups. We kind of clashed though, and Jess always felt I was \"stealing\" Leah away from her. By the time college rolled around, there was some bad blood between us (though we were always civil with each other) and I was fine with letting her drift away. She also drifted from Leah, but a couple years ago they reconnected a bit, though they aren't nearly as close as they once were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where the potential asshole-ness comes in. At the wedding, I was at a table with Tom and John, plus my SO and a few others I didn't know. Jess was at a table with her parents and other old family friends, but she came over to our table a lot to socialize. At one point, she requested a group picture with all of us plus the bride and we agreed. A bit later, Tom, John, my SO and I grabbed drinks from the bar and noticed there was a beautiful sunset, so we asked the photographer, who was nearby, to snap a quick photo of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little after that, Jess came back to the table and asked if we had taken a photo together. Tom said \"No\" and I followed with \"What? Yes we did.\" Sometimes in the past we would lie to Jess about hanging out or doing things without her because she is sensitive, but I always thought was super assholeish to her. I didn't catch on that's what we were doing again. We all ended up taking a photo later in the evening, but Tom and I got in a little argument about it and maintains I should have lied because I, and him by extension him came across as TA since we took one without her. I said we're not in high school anymore and she knows she's not as close to the rest of us anymore so it shouldn't matter. So...AITA?",

      "description": "My (19F) Friend (20M) and I became friends in middle school when I one day asked if he was okay. I had realised that he seemed overly happy for him to truly be okay so I asked and he opened up to me about his family issues. A lot of people in my grade at that time knew about my Mother leaving so it lead to a lot of people feeling like I could relate to their family problems. \n\nThis Friend of mine over time developed anxiety and I could tell. His parent was strongly against therapy and left me basically to be the only one hearing him out and helping his problems. I would be there to reassure him constantly for the 7 years of our friendship. \n\nI had the last straw with him when I found out he was in contact with 2 girls who had the goal of ruining my social life. One In middle school who was successful for a few months until I found better friends and one in high school who wasn’t much of a success as I didn’t care for her. By ruin my social life I truly mean spreading rumours that had 0 truth. \n\nOther things he did were things such as calling me “used” cause I had sex with a few guys. \n\nI’m a very VERY loyal person to the point that if my Best Friend tells me about smth someone did to them. I’d most likely cut off that someone. ESPECIALLy if the someone was trying to ruin my friend’s social life. \n\nNow. A few weeks ago I was speaking to a guy who is friends with the Best Friend (20M) I cut off. I had just dealt with my Brother attempting suicide all while I had the biggest final exam at my second year of university. In the past I had also dealt with a Friend who consistently had mental health issues but would not seek help and instead would blame me for a lot of her emotions such as why I was friends with her friends even though we were a trio. Anyways. I was ranting to the best friends Friend about how I felt that individuals who suffer from mental health are extremely selfish. I completely understood that it wasn’t the individuals fault as they’re suffering but their actions tended to lead to selfish behaviour. I have consistently put my own mental health as a bottom priority and propped people up when needed and asked for. \n\nAlso all while I was dealing with a suicidal Brother, he never reached out to ask if I was okay. \n\nSo. Am I the asshole for cutting off a Friend ? Or are my expectations of a Friend somewhat unrealistic ? ",

      "description": " \n\nSeveral years ago, I purchased for my sister a very expensive dog to comfort her during her battle with cancer. Sadly, her cancer became terminal about two months ago and she died last week. Last month she went into hospice care and my brother went over to her house and took the dog. At the time, this seemed ok because someone had to look after it temporarily, but now he's planning on keeping the dog. Here is the issue: my sister's daughter, now an orphan, wants the dog and I agree she should have it. I don't think my sister would have ever let him take the dog if he'd told her he was going to keep it and I'm certain she would want her daughter to have the dog. My niece did not initially take the dog because she lives several states away in an apartment but in a few months she will be living in a house. I think the best thing for both the dog and my niece is for my niece to have the dog when she gets a house. She is a responsible girl and the dog is one of her last things on this earth that she has to remember her mom by.  My brother has been like some kind of Disney villain - taunting my niece and telling her he'll never give it back and it loves him the most now. He was not even very close or nice to our sister, even as she was dying of cancer and I now realize taking the dog in the first place wasn't any kind of generosity to help a dying woman - it was an opportunistic dog-napping. Frankly, I am disgusted by his heartlessness. Anyways, at the funeral, I was eulogizing my sister and complimenting our other family members on their kindness to each other and my sister but when it came to mentioning my brother I just looked at him and the only non-profane words I could muster to describe him were \"my brother, the dog thief.\" Thankfully, everyone laughed and it brought a brief smile to my niece. I've talked to some friends and they are divided on who should get the dog so now I'm reflecting on the situation and wondering AITA for calling my brother a dog thief at my sisters funeral.",

      "description": "A little insight: I (21m) and my little sister(19F) live together in our parents apartment due to my parents moving abroad because of my parents work. I'm in uni and she is in her last year of high school. We don't have to pay for rent, utilities or internet since our parents want us both to get an education not needing to worry about financials. \n\n We both get the same amount of money from my parents for groceries and overall living. It isn't a lot of money, but you get by easily. Now the difference is that she has all her lunches and  trainings paid while I have to pay for my own since i get a small scholarship every month and do odd jobs sometimes which earns me a little extra income while she doesn't do anything for extra money. \n\nQue the problem, I buy most of the groceries, and I do shopping 1-3 times a week where I buy about 2-3x more stuff than her. Okay I must admit that I eat more at home than her(to save money), but a lot of the stuff we both eat is still bought by me. \n\nShe says that on Tuesdays she has more time so she goes does \"big shopping\" then. However whenever she does do this she buys the cheapest and the minimal amount of stuff and on the following days asks for me to buy extra food.\n\nWhenever I confront her about this she says \"oh I need to save money\" however she has been going to dinners with her friends and recently bought an Iphone X(she got some discounts to it, but still cost a lot for her and she is in debt to my dad for it). \n\n",

      "description": "So yesterday, my sister, let's call her Lana, and I got a Switch for Christmas. Along with this console, we got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Edition and Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate. This morning, we were playing a game of Smash.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to play Smash, and this means that we I am a lot better at it than her. I also had it on 3ds, meaning that I was very familiar with it. The last time she had played a game of Smash Brothers was Brawl when we had a Wii. She didn't really enjoy playing that game either.\n\nWe were playing a few games when the incident happened. I had been winning for the past few rounds, and she had gotten visibly angered. Lana blamed her lack of winning on the fact that I was getting a lot of items. In the moment, she actually said that I was \"stealing\" the items and taking them from her. I had never actually thought of it in that way, as I was just acting on my instinctual knowledge of the game. I tell her that I was not stealing the items, but just picking them up. I got infuriated that she did not blame herself for her own lack of skill, but me. This meant that I probably didn't say it as kindly as I could have.  This did not cheer her mood.\n\nWe play at least 1 more game, and of course, I win. She then puts down the joycon, and walks out of the room. As Lana walks out, she says to me \"just play by yourself.\"\n\nAm I the asshole?",

There have also been a few instances of me definitely being an asshole and switching back and forth between wanting to continue the relationship and wanting to stop. \n\nShe’s recently moved to another state for university, and while she’s been away I’ve thought about our relationship a bit. I don’t feel sexually attracted to her anymore, and I feel that it is in everyone’s best interests if the relationship ends. However, when I tried to have that conversation with her she became really upset, and the conversation got fairly heated. \n\nShe’s said that I’ve humiliated her and that she feels as though I’ve “had enough” and have “discarded” her. She feels as though I’ve used her for sex and that now that she’s left I’m done with her. I still want to be friends, but I can’t keep doing anything past that. I’ve tried to explain to her that I just don’t feel that way about her anymore and that I think it needs to end, but she’s still very upset.  \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throw away.\n\nI'm a mom with a 3 month old and a 2 year old.  \n\nPrior to giving birth, I was hospitalized with pre term labor.  I was in the hospital for over a month and then released for several weeks before my little one was born.  During this time my family was super helpful with my 2 year old.  My mom and sister took her when my D(ear)H had to work.\n\nI gave birth and everyone disappeared.  \n\nBackground: after my first was born, my mom was at my house every few days for a few months.  Then she babysat her one day a week.  She has spent loads of time with her.  My sister also visited several times.  Everyone came over, aunties, uncles, grandparents, cousins.  When my sister had kids (she has 3), I made a point to go to her house and do dishes, let her shower, play with older kids.  I tried to be present and helpful.  I did this once a week (3 times a month at least) for an extended period of time.  My mom was also there at least every few days for months.  So we have a pattern of behavior here.  \n\nUntil now.\n\nAlso, my mom has recently (in the last year and a half) gotten involved in a national organization, runs a chapter, it keeps her pretty busy so she is most often doing stuff for that instead of coming to see me now.\n\nMy mom has only come a handful of times since the baby was born.  When she comes it's for less than an hour usually.  She had asked me to drive out to her on multiple occasions.  She lives about 40 minutes from me, which is a lot of driving for the littles, but I've done it a few times.  She is always hinting that I should come over.  I'm an overwhelmed new mom who feels like I can barely shower.  My house is a mess.  My baby has horrendous acid reflux.  I'm thinking WTF?!\n\nI have tried to keep asking for help to a minimum in light of all the help I got before the baby was born.  But when I do ask, it's not worth the effort or I can't count on others being there.\n\nI asked my mom to come over to check on me when DH had to go back to work the first day I was home with both of them alone.  I asked a week in advance.  My mom assured me it was no problem, then called me at 3:30 saying she was still in her PJs and waiting for a package to be delivered.  How was I??  I got off the phone ASAP because I didn't want to break down in tears.  The day had gone well but I was super angry.\n\nI asked them all (mom and sister) to come over to help me get ready for my oldest's birthday party (after they declined watching my oldest so we could construct her present).  They said they would be at least a few hours early.  My sister had gone to see my mom and stayed the night before, had an event in the morning that was over by 9-10, so they baked cookies!!!  And came over about 45 minutes before the party was supposed to start with cookies for everyone!!!  I was a mess.  \n\nMy mom has gone to see my sister (I live 40 minutes away, she lives over an hour from my mom) at least as many times as me in the time since I gave birth.  \n\nI'm jealous.  I'm also frustrated.  I am also super pissed that my children don't rank high enough on her calendar for a visit.  She cares more about some stupid organization.  I'm happy she found something she loves, but she won't schedule time with me and I hate it.  I want to tell her we won't see her unless she schedules it ahead and for longer than an hour.\n\nWIBTA if I confronted my mom with this frustration?  Or an I being childish?\n\nMy DH just says it won't do any good and just don't rely on her/them.  But I'm really hurt.\n\nPS... Typing all this out, it seems obvious.  However, I'm wondering if I'm being immature and childish.\n\nTL/DR:  I'm frustrated my mom is not visiting my newest baby as much as she has her other grandchildren and pissed that she is not keeping her word when she says she will come.\n\n",

She rationalised it by it being her choice so it’s ok and I was complacent. I ended up waking up in her bed the next morning but nothing happened. \n\nWe have mutual friends, so spent a lot of time around each other because of that. At one point we were walking back from a group event alone and she kissed me again, she admitted that she liked me and pressured me to admit that I liked her. This was true, I was just trying to keep to myself and making a poor job of it. \n\nThis same thing happened a few times but nothing ever happened. \n\nUntil one night we were drunk at an event and argued about the situation and how I didn’t want to be a home wrecker. She told me that I shouldn’t feel bad because she’s putting more on the line by wanting me. We both got upset, I went back in to the event and drank more. \n\nThat evening, after a few more drinks she came on to me again. Somehow she justified spending the evening together because it’s unlikely we’ll see each other again so it was like “goodbye”. We ended up at my place and slept together. Of course I wanted this, but my thinking brain lost it’s ability to stop it happening.\n\nIn retrospect, I can’t live with myself for it and it’s fucking me up.

      "description": "I am 26 F. My brother is 7. I have no children of my own by choice. I don't want kids, I don't like kids. I love my little brother from a far. That's the best I can do. My mom gets overwhelmed by him. She's a SAHM. My dad works. They are both in their 50's. \n\nI don't think I have any obligations to them, or my brother. It sucks that they're in this situation, but they chose to have children at their advanced age despite the risks. So really, that's a them problem. Why should the decisions they willingly made when I was already grown have an effect on my life at all? \n\nI know that might sound harsh, but they never did me any favors. I'm not equipped to deal with any children, let alone a special needs child, which is why I'm not having children, so I don't think it's fair that they try to guilt me into trying to minimize the consequences of their actions. \n\nReally, I'm not fit to be around this boy. He starts making these obnoxious noises and I seriously have to restrain myself from acting impulsively. There have been several times when he has physically attacked me and I don't know how to deal with that. I don't want to hurt him, but it enrages me so I just lock him in his room until my parents come back. I think that's a better alternative than beating the absolute brakes off him, which is my inclination. \n\nYes, I'm awful. I shouldn't be around children. No responsible parent should ask me to babysit. I rest my case.",

      "description": "So my girlfriend (21/F) and I (23/M) had been dating for 2 years with a 2 month break in the middle because of a lot of shit going on in my life which she accepts and we’ve both moved on. \n\nEverything was great until a month or so of getting back together when she started to question me about everything, make me feel bad for going out to see friends, made me ask permission before I do literally anything like clean instead of calling her or being at her house. I felt trapped and then the arguments started. If I said that something bothered me then a full blown argument would erupt as to how I’m wrong and she’s right. It’s like trying to punch down a brick wall, it hurts and it doesn’t work. \n\nThe arguments and frustration got so bad that I punched a hole in my wall (stupid I know) and kicked her out so she would go home and leave me alone to cool off because that’s one of her favourite things to do would be to follow me if I need to cool off for a minute. \n\nIt was a brand new argument every week and to be honest I started to expect them they were getting so frequent. I asked her many times during this period to seek help and try to talk through her emotions but she did nothing. \n\nBecause she did nothing I left and she started seeing a psycho-therapist a couple of times a week. We have been apart for a couple of months now and she’s proclaiming how she’s now better and wants to get back together. When it was good, it was amazing but I still see the person who did all that stuff to me so I’ve said no. \n\nShe’s tried so hard to better herself and I didn’t get back into a relationship with her, does this make me an asshole?",

Let's get that out of the way. I live in smalltown-middle of nowhere. Everyone knows what happens to anyone at any given time. Kinda like one of the towns in a Hallmark movie where city girl meets small town boy.\n\nOver the weekend there was a car accident involving two kids. These two kids are the ones everyone knows, but not everyone *actually* knows personally. \n\nHere's how it starts. My friends know them pretty well, and were blowing up the groupchat about this, and that's fine, I understand they're worried, but I don't know guys well so I refrain from saying anything. I ask if they anyone knows what caused it, because we had some snow last week and there was a little ice on the roads yet. Someone replied saying that they were allegedly high. They were also (confirmed) to be on Snapchat while driving (friend was Snapping them while in the car). At this point I just say \"oh\" and keep to myself and start thinking \"It's these guys, they probably were driving high.\" Now at this point I am thinking \"Sucks to be in an accident but they were on Snapchat and possibly high while driving, so, while they didn't deserve it, they're generally nice guys from the few interactions I've had with them, they learned a lesson.\" Now I don't feel super bad about this, because, it *is* their fault for recklessly driving. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, sorry for being all over the place. I'm not the best at structuring paragraphs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- I don't feel super empathetic for some guys from my school were (allegedly) high while driving and using Snapchat. I don't hate/despise them, I just think they learned a lesson they needed to. AITA?",

      "description": "I've dealt with depression for 7 years now, I basically just bareknuckle brawled my way through it for most of that time. That was until a few months ago (I was 18 at the time). I had to take some sort of psych test and an interview for a job. In the interview the person I was talking to said that I scored a little high and wanted me to head to Boise to take a more in depth test. So I came home told my parents and told them when I was headed down (we live in Oregon). My mom had shopping to do and my dad was checking out a new car so they came with me. They dropped me off where I was supposed to take another test. It didn't take too long to get in and take it. After that was done a therapist called me into his office and gave me different ranges for how severe somebody's depression was. He said severe was considered 90-110 and I had scored a 120+, he then proceeded to tell me he would not recommend me for the job. Not only that but he recommended me to start therapy and medication. After all this I left the building and called my mom to tell her I was ready for her to pick me up. When they showed up I told them about my issues. This is the first time my parents had heard anything about it, and my dad kept trying to convince me I was fine for the next few hours as my mom still had shopping to do. That night I drove home in the new car while my parents took my dad's truck home. When we got home we had yet another several hour discussion about where I was in life. And my dad seemed to finally accept what was going on.\n\nFast forward a few months, im now 19, I have a full time job and i had started therapy (which I was paying for). It was helping a bit but it wasn't changing how I was feeling for the most part. So i set up an appointment with a doctor so i could see if i needed meds. When i went in I told the doctor what was going on he asked me some question and told me he was going to start me off on a low dose of citalopram, from there he slowly worked me up through the weeks until we found a dosage that helped. Throughout this process I didn't tell me parents, not because I was intentionally leaving them in the dark but I had moved out and was paying for all of this myself. At some point I was staying at their house for the night and I brought a bottle of my pills so I wouldn't miss a day. My dad came across the bottle and went didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. In the morning my mom asked me about the pills and I brought her up to date on what was going on but ever since then my dad has talked to me less and when he does he talks to me like I'm completely unwelcome anywhere near him. Did i do something wrong here? Am I the Asshole?\n\nSorry if the format is odd I'm typing this on my phone",

I’ll admit, sometimes i get told I can be “too friendly,” but I don’t think I was being flirty with him at all. \n\nThis wasn’t an issue where he was filing a report for harassment or anything, but he pretty much told another coworker that he thinks I like him, and that “she’s cute, but I have a girlfriend.” \n\nWhen my coworker told me about this, I felt like if I stopped being friendly it would seem like I did like him and was mad about the gf, but it also bothered me too much to let it go.

He also mentioned how I was always giggly with him, and yes but I laugh at EVERYTHING, not just with him. I calmly denied it and apologized if he thought I was coming on to him.  He pretty much rolled his eyes, and went, “yeah, okay,” in a sarcastic tone. \n\nI was annoyed, bc to me it seemed like he was trying to act like hot shit, so I just told him I didn’t even find him attractive, and might’ve made unnecessary comments about his height. He pretty much told me to fuck off, and my manager found out about all of this. \n\nNow this is where I felt like the asshole, because i had been there longer, my manager automatically sided with me, and there was a small instance where she insinuated she might fire or transfer, even though I was the one who made the mean comments. \n\nOne of my other coworkers said I was an asshole, and commented on how tough he must have it, seeing as he just started. Up until this point, I felt like ESH but AITA??\n\nAlso reading this back to myself, I feel like the whole situation is extremely childish, but I don’t know how to go about it. ",

      "description": "Basically, there was this girl (let's call her Tiffany) in my art class that I considered a friend, she and I were connected through three other people, were in a group chat together, had hung out a few times, and had worked together until I quit. She, in my opinion, was creative but lacked in drawing ability, but I kept this to myself until we were setting up schedules for our senior year of high school. I was invited, face to face, by my art teacher to take AP Art during my senior year if I wanted to, but, as it was going to be a new class, she didn't know what it would be like. She told me specifically that she only wanted to pick people that she thought would pass, as she wasn't going to be the one to grade it, but the school board was. She explained to me that it wouldn't be much of a learning experience, but more so a class to build a portfolio for art school. I planned on going to a medical school for psychology, so I ended up declining.\n\nTiffany, who was *not* invited to take AP Art, kept bringing it up how much she would like to take AP Art and that it was her dream to go to art school. I don't want to lie to people and push their hopes too high, so I just kind of told her that it sounded like a cool idea and that I hoped it works out for her. For the next two weeks, she proceeded to talk to our art teacher, whom I'm actually close with, about AP Art and if she would be able to take it next year. Our art teacher, at first, tried to spare her feelings and told her that Art 3 would be a lot more fun and that she should take it instead, but Tiffany insisted that she wanted to take AP Art each time, only for our teacher to ask her to bring in some art that she could see and decide if she could. Tiffany never would bring in the art she promised, but always tried to show off her mostly empty sketchbook (besides a few unfinished anime heads and bodies with no good sense of anatomy), to which our art teacher said wasn't really enough to really tell whether or not she was ready. Our art teacher and I both knew she really wasn't, and so she just pushed her to take Art 3 instead.\n\nTiffany would then try to talk to me about how stupid our teacher was and that she *deserved* to be in AP Art. Eventually, I got sick of her complaining, and I got mean. She called our teacher a terrible artist with no sense or talent, and I snapped and told Tiffany that her art was lackluster and that if our teacher felt that she wasn't ready to take AP Art, then she probably wasn't. Tiffany, and suddenly a couple of our mutual friends, started getting distant. I'll get into that in another post, but in this scenario, was I the asshole?",

      "description": "Background, I am 28M married to my wife (29F) for 3 years. She has worked as a legal secretary for a law firm in our city for some time, and they are now offering her tuition reimbursement for law school. This would obviously be great for her earning potential, but it throws a wrench into our life plans, the main one being that we were planning to start trying for a baby soon.\n\nMy wife and I are both ready for a baby, and we are pretty much right there at the pivotal moment of the timeline we had discussed several times throughout our relationship/marriage. But obviously law school is very difficult under the best of circumstances and it seems absolutely out of the question that she would get pregnant/raise a newborn while trying to go through this rigorous schooling. As a result, she wants to postpone starting our family until she gets her degree.\n\nAITA for being absolutely opposed to this? All of our friends have kids in preschool and going into elementary school already. I don't want our child to have no friends because they are so much younger than our friends' kids. But that is a small worry in comparison to potential fertility issues. My wife is almost 30 already and I know that is a ticking clock. I'm also worried that we'll end up with a ton of additional debt and nothing to show for it if her employer doesn't actually pay (for example if she doesn't get good enough grades.) Right now, we're comfortable and financially ready to support ourselves and a baby. We have a good amount of money saved up and honestly we don't *need* her to become an attorney. Her job is really good enough as it is. I just worry that she's going to end up leaving our life goals in the dust because she's trying to climb that ladder.",

      "description": "My husband and I get along really well. We’re very alike in most ways. One of the only times we disagree is when there’s some kind of event I say we are supposed to go to. Neither of us are very good at being social. \n\nWe don’t really have any friends we hang out with. He‘s somewhat friends with a couple people at work, but he doesn’t hang out with them outside of work, and a he sometimes plays xbox online with a guy he used to work with, and the only people I am close to and really spend much time with are him, our 8yo daughter, and my 15yo sister. \n\nSo with all that sort of explained, my husband really dislikes social situations, they make him exhausted trying to pretend to get along with people and just feeling awkward the whole time. My family though, has a get together at my grandma’s whenever anyone has a birthday, it doesn’t matter how old they are, so there are parties every month or two. The cousins and aunts and uncles are all there hanging out and we usually go off in another room and sit since it gets so crowded in the kitchen/living room area. We usually only say maybe 10 words to other people and we mostly just talk to my sister. It usually ends up being a 2-3 hour ordeal with eating, then gifts, and then cake. \n\nSo now there’s another party this afternoon, I’m at work right now, and my husband texted me and said he’s not in the mood and it’s stressing him out the more he thinks about it, so it’s an automatic no from him. He’s said no before and so he’d drop me and our daughter off (driving gives me serious anxiety), but I hate having to explain why he isn’t there. He says he doesn’t care what they think, but I do. So I always have to make excuses like he’s tired or doesn’t feel great. I’d try to explain to my family but I feel like they’d just think he’s a jerk or something, because they wouldn’t understand, even though they all know that we don’t talk much to other people when we’re there anyway. Honestly I don’t really want to be there either, but I feel like I have to. \n\nSo am I an asshole for trying to get him to go to these things with me? Should I just give up I worrying about what they all think?",

      "description": "Some backstory is i (21F) am in a long distance relationship and have been for over a year with my boyfriend(24M). I’ve been trying to plan a second trip there for the majority of the year and he’s always had an excuse as to why I can’t come. \n\nWe talked about me visiting in June for two weeks. Before that I wanted to go before i started uni in may and so i told him which months i wanted to visit and he denied all of those months. When he talked about June it wasn’t set in stone but it gave me a general idea of when to book off school so I’ve kept that entire month free just in case. About a week ago he told me that he is going to visit his best friend in texas in June which started a fight because we had both agreed on me going there in June. He then told me he has no memory of even talking about me coming in June.  We got into a fight and i basically told him that I’ve wanted to see him for a year and i called his friend unreliable because she kept making empty promises to fly him to texas. He got very defensive and told me that he hasn’t seen her in two years and he saw me last year so he would rather see her. \nFast forward to Friday and i had to leave to another province in an emergency because my sick sister had a seizure and was paralyzed from the waist down.She recovered the best she could and got feeing back in her body and i went home the following Sunday. I messaged him and he told me he was in bed. I said goodnight and that i loved him because it’s not unusual for him to go to bed early, it was daylight savings so he was now two hours ahead.  An hour later he hits me up and starts talking about another best friend who had just broken up with a fiancé. This dude hasn’t talked to my boyfriend for the majority of the year. My boyfriend is excited to be in touch with him and then tells me that he will be going to that friends place for a week. I tell him to hold up and that I’ve been trying to come there for a year and this guy shows up and you visit him in a hot second? So a huge fight about it breaks out and I basically say to him that I deserve the same respect that he gives his friends. He ghosts me and now I’m left to wonder where i went wrong?\n\nAm i the asshole for causing so many fights about this subject that lead to our breakup? \n\nTLDR; Started an old fight about trying to visit him for a year. Ended up with me being ghosted after i called him out on visiting friends places for weeks. ",

      "description": "So my parents have been divorced ever since I was 6 (am 14 now). My mom got together with this boyfriend around March of last year, and because of some money issues, moved in with him just a few months later. I didn't especially like him at first. He was just a weird person with a stupid sense of humor, and totally didn't understand me at all. Plus, his house was a solid 40 minutes from my school, which sucked. However, over time I came to really enjoy living with him. He was really well intentioned, and had a lot of really cool hobbies that made him an interesting person (vinyl collecting, retro video games, art, making electronic music, MTG, and even more). I really enjoyed being with him. However, come May of this year, my mom broke up with him and cut all contact with him. Their relationship had been seemingly sort of rocky for a but, but I figured that it would be ok. However, they did break up, and after the break up, my mom said that he was emotionally and verbally abusive. I noticed that he would cry quite a bit, but I chalked this up to just him being emotional. I now think that this may have been manipulation, but I'm not 100% sure. He would also say some pretty demeaning stuff to my mom when he was angry, but my mom topped him in that regard. Apparently, he would also kick her out of the house after fights when me and my sister weren't there, which I didn't know until after the break up. That's all I know, but there may have been more abuse that I didn't know about. Either way, all contact was cut with him, and we moved on. My mom was homeless for a bit after this, so I stayed with my dad, who confirmed that the boyfriend was abusive. Eventually my mom got an apartment, and the relationship was never really mentioned, except occasionally by my mom to roast him.\n\nThat's the backstory. 2 weeks ago or so, I confessed to my mom that I missed her ex boyfriend. The time I lived with him holds this special place in my head. It was the happiest I've ever been, the closest I've ever been to my family, the best I've been treated by any adult ever. I loved being with him. I miss the days where I'd play the PS2 with him. I miss his cat. I miss my old bedroom. I miss his yard. I miss him coming to cheer me on at my soccer games. My life isn't bad now, but it was great back then. And I confessed some of this to my mom. She freaked out at me for it, called him an abusive piece of shit, and said that I was just as bad for missing him the way I do. She took my phone away, and specifically said she won't get me the Christmas present I wanted the most. She's still mad at me for it, and I understand why, but at the same time, I don't. I don't think that he was a horrible person, but he did treat my mom like shit sometimes. But he was always awesome to me and my sister, and I loved him. I don't even know if I should apologize to my mom, because I feel like I did nothing wrong. But at the same time, my mom was abused (or at least feels like she was). I don't even know.

Up until 3 months ago we both worked, had a nanny for the children, a housekeeper and also paid for a yard care service and dog walker.\n\nThen my husband got a fantastic promotion which meant he was making more money on his own than we were making by both working. He asked if I would like to stop working and focus on the children. I accepted. \n\nNow he wants to let go of the housekeeper too. I am annoyed as I didnt agree to that. \n\nMy reasoning is that looking after the children is a full time job. I dont feel he can dispute that as we paid someone to do that as a full time job and we never expected the nanny to keep up with the house as well! I make breakfast, change nappies, cook, do dishes, take the kids out to parks, swimming lessons and other activities. He never helps with dinner/bath/bed and I dont think he would help with the house either. I dont want to feel frazzled all the time and be cleaning when I could be reading to the children or doing fun activities with them. It's not like I dont do any tidying. The housekeeper comes 3 times a week and mostly deep cleans, I feel the deep cleans would never get done if not for her. He would complain if it was not done.\n\nHe says I'm acting like a spoilt princess. I told him if he felt that way then he could do the lawns and yard work himself. He said he is too busy and that's why he pays someone else to do it. He said if I'm not working it should be my responsibility to keep the house. I didnt agree to that! I wanted to stay home to spend time with the children not to mop floors! \n\nI know other people do both, and I acknowledge that I am in a very privileged situation. The spoilt comment really struck a nerve.\n\nAITA? \n",

Our building has two floors and a bathroom on each floor.\n\nThe men’s bathroom experienced some issues today and there was a sign on it telling men to please use the upstairs bathroom while the downstairs one is being fixed.\n\nI obviously work downstairs.\n\nThis morning I was using the bathroom when a man came in and went into the stall next to me. I’m not sure what he was doing but I did not hear him urinating.\n\nI immediately finished what I was doing and jetted out of there (without even washing my hands).\n\nI went to tell my boss and he instructed me to report it to HR.\n\nI have filed a complaint to HR and I have a meeting with them tomorrow morning to discuss the matter but they’ve been filled in on the gist of it.\n\nAm I an asshole for reporting a man for using the women’s restroom?",

      "description": "   Backstory: Me (male) and the friend (female) has been friends for 3 years. We were both into anime and video games so we had got along pretty well. We were both single back then. Then, she got a boyfriend at July of 2018 and she would always talk about how great he is and how smart he is. I didn't find that annoying, though. \n   FF a month or two later, they broke up. Turns out the guy was only dating her for fun. She got really depressed for a while and I was there to cheer her up. Then, on November, she started dating with the guy again. I wasn't totally against it but I personally still couldn't forgive the guy for what he did back in July but I still approved of their relationship and helped them get closer because she was happy.\n   But lately, she's always with her boyfriend all day and pay less attention to her friends including me. Back then, she and her friends were inseparable and were chatting about things all the time. Now, she spends 99% of her time just sitting with her boyfriend all day long. Friendship between me and her had also lessened. Back then, we would talk about the things we've experienced and minor things we happened to witness during the day. We would also buy each other food at least once a week. Now, we just sit on our school bus and just mind our own things. She don't even make small chats with me anymore and whenever I try to start a conversation, she would just flat out ignore me. So, I've been thinking maybe I should just stop interacting with her unless she needs my help.",

      "description": "It's Sunday afternoon and I'm chilling on the couch watching a Football/Soccer match. Suddenly, I get a text from my friend (we'll refer to her as A) asking me for help on an English project. Btw I was born and currently live in a French speaking country in Africa (Ivory Coast) but I grew up in England so I was the only person that spoke English fluently in my class. But pardon me if I make a couple errors here and there.\n\nA: \"Hey S (me) can you *help* me with some English work pretty please?😊\nMe: \"Sure, I'll see what I can do.\"\nA: \"Thanks so much! I'll send you the details in a hour.\"\nMe: \"K\"\n\nAn hour and a half later, I'm chilling on my bed watching Football/Soccer vids. Text from A. It's a photo of her work and the orders.\n\nA: \"Here it is.\" \nMe: \"Wait, I'm supposed to help you or do it for you?\"\nA: \"Could you do it please?🙏🏾\"\nMe: \"When is it due?\"\nA: \"Wednesday.\"\nMe: \"I don't know but I'll see what I can do.\"\nA: \"Great!\"\n\nNow maybe it's just me and maybe you disagree. But for me when you have work that's this important; if someone says that they don't know, considering the fact that you know that they also have tons of work to do, you should consider it as a no and at least *try* to do SOMETHING. Then again that's just my opinion. Here's a little bit more info: We're on the last week of a little 2-week break. And I was absent on the last day before the break due to sickness meaning that all the homework they gave for the break had to be done pretty late cause I was too sick to do so. When she asked me for that favour. I had done nothing yet. Fun fact: Our class also had an English project that we hadn't even started cause no one in the group would cooperate so we're going to do it tomorrow cause it's due tomorrow. Like hers. So I just talked to her today and told her that I really didn't have time to do it.\n\nA: \"What? Why didn't you tell me earlier?!\"\nMe (in my mind): \"Girl you had 2 weeks and you waited when you had 3 days left to tell me so you don't you even start with that BS.\"\nA: \"What am I supposed to do now?!\"\nMe: \"Maybe I could *try* to do it by text and send it to you so it's quicker?\"\nA: \"Okay do that.\"\nMe: \"No promises.\"\nA: \"Sure thanks!\"\n\n*Wrong move*\n\nAs I come back from home my mum tells me that I still need to read the school book that I didn't read during the break. I didn't read it cause like I said I was sick and they told us to read the book on the day when I didn't come so I didn't even know that there was a book to read. The book was at least 500 pages long so according to the teacher you would have to read 33 pages every day to finish in time. So I had to start tonight. (I told A that) So I'm a couple minutes into reading and I receive a 30sec long voice message from A telling me that I should've told her that I wouldn't be able to do it and that it was really  not cool from me.",

      "description": "TLDR: Connected my wife's friend (who's looking for investors in real estate) and my friend (who has a lot of free cash to invest in real estate). I suggested that I should receive a small cut if they sign a deal. My wife thinks that's not what friends do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull version: this weekend I was helping out with some manual work to my wife's friend, let's call him David. In a month he wants to leave his day job and start his real estate enterprise, which would involve finding apartments, buying them, finishing them up himself (or renovating) and either selling them for a higher price or furnishing them and renting their rooms. I'm no expert in it but he does seem to know his thing and, from what my wife tells me, David and David's wife are quite the venturesome types. Even though they have two small kids, they also started a small side-business a few years ago (while also working full-time jobs) which they intend to sell in a year or two to focus on real estate. David is looking for investors, since he doesn't yet have the financial capacity to buy multiple apartments himself and really kick it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing this, I reached out to an old friend of mine, let's call him George. George been very successful in the past 15 years and is definitely a millionaire, likely a multimillionaire by now. He's by far the smartest person with money that I know. He's been a good friend of mine but we don't live in close vicinity so nowadays we see each other 2-3 times a year and speak too little on the phone for me not to have a guilty conscious about it. Anyway, during the past few years, he also started to invest in real estate but doesn't know our local market. He invests mostly abroad and if it's local, he lives in a completely different part of the country anyway so he focuses on his operations there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth gentlemen seemed very keen in talking to each other. If not to strike a deal then at least to exchange experiences. George is starting very slowly, since he's currently got his main business to run and David wants to go all in within the next few months but is only on his first investment now. So, they're both learning their new trade. Therefore, I connected them - exchanging their email addresses and phone numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did mention to David that if they strike a deal, I'll probably be wanting a small cut, like 1000 USD. He replied with something along the lines of, \"of course, that's obvious.\" However, my wife does think ITA because that's not what friends should do and literally forbids me to bring it up again because she would feel ashamed by it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. My first ever post on reddit \\^\\^ Be kind, please. Especially since English is not my first language :)",

      "description": "To preface this I haven’t actually taken any action just yet, but wondering if I should. \n\nSo I went out to a work friends leaving party/Halloween drinks last night, and the wife didn’t want to be home alone with it being Halloween and there been who knows what out and about. Plan was my wife’s friend was going to come over and they’d order a take away and hang out. \n\nWife’s friend ends up cancelling the last minute and wife spends the evening alone, doesn’t tell me because she didn’t want to ruin my night because she knows I would have gone straight home. My wife also didn’t eat because she was upset to the point of just losing her appetite. \n\nThis isn’t the first, second, or third time that my wife’s friend has cancelled last minute and it’s got to the point of when my wife’s friend does turn up it’s more of a pleasant surprise. My wife has been growing increasingly frustrated with this, and it’s going to get to the point where my wife kicks off herself at the friend or just breaks ties completely, which I don’t know would be a bad thing, but my wife does value the friendship. \n\nI’ve been contemplating sending my wife’s friend a message kinda just explaining the situation and hoping it will kind of kick the friend into gear, but I don’t want to put my 10cents in where it doesn’t belong and I don’t want to say something like an asshole and start something between my wife and her friend. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

So during this  story I went on a trip to an indoor sport with a summer camp program.\n\nMe=me\nK=kid (who used to be my friend)\nC=Coach\n\n\nSo I was on the soccer  field and was sitting  on the bench waiting  to be put in. While I was waiting, I was listening to some music.\n\nSo me and my friends have a game where  we try and guess each other's passwords. \n\nMe: I bet you guys can't guess my password. \nK:It's probably 666!\nMe:Why would that be my password. \nK:Because your a devil worshiper \nMe: 1st I'm not a devil worshiper  \nK: Yeah you're  just an idiot \nMe: How am I an idiot\nK: because you're  an aethist\nMe:Stephen Hawking is an aethist, is he an idiot\nK:He was smart about science, dumb about religion \n\nAt this point he is basically  yelling and the coach comes over and hears the kids argument.\n\nC: You shouldn't  call anyone  an idiot because  of their religion. Now if someone  was being crazy and then blaming it on your  religion  then they're  the idiot. \n\nNow the next day I were in a cafeteria  talking with my friends. I am looking  at my photos  and look up and realized that K was walking towards. I put down  my phone and continue talking. \nAs I'm talking he interrupts  me. \n\nK:My mom says I can't talk  to because you're  an aethist. \n\nNow at this point I just left the room because  I was that angry. \n",

      "description": "So obviously there are two sides to this story and I can't go into all the details but essentially my three housemates asked me and my girlfriend to move out without any warning. The reason being that me and one of my housemates were having some trouble. The main issue here is definitely that we were not communicating about the problems we were having. I am a busy human and work 40 hours a week while also going to school full time for the most intensive subject at our University. I will often come home stressed during the semester to find said housemate has invited several people over to drink and have a good time. This is all fine and dandy but I have asked several times for this roommate to text me and let me know people are over so I can be ready for that when I get home, which never happened. I was extremely frustrated by this (and several other small things) and I'm sure it was apparent but I never said anything rude. I admit there were times where I was bitter but I would always keep it between me and my girlfriend. I'd like to again recognize that I am definitely at blame for some of these things and that I shouldn't have neglected to communicate for so long. The thing that has really gotten to me is that for the last month I was certain that things were getting much better and was actually beginning to feel like me and this housemate were getting along great! I don't really need to get into the specific details, but essentially they sent my girlfriend a Google document out of the blue that said they were frustrated with some things and that they wanted me to move out. The things on the list were really manageable and easy for me to fix, this really confused me especially because they hadn't brought anything up before. After further investigation, one of my other housemates informed me that the housemate that I was having problems with was the one that was really pushing for me to move out and that she gave them a him or me situation. I then found out that this housemate, instead of talking with me about the issues she was having, talked with anyone who would listen about how terrible of a housemate I was, some of the things she was saying were true but some of them were blatantly untrue. Because I haven't talked about my problems with said housemate to anyone but my girlfriend, all of my closest friends have turned against me because they have only heard what she has had to say, this obviously hurts. my co-workers knew about the problems she was having before I knew, folks that weren't in town knew about this before me, people I had never talked to knew about this before I had a clue. \n\nI would like to respect the wishes of everyone in my house but I feel like I've been ganged up on and not given an opportunity to change/defend myself. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to hold my ground and not move out?\n\n",

      "description": "The title basically says it all. My sister and I are only a year apart and were raised the exact same way. Thing is, she’s a bit hippy-ish. Which is fine, but it’s gotten more extreme since she had kids. (I’m a mother of one myself, so I get how your beliefs can evolve when you become a parent–but IMO she’s really out there on a lot of topics). \n\nEvery Sunday we try to get together at my parents’ house and hang out, have dinner, etc. (We all live fairly close by and my parents are getting older so it’s been a nice little tradition). \n\nSo I guess my sister was doing a feeding in my parent’s room. I guess my mom didn’t know and so she walked in. I didn’t hear but she apparently said something to my sister about how she thought my nephew was getting weaned. They ended up getting into an argument about it. I (regrettably) went into the room see what was going on. My sister was raising her voice and, i thought, crossing some lines with how she was speaking to our mom. I got annoyed and I told my sister that she can’t expect everyone to be okay with her continuing to breastfeed and sleep with a kid who should be in kindergarten (she’s homeschooling him for now) and that it is a bit creepy. \n\nThat’s when she ended up calling me ignorant and taking my nephew (and my 7 y/o niece) and leaving. She didn’t even sitting down to eat dinner, unfortunately.\n\nOverall it was pretty awful. But everyone else (meaning my parents, brother, and sister-in-law) are took my side and said I just verbalized what everyone has been thinking. I still feel bad though because, I mean, she’s my sister. I’ve texted her, but, predictably, no response yet. \n\nAnyway, I know this might be sensitive topic for some people (and I don’t feel like dealing with any drama, hence the throwaway). But I also want honest opinions and I’m willing to apologize if I’m wrong. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend to refrain from talking about our exams for just three days?",
      "description": " Well my girlfriend and I are both uni students. We're currently in the middle of our finals and we are both extremely stressed out. Although I also had to go through a lot of stuff this semester, she really stressed herself out and I was always there for her. Literally every single day she would tell me that she's exhausted and that she wants to kill herself and etc. I also had my own problems but I just kept it inside because I felt like I would be burdening her.  \n There were signs that she was a self-centered person. During the beginning of our relationship, she was so burdened that she literally lashed out everything at me. While I was trying to sooth her down, she acted all normal in front of our friends and I had the feeling that she didn't really respect me as a human. But I just got over with it because I knew how much it burdened her and I didn't want it to be a big deal.  \n Then quite more recently I got accepted to this thing that I was desperate to join. I was so happy about the news that I instantly told her the good news. At first she congratulated me but then literally 5 minutes later she started telling me how I should be thankful for everything that I had because I grew up in a household where I was provided with everything I needed. It's not as if she came from an extremely poor household and couldn't even afford our tuition fees (It's about 5k per year without scholarships). She just feels the burden on herself. That completely ruined my mood because I HAD to feel sorry for her. But I just forgot about it.  \n Now finally just a day ago, she was complaining about her GPA as per usual (which is still above 4.0 and mine is around 3.5) and I lost the last straw. I was already too stressed out, felt depressed, suicidal and all that emotional crap stacked up like a pile. I just couldn't take it anymore. So I politely asked her if we could just stop talking about our exams or anything study related just until the end of the semester (which is in three days). She got royally pissed at me and started guilt trapping me about how selfish I am and even mentioned the wealth thing (just for clarification I come from a middle-class family) which pretty much has absolutely nothing to do with it. We're still fighting atm but now I'm confused. Am I being the asshole over here?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting out a depressed friend for being negative 24/7?",
      "description": "I met him (I'll call him Jeff) in school and initially thought Jeff was a pretty chill dude to talk to, so with both of us being into gaming I asked for his Steam profile. We then started playing regularly until half way through school when he randomly stops showing up altogether. During this time we rarely talked or played together, I figured whatever is happening I'll just let him have his space. He ends up telling me that he is homeschooled now and that's why he isn't showing up in school anymore. We play on and off on PC until late summer after the school year. Just before the next year of school I ask him about homeschooling and where he goes to etc because I wanted to try homeschool for personal reasons. He tells me I need to talk to a school counselor during the year and see if it is right for me. Wasn't a big deal to me at the time so initially I left it at that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVery late into summer maybe a week and a half before school starts I really just want to get into homeschool and not go to public school at all this year. I pressure him into telling me the program he is in and he never budged, he eventually pretty much told me to \"fuck off\" and go to the counselor because it's probably not right for me. I can understand where he was coming from so I wasn't that mad. Me and my parents contact a local homeschool and before you know it, I'm in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decide to tell Jeff I got into a homeschool and it's been going fine. I ask again what homeschool he went with and he finally tells me that he actually just dropped out. I was reallllly disappointed in him for dropping out for no reason and for lying about being homeschool. Despite this we end up becoming really good friends talking to each other almost daily on Discord and playing cs:go. However things started to go downhill. After playing with him for a few weeks he starts to go into some small detail about him and his family and why he dropped out and I'm sitting here and listening to him and helping him however i can for the next few days. Some time passes and i end up visiting his house twice and pretty much everything he told me was an over-exaggeration. Most of the things he claimed ended up being either false or stretched out of proportion.  \n\n\nHowever most of this probably stemmed from him recently becoming depressed. So I decided to ignore it and just play games like we intended to do in the first place. Then he randomly obtains this huge insane unreasonable ego on how he used to be a god at CSGO and have better aim than a big majority of pros in his \"prime\" consisting of playing at 45 fps on a laptop with an office mouse. As you can see it just doesn't add up what so ever. Now when we que into games he's constantly complaining about his mouse and mousepad. Saying that if he just had the best peripherals for him that he'd suddenly soar to the top with minimal effort. It honestly just does NOT work that way. You find a flagship mouse and you adjust to it and practice to get better. But he thinks just because he obtained a ton of hours previously that he shouldn't have to practice a ton or adjust. He frequently blames teammates and even me. I rarely have a good time playing with him anymore and no matter what I try to do he refuses to change his thought process.  \n\n\nSo I decide to completely block him on discord, steam, and my phone. Because for me playing with him was a chore and mentally degrading. I can't really force myself to play with him much longer. But I'm worried that I didn't do the right thing and that maybe I should've stuck with him and helped him overcome this \"phase\" of sorts. AITA for essentially ending our friendship?  \n\n\nTL;DR: Decent person who became a good friend eventually ended up being depressed and really negative towards himself, his abilities and the people around him. Got too much for me and I blocked him.",

      "description": "In two months my class is graduating. They are all excited about it. I am not. I really don’t want to go. I don’t have any friends and I won’t enjoy it the least. There is so much group pressure surrounding it, and theres a lot of money to be paid. We have to pay for dinner and then 7 tickets to the party. I have bought my 7 tickets and am now supposed to sell them to 7 people, but I don’t have any friends. So I have now paid what equals to around 100 dollars for these tickets that I am not able to sell. I will then have to pay  200 dollars for the dinner. \n\nI have now decided not to go. I have been to stressed and anxious about it. I cry everytime someone mentions it.  Of course, I now want my money back for the 7 tickets and I don’t want to pay for the dinner I’m not going to. It is possible they now have to pay for that, but slit by 30 people I don’t think it will be that much. I still feel like an ass for not telling them sooner, but I have really bad social anxiety (diagnosed, I go to a therapist). I have postponed this because I hoped I could deal with it but I can’t. I am not even sure I will be able to tell them I am not coming because of my anxiety. My whole body shakes by the thought of writing to them about this. I feel like they will hate me. I don’t know what to do. \n\nIt will probably end with me paying everything and then not going, but I don’t want to throw that money away. They have never asked if everyone is going, they just assumed it. I am trying to summon the courage and write to one of the planners that I won’t be coming. I am not close to anyone in my class, we never talk. I am the outsider. I don’t want to ruin my graduation by forcing myself to be there and then just try to not cry all day. I can barely sleep because I am so stressed and anxious about the graduation party. I have cried myself to sleep over this more than a few times. I just don’t want to go. \n\nSo WIBTA if I now told them that I am not coming? Even if it means they might have to pay a little extra? My 7 tickets they will be able to sell because they have a lot of friends so they will get that money back, they just have to split the 200 dollars between them which would be around 7 dollars each (if they even have to pay that, it is possible they created a larger budget and would have to give back a little money). \n\n",

The company is disorganized, poorly managed, abusive to employees, and generally speaking not s fantastic work environment and for that reason I have accepted a new job in June. However, over the last year, there have been 4 instances in which I was overpaid due to clerical errors/ incompetence on behalf of my employer and each time I have notified them and had to pay them back. \n\nLast Friday I logged into my 401k account and noticed they had overpaid me (by several thousand dollars) into this account (the previous overpayments had been to my checking account). I am worried that if I tell them I will have to withdrawal the money and be responsible for taxes and penalties. \n\nAITA if I don’t tell them and just keep the money even though this will be the 5th error in a years time?

      "description": "First time poster here, small time creeper, mobile user, shitty format, here comes the background info.\n\nTl;dr at the bottom for you skimmers and creepers out there. \n\nMy brother is 21 (the same dude from the title), and has been fighting a heroin addiction for a little over 3 years, give or take some time due to shitty memory. \n\nHe has a history of stealing from family members, including myself. On one occasion, I was staying out of state at my mom's to pick up a car I had been working on. I had about 10 dollars in cash, to top off the tank to make it home (home being 300 miles away). I had some extra in my savings, as a safety net. \n\nWell the night before I was set to leave back, my brother went into the room I was staying in, and took the crisp $10 bill out of my wallet, to buy whatever he could with it. \n\nThis pissed me off, and I confronted him about it. He denied, (of course) and my mom believed him.\nI just let it go, and chalked it up as a loss.\n\nFlash forward a few months, and he is staying with my younger sister (she's 24). She tells me that she has to kick him out, because he's fell into the wrong crowd again and is smoking heroin in her home. My sister has 2 biological sons and 2 stepsons, all under the age of 11. My sister and brother-in-law were not having it anymore, which I don't blame them. \n\nHe then goes back with my mom, who continues to coddle him through all this. She has bailed him out of jail 4 times, paid off multiple drug debts he's had as well. \n\nNow that we have all the pertinent information, let's talk about tonight.\n\nMy brother is staying in the same city as me with our father (our parents divorced back in 2012), and apparently have not been getting along. My sister called me tonight to ask me what was going on, because my dad was kicking my brother out for stealing his van, and stealing for other people. \n\nMy brother messages me and asks me if he can come over. I told him I'm already in bed, because I have to open at work tomorrow morning. \n\nHis reply was how he doesnt have anywhere to stay, which isn't the truth. We have a ton of extended family (cousins we grew up with) who have been willing to help him out. \n\nHe asks me if he can spend the night, which I replied with no, explaining that he needs to get some help, and that he has burned me in the past. I don't trust him alone in my apartment. I have worked hard for 2 years to get my apartment and have the few nice things I have. \n\nI am in no way, shape or form well off. I make minimum wage in a state that is considered poverish, and I don't live in the nicest of part of town, either. \n\nSo reddit, \nAITA for refusing to let my brother stay at my apartment?\n\n Tl;dr: I told my heroin addict brother he can't come and stay at my apartment because he steals.

I disagree. If you are traveling at 55 mph, and you are looking down at your phone for 5 seconds, you will travel the length of a football field with no eyes on the road. Sounds scary, right?

      "description": "English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. \n\nFirstly, some context. My parents met when they were in school and my mother got pregnant of me when she was only nineteen years old, they never got married or anything. When I was very small (6 or 7) they broke up for the first time, I don't really remember why or when, but they started dating again. \n\nEverything was fine until 2015. Then, a few days before my birthday my mom told me she was looking for places to live because she and my dad broke up. She told me that the relationship just didn't work and she wasn't happy, she even cried (this was the first time in my life that I saw my mom crying this way). I was only fourteen but I understood, I just wanted them to be happy.\n\nNow, the real problems. Like I said, it was my mom who told me about this, my father simply wasn't there. He never really talked about this with me until I started the conversation. My mom found a place less than a month later and I moved with her. Both of my parents were destroyed and I asked them both to go to a psychology, they said no. I really think my mom moved on, she's very strong. Sadly, my dad isn't.\n\nMy emotional state was, as you can guess, no the best and everything was jus too much. Even without this, I cry VERY easily, like once a day at least (yeah, I know) so every f*cking time we had a discussion I cried. And e v e r y t i m e he got mad at me. He said stuff like \"whatever YOU do\"(you=me and my mom) \"what SHE says\" (My mom, obviously). I got pissed off every time. \n\nMy parents still text, mostly to talk about me, and my father insulted my mom and called me a liar in that first year. In the next year we had another big fight and he threw me out, he told me to take my stuff and don't go back ever again. I didn't because when I want stubborn becomes my second name. He apologized and promised to never do something like that again.\n\nOf course, he did. Months later I called him, I don't even remember why, I think I needed something that was on his house? No clue. The point is that we started arguing and, again, he told me to never go back. And, once more, he apologized. \n\nThe most recently thing that has happened is related with the pension he gives my mom, which is extremely low (only 150€). My mom had to take a job in another part of the country, so I lived with my dad that time, we had a few fights but everything was kind of fine. When my mom came back she told me that those two months he didn't give her anything, not a single cent. According to a lawyer my mom talked to, he must do it. We had another fight related to money a week ago, for a trip I had to do.\n\nImportant thing, I go to his house every other weekend and live in his house like a month every year.\n\nBy now, after not only this but a lot more, I'm sick of this. He behaves like a fiveteen year old and I have enough of my own teenager sh*t. I don't want to spend my time like that. Is it me? Is he in the right here?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I are currently fighting about this, and I'm not sure if I can be considered the asshole here or not.\n\nSo my boyfriend, (23m, we'll call him PAH for possible asshole) has a female friend (23f, we'll call her HW for reasons that will soon be clear). I (20f) told PAH about a month ago that his friend could stay with us if she wanted to get back on her feet, as it's winter in Canada and not a good place to be a Homeless Woman. (HW). My only condition for this was that she stay off drugs and definitely not have them in my home, and that I get to meet her before agreeing 100% to let her live with us. I even offered to get her a job at my workplace.\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago, when PAH was hanging out with HW. She took him to her friends house and pulled out a bag of coke, and then starting doing lines in front of him. PAH came home visibly upset, because he had asked her on numerous occasions not to do drugs in front of him. Note, I still haven't met this woman.\n\nSince that incident, I was under the impression that he hadn't spoken to HW. Except, apparently he \"gave her shit\" for doing drugs in front of him and they're best of buds now. Also, apparently she's clean again? Either way, PAH texted me while he was at work and asked if he could pick up HW and take her back to our place tonight and have her stay for a while. The length of time wasn't mentioned, so it could be anywhere from a few days to a few months. I have no idea.\n\nSome additional info; I still have yet to meet this woman. At one point between my stating she could stay and now, I was placed on medical leave from work. So we only have PAHs income. Also, had he picked her up tonight, I would have been alone with her all day when PAH left for work tomorrow. Possibly worth mentioning, these two do have a past romantic history.\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend is friends with a homeless (possible former) drug addict. He wants her to stay with us. I disagree. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a pizza delivery driver and I had a customer pull $4 from their wallet and set it on the table while filling out the receipt. They initially wrote in $5 and added $5 to the total but then changed the tip on the card to $4 when they realized they only had $4 on the table. I'm 100% sure that they didn't intend to give me an $8 tip. \n\nNormally, if this happens and they only hand me $1 or $2, I take the extra money. I have to claim $2 as taxable income for every delivery I take regardless of what I receive. And a lot of the time, a $2 tip means I make about the same as if I had just stayed in the store. The way I see it, they took advantage of me by skimping out on the tip (especially if it's a larger, $30+ order) so I return the favor but taking advantage of them and line my pockets in the process. But $4 is a pretty good tip for a ~$22 order, especially to the college campus where this delivery went.\n\nAm I the asshole for taking advantage of this person's ignorance and taking the $4 on the credit card?",

      "description": "We've had petty fights over this but I just want to know if what I'm asking for is unreasonable or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my husband has notoriously bad-smelling bowel movements because of IBS. It's not super often but happens occasionally when he eats something he's not supposed to and he gets irritated. Anyways, the smell is absolutely putrid and will make you gag. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been thinking about asking him to use the downstairs guest toilet instead of our main one for all number twos. Part of it is definitely selfish, since I have a lot of nice-smelling makeup and delicate skincare in our master bedroom and tbh I get a bit paranoid that his foul smelling movements are creating lingering smells/poop particles. The other is that I even though he closes the door, I can always smell a bit when he's pooping and the smell makes me honestly gag. There's nothing worse than sitting in bed at 10pm and smelling a tiny bit of poop while you're relaxing and getting ready for bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways I brought it up to him that I think it would be nice if he started pooping in the downstairs toilet which is far away from our bedroom. He got angry and said that he'll poop wherever he please. I think he's being REALLY immature and childish for \"wanting to poop wherever\" especially when it honestly affects me negatively both mentally and physically. I don't think its a huge ask if it means I could be a LOT more comfortable in my own home. I know I'd do the same for him. Is he being immature or AITA here?",

      "description": "As a disclaimer: this is late at night, I’m frustrated, and using a cell phone. I’m sorry in advance for any typos! \n\nSo, I live in a state very far away from my family. In fact, the four of us (Mom, sister (27), me (25f), brother (21m)) are all very spread out over the US. We came together yesterday to go for a wedding. Obviously, we are far apart in distance but I’ve always felt close to my sister, brother, and Mom. \n\nSo, the last few times I’ve seen my brother, he has irritated the HELL out of me. I feel like he chooses to say and do inflammatory things just to piss people off, myself included. No one really puts him in his place, as he is an adult and can do/say what he wants. But, I’m trying to figure out if HE is an asshole or if I am being an irritable asshole, myself. \n\nHere’s a couple of examples from the weekend (one day) so far: \n\n1. My mom asked me about an uncomfortable situation I had told her about involving a strange man.  Basically, just a creep at the bar that I felt weird telling off because he was friends with my coworker. She asked my brother for his advice, and I filled him in on what happened. He immediately told me what I SHOULD have done “just tell him to fuck off!” To which I replied, it’s a little more nuanced than that. I have a new job, didn’t know my coworkers who I was out with well, and he was a friend of theirs. He scoffed and said he would have just told him to fuck off anyway. This was a situation that I was already feeling really self conscious about, and I kind of snapped at him and said that he didn’t understand the reality of the situation, though I would have loved to have done what he suggested. \n\n2. Shows me a new tattoo that he got. I said I liked it. It is the start of a sleeve, and was really well done. My mom said she liked it, but hoped he would wait to get a job to complete the sleeve, just to ensure employment (he’s in college). He immediately responded “I’m going to be tatted from head to toe, just watch. See me when I’m 70”. I said okay, good for you. I also have tattoos. I said I liked your tattoo. Our mom loves you and just was having a normal mom reaction. Not sure if he was just defensive or what. \n\n3. He brings up politics every opportunity he has. We have very different political views, which is fine. But I feel like he baits me into these discussions and just tries to piss me off. Like, tonight he brought up how he “Loves the death penalty” and I said, okay. He knows I feel differently, but won’t stop. “I think we should kill anyone who does something terrible. Why pay to keep them alive?” I try to stay out of these, but eventually get sucked in. Or he talks about how he thinks he has the solution to school intruders, and I’m a teacher. I try to give him my perspective but he absolutely won’t listen to me and continues to spout. \n\n\n4. He uses profanity in insane excess. I’m not a prude by any means, but he literally cannot say a sentence without saying fuck, regardless of the audience. I get irritated and say something, and he gets in my face. \n\n\nI don’t know. When I read back, these seem like normal tiffs. But, they are much more numerous than this. Im discouraged because this past year, I’ve seen him three times and am constantly annoyed. My boyfriend can’t stand him and I frankly don’t blame him (he threatened to beat him up for no reason while drunk when he met him). I wrote that off as him being a defensive, dumb 20 year old (at the time) but now I feel like the behavior is more consistent. \n\nAm I an asshole sister who is being impatient with my brother? Or is my brother being douchey? Do I need to get over myself, or talk to him about his behavior? ",

      "description": "Backstory, because it helps explain my mindset a bit: I’m diagnosed with clinical depression and have been through a decent amount of trauma in my life (extreme bullying throughout most of mu childhood &amp; an alcoholic parent) which has led to me having a decent amount of trust issues. In the past two years I’ve broken off 3 very close relationships in very painful ways because of toxicity; it’s taken a bad toll on my mental health, and I am going to therapy. \n\nSo the person I want to break the friendship with is called C. C has been a friend for about a year or so now &amp; usually we get along pretty well. However, C also is really quick to make assumptions and has said that I “have it better off” because I “”only”” have clinical depression and not BPD and Bipolar like they do. I’ve never tried to downplay their mental illness, but when they said this one night I told them this really hurt my feelings, and that I don’t have to fight to be true about my experiences. They acted all shocked that I was upset (during this interaction prior, mind you, I didn’t show any upset because we were at a party &amp; I was deeply self-conscious) and when I asked for an apology they used the whole “I’m sorry YOU got offended” routine. That kind of stuff isn’t only gross but also made me feel bad because I felt like I was being hysterical. \n\nFast forward to now. I moved on because I figured they wouldn’t grow up and give me a proper apology. Yesterday I was dropping a friend off (they were in the car with me and my gf because they can’t drive) and we got into a dumb fight really over miscommunication. I got mad at them because I didn’t want them involved and nearly kicked them out of my car. \n\nLooking back on it now, I feel like my anger is from the prior experience—they never really apologized to me while taking my feelings into account, and I’ve realized the anger is building in me. I don’t want to break it off because it’d tear apart a friend group, but I’m still really hurt. \n\nSO: AITA? I need a second opinion. \n\n(lemme know also if you need more info: I can answer what I can.) ",

      "description": "A few years ago I made a new friend in the new city we had just moved to. We got along well and our kids became friends. She liked to give unsolicited advice about everything, even retroactively. If I ever complained, she took it as an invitation to either give advice or tell me what I should have done in retrospect. She told me I potty trained wrong, that I should have used a sticker system for my daughter’s behaviors (even after I said I tried it and found it ineffective), that when I had a mishap ordering an appliance online I should have gone inside a store to order from a sales person, that I handle tantrums wrong and how I should be handling them, etc. I’d usually explain my reasoning or just say thank you so she’d stop. We otherwise had a great relationship. One horrifying day I discovered that both my daughter and I had lice. I texted her to cancel our play date. She said she’d never had lice before and began sending me links and advice and even telling me how I should have prevented it. I was already overwhelmed and freaking out so I got fed up and I finally confessed that while I appreciated the thought behind her advice, I could no longer accept so much unsolicited advice. She responded that part of friendship means giving advice, and if I couldn’t accept her advice we could no longer be friends. I tried to explain how not all advice is bad, but that sometimes I just wanted to vent without being told what I should do or should have done, but I ended up apologizing to her. She said she’d think about whether we should remain friends. After a few days she ultimately decided that we could not be friends (she texted that giving advice is very important to her in her friendships and she felt like I would be “policing” her too much for her comfort) and I lost the only friend I had made in my new city. My daughter also lost her friend. I still think often about whether I handled this wrong. ",

      "description": "So this all started back about 3-4 years ago, my brother has always been an \"edgelord\" reading about serial killers collecting knives being satanist and all that kind of shit, that's not the problem though. About two years ago we kinda shipped him off to my dad's house to leave me(17), my sister(12) and my mother to live by ourselves my brother is 20 going on 21. But before we sent him off we would scream and crash things, even going as far as to wrap his first in a pillow to hit my sister and threats to our lives were a more than daily occurrence. Both I and my brother have high functioning autism, but him a little less function. And as of two years ago he had stopped just being interested in serial killers and now kinda idolizes them and I'm convinced 100% if he was still in school he would've tried to go on a stabbing. But the final straw for me was after he moved out I looked around his room and found bootleg Molotov cocktails in a box and so I confronted him about it and he continued to lie to my face and the only reason I didn't beat his ass then and there was because he had his pet snake around his neck. The snake used to be shared around 4 years ago but after one time he cleaned her tank he put it in his room and called it his snake even though I paid for half of all expenses and loved her just as much and still do. Anyway, when I and my sister go up to my dad's house we fear for our lives and our father's life whom my brother exploits and causes even more mental harm to my highly depressed father. So now I couldn't care less if he was hit by a bus and I'd only pity him if he died.\nTLDR\nMy semi-autistic brother has terrorized my family for years, we sent him to our dads were he exploits him and we found Molotov cocktails in his room he aspires to be a serial killer and I no longer care for his life.\nPs\nHe disowned us all as family, my mother doesn't want to send him to a home.\nI questioned this recently because people tell me to cut him some like for being disabled and because he's my bother but I've tried and I'm done.",

      "description": "I live with my parents and brother, and work several jobs to make ends meet.  My jobs are stressful and I am paid little so I exist in a constant state of stress and worry.  I'm pushing thirty.\n\nI decided to take a short vacation towards the end of the month to a city about three hours away from home.  That's the only week where I have a couple days off from all three of my jobs.  I'm honestly going to get away from the family and sleep and have a nice dinner.\n\nOnce I told my parents that I was going on vacation, they told me they were planning on going out of town around the same time as me and they immediately pulled some faces and started suggesting that I cancel or reschedule my vacation until after they come back.\n\nMy brother is in his mid-twenties and has had some mental health problems over the years.  He's doing much better (he's on anti-d's and goes to therapy regularly) but I believe that my parents are still worried about him being in the house alone, and they want someone to watch him.  And I understand that, I do - but I have never taken a vacation for myself.  I want to relax and not worry about work for the first time in years.  And while I'm on vacation I'm planning on meeting up with one of my old college professors and talking about applying to grad school.  My professor already confirmed our meeting date and time and I don't want to back out.\n\nI guess I'm asking if I'm the asshole for not wanting to change my vacation to keep an eye on my brother. I care about him deeply - he's my only sibling - and would be devastated if anything happened to him.  But I want to take care of myself and relax a little.  AITA? My parents keep making me feel like I am.",

      "description": "My husband's best friend is a really awesome guy: friendly, funny, and an amazing artist. He has an art degree from a pretty prestigious art school, has worked for a couple of big animation companies as a storyboard artist, and a very big company which rhymes with \"Lisney\" as a PA. He has since moved on to being an independent artist.\n\nHe and I get along great and text all the time. One night I asked since he was now independent if I could commission him to draw a realistic photo of my husband, our son, and I in a comic book style. We went over what it would look like, he asked for some examples of what we would be wearing, and put the whole thing together. He and I were legitimately excited for this project! I then asked him for his pricing and he said he'd do it for free, since when he started branching off on his own I advertised his art on my blog for free which in turn gave him a bit of traffic.\n\nThis was back in November. I told him I wanted to give it to my husband for Christmas, but told him there was no rush. I was really hoping this would be the center piece of the gifts I was going to give him. Since our collaboration I haven't heard a thing from him about the picture. I have a curiously large amount of friends who are artists and know how frustrating it can be having a client hitting them up for a timeline. Also he is doing it for free, so I don't feel like I'm super entitled to pester him for it.\n\n WIBTA if I messaged him and gently ask about it?\n\nTl;dr: Commissioned my husbands BFF to draw a Christmas gift for my husband six months ago. He insisted on doing it for free, and I haven't heard anything about it since.",

      "description": "So I’m doing a level 4 improv course and I’m not really enjoying it as much as I enjoyed the other levels. It seems like a lot of time is spent on overanalysis and and explanation of pretty basic concepts, and not much performing. In the other levels there was still a lot of talking, but a decent amount of performing, too. I just think - we’re all adults, we don’t need to talk for 10 minutes about what might be funny in a scene and what humour is. We don’t need to overanalyse pretty simple concepts as if they’re theoretical physics. Give us the basics, and trust that we’ll get it and intuit what’s funny - let us learn by doing.\n\nSo after class I spoke privately to the teacher and said I thought there was too much talking. I wasn’t aggressive at all, but I still feel like a douche. She took it pretty well, but was a bit defensive. The thing is, I’m a teacher too (not improv) and I hate when students give negative feedback at the end of the course - I always wish they would’ve told me earlier on, so I could’ve changed things. So I assumed it’d be the same here.\n\nIdk. And now I’m afraid it’ll be awkward next week, I almost don’t want to go back (I have social anxiety)",

      "description": "Strap in, honeys, this is a long, two year ride. \nIf I’m being honest, I only made this account to post this story for this reason. It came to my mind after a conversation with my sister, and I guess I want Reddit’s opinion. \nBefore I begin, let me clarify something. In my seventh to eighth grade year, I was an horrible, horrible person.\nBottom line, I was bitter because I had some family baggage. My mother mistreated me and my sister in the past and blew up at us. I was also religiously scarred as a kid, and I never actually truly got over that. This led to me being incredibly depressed, negative, and toxic. \nStill, there was someone in my life who I can’t decide on which one of us was worse. Apparently, my family is insisting that this person I’m going to talk about was innocent and I was the only aggressor. I won’t deny that I was cruel to him, but was I really the only offender? Well, that’s for you to decide I suppose. I am ready for Reddit’s just and swift ruling of my pretty damning case. \nI guess what I expect here is either an “everybody sucks” or “you’re the asshole,” I just want to know. Forgive me as this was a very long time ago and my memory is shaky. Also, I’m writing this on my phone. I will try my very hardest not to misrepresent things in my favor as I really do just want an answer and to put this part of my life to rest. \nI had a friend. I’ll call him Gean. We met after an awkward incident at his garage sale when my dog tripped me, and he helped me up and untangled me from my leash. I was twelve at this time. It was funny, awkward, and we laughed it off. \nLater, I invited Gene to dinner as my parents were grilling out. He told me he was sick and vomiting. However, later when I went by his house, he was hanging with his cousins. He said he was feeling better, and being the innocent kid I was, I believed him. \nGene never lived in a good neighborhood, but I never judged him for this. His house was small and cluttered but I enjoyed going over there. We became friends and he did have dinner with us and our family a few times. \nHe later told me that he lied about being sick because his cousins didn’t want him hanging with “homeschooled little white girls,” I was incredibly insecure about being homeschooled, and this hurt ms a log. This was my first red flag and I did begin to treat him differently because of this offense. I never ever hang with people who are ashamed to be around me, but in this case, I had no choice. My family liked him. \nIt was no secret that he liked me, but I was young and I wasn’t ready for that. He would make sexual comments my way and tell me he’d do things like “grab my butt,” and pull down my skirt. I would dismiss them as just him playing around. \nOne day, he told me he smoked weed and, as an innocent homeschooler, this scared me. I never judged him for where he lived, but cursing used to be a criminal offense in my view and smoking weed was even worse. Now, I’m a bit more open minded, but at the time I was heavily sheltered. \nMy parents and sister adored him, and I was a little uncertain. I knew that they wouldn’t be so accepting if they knew what he was really like. Around them, he acted perfect. Still, I wasn’t a snitch, and I kept quiet. \nSo far, I didn’t do anything wrong. Then... I hit eighth grade, my darkest year. I was depressed, sick, and angry. I would frequently yell at my parents and fight with my mother about the way she treated me in the past. I struggled against my religious indoctrination, and I hated everyone. \nMy resentment grew towards Gene and the way he treated me. So, I stopped talking to him. He would come over, and I’d lock myself in my room. If he tried to talk to me, I’d snap at him. My home and school life grew worse and worse, and it was the year I considered killing myself or running away from home. Yes, I was a drama queen, but at the time, this seemed logical and honestly, I just didn’t want to be alive. My life was meaningless without religion, and I was learning that I was socially inept because of my homeschooling even as I went to a school for the first time. I felt worthless and like everyone knew I was a loser. So, I was defensive and cruel. \nGene would tag along when my dad and I when he would take me on our favorite trip. We’d go pawn shopping. I collected knives because I thought they were pretty, and even now I throw knives at a target. This got us somewhat close again. Although, I was cold and distant with Gene. \nDuring this time, I was the offender. I’ll admit that right now. I was cruel to this kid, and I personally don’t think he deserved it after the dumb things he did as a kid. I told him to his face that I wanted him gone and that I was sick of him hanging around. He’d cry to my parents that I was bullying him, but I didn’t care. I knew he had them wrapped around his little finger. \nSee, Gene had a rough life. He lived with a single mom who had been to prison for drugs. So, they fell head over heels. (Keep in mind, my mom was a huge fan of the movie, Blindside. And she wants to do that with every kid with a sob story even to this day) I didn’t feel sorry for him, and I didn’t believe anything he said. I knew who he really was when my parents backs were turned. \nAlthough these were my thoughts at the time, I think, most of why I treated him so horribly was because I knew my parents liked him more than me. He was actually nice and I was a depressed screw up. I didn’t know how to fake it.\nThat was until the fateful day he brought us weed. My sister, him, and I went into the woods and smoked. That was when I realized that I needed something from him. So, I tolerated him. He kept lying to my family, and I’d get so angry but I couldn’t tell them who he really was or I wouldn’t be allowed to see him, thus cutting off my supply of drugs. \nHis cousin started coming around, and would bully my sister. She had a learning disability that rendered her socially awkward. She’s fine now, but he would bully her relentlessly. He called her disgusting, stupid, and told her no guy would ever want to screw her. Only recently have I discovered how badly that effected her. Still, I was a selfish twelve year old who didn’t care about anyone but myself. \nThen, about when I turned thirteen, I got desperate. I felt like I needed a boyfriend to have self worth So, I returned his romantic advances after a year. We kissed, and it was my first. Then, we stopped talking for a while. I got so angry and defensive. Why would he just kiss me and then leave and not talk to me?! So, the next time we talked, I told him I never wanted to see him again and he finally listened to me. \nFast forward to the summer, and I had a huge attitude change. I cried and begged my mother for forgiveness, my dad, my sister, and I did everything I could to change. Life got pretty dark from there, but I faced it with a smile and tried to be positive and selfless. I wanted to live. I wanted to make it up to my family, and I wanted to change and be good. Perhaps, I didn’t deserve forgiveness, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to get out of that slump I stayed in for two years. I stopped cutting myself (yes I did that) Although, I still get tempted to do it. Stupid endorphins... \nI must have been thirteen when I saw Gene again. It had been a long time, and I was with my friend and sister. I told them that I wanted to talk to him, and I tried to apologize to him for what I said. He was awkward, and I wasn’t sure what was wrong. I guess I figured he’d either forgive me or just mutter whatever and leave. I wanted to talk to him further so I asked if I could come over. He said sure, and when I got there, his cousin and two others were there. \nThen, I did something I will forever regret. I got drunk. He and his cousins were taunting me that I couldn’t handle it, and so I got drunk. It was horrible. My apology was ruined because I screwed it up. My sister came later and the same thing happened to her. So, we stumbled home, our parents caught us and yelled at us. \nI tried one more time to apologize and he wouldn’t hear me. He told me to just leave like I did so many times to him. I went home, cried, and got a text from his mom, apologizing. She called me beautiful and told me things would get better. It was weird to hear that from an older woman, just sympathizing with me and telling me that I could get better. It gave me a lot of hope that even past those two years, I could move on. I cried a lot and decided that even if I felt guilty, he wouldn’t hear my apology, and I had to move on. I had done everything I could, but it was over. \nThat was the last time I ever saw him and I hope it stays that way. I know we were both stupid kids, but I can’t help but feel completely overwhelmed with guilt, shame, confusion, hurt, and regret. \nSo, tell me something, Reddit. Did I deserve what I got? Did everyone suck in this situation. Do I deserve forgiveness or did I really hurt this boy? I honestly believe I didn’t as he was pretty heartless. Whenever he got “upset” it was obviously an act. So, I kind of just thought everyone sucked, and I didn’t actually hurt him. Was he completely innocent? You guys tell me. \n",

Also mobile here so sorry in advanced for the text block. \n\nSo I have a very close group of friends, 3 of us have know each other since middle school, I'll call the other 2 A and B. As everyone's leaving for college, A and his girlfriend (C), who is also a very close friend and on her own a definite part of the group, break up. Me, B, C, and another girl from the group (D) get pretty close after that. We plan a road trip to see each other's campuses and get everyone home for break, just the 4 of us. Between planning and taking the trip, I learn from other friends that A has taken the breakup terribly. Still doing bad months after the fact. We don't cancel the trip, as reservations are already made and we're still friends beyond the fact that A and C dated. A doesn't know anything about the trip, but has accused both me and B of trying to sleep with C on some very flimsy reasons. Based on those overreactions, I have no desire to tell A about this trip, AITA? ",

      "description": "This is going to be a bit long, so I apologize and will try to be as organised as I can. \n\nI dated someone for less than a month before ending things. To be clear, this person was a really sound human being, all-round good bean, which is one reason why I feel like a huge assehole. The other reason is long and convoluted, which I will explain below:\n\nI have mental health issues that affect my ability to feel romantic and sexual desire. I have struggled with depression since I was 12, but my mom beat the shit out of me for saying I was depressed, so I never sought help, and I may have developed anxiety along the way as well.\n\nAlso, I find it quite difficult to identify my feelings a lot of the time. I just feel an undifferentiated wall of static. It gets a bit troublesome in the sense that sometimes, I know that people probably expect me to feel and react a certain way to something e.g. major news, family crises, but all I feel is the wall of static, so I try to logically reason out what I should be feeling at a particular point in time, and then display the appropriate emotion.\n\nThis tends to complicate romantic attachments. Usually my feelings for people are quite ambiguous and can be reasoned away. \n\nThis worked up to the point I met this person. I was attracted to him and it was reciprocated. I decided to go for it because it felt more unambiguous and I thought it might be fun. Also (and this is where the potential assholery begins) I was feeling slightly reckless and I was sick of my life and I liked the idea of having a boyfriend and a separate life from my abusive mother.\n\nSo we started a relationship. I told him right off that I had issues but I wasn't sure how bad they were and he said okay. It turned out to be very not okay, because I was incredibly stressed out whenever I was with him, and unable to handle any kind of physical affection whatsoever (like hugs or holding hands) (physical contact is a bit uncomfortable for me because of the childhood abuse). I could tell he was hurt by this, but he didn't push it. \n\nIt reached a point where I was doing all I could not to have panic attacks when we went out on dates; he could tell and it was making him miserable. Whatever feelings I had for him just dissolved into a wall of static. I tried my best to be normal and cheerful on dates but I wasn't sure if he was fooled. Eventually I gave up and ended things. \n\nI feel like a huge asshole for inflicting my mental problems on someone else. He didn't do anything to make me uncomfortable and in fact tried his best to accommodate me. And I feel useless for giving up after less than a month, where a better person would have tried harder to make the relationship work. I'm not sure whether or not I'm an asshole, because as shitty a situation as this is, I had no way of knowing it would turn out this badly. (I hadn't dated previously.) AITA? ",

      "description": "So I cashier at a grocery store that also sells a multitude of gift cards. These gift cards range from 10-500 dollars.\n\nWell yesterday, the oldest woman I have ever seen comes in. I noticed her because she was also the slowest moving person I had ever seen. She hobbled past my register and isn't gone long before she comes back with a handful of gift cards. I think nothing of it at first because they get bought a lot as gifts, and I'm like \"oh she probably just wants 20 on each\" or some other reasonable amount.\n\nNope.\n\nShe throws down 4 Amazon gift cards and says \"I want 500 on each of these\" and I asked her if she was sure. She said yes. So i scanned the first one and she pulls out a fat bank envelope filled with what appeared to be exclusively 100 dollar bills. I scan the second and an error message pops up. I take a deep breath of relief because this means I need to get a manager. I walk over and tell my manager what's up and she agrees that it's a little sketchy. She calls the store manager over, and at this point I'm very happy because I figure it's gonna be resolved and this lady will be okay.\n\nSo he comes over and looks at the situation and asks the lady very kindly \"Hello, ma'm, I just wanna make sure no one told you to pay them with these.\" She tries to interrupt but he continues, \"You know there are all sorts of scams people do,\" and at this point she goes \"I know! I know! I've already fallen for those twice.\" And he just looks at me in bewilderment. It was apparent she was getting agitated, and wanted us to continue. Reluctantly he waved me forward and she paid for the first card in cash. I scan the second and an error message pops up. We can't scan anymore cards! It's a scam blocking thing that prevents large amounts of cards to be purchased all at once. I see my boss visibly ease up, as do I. She was a little angry but it didn't really seem like she knew what was going on. \n\nI still feel guilty about her definitely losing that $500 and who knows what more if she went some place else. I feel like I could have done or said more to inform her, but she was quickly growing irritated. So, Am I The Asshole? \n\n",

We'd always say hi, talk about work, talk about some mutual interests (language barrier not insurmountable). But on Christmas he gives me a store-bought card with an obviously romantic illustration on the front. Inside, all in Spanish, he wrote a very touching paragraph about how much he admires my work ethic and smile, and how we are great friends. He also gave me a soccer jersey (though I never mentioned sports to him).\n\nI didn't stop talking to him then, even though the gifts were unusual. I thought \"it's harmless, very touching, but I never intend to reciprocate that kind of affection. Maybe he's just an old eccentric Mexican guy and this is his way of being nice. After all, the rest of our coworkers get along with him just fine.\"\n\nValentine's Day was near, and on my break he comes up to me and starts asking me if I like perfume and chocolates. At this point, I do a complete 180 from my previous thinking and tell him (roughly)  that those kind of gifts I can only accept from my boyfriend (I'm single), and I don't want anything from him. \n\nFrom that point on, I haven't exchanged a word with him.\n\nI feel on one hand that perhaps the language barrier and my cynicism caused me to ruin a friendship.

Also if you need this to be NSFW, I'll do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo\n\nMy bf and I have been together for 3y now. I love him, and he loves me too.\n\nWe never loved each other at the same level. He's the kind of boy who likes his gf as much as videogames, his passion, or his friends. And I'm the kind of gf for whom his bf is the best thing ever. And this is something I learned to live with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, we've had a lot of troubles about sex since the beginning of our relationship. For months, 2y ago, he never wanted to have sex nor to talk about it. During this period I felt so hurt because it felt like he didn't desire me. Time passed, and we started having a sexlife again. We were seeing each other once a month(he was far from me), so, everytime we met, we used to make it, and were happy to.\n\nBut now, we've been living together. Life is good. We laugh, we share our passion, even if we also argue a lot.\n\nSomehow, there is smthg making this life seem.. fake ? = I feel like we act like friends, or \"kids\" only cuddling.\n\nOFC, sex is not everything !! But this is something I can only have and WANT to only have with him. But he does not. He only make love to me when he needs to fulfill his \"natural need\" of sex. But whenever I want to have sex, he refuses. And it makes me feel so ashamed of myself and of my body. I feel so bad for not being able to make him feel desire for me. I feel like the baddest gf for not being able to be cute and attractive to my own bf. To me, he's the most handsome and attractive man ever!\n\nI try my best everyday to be the best gf he could have, and to make him happy. But he never did the same (which I got used to)  And this made me feel like a dog doing his best for his master but not receiving anything from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, everytime he refuses  (For 3 times in 3 weeks, he refused to make love twice. The only time he wanted to make it is when HE asked me for it (the \"natural need\" I was talking about earlier) ) I get really sad and hurt, and ofc, I act this way, which make him rly mad, and we argue. Everytime. I'm hurt, and he's mad, telling me I'm asking for it in a bad moment. The last time I asked for it was last friday. It was our 3rd couple anniversary, so I thought we'd make it. But he didn't want to, saying it wasn't the right moment to do it because he had to sleep early to be ready for a videogame tournament with friends we had during the following WE. Our couple anniversary was not the moment, just like Valentine's day wasn't the moment, and like his birthday.\n\nBeside this, he's a kind bf most of the time. He hugs me, kisses me, and is cute and funny.\n\nI'm driving crazy because of all of this, and I'm developing a hatred of myself.\n\nSo, people on Reddit, PLEASE, HELP ME. I need to have clear opinions on all of this. Now that you have the context : Am I the asshole for feeling hurt &amp; ashamed when he refuses to have sex ?",

      "description": "I’ll start this off by saying I don’t really care what people do in the shower on their own time. I know a lot of guys pee in the shower, and girls do too. If you wanna pee, or brush your teeth, or masturbate, or whatever you wanna do in your own shower, more power to you. \n\nBut my boyfriend and I live together, and we often enjoy showering together. We have a fairly large shower and enjoy each other’s company.\n\nAnyway, more than once now he has decided to pee in the shower while I’m in it. I’ve asked him not to do it. I even asked him not to do it today directly before he did it, but he did it anyway. He stands to the side and aims for the drain, but I still can’t help but think some of it gets mixed with the water swirling around the floor of the shower and I don’t like it. \n\nSo after he did it today, I got out of the shower right away and haven’t been speaking to him since. I know I could solve this by taking my own shower separately, which I do sometimes, but I do like showering together sometimes and id really appreciate if he wouldn’t pee in there while we’re together. Am I overreacting? ",

      "description": "Everyone in this story is American btw.\n\nI went out to eat with some friends a few days ago. The restaurant was pretty empty because we came in around 2pm on a weekday and we got seated right away. We sat for about 10 minutes with nobody taking a drink order until a girl came over and apologized saying she wasn't our waitress, but she thought we were waiting a while and she would find him for us. 10 minutes later our waiter comes out stoned out of his mind and mumbles a few questions at us and we order. We finished eating without ever seeing him again and we had to ask someone at the front to get us our checks which were supposed to be separate but were all messed up. We sorted it out ourselves and I refused to tip him because he did way below the minimum I would expect from someone. My friends over tipped because they thought I was being a dick. I understand working a shitty job and not caring about it at all so I didn't complain to anyone about him, but is tipping really mandatory in this case?",

      "description": "Me (F 28) and my BF (25) met online and have known eachother for over a year before meeting, and then started it serious.We've met several times after that. Lately, I've started having concerns about our long term compability. \n\nOne of the concerns is how I feel he is not very independent. He has never lived alone or with anyone except his family. He doesn't cook or clean anything but his room. He doesn't do grooceries, budget, laundry or anything I was taught and grew up with. If I wanted specific groceries or food, I would fix this, while he complains. \n\nIt's not necessarily his fault, I don't think his mother has ever wanted him to do any of this. She cooks dinner every day and seems to fix all grown up everyday things. \n\nAs the relationship progressed I've been clear that I do not want long distance for a long time, and now I have worries about how it would be if we moved in together. Many of them he is very open towards and we talk well about it, but this 'independency' thing does not go well with him.\n\nHe says he feels like I'm calling him helpless, even though I say that the thing is we just don't know how it would be - but that's it important for me to try and find out. I suggested he maybe try and do some cleaning, groceries, make some food. He think's I'm overthinking it and overreacting, and feels I'm talking down to him. \nI'm trying really hard not to, but it's not an easy subject to talk about. \n\nIs it wrong of me to suggest and want him to put effort into doing these things where he lives now? (with his mother) I don't want to risk having to do and teach him all these things if we live together, or finding out he does not like it and me ending up feeling like I need to do it all. ",

      "description": "Throwaway account and posting this on my phone, so formatting might be bad. \nI am a 19 year old, who currently studies and i spend most of my free time what is offered to me out of studies on my pc. My parents and brother are very strict on everything what i do, going from what do i do on my personal time, financial decisions and limiting my time on certain things i do on my spare time. For context, In the past, i was a student with awful grades, but not with any behavior issues or anything, just very lazy because i wasnt interested in the classes i took really. They didnt care about my performamce, but still liked to control my time to some extent on what i did on my own. Ever since i failed those past 2 years, everyone in my family took a super strict turn to everything on what i did thanks to those 2 failed years. They started going through my phone (looking at my personal things, mind you without permission and by bypassing my lockscreen). They wont allow me to make any financial decisions when i would have liked to get something for myself with my money (going as far as saying gifted money is not even yours, every single collected amount ive gotten now is in my mothers hands) without consulting my brother to see if i can buy it. I cant use any of my electronic devices for more than 3-4hours a day in the evening from 6-10pm, if i go overtime by even a single minute, im banned from my PC for a week and that includes no studies done on it. If i get a single bad grade, even if its out of my control, i cant use any of my electronics for the duration until its fixed. I have to literally ask permission to go over to my friends house if i wanted to. \nI live with my brother, im not allowed to move to the dorms, live with a friend or rent anything for myself. I have no freedom.\nI have tried to talk about it to anyone in my family, but nobody is on my side to get a little more freedom on things i do, going as far as calling me an asshole for being ungrateful that they kept me up this good and helped me keep my grades up. Ive been keeping my GPA on 4.3 since i started all over again for them to see im working hard and school even giving stipends to me every month for my good progress, only to see nothing changing. \nReddit, AITA for wanting more personal room for things i can do, after the 2 years i've wasted?\nP.S i know this post is messy and might have some typos and such but i had to write this in a hurry.",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to take care of my mentally disabled half-sister?",
      "description": "Recently my mom has decided that she no longer want to look after my 20 year old low-functioning half-sister anymore and have passed that responsibility onto me.  without my input at all. My sister is severely mentally impaired. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. I don't know much about her condition as I have never been around her much (i'll explain this later) but from what I know she has never sought any sort of treatment for her and pretty much sheltered her for her whole life.\n\nSo, let me give a little bit of context here to the situation. My parents got divorced when I was 5 because of my half-sister. My dad was overseas when she was conceived (doesn't take a Guinness to put that together) and my mom decided she wanted a new life so she walked out on me and my father. The divorce was quick and in the end she voluntarily signed over full custody of me. I really don't feel like elaborating on this so i'm gonna move on. After the divorce my mom was remarried a month later and my sister was born. I knew almost nothing about her for 10 years after when my mom decided she wasted back in my life (she has made it clear she only wanted me \"back\" because my sister was mentally handicapped). You can tell I never accepted her back. \n\nSo, outside of a passing relationship i've never associated with my mom or sister, until about a month ago. My mom's husband is retiring this year and they want to move to Hawaii. Well, that's gonna be hard with my sister so my mom has decided it's my turn to take care of her. She called me up and told me that she no longer can take care of her and that i **need** to take her in and take care of her. I knew very little about my sister besides the fact she was mentally disabled (since my mom came back I've seen my sister maybe 3 times a year. Every time it was obvious she was \"not there\". I didn't know though how bad it was) so I decided to investigate. It turns out my mom pulled her out of school early to home school her. Along with this, my mom apparently still treats my 20 year old sister like she's a baby and has sought no help for her what so ever. \n\nWell, seeing this along with my relationship to them, I declined. Well,  ever since then my mom has been raising hell. She claims i'm \"betraying my blood\" and that I'm a horrible person for turning down my sister. \n\nI'm not crazy right? She cut me out of her life for her new family and now only wants me to take responsibility when she is tired of it. Am I wrong. Is there some kind of unwritten rule about this i'm breaking? Am I an asshole for this?",

      "description": "(This isn’t my story but my aunt’s, who asked me to post it here cause she needed other people’s opinions)\n\nI’m pregnant and should be due in a few weeks or so. I learned a while back that my baby was a girl and therefore chose her name in consequence. The only ones that are privy to this information are me and my husband and I’ve refused to share it with anyone else given that sharing your baby’s name prior to their birth is bad luck. \n\nOddly enough, my older sister has been deeply hurt by this, bringing up many times the fact that she had done everything for me during my pregnancy, from letting me live under her roof despite the fact that she had 4 children (forcing them to all sleep in a room meant for 1 person) and that she severely lacked space already. She helped me get my appointments and it is true that if she hadn’t been there for me, I’d most likely have lost my baby. \n\nShe said that she wasn’t asking for much, just wanted to know I trusted her and actually cared about the fact that she helped me but I don’t know, I think she’s just being selfish ? I didn’t ask her to help me, nor did I force her to pack her kids in one room and let me stay there for 2 months. I’m obviously grateful for it but now she’s making a huge deal of me not wanting to tell her my daughter’s name when nobody else knows. She even brought up the fact that I hadn’t made any effort to go see her ever since I left her home, but once again, I’m pregnant and she has a lot of kids so her house is very loud which makes me not want to go there. Couldn’t she just visit me if she wanted to see me ? \n\nTLDR : My older sister is angry at me for refusing to tell her my future child’s name because I think it’s bad luck\n\n",

      "description": "A month and a bit ago I (25f) moved into my bfs (25) room, with the knowledge that I'm only staying here for about two months as I leave to go back home to the UK soon. I hadn't a job at this point but we split everything else from groceries to activities outside of the house. I offered to help him around the house, keeping communal areas clean, doing laundry and to tidy his room occassionally.\n\nA few weeks after moving in he asked me to tidy his room. There were like empty bottles and a couple of dirty plates around that I washed or threw away, and other general messes dealt with. When I clean I like to do the job well, skirting boards are dusted, vacuumed under the bed, reorganise to make it neater that sorta thing.\n\nThis morning (a month after) I was wanting to get up and go, it's one of the few days that we both have a day off and can enjoy doing something together. He had gotten back from work much later than usual last night, but I bought him a coffee and we watched TV together. Just as I was persuading him to get ready to go out he started looking for some scrap paper and got angry he couldnt find any. \n\nI realise that it's my fault and I should of asked, I apologised and know that he is tired and probably not in the best mood. I offered to help him replace the things I had moved or at least create a new place so he knew where things were. But he wouldn't help me help him and started yelling that I was in the wrong and that I had to fix it. I hadn't really noticed how different I had made it so was unable to start. I left saying I didn't want this, and that I wanted to spend my day doing something and he could come with me or not. \n\nHe's phoned me a lot since, telling me that I need to apologise and that my apology was weak and that I needed to make it up to him. The phone call are heated I've been calling him an ass, saying I was trying to be an adult sorting my own mistake, he saying that I am really in the wrong and if I were to ask anyone that they would react the same as him. I can't help but laugh when he says that Im not trying hard enough but when I ask what he would like me to do he hasn't any idea. But what's hurting the most is that he's saying I'm manipulating him that I'm making him look worse than he is.\n\nI just don't know anymore ",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for formatting issues.\n\nI have Tourette Syndrome, but my tics are relatively subtle. It’s mostly facial and neck tics for motor tics and humming and tongue clicks for vocal ones.\n\nIt’s entirely possible for me to suppress tics, but it’s kinda like suppressing a cough or sneeze in that it’s pretty unpleasant. If I suppress them for too long, I’ll have an episode of intense ticcing including hand and less subtle vocal tics.\n\nPeople have expressed annoyance at me on several occasions about humming and clicking my tongue in class. While I could stop in theory, suppressing it for two hours straight would be extremely difficult and lead to worse situations after class.\n\nMy perspective is that it’s not realistic for me to put myself through that every day, but I also understand that my classmates all payed for the classes. Like I said, my tics are so subtle and quiet that most people don’t notice them at all, but those who do can get annoyed and distracted. I’m not sure how I can focus on learning if I’m spending the class trying not to hum. AITA?",

      "description": "So I've lived with my roommate for over a year now, we are very similar and the house was great until her daughter (18f) moved in a couple months ago. Her daughter has very poor hygiene which has caused quite a bit of discomfort for me since I have normal human expectations for cleanliness and she has none.\n\nWe have two full bathrooms but the one upstairs is significantly nicer because I updated it when we moved in. Her daughter likes to use the upstairs bathroom but she does not clean up after herself. She leaves fecal matter on the toilet seat, hair covering the tub every time she shaves and throws her clothing in the middle of the floor after she changes. Not to mention she's always sick; she had hand foot and mouth disease, a stomach bug and the flu all within the last month. I'm convinced this is because she doesn't have good hygiene and I'm paranoid I'm going to catch something from her despite my overly cautious frequent sanitizing of the area.\n\nI (26f) want her to use the downstairs bathroom as I'm tired of feeling like I need to wear a hazmat suit in my own living area. Her mother (43f) wants to believe her child can do no wrong and refuses to have a hygiene talk with her.\n\nAITA if I demand she stops using the upstairs bathroom ?  I may request that her mother pay a larger portion of the rent if they don't agree. We're still splitting it two ways even though she now has an extra person living with us. ",

So I’m eating the cookies when all of a sudden one of my long time friends comes up and asks me for some cookies. I reply no, mostly because the cookies are pretty expensive. More come up, and I give the same response.\n\nFlash forward today: I still have the cookies, and I’m walking up to my friends. The Girl Scouts are sick, and my friends want some cookies. Even though they know that I want to keep them, they still want my cookies, so they start bargaining with me, trying to get one for some 30 cents. I start to get annoyed, and I ask them to stop. Instead of understanding, they start to get mad  at me and give me excuses on why I have to give them some. I ignore them and leave.\n\nI feel really bad, because they’re such nice friends, but they also got mad at me because I didn’t give them any cookies. I just feel guilty. What should I do?",

She said I was just \"giving excuses not to do it\".\nThat's the second time this happens. Also over food, it doesn't happen with anything else, the last time she said I always make a big deal over driving when she doesn't live that far and she would do it for me (this last part is true but she doesn't really cook or does sharable things if that is a word so it's not like it would happen).\nI'm very curious on the veredict, I'm trying to give both of our point of view so you guys can judge better:\n1- In my point of view she has a bit of anxiety and wants thing whenever she pleases and should control that. Getting a free cake a few hours later isn't a big deal. \n2 - She drives a lot so driving my house to hers shouldn't be a big deal, it's a 15 min drive (just to go), not actually that long, but put the time I'm going to spend making a free cake she should be more considerate.

      "description": "Preface: I know it's a niche subject but I think I need an outside view. If I skipped anything important or need to clarify or explain anything just ask.  \n  \nI've had a hypnosis fetish my whole life [28M]. It's hard to explain but I don't think there's a logical reason so I don't think too much about the why. My senior year of high school, my science teacher showed me the magnet fingers bit and it just started an obsession for me. I started reading every book I could find and practicing on anyone who would put up with me. Even ended up taking some classes, too. By my second year of college I had become pretty good and would frequently be asked to hypnotize people at parties (always simple, non-sexual things like name amnesia, sticking hands/feet, whatever...). Some people even started avoiding looking me in the eye lol  \n  \nAnyways, I always wanted to keep learning and made some friends online who, like myself, were into the sexual side of hypnosis (i.e. r/erotichypnosis). During that time I had decent success doing some phone sessions and selling a handful of recordings - it really boosted my confidence and self esteem. I don't do that anymore, and basically drifted away from the scene when college got more intense and the job hunt started up. While I was active though I made two pretty close friends: a mid 40s woman who taught me a lot (she's clinically trained) and a mid 20s woman who used to be a subject. We share other interests too, like music, cooking, and gardening. Both are strictly online friendships, we email a couple times a month just about general life stuff but they'll also occasionally send me scripts they're working on to ask for a male perspective. They're both currently professional hypnodoms.  \n  \nI didn't really think anything of this (sort of like penpals) but I recently (few months ago) got into a relationship [26F] and she wants me to cut off all contact. She knows I'm a hypnotist and it's part of our bedroom life, I've told her before I have a couple webfriends who are professional hypnodoms and at the time she didn't say anything against it - she actually said “oh, so that's where you get your ideas”. But today she saw me reading a script the younger one had sent me. For context, the session was supposed to get the guy extremely turned on but unable to use their hands (use your imagination, woof). In her words I'm “basically friends with two prostitutes and you’re giving them sex tips”. I've never seen either in person, just a few times over webcam, and they both live in other countries. I understand the subject matter can sometimes be explicit but 80% of the time it's just normal stuff like “hey I went to Disneyland!”  \n  \nI've told her that I would stop reading over scripts or giving them hypnosis tips or effect suggestions, basically anything that could be considered PG-13+, but that wasn't good enough and she wants me to completely ghost them. They're nearly 10 year friendships and I feel really bad when I think about never hearing from them again. I even let my girlfriend read through every email we've ever sent just to show I'm not cheating or anything. I think it made things worse.  \n  \nI just don't know, I'm so conflicted. Am I the asshole?  \n  \ntl;dr - I'm friends with two professional femdom hypnotists and my girlfriend wants me to cut off all contact.",

I can't remember too many specific occurrences growing up but I always hated him, especially for the way he treated my mom, constantly gaslighting her and making her cry all the time.\n\nWhen I was around 14, my father got arrested for possession of child pornography and went to prison for two years. Mom stayed with him. A while later I started developing severe mental issues including an anxiety disorder and spent two years unemployed while finding the right medication since I was afraid to even leave the house. She was the only employed person in the house so money was tight. \n\nNow my father has served his sentence and is back home on parole. We're allowed internet in the house only because we put a motion through to parole since my only friends were online and my therapist thought it would be bad for my mental health if I lost contact with them. Dad's employed as a cook, mom works two jobs, and I am finally getting better again and even have a part time job that may become full-time soon. I help pay rent and pay for my healthcare and medical bills.\n\nThe thing is, though, Mom talks a lot about how stressful things are for her. She hates if I even bring up things like taking our dog to the vet since she says we have no money, even though I always offer to pay. And then there's her interactions with dad. As a kid I always  stood up for her and tried to protect her when dad would turn on her, which usually pissed dad off and made him accuse us of always ganging up on him. I always stood up for her hoping that one day shed see how unhappy her marriage was making her and leave, with me in tow. I thought the arrest would be the final nail in the coffin, but she stayed. And while he is better now, they still get into fights like that and she still gets really upset but I've stopped standing up for her. I feel like i can't help but feel a little betrayed and stuck. I wasn't an adult when she made the choice to stay and when I finally was an adult, I ended up with severe mental problems that kept me from leaving myself. I had no choice in the matter.\n\nNow when she complains about how stressed she is I find myself not paying attention. It feels like she made her choices and now she has to live with them. We're still friends and we like to go and travel together and do fun things together but it all feels different now. And recently she's been trying to get me to apply for a car loan because we only have two cars and I keep having to take Lyft and I'm the only one in the house with a good credit score, but I put my foot down on that because I don't want to apply for one. \n\nI want to feel bad for her because I think that's the right way to feel, but I just can't anymore. I feel like she chose to add all this stress to her life, and mine, and I never got a say in it. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for going on stress leave and writing an email critical of my boss?",
      "description": "I’m on stress leave from a management job. My workload, which already included a high level of responsibility and heavy workload increased in demands several times over a few years, with me telling my boss it was too much a couple times and her only offer of “help” was to ask me to work more hours, which I was not able to do. I’d been seeing a psychologist to manage the stress, but I was barely holding on.   Lots of anxiety and serious physical health issues. Then my boss resigned and told me the plan was to have me take on more of her workload. I told her I couldn’t and that my psychologist had been suggesting it was in my best interest to go on stress leave. Then I did go on leave. I assume she was pissed. Her boss (ED) emailed me asking how I was doing. I wrote and rewrote a response, but was in such poor mental health that I was breaking down and fighting off a panic attack while trying to.  I realized I wasn’t in the right state of mind to write ED back, so sent the draft to my inbox, planning to revisit it once in a healthier mindset, and after my boss had moved on. Admittedly I hoped to use my boss as a reference if I apply for a less stressful job and wanted to keep things civil for my benefit. After a few days, I decided not to send it at all, and to instead talk to ED closer to when my doctor thinks I’m ready to return in several months. My boss texted me mentioning herself or another manager would be checking my emails while I was off.  I replied that that was fine.  I thought I had sent the draft email to my personal account, but it was in fact sitting in my work inbox. \n\nMy boss contacted me asking if she could give someone trying to get in touch with me about work related questions my personal contact info. I said no and asked her to tell them to contact my term replacement once they’re in place.  I assume she was also pissed about this, but I need space and time to recover.  Yes, I am ducking responsibilities, but it’s the stress related to work that is making me ill. \n\nMy boss did go in and read that email, and assumed I had meant to send it to ED and forwarded it to her.  ED emailed me letting me know this should never have happened, that she was sorry, that more should have been done to respect my needs, etc. \n\nI feel disloyal to my boss, and shitty I had to go on leave and not be there to help with the transition.  I’m sure her perceiving I was ratting her out feels like shit. It was her assumption that lead to ED actually seeing the email, although the things said in it would have been close to what I would have eventually said anyway. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for losing sexual attraction towards my boyfriend and feeling depressed because he used to be in excellent shape but has been gaining weight ever since?",
      "description": "When we met 5 years ago, my boyfriend was a martial arts instructor and he was exercising at the dojo 3 times a week. But then he started to work full-time hours since he wanted to be more independent. He hated the job, gained weight on an antidepressant and hardly ever had enough energy to workout anymore. A few years later: he hasn't lose that weight. Eventually, he was only doing martial arts on Fridays. Perhaps I should have forced him to go to the gym with me as much as possible instead of just sitting around with him. That could have made a difference. We only ever went about once a week and neither of us stopped eating unhealthy food. I know we (boyfriend and I) are both responsible for his weight gain to some extent. But nevertheless, I remember how attracted I used to be to him. And if it makes any difference: I would never allow myself to gain fat like that. It would bring me constant shame everyday. (Extra Details: He has love handles now and his face has gotten a little chubby. I used to love the shape of his face: it was like a cute little heart). Maybe this all sounds dumb...but now, I feel sad whenever I look at him. When we first met, I thought he was the sexiest man I'd ever seen outside of a T.V screen. It's not like he's hideous now, but I definitely don't feel as attracted to him as I used to be. He seems to be saying \"Well I wouldn't let it bother me if you got a little fat. So, it shouldn't bother you if I do.\" He calls me shallow for it. That he could probably find another cute girl who wouldn't care. Is it wrong of me to be upset? What would you guys do in this situation?",

      "description": "So I spend a lot of time in what you could call a little community on discord. Most of the people in said community are British but a few of us aren't, me included. (I also speak Dutch) There's one other person who's Dutch so sometimes we make inside joke.\nA friend(she's British), said on discord, with no context: \"I am some famous football guy's name \".\nAs to which I reply in dutch: \"footballer's name is een kut ventje\" which literally translated means \"footballer's name is a cunt guy\" but figuratively I was just calling him a prick. (Could be interpreted as asshole)\nShe asked if I called her a cunt. As to which I replied no, because I didn't call her anything. But quickly after also added that I \"technically did\". I continue to explain. I saw no problem with what I said. It was just a silly comment to me.\nLater I find out she blocked me on discord and removed me from a few other online media but not on facebook. So I confront her about it. I wasn't sure if it had to do anything with it, she told me it did. I still felt like I didn't really do anything wrong because I thought I explained it. I apologised and explained again. That it wasn't even aimed at her and that it was just a little inside joke between me and the Dutch friend. (We all often call each other random rude things but we know we don't mean it and we're all good friends)\nShe said \"I don't give a fuck what you say to the others, but speak fucking english to me unless you want me to badly translate it and take it for face value. you don't know if i've had a good day or a bad day, so maybe use your brain and apply some diplomacy to the shit you come up with\"\nAt this point I felt offended. I replied with: \"We all have shit days. But I can't smell that. I admit that maybe I was a bit rude and I will avoid speaking in a foreign language to you in the future. But given that I made it clear what I said/meant I don't think it warrants you being annoyed at me/ignoring me for the days after. I think given that I explained myself I don't see any issues, other than that I should avoid it in the future.\"\nshe replied back with: \"i mean you know how i feel about some guy (he talks to her like me and the other guys talk to each other, as explained earlier) and you didn't even apologise so i don't know what you expect\"\nI replied saying I didn't fully understand how she felt then and told her I didn't apologise the day before because I didn't think it was upsetting at all. And that I didn't feel like apologising yet again.\nThe last thing she said was: \"Okay\" and I haven't talked to her since just over a week ago.\nBesides the AITA, any advice on how I should go about it next, and how to handle this type of stuff in the future?",

      "description": "Background:Xmas Eve I had emergency surgery that involved me hemmoraghing to the point of coding due to blood loss because of a mishandled ectopic pregnancy. This had been going on from Oct (when we found out) to Feb 5th (when I got off bedrest), &amp; I understand that that is a long time to deal with someone who is in constant pain. My ex left me the day of surgery and refused to visit me in the hospital, but approached me on my birthday later asking to stay friends.  This leads to the current issue. \n\nToday I drove him to a movie and dinner an hour from where we lived. On the drive home we were discussing things and ended up talking about kids and how the bits of me they had to remove have impacted my fertility. We discussed how he felt about the situation, which I listened to him &amp; tried to help him through things. I took that as a cue that I could talk about how this has affected me,the difficulties with sleeping &amp; nightmares that I've been having. He kept interrupting me &amp; bringing the conversation back to himself &amp; how it made him feel, so I just shut up &amp; resumed listening to him because he obviously needed to get everything off his chest... until he told me that him not coming to the hospital was my fault for being a bitch &amp; that I should be more concerned about how the situation made him feel.  \n\nI understand that I was not the best person during those months,that the pain made me a completely different person. I am just now starting to get back to my normal self. I have apologized so many times already &amp; taken him for food, shopping, &amp; pokego to try to make up for it.\n\nHe helped a lot during October and part of November, but when it was obvious that my condition was getting worse, he started avoiding me &amp; starting fights as a reason to leave.  I know that I'm an asshole for bringing that up &amp; calling him a coward for abandoning me when I needed him the most. He's hurting too &amp; I've tried to acknowledge it, but today I just kinda froze him out once I realized that he's not gonna listen to me about how I'm feeling &amp; trying to cope. \n\nWe'd been in a relationship for 2 years &amp; always said that we'd stay friends and try to help each other. Am I the asshole for trying to hold him to that promise &amp; get emotional support from him during this process while I wait to get into a therapist? I've been trying to listen &amp; be there for him, but today I failed hard &amp; I feel guilty as shit. I can't fix the past, but I can try to make it so that I cause him less pain in the future. \n\nTldr: I froze out my ex who is hurting because of my own pain &amp; trauma due to surgery. I'm trying but failing to listen to him &amp; his side of it without feeling attacked &amp; hurt.  Am I the asshole for trying to use him as an emotional support until I can get professional help?\n\n",

      "description": "My parents decided, out of the blue, to go on a cruise in July. They even invited another family to go, just so I’ll have someone to be with and not be lonely. The only problem is, I’ll be out of the country during my 1 year anniversary with my girlfriend because of this. She already made sure that her family’s vacation was pushed back a couple days so she can be with me on our anniversary. My parents probably already booked it, knowing them. I told them I don’t want to go, and told them why. All they told me was that I can spend time with my girlfriend when we come back, but I’ll only have one day until she goes on her vacation to Europe for 2 weeks. \n\nNow my parents are trying to guilt trip me to go, even if my girlfriend doesn’t go with us. They said she could go if she can, but knowing her mom she won’t be able to. Which really sucks. This leads me to believe that they didn’t book it yet, which is good. \n\nMy family’s great, but I honestly need a vacation from them sometimes. Based on countless family vacations, it’ll go down the same way as it has been the past 19 years. Not the best. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go, just because I don’t want to miss my 1 year anniversary? Formatting and grammar might be bad here, my apologies.

After every argument I have to endure I always chant to myself that I only have 3 years left till I can move away. \n\nNow my parents are extremely narcissistic and mentally abusive most of the time and I'm sure I've gained more than a few issues from them, but I can't help not wanting to hurt them. So when my mom brought up me wanting to move out during an argument, purely to guilt trip and manipulate me, it stung. She doesn't understand why I'd want to move out and and thinks that I'm trying to get away from her. Much like she did to her own abusive mother at 12.\n\nI do want to move away, maybe not as far away as possible but still at least a separate town. And I do want to move to get away from my family, particularly my parents. But I dont want my mom to think of me or her as a failure and take it out on my siblings or her health.\n\n I can tell shes trying her best and has recently been a decent mother for the most part, so it hurts even more during this time, maybe she'll get better eventually, but I can't bear to sit around and be her punching bag while she figures out how to be a good person on her own.

      "description": "## Note: My other post got deleted for being too long, so heres a shorter version.\n\nOkay, this isn't a single argument, but a string of arguments throughout my life.\n\nMy parents really want me to work as a doctor or nurse. They've been pounding their dream into my head. Before I was even ten, I was watching shows about autopsies and medicine. I wasn't bothered by the gore, but other then the dead bodies, I wasn't really interested.\n\nAnytime I show interest in another job my parents would get really mad. They would tell me that those kind of jobs were useless, and yell at me about how I could never live off those salaries, and how would I take care of my parents? I've never really gotten the chance to explore my interests, because I was scared of getting scolded. I don't think I would be good at anything anyway, so it's useless to try.\n\nI used to be really scared, or have no interest in any actives, other than drawing or writing. But, my parents don't really approve of those hobbies.\n\nI can't say no. I can't say no.\n\nEvery time, and I mean *every,* single, time, we pass by a homeless person, my mother goes off about how that person is suffering because they didn't pursue a job in the medical field. I now really hate thinking about the future, I get really scared thinking about my future after I complete high school. I don't even know what *I* want to do.\n\nI don't know if this kind of behavior is bad.. I've tried talking to my parents about how I feel, but it always ends up in me getting yelled at, and being told I'm spoiled, and don't know how to survive in the real world. I always get told that I'm going to starve to death, or become homeless. I get called a spoiled princess, or dismissed just because I'm young. I start breathing weird and my head feels weird thinking about that happening to me. I don't want to think. I don't.. My parents aren't abusive. They take care of me, and have never hit me.\n\nMy mother has admitted that she doesn't want me to have any other interests, other than medicine, and is purposely scaring me. She's claimed that she wants to chase out my dreams.\n\nThey love me. They just want to make sure I don't starve, and have a secure future. They might be going about this the wrong way, though.\n\nAnother problem, this is also affecting my little sister. They treat her similarly. I remember once she was really interested in the universe, and tried to excitedly talk about stars to my parents. My mother snapped at her, getting all serious, even though we were on vacation. She told my sister that astrology was useless. Apparently, astrologists live paycheck to paycheck, suffering. She also complained that astrology wouldn't help her and our father if they got sick. If I don't work in the medical field, how will I take care of my parents?\n\nTLDR: Parents scare us into working in the medical field, even though we don't really want to.",

      "description": "When I (20M) was in high school, there was this one kid (also my age 20M) who was a douche to me, from ages to 11 to 16 (he didn't stay on until Sixth Form). \n\nHe would always single me out and make me feel a bit shit. Back then I was overweight so he would mockingly say ''Got with any girls?'' fully knowing I clearly hadn't. He was just generally a dick to me.\n\nNow at university I've gotten a bit muscular and way more confident and loud. if anyone tries to give me shit now, I instantly call them out and confront them. \n\nNow I went back to a party of one of my high school friends in my hometown and the douchebag was there. Now I was social at this party, talking to everyone tho I did get a bit drunk as the night went on (though so did everyone).\n\nNow when I went to step outside for a cigarette, he was also there and we made convo, seemed normal and okay. But then he started to get a bit cocky like he used to, he started mocking me again ''Oh you getting girls now???'' with a sly grin on his face, I could tell he was mocking me (and before anyone says he wasn't, HE WAS, I know his facial expressions/tone, he was trying to do the exact same shit). \n\nI then said to him ''You have a problem with me? Cos I'm not going to do that shit in school where we did this passive aggressive shit. If you got a problem, tell me right fucking now''\n\nHe looked really startled and confused, and he said ''No man I was only messing''.\n\nI then spat on his face. He looked even more scared and confused. So then I couldn't help but laugh, and walked back inside.\n\nAll this time I was intimidated by this guy, he was always just a pussy. He wasn't really a bully just a douchebag, but I felt like I had so little respect for him as a human being, that he deserved to be spat on. \n\nMy friends found out i did this and most of them found it funny except one, he said it was too far AITA?",

      "description": "Here is some background: So I broke up with my ex a while ago and have been on tinder trying to get back out there. I matched with a guy and we hit it off. Our text convos were great and I find him attractive. \nHe confessed to me that he’s been catfished before and was wondering if I could FaceTime him to prove I’m authentic, I obliged, because I’m real. Before our scheduled FaceTime I did warn him I have a lot more acne than in my photos (all of them are over 2 months old) and that’s probably the only thing different about me. He said that was fine. \n\nSo as of right now we’ve met up 5 times. Every single date we’ve been on he has tried to tell me how to make my acne go away. The first time he gave me a suggestion I thanked him and told him I’ve tried tons of things and I’ve seen 6 different doctors about my acne and tried home remedies, etc etc. I also told him my acne doesn’t bother me. I am used to it. Also acne is just the least of my concerns right now. \n\nBy the third date I asked him to just stop mentioning my acne. He said he would. But on date 4 and 5 as well as in our texts he kept bringing it up! \n\nSo after our 5th date I sent him a text saying: “I don’t appreciate how you constantly talk about my acne. If you don’t stop, I will have to stop seeing you.” \nHe then called me and told me he was just trying to help so people don’t assume I’m dirty and don’t wash my face. And that I should appreciate all of his tips and that he cares enough to try and help me with my problem. \nI hung up on him and texted him telling him to leave me alone. \n\nSo reddit, I’ve told a few friends about this situation and they think I’m in the wrong and I should’ve been grateful for his “help” but I feel I had an appropriate response. So AITA for being upset and ending whatever me and this guy had because he wouldn’t stop talking about my acne?? \n\nAlso sorry if this is formatted wrong! Only my second post, still figuring this thing out. ",

      "description": " \n\nThis story all starts junior year of high school.  I was in this class with a girl who I didn’t really think much of.  She was pretty nice, but I would have never considered dating her or anything.  She’d talk to me(emphasis on she’d start talking to me) during class and i saw it as just regular high school chit chat.  I was fine with just being friends with her, and when I say friends, I mean mostly just classmates.  I should probably mention I’m a pretty withdrawn person.  Most of my social interaction came from the people in school and I’d rarely ever go to even my closest friends houses or hang out with them after school.  I could probably count the number of times I did throughout all of high school on my hands.  I’d say that I like to be friendly with everyone but not have very many close friends, it’s just too draining for me. \n\nFast forward to first quarter of senior year.  She texts me and asks if we should start dating.  I said no and we should just be friends.  I was completely serious about staying just friends, but then she texts that we should hang out more.  At this point, I didn’t know what to say.  As I mentioned earlier, I really don’t even hang out with my best friends after school that often and I really didn’t want to hang out with this girl after school, but I didn’t want to sound like a dick about it.  I kept panicking on what to say and so I eventually just didn’t say anything.  I still haven’t replied and this was about 2 years ago.  I think she  may have gotten the message that I didn’t like her but that wasn’t true, I just didn’t want to be super close friends, I mostly just wanted to stay classmates.\n\nThings were kind of awkward around her for the rest of the year.  Like I said before, most of the times we talked she was the one who started talking to me because I usually don’t start conversations with people, so when she stopped talking to me we both kind of stopped talking altogether.\n\nTo make things worse, we were in chemistry together first semester, and at the beginning of the year before all this happened I asked to switch to the other chemistry class because all of my closest friends were in that class.  The guidance counselor wouldn’t let me then because he wasn’t going to have me switch classes just to be with my friends.  I decided to wait until semester to switch because by that time he would have forgotten why I wanted to switch.  So it might have looked like I switched classes to avoid her.  At the time i didn’t think anything of it because I’m dense as hell but looking back on it I think I might have been an asshole.",

No big deal, right?\n\nWell my mom thinks it's a huge deal and keeps bringing it up just because I'm the first(and youngest) of our family to successfully go and get any sort of degree. I seriously have absolutely no interest. I'm very introverted so I do not want to do any of the socializing accompanied with it.

If I go to graduation, between practice and picking up my cap and gown, I'll have to go 2 or 3 times that week. \nGraduation is also on a night before I have work(have to get up at 4:30), and I'm running low on time off this year.\n\nMy boyfriend is on my mom's side, I should go and walk across the stage and what not, just to make her happy. \n\nMy grandmother is determined to somehow get my name and picture in the paper when I do not even want to send the school my photo to put on the screen for when they call my name. \n\nSo, tell me, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, so this is a weird post maybe. Anyway, I'm 18, and I've been playing guitar for close to 2 years. When I started I had very few friends, though somehow, over the last year or so I've grown a huge group of friends. This is great and all, but I feel like my guitar practice is suffering because of the social stuff, and I'm practicing to actually do something professionally. I'm already balancing work and social life, but when I'm out socializing I always feel like I'd rather play guitar. I used to practice intensely, like 6-7 hours a day, and I'd like to get back to that routine, since I want to get better.\n\nSo, I'm moving out on my own in a few weeks time, and this new place is pretty much ideal to practice guitar. I've made a plan to pretty much shut myself in and practice obsessively until I feel I've gotten the results I want, as well as to work on my guitar mods. The problem is that I feel like an asshole, since this is gonna mean that I'm probably gonna be completely cut off from my best friends for months, willingly at that, despite them not doing anything. Help a brother out, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for losing trust on my friends over a badly-done prank?",
      "description": "This is going to be a little long, so there's a TLDR at the beginning:\n\n**TLDR: My friends locked my bike to prevent me from leaving a party, now I feel I can't trust them to be honest with me and respect my boundaries.** \n\nStory time: I'm part of an urban cycling group. We get together, do night rides, and hang out. \n\nIn the last weeks of December we organized our Christmas party in a public park. People brought alcohol, and eventually nearly everyone was wasted, but since I don't drink I was sober.\n\nThere are three people relevant here: Guy A is one of the leaders of the group, he and I get along quite well. Girl A is a member of the group and one of my best friends there. Girl B was a member of another group that was there just for the party. I had never talked to her before, and my interaction with her was mostly her trying to teach me how to dance salsa. \n\nIt was a Tuesday night and I had to work the next day, so at two A.M I said I was leaving. Guy A immediately jumped to tell me I should stay longer an grabbed me, until I had to physically remove myself from him. Then Girl A and Girl B began grabbing me (in a playful kind of way, not violentlly) and chased me away (by the way, during this, I re-sprained a wrist injury I got a couple weeks before, so...). \n\nWhen I returned, someone had put an extra lock in my bike, making it impossible for me to leave. \n\nIt instantly killed the fun for me. Somehow I felt that I was being told \"you stay here whether you want it or not\", and I started getting angry. People floated the idea that the lock had been already there (It wasn't), maybe left by someone who had left already. \n\nThen they opened a box of presents from the group to the group, which were mugs with our names on them. They gave me mine, and Girl A insisted on getting the perfect photo of her and me holding our mugs, which required to get away from where the bikes were and taking like 20 pictures. And yes, I have 20 pictures of her and me holding our mugs. \n\nAnd when we returned, the lock was gone and no one had seen who did it. \n\nI went over the edge. That felt (and still feels) like a cowardly thing to do. Putting the lock may have been a prank, but putting it, letting me get angry over that and then removing it and not owning it up... it made me really upset. \n\nI gave them all a verbal dressing down and left immediately, and when I got home I sent an angry message over our group chat, basically telling them that I expect my friends to be able to respect my boundaries and to have the courage to take responsibility from their actions. Girl A and Guy A got also a message of their own. \n\n...and then I ignored their apologies. That, I think we all can agree, was an asshole move from my part. \n\nAnother guy in the group said he thought Girl B was the one who had put and taken off the lock. \n\nFast forward to this Friday. We got together for coffee, dinner and new year's cake (Mexican tradition). When we talked about the lock incident, everyone seemed to agree that it had been Girl B (though no one had said anything about her before) and that I should apologize for getting angry at them. \n\nI can accept that story for the sake of keeping the peace, but somehow I can't bring myself to believe it. It feels that they taking a scapegoat that they know I can't verify. Remember, I don't know Girl B and I have no way to confirm or deny it, and I find strange that suddenly everyone is pointing at her. \n\nAnd during all the time I was with them I felt closed off, disconnected, like I was with a bunch of strangers and couldn't really relax and let my guard down. It's usually quite difficult for me to open up with people and it took me quite long to be able to be myself with them, and being back to square one and feeling I can't trust them really really sucks. \n\nThere are two things I hate about this: First, the respect for boundaries. If I say I'm leaving (at two A.M, when I have to work the next day), I feel that it should be respected. And second, the whole cover up. Taking the lock behind my back and (what I see as) coordinating a story, makes me feel that the group only cares about not taking responsibility for something that made me upset.\n\nWe were kinda planning a trip to a music festival, and I realized that right now the last thing I want is to be close to them while they're drinking, with no way to leave if I want. \n\nWhat do you think, Reddit? Is my reaction justified, or am I overreacting and being paranoid?\n\n**TLDR: My friends locked my bike to prevent me from leaving a party, now I feel I can't trust them to be honest with me and respect my boundaries.** ",

Then as time passed the house became less appealing, becoming cluttered, dirty, smelly and generally not clean.\n\nI started hating it because it felt like everywhere I stepped was a stain or garbage. He's gotten better about cleaning up after my eldest sister moved out but now his dog is getting really old (about 11/12 now) and has trouble making it outside to do his business, so you can imagine the stains and smell that would come from not really cleaning up after him properly.\n\nOutside of his accidents, the house itself is just in bad shape. There's mold and grime that was there before he moved in, and it would most likely take a week of deep cleaning to get it where I'm comfortable with staying there.\n\nEverytime I bring up how much I dislike the house and how uncomfortable I am with staying there my dad jokes I don't love him and always ends up saying it's only for two days, and tonsuck it up.\n\nAm I overreacting or being an asshole for heavily disliking my dad's house and despising my dad's custody weekends because of my dislike?

      "description": "Before I start, first-time poster, on mobile, etc. \n\nSo from the title, it’s all like ‘No way! If you are eligible, you deserve it’ and all, but... I don’t know. I am a 13-year old female with a chronic illness called Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis. It’s an extremely rare type of auto-immune disorder, and only about 1 in 20-30,000 adults  have it. It’s even rarer in kids, and the kids have different symptoms. I put more links to info about it in the bottom. \n\nSome backstory on how I discovered it.\nLast summer, 2018, for 3 days, I felt awful. Throwing up anything I tried to eat, no appetite at all, sleeping about 18 hours a day. We went to Urgent Care, they told us it was just a virus, maybe stomach bug or something. Exactly two weeks later, it happened again. Three days, no appetite, slept. Then felt better. Doctor was out on vacation. The cycle happened 2 more times. They took some more blood tests and said they’d call with the results. As soon as the blood tests came in, they called us and asked why I hadn’t been admitted to the hospital yet. There were multiple red flags, but the biggest one was my inflammation marker was supposed to be between 1 and 10, mine was 140. Went to the Emergency room, IVs, the whole 9 yards. They didn’t know what was wrong, they released me. Over the next few months, they finally diagnosed me. Originally, they thought it was another autoimmune disorder, called Lupus, but all of the signs weren’t there. I got started on treatment, and the thing is- I feel completely normal. Yes, I’m on medicine, but I have absolutely no symptoms anymore. Sometimes I feel like it’s just this made-up thing and I have no reason to take medicine cause I feel fine. My treatment also contains infusions, with a heavy dose of something through an IV for 6+ hours. I am on my 5th one right now, they are split into 4 parts every 6 months.\n\nSo, into the am-I-the-asshole part. Today, during  my treatment, my doctor came in to check on me and told me that if I wanted, I was able to make a wish and have it granted because my disease is on the list of those recognized by the Make-A-Wish foundation. I was surprised. It’s not a terminal illness, and I feel like if I accept, and use it I am stealing from some 5-year old with cancer that’s going to die in two months, and I am a horrible person because I am selfishly using it, when it’s really not that serious and I’m not going to die. Yes, it’s chronic, but the doctors say most people go into remission within a few years. I would just be incredibly guilty if I stole someone’s wish that needed it more. My family if not exactly poor, either. We do travel quite a bit.\n\nAm I the asshole? Or am I just overthinking it? I will try to answer as many questions as I can.\n\n[info](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351088)\n\n[other link](https://www.stlouischildrens.org/conditions-treatments/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis)",

She is in her senior year of highschool, while he would have graduated college by now. \n\nHer parents don’t even know about her boyfriend’s existence because she knows they wouldn’t allow her to see him. I feel like I should also say that he doesnt show signs of being abusive or anything, but they do have sex and she thinks he has possibly given her genital herpes. They also smoke weed together pretty much every time they see eachother, which is something that my friend had been trying to do less of prior to their relationship. \n\nI really dont approve of their relationship, but every time I say something she makes me feel bad about it. She’ll say that I “hate every guy she’s with” and that I only disapprove because I “dont want her to have a boyfriend”. Is it unreasonable and rude of me to be bothered by their relationship? Or do I have reason to be put off by it?\n",

      "description": "BACKGROUND: \n\nI am 18m and my girlfriend is 17f. We have been dating for a little over a year. \n\nMy friends are 18f (T) and 19m (C), and I've known both of them for longer that I've known gf. We have also gone up north before, even before I knew gf, mostly just to play video games and do stupid teenager stuff. Once before I met gf, once at the very start of my relationship with gf. \n\nI met C in seventh grade, and three years ago C introduced me to T, and we have all been friends since. Nothing romantic or otherwise has happened between any of us, this is important later\n\nNow, over time my gf has become a big part in my life, resulting in me seeing my friends less and less. When they came to me about going up north again, I was excited, but there is one other issue. \n\nGf doesn't trust T. Gf thinks she flirts with me, and wants to sleep with me. Gf has asked me to do things like let her know when I'm seeing T (which I did anyways), and not to hang out with T one on one (which we didn't do much anyways, it was mostly all three of us, C, T, and I). I have assured gf over and over that I have no interest in T, and that in the instance where something did start, I would end it immediately. Despite this, she gets very mad at me whenever I see T and it makes me want to see her less and less in fear of fighting again. \n\nSo when I told my gf that we planned to go up north again later this year, she was not happy to say the least. She has said she doesn't feel comfortable with me going, and has asked me to ask them if she could come along. I love her, but I want to go with my friends and just my friends. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "There might be a split here since everyone has different ideas about work ethic or snitching so ill let you fine folks decide if i was the ass.\n\nI work in an office thats somewhere between white collar abd blue collar. There are 6 of us in an office who do A LOT of paperwork there and 20% field work outside.\n\nWe are all paid extremely well for what we do, our field is in demand as not a lot of people know about it so they dont pursue careers in it. So because of a shortage of labor we make crazy money and its very hard to get fired.\n\nSo heres the story. Ive worked at this office for two years. I am pretty much a go getter type of person, and I take pride in my work. I also want to keep a professional work environment at all times. Some people will automatically dislike me for this already but hear me out.\n\nI dont necessarily think everyone has to share my work ethic. But i do think its kinda ridiculous that we can be paid this much money and people still show up an hour late for work. But thats just me and i keep it to myself for the most part.\n\nHowever theres one guy at my office i work closely with thats so lazy and unprofessional that he makes my job significantly harder.\n\nThe biggest example of this is lateness. I get in 30 minutes early as i know we're gonna be swamped and i like to plan ahead. You dont have to do that, but at least get there on time.\n\nThis kid whose worked here for maybe seven months (transfered from another office and has about the same experience as me) shows up consistently late 20 minutes to an hour late each day. This infuriates me as i could really use the help in the mornings and he always shows up when the hard stuff is almost done. And if im being honest it annoys me even when it doesnt affect me. I just think if youre making a lot of money as an adult you have no excuse to be late everyday.\n\nIve talked with my boss about this who keeps saying he'll talk to him about it but nothing is ever done. Its sort of become a new normal thats accepted. My boss is a \"friend\" type of boss who wants to be a cool guy and not make people mad so it ends up being me that has to be the douchebag in a lot of situations.\n\nAnother aspect is laziness. He will outright avoid work. Ill ask him to do something at times and he will pretend not to hear me (literal silent treatment) to the point where i have to get in front of him and meet his eyeline before speaking louder. Then ill get a loud \"OKAY!\" in response. I do this so he cant say i didnt ask for help later.\n\nAlso he plays video games constantly. Like nintendo switch for hours at work. This makes me angry as he could be helping me and im basically doing the work so everyone else can relax and enjoy free money.\n\nFinally, he sleeps on the job with his shoes off in the office. This is the most brazen laziness that i cant stand and ive told him multiple times that he snores and his feet stink. He doesn't care and neither does my boss apparently who sort of just says \"yeah well he wont get far in life\" but doesnt reprimand him with any consequences.\n\nSo finally i took a picture of him secretly sleeping in his socks and sent it to my bosses boss at corporate. He of course confronted my boss about it who got an earful about how hes not managing us right because not only is the coworker sleeping but im going over his head.\n\nNow im known apparently as the office snitch and my boss has been less friendly to me. Ideally i want to get along with everyone but i truly hate lazy people. My coworker basically told other coworkers that im basically a \"bootlicker\". The other guys on my office are neutral or against me as they personally get along with the coworker but dont really work directly with him like me.\n\nIn the interests of fairness ill also point out that at times i could be short with people when im frustrated. Like if we're swamped and i have 12 different projects going on and someone starts asking me a question with an obvious answer ill tell them to ask someone else. That may not endear me to others and i recognize that.\n\nSo am i the asshole?",

      "description": "I usually don’t care if people are disruptive in movies, especially teenagers because we’ve all been one (I wasn’t a total shit head though), but there were 5 of these teens sitting together beside me. A couple of them were constantly making jokes, yelling, and making sarcastic comments through the movie (all in a shameless loud tone). I tried to let it slide, but by the time it was halfway through my movie, one of them pulled their phone out and played a song at max volume just to try and be funny. \n\nThis is when I snapped and said, “Shut the fuck up bro. People are trying to watch a movie, don’t be a fucking asshole.” \n\nIt got really quiet after that, and they didn’t do it again. I’m usually a quiet guy, and I’ve experienced disruptiveness in movies before, but it was never like how these guys acted tonight. I feel like an asshole afterwards, and in hindsight, I probably could have dealt with it better, but I also think that people should be respectful in the appropriate setting. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So about half an hour ago, my girlfriend and I were talking about her cat, which we both love dearly. However, she started describing certain things which she likes/liked to do with her cat, such as lightly inserting her finger into his mouth when he yawns (however, she has since stopped doing this as of around a few weeks ago) and filming him while he is using his litter box. Now, the latter concerned me a little, as I believe that cats deserve privacy just like humans. This belief comes from me accidentally walking in on my cat while she was urinating, and she freaked out.\n\nAnyway, when she said this, I politely let her know that that is a little strange. I also told her that cats deserve privacy. She responded to this by saying that “it’s so cute though” and sending a video of the cat cleaning up after himself. I told her that I didn’t want to watch it, and she said, “If you could get through dissections in high school, you can watch this.”\n\nOf course, I responded to this by saying that I wouldn’t voluntarily watch this if I didn’t have to, and that the thought of watching a cat urinate and defacate unsettles me. Also, I said that no living being should be subjected to that. She responded with “Okay, okay, jeez.”\n\nI might add that I did watch the video, and in it, this poor cat is visibly distressed. I felt very bad for that cat.\n\nI finally told her to stop doing that to her cat and to not send those videos to me any more. She subsequently responded by saying, “It’s really not that bad, but okay. I’ll stop.” I kind of feel bad about this. Am I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "So in terms of a brief bit of context, my friend (23F) has an eating disorder that she was diagnosed with 2 or 3 years back. She's since been in and out of therapy, and whilst she's gotten better with eating, she's still a very insecure person which ofc spawns from the eating disorder. Being her friend thus includes a lot of talking through her problems and trying to help. I want to help and I know I shouldn't be commended for trying to help, it's just what friends do, but I find some of her issues really hard to work through. For example she's very juvenile when it comes to boys - becomes a bit obsessed quickly and the likes. And I'm finding it hard to reassure her over a boy she's crying over whom she's met on a night out only a handful of times. \n\nNow cut to what's pissed me off. I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years 3 weeks ago, and she let me stay at her place for 3 days after just so I wasn't alone etc. When I tried to go back to my own apartment, I immediately broke down and texted her asking if I could come back to which she replied that I need to realise that me sleeping on her floor can't be a permanent thing so we need to try to 'solve' this to get me better. This wasn't great to hear as I was A) very aware that I wouldn't be sleeping on a blow up mattress on her floor forever B) my heart break wasn't really something to be solved, it will just take time and I just wanted the company. Also when I was staying with her, I didn't really talk about my breakup, it was mostly still her problems. She hasn't texted me since I told her she was being really nasty, and I'm honestly very upset that she hasn't texted me at all asking how I am, despite 3 years of me counselling her. So I'm thinking about distancing myself from her, or stopping talking completely. We don't gel much anyway, and this has kind of solidified my decision. So AITA here? Feels a bit narcissistic typing all this out but I just want a second opinion.. thanks so much for making it this far if you did ",

      "description": "My partner is currently going through a very rough patch. We're long distance so it makes it  even harder for us. I have my own mental health issues I deal with too, so I definitely understand what it's like to struggle. But it feels like so much of our daily conversations are about how much they want to hurt themselves or how much they want to die. \n\n\n\nThey're currently in therapy and taking meds. They've called crisis hotlines. They're doing what they can to help themselves but all this constant talk and complaining is really stressing me out and is hard on my anxiety. I care for them deeply so I worry a lot and I feel awful because nothing I can do or say will help. I'm worried that it would be selfish if I told them \"hey can you maybe not tell me about how badly you want to die everyday\". I know that they would take it very hard too if I told them even in the nicest possible way. Would I be an asshole if I told them their mental issues are having an extreme bad impact on my own mental wellbeing?",

      "description": "I used to be very conservative (morally, not politically) growing up all throughout high school and college, and I have a very hard time coming out of my comfort zone. My first drink wasn't until college, and I only started smoking weed a few years after I graduated. I've never tried any hard drugs or psychedelics, and have no firsthand knowledge of what it does to your brain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend is a very loving and caring person, but this last year she's gone through some hard times. She told me a few weeks ago that she was depressed earlier this year, to the point of being suicidal. She told me that she feels a lot better than she did earlier this year, and is in a much better place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been working with a third friend on an animation pilot, but recently that third friend had moved away and decided he didn't want to be a part of our project anymore. She took it personally and was very upset by this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis afternoon, she came over and was still reeling from his decision, to the point where she was in tears talking about it. I talked to her and tried to make her feel better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few hours, she surprised me and brought me to a VR concert with light shows and a Pink Floyd cover band - something we were both into. She met a group of her friends, and we all walked into the giant dome to wait for the concert to start. Out of nowhere, her friend puts a drop of something on her hand, and she asks me if I want to try acid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnowing who she is and who her friends are, I shouldn't have been surprised, but internally I became so angry at her all of a sudden. Here she was, not a few hours after me talking her through her emotions and trying to make her feel better, taking acid with her friends. To me and my naive brain, I took it as a sign that she was using acid to try and make herself feel better. Terrified, I excused myself, walked out of the concert and had a panic attack worrying about her and why she was doing this to herself and what it all meant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe found me outside and I told her I was upset about her taking acid, and she got defensive saying that it's no different than drinking and smoking, and that I shouldn't worry about her. She's had a history of doing drugs in the past, and I have the feeling that she's been using them to escape how she's feeling. She told me that I was projecting my own interpretation of what the drug does to you and putting that on her, calling it unfair.  I told her that I was grateful for her taking me to this event, but that I needed to leave and collect my thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, AITA for confronting her about taking acid? Is it that big of a deal? Or is it just another thing like drinking and smoking and I'm just overreacting and need to grow up? I'm honestly curious, I'm so confused about how I should have reacted or felt because I've never even seen someone do acid before, so I have nothing to base my reaction off of. I'm just so concerned about her because I'm afraid she's hurting herself by making choices like this. At the same time, I have terrible anxiety and I'm probably overreacting to this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help, thank you. \n\nThanks Reddit.",

      "description": "So, first of all, English is not my native language and I'm on mobile.\n\nAbout me : I'm 24, currently doing 2 Universities at the same time while working as an actress. And I'm also happen to be gay.\n\nMy parents weren't supportive with me at all. I've tried coming out a few times when I was around 14 or so, but it always ended up being a shouting match between us.   \nSo that's one thing they don't really like (they are acting like they are more supporting but I still hear them saying \"fuckin' faggots and stuff like that, while they know I can hear it). They aren't always like that but they know my weak points when they want to hurt me.\n\nTheir second problem is my career. They just can't stand it. I've tried sending them tickets, but I was always met with 2 empty seats ( I work at one of the biggest theaters in my country so there are quite a few seats but theirs were always front row). This resulted, that I don't like inviting any relative or friends to my shows because I'm afraid of the disappointment if they somehow wouldn't show up. If I give them tickets it gives me severe anxiety. \n\nThey know about 1 of the universities I attend, but not about the second (it is related with acting)\n\nAround a year ago I've met someone ( we've been working together for 5 years but we just did not see each other that way) and fell in love. She is 13 years older than me, and has a 2 year old toddler, who I love dearly. We've been talking about marriage and maybe one more kid. We moved together, I have my own place but it's literally a street away from my parents.\n\nBut I'm really really anxious because of my parents.  My gf is the nicest person and they still managed to call her a slut.  \nMy parents have caused me a lot of mental damage. I have had plenty of psychology classes and I'm really about trying to recover myself. But whenever I'm trying to say that they said something rude or disrespectful they just laugh it off and tell me how sensitive I've got.\n\nEarlier this year I tried again, I've sent tickets (where I'm playing together with gf), arranged a nice dinner, where they could meet their \"grandson\" and my love. They said that they didn't like the show, and some random kid of a random woman wouldn't be their grandson. Again, 2 empty seats and a night of crying. Now they reached out to me, because they heard that we've got engaged and we might end up having a second child.\n\nBut I think I've had enough for now. If they can't accept my love and her son, they won't meet our second, because I don't want the little one to feel left out.\n\nAITA? What would you guys do in my position?",

      "description": "So me and my fiancé moved away from home last year, and we decided not to go home for thanksgiving. We are having s few friends from out of town over for dinner on thanksgiving. \n\nI do 95% the cook for the two of us. My fiancé isn’t a great cook but I enjoy it. However I’m not a huge fan of turkey, and I’ve never made one. Little daunting to bd honest cooking a big bird like that. \n\nAITA if I suggest cooking something other than turkey on thanksgiving? Maybe some steaks or something else? I just don’t want to spend 4-6 hours on a meal that I’m going to be nervous about screwing up and coming out tasting like dry cardboard and would rather cook something I’ve done before ",

      "description": "So I have friend, let’s call her Haley. I met her more than a year ago. Soon after she got super into a TV show. She’s obsessed with it, she’ll watch every episode at least twice when it comes out, rewinds to watch her favorite scenes multiple times and reads fanfics all the time. \nThe show is based on a book series and I read the entire series back in high school.  The show is incredibly different and it’s not my cup of tea. \n\nAnyway, since I was familiar with the characters I would talk to her about them sometimes (book vs show) etc. Soon the show was literally all she could talk about, she would go on for hours at dinner and send me long paragraphs ranting and fan-girling over the show. I listened and engaged in the beginning. But I would change the subject, letting her know I was bored and hope she would get a hint. She did and we would talk about other things when we hung out.\n\nThen the show got cancelled over the summer and that’s when she went back to her old self, she told me to support the show, call the network and ask them to not cancel it. She made a Twitter to try and save the show and urged me to do the same. I was sympathetic but a bit relieved that I wouldn’t have to listen to her rant anymore. Over the past couple of months she brings it up occasionally and I’ve told her straight up that I don’t care and I don’t want to hear it. She would still bring it up - “I know you don’t care but blah blah blah...” \n\nWe had our spring break last week and decided to go to NYC. I couldn’t go sightseeing one of the days where they (her and one of our other friends) visited Central Park. There’s a bench there dedicated to the show and she sent me a huge paragraph fangirling with articles about how the actors were there and all.\n\nThis is what I told her - “look I admire how much you like this show (I was taking about how passionate she is) but I simply don’t care and I’ve heard you talk too much about them that I low key hate them even more now”\n\nHer response- “You literally just broke my heart”\n\nSo, AITA?

      "description": "Hey there, this is my first post so go easy on me\nSo it all starts back in 2018, when my friend (who I will call “F”) claims that he will wear his fur suit on the last day of school. Clarification: I am not in any way shape or form associated with furries, so I just decide to let it play out because it didn’t affect me. Next day, F wears a headband with furry ears attached. I initially thought that it was a one-time thing that would blow over by next week. I thought that, until he wore that same headband for 3 MONTHS! Sure, me and my other friends in our group were starting to get annoyed with his shenanigans, so we decided to confront him. F said that he wouldn’t take off the ears for even the least formal events. I eventually learned to tolerate his...ways for a little while. Starting 2019, he started to wear a fucking tail in his belt loop to every. Single. Class. It drives me up the fucking wall and I’ve asked him multiple times to take it off even for a little bit. Am I the asshole for just voicing my opinion?",

      "description": "So I [23F]matched with this guy [30M]in December and starting talking to him. We had our first date after Christmas and it was good. Went back to his place watched a movie and cuddled and made out a little (didn’t do anything else). I wouldn’t say he was the best kisser, but a lot of the time I felt like he didn’t know what he was doing. Second date we went out to dinner again and ended back at his place, things were getting hot and heavy but then he went soft. He actually admitted he had PE while we were making out on the couch. And when we did have sex i literally could not feel anything. He apologized and I told him that it happens to everyone and to text me again when he’s back in town (he had to go on a business trip for about a week). And we’re texting the whole time and I thought it was going well. Plot twist was that I got an UTI so I had to wait for that to go away. So he comes back to town and we end up going on the third date, we go out to dinner again and it was okay and we go back to his place. But this time I noticed that I was being a little more distant and we watch another movie. Then we head upstairs and start having sex again, but I had this horrible pain, like I couldn’t continue so he basically just fingered me. And I kinda got the feeling he was less experienced then he was letting on.\n\nAfter the awkward sex both times, I texted him the next morning basically saying we were lacking chemistry and that it wasn’t really gonna work. I still liked this guy, but sexual compatibility is important too. So about two weeks later I texted him , being rather blunt and asking if he wanted to try again and work on our sexual incompatibility &amp; I got ghosted. I get no one likes being told they suck at sex, but it’s rarely just one sided and I genuinely wanted to work on it together. \n\nThis was what I texted after a couple exchanges“Ok honestly I'm not interested in just being friends, i just felt like we were both struggling with our sexual chemistry. And I wanted to know if you'd be down to work on it together. If not that's fine, we can just be friends.”\n\nTLDR: I broke up with a guy from tinder after two awkward hook ups, but I told him I wanted try again last week. I wanted to improve our sexual chemistry &amp; he basically ghosted me for being honest. \n\nAITA for telling him the truth and wanting to work on it?",

      "description": "AITA?\n\nI have a neighbor whose dog was seen all over the neighborhood 4x in one month off leash with nobody following behind or looking for him. The dog btw is a 90+lb Doberman, but has a very sweet look to him, but still a really big dog. I finally had enough when the Doberman come into my yard an peed on my bushes. I have an older dog that is very territorial and it drives him insane smelling another dog in our yard, so he is on edge whenever he goes out now. I know that if my dogs were out when this dog came back a fight would ensue. My dogs would likely lose because they are older. My other is a pit who literally would never even show her teeth unless her family was in trouble. I made a post looking for the dog on our Nextdoor app, which is kinda like Facebook, but for a neighborhood. I didn't see anything recent so I posted in there basically saying the owner needed to get this under control. I looked deeper after and ended up finding a post about the dog 2 months prior. The guy tries to defend himself by saying the collar wasn't charged and the dog just kinda goes where he wants. Another guy on there expressed concern for his cats that go out at night sometimes. The Doberman owner chastised the person and said they should keep an eye on their animals. I then commented again on my post saying the guy knew it was happening and still had not remedied the issue. The guy told me I was welcome to come talk to him, but I told him I would likely call animal control for fear of my dogs safety. I know his dog is not aggressive, but I know he would fight back if my dogs attacked him in my yard. I also mentioned he needed to be a better representative for his dog breed, having a pit myself I know the struggle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife said I am a bully for doing this, but I think the guy needs to take responsibility for his animals and be a better owner.",

I agreed and thought this was definitely fair. I ended up getting a job my senior year of high school at an engineering firm doing some drafting work and decided to work there part time while attending community college to get my associates in engineering. I didn’t realize this company had tuition reimbursement until about 1 semester before I graduated with my A.S. They ended up reimbursing me for my whole entire 2 years of community college (about 10k). I decided to give this back to my parents and they were very happy as one would imagine. I then asked them if I could put this toward my final 2 years of my bachelors degree and they said no. \n\nThis caused a lot of arguments between us because in my mind they basically didn’t have to pay for any of my college when the deal was that they would pay for 2 years for the college fund they had built up.\n\nThey are pretty well off financially. The summer after I got my A.S. they bought a new house and since then they have been purchased 3 brand new cars just for reference.\n\n\n",

Over of the guys that I rarely see brought his wife along. \n\nI barely know this woman and when they arrived, she did the fake hugging and two kisses bullshit with everyone. \n\nShe approached me and I told her I don't do fake hugs. She made some joke and tried to put her arms around me so I held up my hand like a traffic cop, stopping her from getting any closer and repeated I don't do fake hugs. \n\nShe looked really embarrassed and everyone looked tense for a few seconds so I said I'd give her a high five with my still held up hand instead. She gave me a sour look and refused. ",

      "description": "My fiance and I are having a second go at planning our wedding after briefly breaking up last year -- I was underemployed, we were both struggling with some mental health issues, and trying to plan a big wedding to include my large extended family was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. I moved to find work, we have been in counseling/treatment separately and together for the past year, but now are back in the same city and planning a much simpler, smaller wedding for February.\n\nWe have limited our guest list to about 25 people for the ceremony and a nice dinner afterward -- 10 immediate family members, and 15 of our closest friends. When I told my parents, they advised me that my grandmother would probably be very upset that my uncle (her son, my dad's brother) isn't invited. \n\nMy grandma is 94, lives with my parents, and still sharp and active. My uncle has poor social skills and is generally regarded in our family as The Most Unfun Person On Earth. Grandma is very defensive of him and hypersensitive to family members excluding him from things. \n\nI have done some soul-searching this week, and I think my decision to not invite him is defensible for several reasons.\n\n* I am not being unfair. We're not inviting my mom's brother (who actually lives in the city where the wedding will take place, whereas my dad's brother lives four states away.)\n* I am not imposing a burden on anyone by making this decision. In fact, I am saving him another costly trip two months after he will already be here for Christmas.\n\nI love my grandma and generally think she is wonderful with the exception of this hypersensitivity about my uncle. Honestly, whenever he is with us, he isn't even nice to her and doesn't act like he enjoys visiting. And there is a part of me that is freaking out a bit about planning another wedding. The last time was such a disaster and I just want everything to be as simple and calm as possible. I am going to stand my ground, but AITA for doing so? ",

In that time, my mom raised me on her own, with the help of my grandparents (she was 23 and he was ten years older)\n\nWhile he didn’t actually physically abuse me, his mental abuse was extreme and I asked the court to not force me to see him anymore when I was 13.\n\nMy mom remarried when I was 15 and he has raised me ever since. He’s truly my hero (check out past posts about my dad) I saw bio dad again when I was 19, trying to see if we could have a friendship or relationship. He ghosted me. Completely. Changed his number and everything.\n\nWhen I was about to turn 30, he and his wife somehow reached to my mom and wanted to start a conversation. I now live 1,000 miles from where I grew up and married my husband. Husband and I were going to my home state for a wedding party my whole side of the family was throwing for us (we eloped after over 7 yrs together).\n\nSaw bio-dad, everything was nice and casual. But after we went home to our state, he added me on FB and wouldn’t comment on EVERY SINGLE THING I wrote that was Anti-Trump. We are very liberal but he just wouldn’t stop, until finally he texted me and said he “WAS SO DONE HAVING A LIBERAL DAUGHTER”\n\nFine, whatever. I barely know this guy. Then my mom called me this morning, saying his wife texted my mom, that bio-dad had a stroke. He’s going to be okay but he’s not really okay. Really encouraged me to call him or his wife...\n\nAfter talking to my husband, he’s encouraging compassion. That when he met bio-dad, he seemed like a guy that knew he fucked up with me (I’m his only child).\n\nI feel very ambivalent to him. But I also feel like my husband might be right about compassion...\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "I live in a dorm where me and one other girl have separate bedrooms and share a kitchen and bathroom. The walls here are very thin. The rules in the dorm state that after 11pm we have to be quiet and people of the opposite sex has to be in their rooms.\n\nShe is really hypersocial and has people over all the time. Which I don't mind in the daytime, but it can be a huge disturbance in the evenings when I'm trying to sleep, especially when her friends or boyfriend sleep over. I also want to mention I'm diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and this situation is really uncomfortable for me. I've only messaged her a handful of times the months we've been living together because of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple weeks ago I contacted the dorm supervisor and informed him about my roommate. He talked with her, and for a few days she was nice and respectful. She got no punishment even though I told him she'd been breaking the rules. Then she continued like before with the sleepovers. Last night she had the TV on a bit loud, so I messaged her word for word: \"turn down the volume\" and the follow up \"hello?\" after a few minutes with no reaction. After a few minutes she turned off the TV and started having sex. I could hear the bedsprings and the wood creaking, and they're normally not vocal, but this time I could hear the boyfriend moaning loudly. I messaged her again, saying \"are you kidding me?\". No response to the messages until this morning when she wrote a really long and kind of angry message about how she's tried to please me and be respectful and that she has to be allowed to watch TV without me becoming angry. She said she doesn't understand why I'm living there if I can't handle her noise. We went back and forth for a bit, and I get the impression that she's turning the situation around on me. She did make me feel very bad, hence why I'm posting. I told her my main issue with her is that she has people over every night, and she responded \"it's sad you see it that way, but that's how it is\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I really being an unreasonable, uptight, controlling asshole here when telling her to be more quiet? Do I just have to suck it up because I chose to live here?\n\nShe also mentioned that maybe I should move out if I think it's this bad. I don't think that's fair to me, considering she's breaking the rules and that my problem is with her and no one else in this dorm. So bonus question: WIBTA if I contact the dorm supervisors again, and potentially get her kicked out?",

      "description": "So Ive been with my boyfriend for 6 months. He works at a shop (retail, small business, very laid back, when it's slow they let him play Hearthstone on his phone). We don't live together, and he's was rostered on for 4 days in a row, meaning I couldnt see him until after his 4th shift (distance to his place/work makes visits difficult when he has work).  \n\n\nYesterday (day 3 out of 4) I was free and bored out of my mind and decided I would surprise my boyfriend at his work as I had never been there before, but they sell stuff I could use (it's an art supply store). I have never been to his work before, and we haven't discussed it, nor has he ever invited me, or told me not to go there.  \n\n\nWhen I arrived he seemed shocked. Like, when you're somewhere and your ex walks in and the colour drains from your face. He legitimately had the deer in the headlights look. It wasn't busy so he takes me to a quiet corner of the store (it's massive) and immediately starts saying I'm creepy and asking what I'm doing at his WORK and that it feels like I'm stalking him. Note that I have never done this before and I thought it would be a sweet gesture (which I told him). I've never turned up to where he lives uninvited, but going to his work felt like a sweet thing to do, especially since I havent been before.  \n\n\nWe haven't messaged since and I haven't organized to see him after his 4th/final shift of the week yet. Im just really confused because I havent done anything like this before and he hasnt like, told me not to visit his work before. AITA for surprising him? BTW the environment at his work is sooo chill he would definitely not have gotten in trouble for me visiting so I don't think it's that. ",

Also sorry for my spelling. \n\n(i have an issue with grubby people, I understand and sympathise that not everyone has access to hygiene products or daily showers, but it deeply upsets me. For example, I once caught the person who always borrows a pen putting his hand under his pants to scratch his crack, so I binned all my stationary. This one time I sat next to a girl on a bus who sneezed without covering her nose, snot went everywhere, I got so angry I was shaking and didn't know wether to yell at her or shake her, so I cried. I also boil my cuttlery and plates I use before using them. To summarise, I am a freak. I really hate the way I am but sometimes I find it hard to control)\n\nAny way, me and my college friends play uno at lunch with my cards, I am aware how annoying I get when I keep asking them to make sure that all the cards are facing the same way, that they are in a neat pile, and I later found out from a friend it was super obvious that I check the state of peoples' hands (like, if they are sweaty or dirty nail beds) before we play. \n\nThere was this one guy who was my friend's cousin who was always there because (as his cousin words it) people in his class avoid him when possible, I feel bad for that but, he only ever talks about either himself, or video games, and if our group is focusing on someone else he will talk over and raise his voice till he gets his way. Also he smells like stale ball sweat and has no clue what personal space means.\nI find it hard to hide anger or discust, especiolly ( i really fucked that word, sorry) with this guy, couple weeks before the Uno incedant he farted next to me while I was eating, so I got up, binned my sandwich and walked away. Ever since he would do the biggest fart possible next to me.\n\nSo, we are at lunch, my mate is dealing when we spot him walk this way, we all groan, even his cousin. And he wants to play. Nobody says anything, they all look at me. At first I just say no. He laughs and says why, I try my hardest to be polite, he calls me anal and his cousin is looking at me trying to indicate that I should drop it..... I do the opposit.\n \"FOR ONE (HIS NAME) YOUR HANDS ARE ALWAYS MOIST AND GRUBBY, YOU STIN-\" I get cut off by my partner who is calming me down, but the damage was done and he walked away, his cousin blocked me and my guidence councilor wants a word with me.\n\n\nI know I will get hate, or at the very least mocked for my bad spelling. You are entitled to your opinion. But I really need to know, was I the ass? Does him calling me anal and farting next to me (purposly)  make it okay? Do I owe him a alology? ",

      "description": "so, this story is from a while ago when i was with my (now ex) boyfriend. \n\na lil backstory: i was working full time as well as finishing my last year of high school. we had been together for a while, and he didnt work at all (and barely went to school lmao) so he had plenty of time on his hands. \n\nSO. i was at work, and i got off at 4 everyday (mon-fri) and i texted him on my last break that i was hungry. it was the week that I was supposed to get paid and i was running low on money.  he offered to make me a sandwich and give it to me when i got off work and i thought it was super nice of him. when he picked me up after my shift, i was super excited to eat the sandwich. i mean, i was thinking about it all afternoon. i get in the car and he hands me a bag. inside is what appears to be a sandwich. i take a bite, and i taste nothing. i start to dissect the sandwich and he had just. put BUTTER on the bread. and called that a sandwich. \n\ni mean, i appreciated the thought and the fact that he brought me that food, but if youre going to put so little effort into it, why bother? i was super mad at the time but it wasnt a huge issue, but every time i think about it it makes me irrationally angry. \n\nso, that being said. AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for making me a butter &amp; butter sandwich?\n",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nI recently graduated this December with a bachelor's in screenwriting. During my last semester, I took on a writing project for a fellow student to help with his senior overview. He's a film directing major, so his assignment was to direct a short film. Typically, the majors will write their shorts themselves, but it's not uncommon for them to consult the screenwriters.\n\nWhen he initially asked me, I was swamped with my own senior overview, as well a huge portfolio review, so I considered asking for payment then. However, a colleague suggested doing it for free since it's important to make connections during school.\n\nI met with him, took notes on his idea, and wrote the 20 or so pages, taking me about 8 hours of work throughout my week. He liked what I had, and that was the end of it. Until last week.\n\nHe texted me asking if I could \"change some things\" as he had some new ideas. I asked what his ideas were, and he basically wants the entire thing rewritten, which is fine because it's his project and he should commit to whatever his vision is.\n\nHowever, not that I'm not a student, I'm busy with the 9-5 and my own projects that I'm working on to further my career. So, I told him I'd be happy to fit it into my schedule, but I'd have to charge him $50 this time. I figured this price was reasonable for a freelance fee that would probably take another 5-8 hours to finish. I'd be working for around $6-10 an hour, which is table scraps compared to what's a standard charge.\n\nHe flipped out on me, calling me a piece of shit, telling me he should sue me, etc.\n\nMy gf and roommates support me, but a couple of my other friends say since I initially agreed to do it for free, I should have continued to do so.",

All I wanted to tell her was that I could understand not wanting to be with a crybaby, but maybe don't focus on the negative so much and talk more about what you do want. Well , it wasn't the first time my big mouth has gotten me into trouble.  I can't post a screen shot of her reply because I unmatched once I read the whole thing. She wrote back a message as long as my arm in under five minutes. \nSaying:\" You dont know what I've been through\" the rest of it was repetitively finding  more creative ways to call me a snowflake  cuck faggot. It was intense!\n\nI only meant to offer some positive feedback, but I clearly overstepped. \n\nTl;dr: told someone to relax on tinder and to try to be more positive, it did not go over well. ",

      "description": "Tldr; friends neighbor had the hots for me, asked to have a drink with us while me and her were spending the day together. He couldn't make it to lunch, and didnt make it to the pool either. I didn't mind, figured we would rain check. He was finally free around the time I had to head home for a 5 am shift, friend got rude with me and continuously pressured me to stay. Her neighbor also made a rude remark towards me. I then notice her texting him rude shit about me, all after I had just treated her to a nice day. I feel very disrespected. We haven't spoken yet because I wanted to cool off first, but now i am wondering if I should even bother at all.\n\n\nSeems fickle but I'm wondering if I'm missing something, A friend of mine has a neighbor who wanted to have a drink with me because he found me attractive. I agreed because I had a nice interaction with him and thought he was interesting and fun. So She invited him to lunch with us, He couldn't make it due to work, no biggie I didnt mind. She invited him to the pool, he never showed, still NBD. Then around 5 or 530 he said he said he would be back in an hour, and asked what beer he should pick up. I told my friend whatever was fine but she forced me to choose, so I settled on stella. He texts my friend shortly after 8 pm that he wants to head over, when I was already about to head home for my 5 am shift. She gets upset and tells me Im being rude multiple times while continuously pressuring me to stay, because it was rude of me to ask him to pick up beer and not at least have one drink (I didn't ask, he offered).\n\nI apologized and explain at least 3 or 4 times that she knew I had work early and it was my ultimate priority, i previously explained to her earlier in the day I would be leaving by 8 or 9. I asked if we could rain check, but nope. Her neighbor proceeded to open his patio door and make a rude remark to me from across the yard, I then notice that shes slandering me while texting him saying things to the effect of ''omg I'm going to murder her\" among other things.\n\n  To top it off, I had walked her dogs for her on this day because she was hungover, as well as treated her to lunch and Starbucks because she lost her credit card the night before. I cant help but feel incredibly disrespected because I have never treated a friend this way even when they upset me, I simply address it. Now, I'm a very blunt person and I dont want to be a complete dickhead about this when i address the issue, even though I feel it would be warranted.  Personally, I feel I have done nothing wrong by choosing to prioritize my work. And seeing as how I didn't get upset when he didnt show up 2 times that day, I felt they shouldn't be on my ass about being tired. Help me out if theres a perspective I'm missing.\n\nAm i the asshole here ?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little context: my friend E has been very toxic towards me and my friend V recently, we are trying to distance ourselves. She also recently ended a friendship with a close friend who we'll call T. \n\nWell, V's birthday is coming up this weekend and I decided to throw a surprise party for V and I have been planning and such. Well, because of one of my other roommates we can't have the party at my apartment so I asked T if he would be willing to host. He agreed. I had to decide who to invite to the party and I thought about inviting E but since the party is at T's house I wasn't sure if that was the best idea. I decided to give it some more thought throughout the week.\n\nAs I continued planning I was still unsure on whether or not to invite E. Well flash forward to last night, me, E, and another friend who is invited to the party, are hanging out. E asks \"what are you guys doing tomorrow\". I'm honest with her and I say \"Well this weekend is V's birthday and so we're throwing a surprise party but it is at T's house\". She takes a beat and without me saying anything else she exclaims \"I don't care, I wanna be there for V\". This annoyed me as she just assumed that she was invited. But whatever, I told her I would talk to T about it. Obviously I would have to ask permission from T because he's already doing a lot for us and I don't want him feeling uncomfortable in his own home and stuff.\n\nA little later in the night she asks me who's coming and I begin to tell her, however, two of the people coming are people that she cutoff as friends (besides T), one of them being my girlfriend and the other a close friend from my hometown. She exclaimed sarcastically \"how FUN this is going to be\". That comment obviously annoyed me because that's my girlfriend she's complaining about.\n\nThe night goes on and I talk to V's girlfriend about E inviting herself and she tells me that V doesn't really want her at the party anyway. I think about it a little longer and I think about how I think it's unfair to T and to me as well because E is putting me in a tough situation because I've already asked for so much from T and he's been incredibly generous, and I think it's unfair to T because you don't get to just end a friendship with someone and then just expect to be invited into their house. Additionally I know that E would be miserable since about one third of the party she doesn't like (it is a small party) and it would just make everyone uncomfortable. So finally I decide that I'm just going to tell her not to come. I sent her a fairly long text message and I try to just be super nice and explain that this isn't an easy situation and I think it would be best if she didn't come. However, it was fairly late and she had already fallen asleep so as of now I'm still waiting for a response.\n\nI don't know, I feel like I'm being fairly reasonable but maybe I'm being unfair, AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend knows my Reddit account and I know his. He likes to read my Reddit comments but I never ever read his.\n\nSometimes I'll post a comment on AskReddit, something innocent like \"I had a sandwich for lunch last week\" and a few days later we might be talking and he'll say something like \"I saw that you ate a sandwich the other day\"\n\nExcept I've never specifically told him that I've eaten a sandwich. He only knows that I've eaten a sandwich because he was snooping on my Reddit account. \n\nI know that Reddit comments are public, but I can't help but feel a bit skeeved that he's constantly reading every single thing I post on the internet.\n\nI could make another account, but then it feels like I'm doing something wrong, like I'm hiding something from him. I promise I have nothing to hide, I just don't want somebody reading over my shoulder. I've never felt the need to read everything he posts online, what he does online is his own business. I trust him enough to keep out of trouble. And for the record, I never post anything bad. It's a few silly comments here and there, I'm not posting pics on Gonewild or saying things like \"I'm having an affair on my boyfriend\". \n\nSo I'm torn. I know I'm not doing anything bad, but I still don't want somebody to read it, but I'll admit that he's not doing really anything bad either since it is obviously public. But it still feels wrong and I don't like it. But I don't know if I'm allowed to not like it. It's a very confusing situation!\n\nTo me, it's a lot like him going out to the bar with his friends and coming home and me asking \"Alright, now tell me literally every single story and joke you told all of your friends while I wasn't with you!\" Those comments weren't meant for you! It's not that I don't want him to know any of this stuff, but I'll tell you the stories when I feel like telling you the stories!",

      "description": "So, let me start with a bit of backstory. When I was a kid, I had no friends, due to multiple reasons such as, Asperger's, OCD and being shy. The only friends I did have we would fight all the time, or would only play with me cause I have a lot of video games and would completely ignore me. Later on, when I was 15, it as well as a number of other things caused me to develop depression. Now when I don't talk to anyone for a while, I break down and have huge emotional episodes. I had a few relationships in the past, all of them over the internet. Some with girls once with a boy who later emotionally and mentally abused me. Then I met my current GF and we've been pretty good for over a year but recently she's seemed more distant.\n\nShe's been having to do a lot such as schoolwork, family and friends. I do get that and I try my best to not have such bad episodes but I do end up having them. When she's finally free, I beg her to please spend time with me doing something we both like doing together. It's gotten to the point where I barter with her in an attempt to do something with me that we both like but I often end up doing something I don't want to do just to get as much attention from her as I can. Often times she won't do anything with me unless it's something she wants to do, regardless of if I want to do it or not.\n\nI get that she needs free time and that it's important to do things she wants to do but I miss when we did things we were both happy doing together. And I know people will think I'm clingy, I do realize that but my GF has said on multiple occasions that she likes how clingy I am\n\nTLDR; GF almost always wants to do things that I don't enjoy doing but rarely the other way around. Gotten so bad that I barter with her and lose pretty much every time.\n\nAITA for wanting to do things we both like to do together or occasionally being able to do something I'd like to do?\n\nSorry if there are any grammar mistakes, I'm not very good with grammar. Also, please be gentle, I have a hard time with criticism but I'll do my best to take everything at face value.",

      "description": "TDLR; My best friends husband just got paralyzed and I just bought a mattress and feel really guilty about it since I’ve only donated a certain amount to them.\n\nI have been best friends with this person for 10 years. Let’s call her BF. Her husband will be BFH for best friend’s husband. \n\nI met her when BFH was in jail for his second DUI. He got out in 3 months and he never drove drunk again. \n\nI desperately wanted her to find someone better but pretty soon he grew on me and we all became good friends. They later got married and just bought a house. \n\nMy husband and I have been saving for 3 years now and rarely spend any money. They always give us a hard time for being so stingy when we probably make the most money out of all of our friends. But for Christmas and wedding presents, we dish out a large amount for them. Also, they are constantly buying big screen TVs and cars and motorcycles and my husband and I have hand me down cars and even hand me down TVs (from my parents). They always come over our house and give us a hard time that we should just buy an 80 inch TV like them. All in good fun but a little bit roasty.\n\nBFH got into a motorcycle accident last month and he’s now paralyzed. They will get money from the accident but I don’t know how long that will take in court. Meanwhile we provided a large initial donation, but I constantly feel guilty that we have savings and we’re using it to buy a mattress. BTW, our current mattress is 20 years old and a hand me down so we are overdue. I don’t know how to be their friend anymore. I feel like they should sell their TVs and stuff instead of asking for donations but they ask for money every 2 weeks. \n\nI just bought a $12 sweater that I feel guilty about. At what point should I stop feeling guilty? How can I approach this? She isn’t coping well and she keeps saying that I don’t know what it’s like. He’s in diapers forever, wheelchair, etc. I tell her she is lucky she has so much support. My Nparents would slave us for help and wouldn’t even help as much as she’s getting from her parents. Help!",

      "description": "Normally my MIL visits us every spring. She works at a school so she spends spring break with us. She is a kind and sweet woman, but she lets her daughter push her around and is not very bright. I have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she’s not creating dangerous situations for my small children. I like her, but it’s difficult to have her here. \n\nLast summer she planned to come out in July (without asking us first) instead of March with my SIL and her husband as well . Turns out this was all the sisters idea. My SIL has never visited us, never met either of my children. Overall is just a terrible person. I can’t stand her because of the way she treats my husband. \n\nSo basically it went like this: \nSIL: We’re coming out for this week in July. \n\nMe: That’s not a good time for us, Husband can’t take time off work that week. I have plans. Let’s look at a different week. \n\nSIL: No that’s all we can do. So we will be there. End of discussion. \n\nSo I changed all my plans. We set up the beds. Had everything ready for a visit that we didn’t want to host. Then they don’t show up and check in on fb getting on a cruise ship. I have to say I was pretty relieved that I didn’t have to spend a week with my SIL and try to hide the fact that I’d like to kill her. My husband on the other hand was devastated. No one called him or let him know. We had to tell the kids memaw wasn’t coming to visit after all. It was a disaster. \n\nSo now, my MIL wants to just pretend nothing ever happened and come visit us in March this year. I told my husband no. I said I don’t want her here until she acknowledges how badly she and her daughter hurt his feelings and the feelings of my kids. They were completely out of line and I will not ignore that! \n\nAITA for not allowing this to be swept under the rug? \n",

We've been dating about 6mo, a few months ago she had spoke to me about a time when she was assaulted when she was 19 (10 years ago) - She passed out drunk and had woken up with some guys fingers inside her basically. The guy told people she came onto him and half of her friend group believed the guy and effectively silenced her. \n\nWe were at her parents a few months ago and she was talking about xmas eve and how I should come over to her parents and she'd drop me at mine in the morning and we could do something with her friends or sisters. \n\nHer assaulter is also from this town, and they often bump into each other at xmas eve. Couple of weeks ago when we were drunk I said I wouldn't really be comfortable if he might be there, and rather she wasn't either - and that if I was drunk and something escalated I wouldn't be able to control myself. She said that would be 'mortifying for the community' and I said I was disinvited and we didn't really speak about it properly again.\n\nSo now, my first xmas eve alone in almost 12 yrs and she's text me saying she's just getting ready to go meet the girls in that pub..AITA?

Today after once again cleaning up poopy undies I decided I needed a mental health break from potty training, I’m losing my temper far too often.

So my husband went on this huge tirade basically telling me I’m a neglectful mother and that he’ll divorce me if I do this. He told me that since I have so much free time(because I’m a sahm) I need to do more research and come up with more ideas to potty train him but when I say I’ve tried everything I mean literally everything.

My folks are controlling and emotionally manipulative, to the point that I honestly don’t know if I love them anymore. \n\nThe tattoo being denied hurt me a lot, as I have nothing but respect for them. I spoke to all of my friends and my BF (22M) and they agreed they went too far. \n\nMy folks make snarky comments about how my BF isn’t well off, and about how we should always go on holidays because otherwise what’s the point of annual leave. \n\nThey also keep insisting that they prefer me being pregnant rather that have a “disgusting ink blob” on my skin. They constantly control what I wear, and if it’s not good enough they’ll shout “people will think you have nothing to wear, you always wear the same shit”. \n\nI’m sick and tired of dealing with them, to the point where they INSIST I give them goodnight kissies *shudders*, or I get yelled at because “it’s a family thing”. \n\nSo, fellow redditors, AITA for just giving up and not giving a crap anymore about them?

      "description": "So I have been with my boyfriend for well over a year now, we have been pulling off a long distance relationship for a while, and we enjoy playing games online together (which I consider important to the story as a sign that I do not hate video games).\nThe problem started not too long ago after the new smash bros came out, of course we both got it and enjoy it. I play it very casually, during my break at work and at home if I feel like it (but honestly not for long and once or twice a day)... My boyfriend on the other hand plays it morning and after work sometimes going to sleep as late as 4:00 am playing.\n\nSo far I guess is pretty normal for \"gamers\" I suppose, I have done that myself with other games, but here's the thing, he plays while we talk and he would constantly interrupt and completely stop conversations because of something that happens in game. \nI try not to show my irritation but the fact that I could be talking about my day and be cut off by a sudden \"EAT SHIT [insert fire emblem character here]\" followed a \"oh yeah I'm listening... what was that last part tho?\" Is getting annoying.\n\nNot so long ago we had a really serious argument about our relationship, and I demanded for him to take it seriously and put the game down, which he got extremely upset about and proceeded to... lower the volume of the game... yup... unfortunately he smashes the controller so hard I could tell he was still playing and made me explode, he defended himself by saying he is capable of multitasking, but I don't think your GSP is as important as to having an stable relationship.\n\nThings that I know are my fault: \n● even though we talked things out I never truly expressed how I felt about him constantly playing. I haven't done it yet and I know I should, I don't like hiding things from him but I am afraid of sounding like an asshole. \n\nMaybe there's something I am not seeing, I could be exaggerating, I want to hear your opinion, sorry for the bad grammar English is my second language.",

I'm not the type to cause a scene either. However, now I've pretty much quarantined myself in a room without talking to him.

My girlfriend's mum loves abroad so she was his full time carer for her dad and kinda just gave her life to him. \nHe could no longer remember who she is or toilet himself. She just took it all on her stride, I've still never seen her cry and I lived with her and her dad at the end. \n\nHe died one morning when I was asleep and she was kinda in shock I think. \n\n She had to pay for the funeral herself and arrange it all. We different religiously, she is an atheist and I was raised Catholic. Her dad was also atheist and requested to be buried in a cardboard box, no headstone or religious speak. She arranged a woodland burial. \n\nI told her I wouldnt go because it makes me uncomfortable, to me it is awful to be burying him in that way. I understand that it's her choice and totally respect that but when she assumed I'd be there with her I told her that I'd rather not go because it is so far removed from an appropriate funeral, in my opinion. \n\nShe says I'm being selfish and putting my religion before her feelings and our relationship. I told her I'll drop her off, pick her up and support her throughout her grievance but I just don't want to go to the funeral. She hadn't spoken to me since. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So I was messaged on Friday by someone who seemed really cute and from his profile, we had a lot in common. We’ve been chatting since. The only thing I noticed was that he seemed a bit on the immature side, but I thought let’s just talk and see where it goes. Then yesterday he sent me a photo of him when he was out drinking and I realized he looks nothing like his profile pic. Like zero. He looks like a completely different person. So I asked for another picture today (since he’s sober now) and yep he looks nothing like his photos from his profile. He appears older, much heavier and has a completely different haircut + his hair is died a different color. I feel kind of duped, but I also don’t want to be judgemental.  At the same time I feel like being a bit of a different from your profile pic is one thing but he looks like an entirely different person and I just don’t think that’s fair.",

      "description": "This is going to be a wild ride.\n\nOkay, lets start with a little of a backstory. Me and my friend were out partying one day 2 years ago and started talking to 2 girls we have just met. Call them S and F. Now things happen and I am in a relationship with F like 2 months later. Things happen again and my buddy suddnely is in a relationship with S. Lucky us, huh?\n\nFast forward a few months and S tells me she would rather be with me than with my buddy. As the honest guy I am I tell my buddy because thats a really shitty situation. My buddy and S have a fight but get over it. Of course i also told my girlfriend (F) about it, who went absolutely mental, blocked all communication to both of them and forbid me to see at least S (my buddy by himself was kind of okay although she did definetly didnt like to hear about it if we met up)\n\nI accept that because i love her and i understand the problem because this girl obviously would try to hit on me one day. So its fine.\n\nFast forward more than a year of very little contact to S and my buddy, because obviously he cant always tell his girlfriend that she cant come with us because my girlfriend has a problem with that, so it was easier to just meet up less. We stayed good friends however and it was not that much drama because S and my friend moved away and he had to work on saturdays so he was not around too much. \n\nThen F breaks up with me. It fucked me up but S and my friend really had my back. Friday after work i drove to their place and stayed there until Sunday in the evening. For 5 weeks. They are great people. \n\nJealousy was a problem in my relationship with F for the past 2 years, but we both made kind of irrational petty statements about it. I am guilty aswell and i know that but i promised her to keep away from S als long we were in a relationship and I did. \n\nWell after said 5 weeks we talk to eachother. We can both see the relationship from a different and more objective point of view and decide to try it again because we both miss eachother.\n\nSince my bro and his girlfriend really backed me in hard times i tell F that i am not going to cut ties with them again. I understand if she does not want me to see S, which is okay to me.  \n\nWithin the 5 weeks that we didnt see eachother F met someone she considers her \"friend\". Well idk about that because i think he is a really bad influence and also he's quite obviously hitting on her for the past 8 weeks or so. My girlfriend is totally aware about that and somehow also brags with it a little bit. She told me that he makes around 5k-8k€ a month by literally ripping off people by manipulating the software of cars he buys off private sellers and reselling them. \n\nShe proudly showed me the chats and tbh its really really obvious to me as a guy that hes trying really hard. \n\nThing is: Since jealousy has been such a major problem in our past relationship I dont want to confront her about it because she never gave me a reason to not trust her. But it's not only me being jaelous but also my disgust for this guy about how he earns his money. \n\nALSO: This is kind of a similar situation that i have been in when S told me she wants to be with me and my girlfriend reacted by forbidding me to talk to her. We have now been together for nearly a month now and i dont want to sound like an asshole because the past month our relationship was literally perfect (coming from both of us, we definetly learned to value eachother more)\n\nSo\n\nWIBTA if i confront her about my dislike of her spending time with him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hello, this is a pretty long story so grab some popcorn..\n\nWhen I was around 16, I met a girl playing online video games. I am now 22 and I have never met this girl in person, neither have I heard her voice or follow her in any social media. On the other hand, she has heard me, knows my social media, has pics of me etc. I did push multiple times to get to know her more in real life, her argument was that she was shy. Tbh, I don’t even think she ever told me her real name (Although she claimed multiple times that it is in fact her real name). I’ve seen a few pics of her but the last one I saw was over a year ago. \n\nI care about her deeply because we really connected when we were younger, she knows everything about me and I mostly know everything about her. As we got older we kind of stopped talking as much compared to when we were younger. Often, throughout the years we both got flirty and fantasized about maybe one day getting married and moving in together etc (Keep in mind, I still don’t know anything about her). Fast forward to 2 nights ago, I got a message from her saying she misses me etc. (For the last year, she did this: Texted me once a month, have a convo \\[we always have great convos\\] and after a few hours of texting, she’d ignore me me until approximately the next month). I told her how I feel: I want to and been wanting to get to know her real life version more (her voice, add her in social media like I have friends added, etc). I told her that until she decided to be completely real with me I’d appreciate it if she stops messaging me. \n\nShe then replied and told me she’s sorry for how this friendship has been one sided and apologizes deeply. She then mentions that for the last year she has been extremely depressed due to her Mom passing away, she feels lost and I was her only escape whenever she would text me to talk for a bit. \n\nI was not aware that her Mom passed away, despite how close we are, she never mentioned anything to me. I did notice she was depressed because I can tell, which is why I have always been there to reply back to her until 2 nights ago when I ran out of patience. \n\nI feel like a major asshole for telling her to stop communicating with me at this moment where she still feels down, lost and depressed. I know I was not aware of her Mom passing away but I still can’t shake this feeling of guilt away. She won’t reply to my texts at all. Idk what to do. I stopped trying to get a text back and in my last text to her I told her that I’m still here for her if she needs anything at all. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues I’m on mobile \n\n\nThis only happened about a half hour ago but, me and two other friends had ordered take out from a local sushi place. When we arrived they told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, no big deal we decided to sit at a booth right next to the till until our food was ready. As we were waiting a delivery driver from UberEats walked in and leaned on the wall next to our booth while she waited for her pick up. \n\n\nSeeing her walk in sparked a question from my friend asking if I’ve ever used the service ( since they just started operating in our city) I told him yes and that I enjoyed using it quite a bit. He began asking more question about how it worked, how long it takes, etc... At this point I could kind of tell the delivery driver was listening in but I didn’t think much of it.  He proceeds to ask me how tipping works. I say that “I tip if they’re nice and if I have the extra money too” I then said however it can be awkward if you don’t tip and then you get the same driver the next time you order. To clarify I tip almost all the time unless the service is really bad or I just don’t have the extra money in my account to do so. \n\n\nSo at that point the delivery driver chimes in and says “I work for UberEats you should really watch what you say” at that point my friends and I are kind of confused. My friend just says “excuse me” and before he can finish she said “if you can’t afford to tip us then you shouldn’t be eating out or you should order less” I’m a pretty anxious person so I just apologize and turn back to my friends hoping that was it. As I’m turning back to my friends she says that drivers “rely on tips to pay the bills” . I can see my friend getting pretty agitated that this point and he blurts out “if you rely on tips to survive maybe you should look for another job!” She seemed taken aback so she turned away and went back to playing on her phone. \n\n\nShe ended up getting her order before we did so as she was walking out she said “bye guys just going back to my shitty job” at that point we didn’t care so we all told her to have a nice night. As we were walking out she just stared us down from her car. We’re my comments mean? Or was I wrong in my assumption that you don’t need to tip? I felt pretty bad after this went down and I just want to know if I was out of line ",

      "description": "I  am \\[22 M\\] and I have been in love with my friend \\[22 F\\] for 3 years now. At first I didn't want to show it because I knew she didn't like me in that way. But last year I confessed to her that I want to be more than friends. She told me no and that she would like to remain friends. I agreed because I have never felt so good hanging out with someone and I thought my feelings for her will fade, but it's kinda hard and I like her more and more every day.\n\nI  never had feelings for someone like I have for her. I always try to say how much she means to me and compliment her  because I really feel that way and I thought if somebody told me something like that I would be happy. But I started feeling that she doesn't like getting complimented by me so I asked her if I should stop telling her how much I care for her. She said she doesn't mind it, but I stopped anyways because I had a feeling she doesn't like it. I don't know why but it isn't easy to hold it in me when I am with her but I wasn't really complimenting her the last 3 months.\n\nBut yesterday we were on a birthday party from a mutual friend. I got really drunk and I told everybody that I am going home. She said she would walk me home and I agreed. When we were walking I told her that my male friends often tease me about her because they know I would only like to be with her, but I told her that I told them that we will never be together  romantically. As we came to my apartment I hugged her and told her I love her more than anybody and kissed her twice on the cheek. She went back to the party and I went to bed. I don't remember how she reacted because I was really drunk. We are talking normally since then, but I am afraid I overstepped the friendship boundaries and I don't know if I should apologize to her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Might be a long story, some background first: been with her for a year, she's asexual (doesn't feel sexual attraction but still gets horny/has sex) so i don't believe she had malicious intent or did anything. I don't know or trust the guy she was with and I am pretty certain of him being into her. I am just still really upset and feel very wronged even though we have already talked about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I am not very controlling and I do not like to tell my partners what to do. I only ask that I be messaged when she gets home so I know that she's safe. She did not do that on that day which worried me, I knew she was out drinking which is fine but i just told her to be responsible and not overdo it. Sure enough she overdid it and texted me the next morning that she woke up in that man's bed and was panicking and did not know what occurred before during her drunk blackout. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was upset, angry, full of hate and rage and betrayal and had no idea what to do.  From the scene that she painted me that morning I had thought 1 of 2 things: she cheated on me or he got her too drunk on purpose so as to take advantage of her while passed out. She went to her normal activities that day and saw him and apparently talked it out and it was a big misunderstanding and nothing happened that night. She woke up where she passed out fully clothed, etc. She did a poor job of communicating that with me and I had still assumed i had been cheated on or she had been taken advantage of, both of which filled me with such anger and sadness. We got in a huge argument about it and i told her not to see him anymore because he can't be trusted. Eventually we worked it out to the point where I told her to do what she wants as long as she's safe and to not scare me like that. Since then she is still going out and drinking with him late into the night and it still bugs me. I feel like my emotions got fucked with pretty bad and got the short end of the stick of this whole mess. I am really glad that she's ok and wasn't hurt but this whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth.

I also made plans with another uni friend for a DIFFERENT gig in Manchester, on the 22nd feb (the friday), which we would stay overnight at. Manchester is not far from my uni city at all, so there’s more than enough time to get home in the morning before the next gig on Saturday night. I told my home friend these plans in a conversation about her train times, to make sure I’d be back in time for her arriving. She then tells me she had been planning on coming to my uni city to visit on the THURSDAY before the gig, to make the visit longer. I had no idea about this and apologised to her that I wouldn’t be there on the Friday because of the Manchester gig with my uni friend, so she would be on her own in my uni house for a night... (side note: she does know my uni friends to an extent so this wouldn’t necessarily be a problem as they would accommodate her no problem). Her reaction was, in my opinion, quite harsh: “alright I know where I’m not wanted then, I’ll just come Saturday fine.” I felt awful already but she knew I couldn’t do anything and thought I’d scheduled the gigs perfectly to arrive back in time for her! She’s still mad about it even though I’ve apologised and she knows she didn’t tell me she wanted to visit on Thursday until I’d booked the Friday Manchester gig with my uni friend. Am I the asshole here ? \n\nNote: this is my girlfriend’s story from her perspective. I’m just posting it on my account, hence the first person. Questions will be answered by her. ",

      "description": "So we moved recently away from my wifes family across the country and they come to visit a couple times a year. The last time they visited was for one of my kids birthday a month ago. Her mom and step dad as well as one of her sisters were here as well as my parents.  My parents stayed just for the weekend and left on Sunday and basically as soon as they left her family started drinking. By the end of the night her step dad has cussed at my daughter, we cuss in our house and actually allow our kids to as long as they are using those words out of frustration not in direction of someone else. Her sister ranted about how we should be raising our kids even though she has none of her own, long story on that side, and her mom was rude to my wife because she doesn't like the way our household chores are set up. \n\nA little more backstory on this situation is that for specific reasons her mom came and visited us for about 6 weeks last year, for 5 of those she was here with just us and did not have a sip of beer or alcohol that entire time. As soon as he husband, my wifes step dad, got here he bought beer and tequila and they were drinking. Obviously he has a problem since he can't go a week without a drink. \n\nThey will be coming in in a few months for another birthday and I told my wife I don't want them to drink here this time. Both of the parents will be here as well as the same sister, but this time her other sister is coming and bringing her boyfriend.  He really has a drinking issue, goes out and gets completely smash, cheats on the sister and she had a mysterious injury that we all were skeptical about last year that she claims to have come from a fall. My wife will be close to 20 weeks pregnant when they will be here and I just don't see if being a good combination fo having two kids,a pregnant wife and a house full of drunk people. Am I the asshole for telling someone they need to go a week-week and a half without drinking because I don't like the way the act.",

We were arguing and out of the blue she says \"You don't care about my insecurities\" I know the few things shes insecure about, and I try to help her with them. Then she says \"I'm also insecure about the fact that no other guy will be able to date me or love me, because of how you treat me\" So first of all this caught me off guard, because why the fuck is she having thoughts about being with other people while shes with me? Anyways, I then tell her to stop faking her insecurities because that blatantly isn't true. I then tell her how constantly she boasts about how many guys want her, and she has to curve 4-5 guys to be with me. She then also made a post on one of her social medias that said \"4 guys bought me roses for valentines, and only one of them did something impressive\" and then another screenshot of her friend saying \"Theres single people out there, while you have 4 different dates with 4 different guys\".  I asked her about this, and she said \"Oh baby its just guys that ask me out, but I curve them because I'm with you but my friends joke about it\"  Why is she even bragging about how many guys are interested in her if shes \"insecure\" about it?   \n\n\nAITA for calling her out on her shit?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "He quit his last job because of some problems (we had a very hard time…) and recently started working at a new place. His old job included shift-working and so does his new job too. He usually takes the car and drives to his workplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe (20) and my boyfriend (24) have been together for more than a year. We used to see each other nearly every second day, sometimes every third before he started his new job. I’m a very sensitive person and definitively NOT made for long-distance relationships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis new workplace is, like his old, a little bit more than an hour away. With train, you have to travel more than 1.5hrs. Since he works in shifts, he usually doesn’t get stuck into a lot of traffic. His car has some issues, but nothing serious (f.e the radio doesn’t work properly and the paint started to peel off, sometimes the brakes shudder). He only will be working for 6 months to earn enough money for studying at the university in town, which he wants to start this comming summer.  Last week he told me that he wants to move  to the new city because of the shift-work. He asked me for my opinion. I told him I don’t want to be selfish and try to keep him here if he thinks it would be easier for him to move. I didn’t tell him that I actually don’t want him to move, but I got really quiet and didn’t really know what to say. I already feel bad for wanting him to keep here. I always put him and his before me and my feelings and I only want the best for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got in an argument. \n\nI’m a heavy introvert, I usually don’t say much in an argument and rather keep my thoughts to myself.  This time, I told him in a calm voice that I don’t know how well I can handle the distance if he moves away and that this scares me. I also asked him if the effort would be worth, because he’ll only stay for less than six months. He got angry an started to yell at me that he doesn’t know what he should do and if I had a better idea I should tell him the solution. He said: «You act like I’d disappear completely for the whole half-year.» I answered:»fine, then move. Because my opinion and words doesn’t matter anyway», this made him even more angry but I know he’s going to do what he wants anyway, so why try?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince he does a lot of selfish things like suddenly cancelling plans in last minute, ignoring me for many hours while playing video games or not answering my messages or phone calls, I got really mad. Also the few last weeks have been rough for me and there was a lot of anger I felt in my stomach, so everything came over me like a huge wave. I screamed at him that it’s also not easy for me because he already works in shifts and we barely see each other. The argument went from the moving-topic to the relationship-topic. I didn’t say anything because everytime when I get angry I start to cry (i hate it), just swallowed his words. He called me selfish and that I don’t understand anything (meaning I don’t understand how bad it is for him to drive to work and back because of the car and the shifts).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn’t spoke the rest of the evening.

      "description": "I’m on a mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. \nBasically, I was touring colleges with my parents and we were at an informational session and a boy (about 17) walked in with his mom. He immediately caught my mom’s attention and she started telling me about how handsome he was. I wasn’t a big fan of this so I uncomfortably told my mom to stop and she just smiled and kept staring at him. In the middle of the session she takes out her phone and starts taking pictures of him (pretending like she’s taking pictures of me). I try to get her to stop but she didn’t seem to understand why I was so uncomfortable. She sends the picture into our family group chat (my dad, her, my brother, and me) with the caption “That boy is so handsome.” My brother immediately freaks out (he’s not with us) and texts me asking what the hell my mom is saying and how that’s really weird. \n\nLater I confront my mom about the picture, telling her it was really weird and sort of creepy for her to do that. She just smirks and asks why and that she doesn’t get it and she thinks it’s funny. I told her no, it’s not funny, and that she shouldn’t be doing stuff like that. She still doesn’t get it and starts saying it’s her freedom of speech to do what she just did. Exasperated at this point I say “You’re 50 years old and you’re taking pictures of a 17 year old kid!” She immediately gets what I’m implying and she gets very upset. She starts yelling at me telling me I’m ungrateful, that she clothes me, feeds me, and even took me on this trip and how dare I treat her this way. I apologize for what I just said, but I still stand firm that what she did was just not right and now she’s livid.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

We talked for a bit and it ended with me deciding just to completely cut her off (we live with eachother so it will be near impossible) But in my head it makes sense since she doesn't want to pursue anything despite her constantly saying she wants too.

My mom and her birth sister and their husbands have been paying for all of his expenses for the last four years and for lawyers to try and get new paperwork for him to no avail. **They have reached out and are asking for $50 dollars a month from family members to keep up with his expenses.**\n\nMy husband is still in school, and I'm a teacher. We're both 24. We both have student loans. However, we can afford to go out to eat, go on a vacation each year, and pay for other recreational activities. Is it selfish of us to not contribute money to my uncle?\n\n**TLDR; My uncle is mentally disabled and is a sex offender who can't legally get government assistance or a job because of lost paperwork. He's out of jail and needs financial assistance. AITA if I don't help out?**",

      "description": "So I have a cousin reach out to me the other day because she's homeless. She's 20 and her mom is mentally ill, and her dad died shortly after she was born. I kept the call short and didn't ask for any specifics about her situation because the truth is I don't want her living with me while she gets stable or whatever. I should add that I still live with my parents, and they don't want her living here either. We've never been close, and my entire family gets weird vibes when she's around. \nShe ran away from home last year and was living with a guy, I think she's \"homeless\" because her and the guy broke up and she refuses to go back to her mom. She's also a high school dropout, has no job, and uses drugs. Before anyone asks, both her and her mom are absolutely leeches. They live off welfare, have never worked a day in their lives, and have no shame about going on Facebook and asking relatives for money. I have relatives in two other states whom in the past have stepped in and offered to help but she ultimately refused and came back to where she grew up. I haven't seen her in a couple years, we've never been close, my parents and I don't want to be in a situation where we offer shelter but later have to kick her out bc drug use or refusal to get a job. We live in a big city, so there are tons of services available to provide food, shelter, housing and job skills if she really needs it. She's not a kid anymore, and I don't think we should be forced to help her just bc we're the only family she has in-state.\n\nTL;DR: I don't feel comfortable helping out my homeless cousin, even though I'm the closest family she has",

      "description": "I'm 15, almost 16, and I've struggled with depression for the past 2 years, and my parents know about it. The issue is that my parents have done things that might be considered abuse, although I'm not sure. Examples include hitting me or my brother and saying it wasn't hitting, getting mad when I don't respond to texts immediately, and sending me passive-aggressive messages like articles on the dangers of phone addiction. The most prevalent of these issues, however, is not giving me the space I need. I'm very introverted and when I come home from school I'm exhausted and any more social interaction makes me function poorly and puts me on edge. My parents don't seem to realize that, despite my telling them this, and so they constantly come into my room to talk to me. It doesn't matter if the door is closed or if I tell them I need space to do homework. They will open my door and come in to talk to me, and they want my undivided attention.\n\nSo this morning I had no energy to leave the house, and my parents were constantly hovering over me. I kept moving rooms to get away from them, and they kept following me. Finally, I decided I was done and went into my room and locked the door. My parents have always had a rule against locking my door, but they lock their own doors sometimes and when I don't lock my door they seem to think that my room is wide open. So when I locked my door, my parents panicked and were texting me things like \"We're worried about your safety and we want you to unlock your door.\" Considering all the issues I've had in the past with them, I didn't unlock my door, worrying that this was a guilt trip. My dad proceeded to break the lock. He then told me how much he and my mom were supporting me, letting me stay home from school when I felt bad and how he was worried about my safety.\n\nSo AITA for locking the door, or is there something else?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are still both living with our respective parents, but we expect to be moving out very soon. I'm graduating in Environmental Science this year and as such I'm trying to make an effort to be more environmentally responsible and I thought trying out vegetarianism could be a good step (I don't have an issue with animals being killed humanely for food, but knowing an animal didn't have to die for me would be a bonus!) . Last night, whilst we were out grocery shopping, I offhandedly mentioned 'I was thinking of going vegetarian when we move out', thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal, after all, I'm responsible for what I put in my own body, right? This isn't the first time I've mentioned thinking about vegetarianism, either. My boyfriend was horrified, I could tell he was angry at what I just suggested. He waited until we got back to the car, not wanting to make a scene, then he gave me what felt like a telling off. He said he's been looking forward to cooking in our own place for ages and now I've gone and ruined it. He said that vegetarians were unhealthy as they all look unwell, using my sister as an example (my sister is skinny, but I don't think she looks unwell). He said would never date a vegetarian girl and how embarrassing it would be to be invited around to a friend's or family's house for dinner and for me to have to say I don't eat meat so they'd have to make special arrangements. He also was concerned I'd try and force vegetarianism on him and any future children we have.  \n\n\nI tried reassuring him that we can still cook together, that I'd even be fine with meat being cooked in the same pan or with the same utensils, that it doesn't bother me that he eats meat, there are plenty of couples who have different diets. I said I don't think people would mind catering to a vegetarian, but he wasn't convinced.   \n\n\nIt upset me a lot. Part of me feels like it's my choice what I eat, but then I also feel completely selfish since I know he enjoys us cooking and eating together. Of course I value the environment, but relationships require compromise. He suggested a compromise could be just cut down on meat, or just eat white meat and that there are better ways to save the environment. Would choosing to go vegetarian make me an asshole?",

      "description": "I went on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) last night to browse through streams. My country is rather small and therefore the \"big\" streamers only average about 50 people at night.  I was bored and just picked the streamer with the most views, because the chat and streamer interaction are usually pretty funny anyways. I hopped into this female streamers stream to check it out and get a feel for the community. She was playing Golf with friends, with really loud music blaring, making her almost unintelligible. The chat was mostly mods and year old subs \"fishing\" for her attention. At this point, I decided to joke a bit and posted the emote ResidentSleeper in the chat. She apparently took it very personally and told me to just leave if I think the stream is boring. She gave me a chat time out for two minutes. After it ran out I wrote:\n\n\"Damn, I tried to leave but fell asleep before I managed to click the 'X'\"\n\nShe perm-banned me while her chat kept asking if I was dropped on my head etc. while she was telling me that I was immature and should enjoy my 5 minute fame. I chuckled and went on my way.\n\nLater this night, I was once again doing the same thing, where I was looking through streams and hopped into the most viewed again. I saw her chatting and wrote \"@(female streamer) Oh god, I almost fell asleep just reading your messages in chat\"\n\nShe told me I was immature etc. while the streamer saw my post and asked what was going on. I said I was just joking, but he got visibly mad, told me to shut my fucking mouth because I'm the kind of dude no one wants in their chat.\n\nI was kinda blown back made me think for a minute. I just left the stream while everyone called me a hater and spammed the streamers name and hearts. I came back 30 minutes later asking why everyone got so mad. I was just told to \"Just stop fucking trolling. Just fucking don't.\"\n\nAm I the asshole? The chat and streamers seem more toxic than me, but this sticks with me for some reason.\n\nTLDR; Joined female streamers stream, joked that it was boring, I got banned. The next day I found her chatting in another stream, said she was boring again and got told off pretty harshly. ",

I told him that I was sorry and he won’t reply to me anymore. \n\nAITA? ",

Guy at work is telling a group about how the demo for a new web site was received by a cross-functional team who commissioned it. Apparently it was well received except the once piece of feedback was (paraphrased) that there were no white people in the home page image. The guy doing the demo is basically mocking the people who made the request for a more diverse image. Now, I know his politics and he can't stand political correctness, but to have him say this out load to a group during a meeting was kinda amazing. The next day one of his direct reports restated the same to a different group. Again, I know this other guys politics and he also is anti-political correctness.\n\nPart of me wants to stay the hell away from all of this, but it's also really inappropriate (in my view) to basically mock someone who asks for a photo to be more diverse. Our company actually has corporate LGBT groups, groups based on your heritage, etc. It goes out of its way to say diversity is a strength.\n\nI don't know what to do here, but the whole thing just stuck me as wrong.

      "description": "Today, during class, our teacher tried to make a joke to one of my classmates where he mentioned her mother, it wasn’t a mean joke, it was something along the lines “you wouldn’t want to bring your work tools and work on your kitchen table next to your mom cooking, would you?” \n\nHe really didn’t mean it in a bad way, he was simply trying to be funny as always, to lighten the mood. What he didn’t know is that my classmate lost her mother to cancer a year ago or so, and talking about her mother always makes her cry, it’s a really sensitive topic for her, which is understandable.\n\nWhen she started crying the teacher got really confused, and when she got up to go the washroom he got even more confused, he had no idea what made her cry.\n\nAt this moment, I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to tell him she cried because he mentioned her mother, but on the other hand, was I even allowed to talk about it? Sooo... I told him, but really discreetly. I just told him “she lost her mother.” and I could see he felt bad, he immediately went after her to apologize.\n\nAfterwards, she seemed to be angry. I asked her if she was angry at me for telling him about her mother passing, but she reassured me that no, she understands why I told him, she was more angry at what the teacher told her, “I’m sorry I didn’t know, why didn’t you say anything?” he said. I understand why she got upset, because it’s not something you can simply tell people.\n\nI know about her mother because she’s the one who told me. Our classmates know about her as well because she’s also the one who told them. We all know about her because SHE told us. \n\nAnyway, I feel REALLY bad about it. Should I have kept my mouth shut and let her tell our teacher herself?\n\nSorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. Thanks for reading ",

      "description": "I have lived with my grandmother since 2016 and ever since then I have been exposed to secondhand smoke. I live there with my dad, my uncle and of course my grandmother. I have an anxiety disorder and I freak out most in regards to health and my well-being. I also have a mild breathing issue which is not diagnosed yet (I have a pulmonary function test next week). My grandma smokes in her bathroom, which is very close to me and my uncles room. I am constantly complaining about it because it makes my chest hurt. Regardless if she closes the door or not the smoke travels all over the house including directly in my room. I have tried to use fans pointing in all directions but to no avail. I spend all day in the house because I am currently unemployed.  I used to have a job but I quit to take care of her because of her growing medical issues. \n\nFor the past few months, I have needed to help her shower because of an injury she had. I don't mind helping her shower but the problem arises when she smokes right before I need to shower her. She will sit in there smoking and I will place stand up fan to try to air it out. No matter what I try the smoke still clings to the air. Most of the time, I just shower her anyway since it is a very fast process but I am really not happy to do so. I recently became ill and went to the doctor. The doctor told me that I have acute bronchitis and ever since I have tried to avoid going anywhere near her bathroom until this clears up. \n\nToday, I am still not feeling well and she asked me to help her shower so I called my father (who was not home) and asked him if he could come home and shower her for me. He said he would so I let her know about it and she got extremely mad at me. She told me that she is sick of my complaining and wants me to move out. I am not one to get into arguments with anyone but every time I bring up her smoking it feels like I am the only one that is is affected by it. My uncle told me to \"stop being a f-ing ass about it\" to which I just walked away.  Everyone in the house is acting like I am the asshole, so am I? I get that she is sickly but I feel like I need to watch my own health at the moment.\n\nTL:DR - Am I the asshole for complaining about sickly grandma's smoking habits?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for any spelling or grammar errors, I am not a great typer.",

She wants to start having kids, I want to wait until we get married. I have been planning on proposing to her, and was going to do it within the next few weeks.\n\nYesterday she came to me with a positive pregnancy test and told me that she was pregnant. I was happy, I wanted to wait, but it wasn't the end of the world that it came a bit earlier than I had planned.\n\nWhen she left for the night, I went out and bought my own pregnancy test. This is not because I don't trust my girlfriend. I do trust her, and I have no reason to believe that she would be faking a pregnancy. However, with big life changing events I always want to be sure that all the information is correct. \n\nWhen she came over today I asked her to take this second pregnancy test just to be sure. She adamantly refused saying that it shows that I dont trust her. She was extremely upset and started saying stuff like, ''If you can't even trust me when I say I'm pregnant how could we raise a child together?''\n\nThis is nto about trust at all to me, this is about being sure. I would also get a DNA test or wHatever it is to make sure I'm the father. This isn't because of trust, it's because I've heard of horror stories and I don't want to end up like that.\n\nShe never did take the pregnancy test, and if she doesn't that could seriously be a dealbreaker to to me.

      "description": "Before I start: I dated someone that I was eventually engaged to, but this is well before the engagement. She comes from a very tradional(aka racist) southern family. I’m Jewish. I would have to put up his racist comments about myself and my family. I would have to put up with him saying I’m only getting my jobs for my religious and cultural identity and overall just listen to him belittle me whilst my partner would tell me to put up with it because her family was important to her. He would also openly belittle minorities in public, openly say racist slurs (including the n word,) and belittle my partner for being LGBT+(and when I stood up for my partner, they yelled at me later for being confrontational.)\n\nAnyway...\n\nWe (my partner and I) were both in college at thisbtime but I was lucky enough to score two really good jobs- I worked for a public radio station in the morning and worked at a television news station during the evening. I didn’t have a great paycheck or anything but I made enough to pay rent and buy food whilst also saving up enough for emergencies, and had saved up a couple of thousand dollars to spend on my family’s holiday gifts.\n\nSo a few weeks before Christmas her father was furloughed. He worked for a freight company (Let’s call them PU) and his wife was a secretary at a junior college- definitely did not make enough to support a family all by herself, in which they lived WELL above their means. I never really celebrated Christmas but told my partner I would celebrate it with their family, and my family decided to celebrate it with them as well.\n\nWe invited them over for Christmas and did the works- we decorated the house with a ton of lights, got a 12-foot Christmas tree, dressed up our 4 dogs, the works. I didn’t tell my partner any of this but my parents and her parents had told me that they instituted a $20 spending limit for everyone, as they didn’t want them to feel bad.\n\nTwo days before Christmas my parents and I hop into game mode. They saw how miserable I was around them and decided to help me out. They bought my partner and I new laptops, my dad got my mom a new desktop, my mom got my dad a PS4, and I went online and bought her dad a $900 scope for the new hunting rifle my partner bought him. When it came to Christmas we all opened their presents and it was nothing crazy- a candle for my mom, a coffee mug for my dad, etc. They start opening our presents and her dad is PISSED. He is the kind of man that considers himself a provider- nobody can upshow him in front of his family and we committed a major faux pas. He immediately sees what we’ve done and just stares at me and my family the whole time. My mom turns to him and says “oh, it must be something to do with our religion- I guess we don’t really understand Christmas.” He left furious, without saying a word. My partner didn’t talk to me for weeks.\n\nWe broke up less than a year later.\n\nAre me and my family assholes?",

Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of having two small dogs as the ring dog and flower dog in my wedding. I never wanted kids in the procession or at the wedding in general. As I’ve gotten older, I kind of wouldn’t care if older kids were there but absolutely no little children. I’ve been to too many wedding where babies and little kids make too much noise during the ceremony or completely ruin the first dance or knock over cake or put their dirty little fingers in it or the food. I agreed to pay for 2 babysitters for the children at our wedding in a different room of the venue so they could at least be there, but so many moms have asked me about who was gonna be the ring bearer/flower girl. I told them that no children will be in the wedding, and my friends 2 little dogs who I absolutely adore will be walked down with the rings and flowers instead. I guess that’s the wrong answer because most of the moms look at me like I slapped in the mouth. A lot of people said they couldn’t/wouldn’t come. Even my MoH was a little offended that I wouldn’t even choose her niece who’s not even 3 yrs yet. Am I really the asshole here? ",

      "description": "I own a lawn care company.  We do everything from mowing, to weeding, to building gardens, any and all things related to a yard.  In the summer, I have some hired help from guys that are on break because we have a lot more customers then.   Currently in the winter it’s just me as most everyone is in uni.  I’m a bit of a perfectionist and go by the philosophy that each yard is an advertisement for the company.  I spend longer than I have to in order to make each yard look pristine, so that the customers are happy, and anyone who walks by will notice. \n\nRecently, my little sister (9th) came up and said it wasn’t fair that I was making so much money and said she wanted me to hire her. She’s never had any experience in yard work.  Barely weighs more than the mower.  Yard work is tough, it wears me out and I’m in good shape.  At first I said flat out no, but I knew I was gonna be out of town the next week so I asked my grandparents to ask her to mow for them so I could see how she did.  It was rough.  The lines were crisscrossing over the yard, she missed a lot of spots, the edging was 😬.  I can’t let her do that to customers’ yards.  It would make them have a heart attack.  The company is supposed to have a very high standard. I just don’t think she can do it. AITA?",

      "description": "At my college, pretty much everyone Juuls/vapes/smokes cigs/dips. It’s really common for students to pick up this habit. I began Juuling the summer before my freshman year. My freshman year roommate had never Juuled before when we met, but she had drunkenly smoked cigs and dipped. \n\nSince we lived in a dorm, it was sometimes inconvenient to buy pods. Myself, including most of my friends, did not have a car on campus. Thus, we would have to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest gas station to purchase packs of Juul pods. This wasn’t always a problem, but sometimes rain or cold weather would make this trek difficult. \n\nTherefore, it became common to buy pods off of other people. For example, someone would ask in a dorm groupme if anyone had a pod they could sell. I would often use these group chats or my friends who juuled for an extra pod. Since it was often difficult to find someone, I had a great idea. If my roommate, who did not Juul, began Juuling, then I would have another person who I was close friends with and in close quarters with for pod purchasing.\n\nI began by offering my roommate to hit my Juul. More and more, she would start hitting it. Also, several of our friends in our circle were Juuling often, so they began encouraging her too. I finally told her one day that she should buy her own Juul, and she agreed that it was a good idea. So I walked to the store with her and the next thing you know, she began Juuling often and was another person I could buy pods off of. \n\nFlash forward a year: this former roommate is now still addicted, and I often see her not only Juuling but smoking cigarettes on her Snapchat. I don’t talk to her as much anymore, but she definitely has an addiction now. \n\nI feel bad for contributing to her addiction, but I also think that she probably would have started Juuling either way at this school. Also, I didn’t literally force her to Juul and get addicted. She had also tried nicotine before, so I didn’t introduce this to her. Am I an asshole for this? ",

      "description": "I volunteered for a shelter-less dog and cat rescue (read: animals were rescued and cared for entirely by foster parents, there was no central structure to house them in).   I’m an experienced foster parent and took on a 3 year old male dog as a foster but told them I couldn’t keep him through the holidays because I travel with my resident dog. I pay for food, train at home with him, and shuttle him to and from all of the rescue’s adoption events and potential meet and greets. The rescue spends most of its time advertising the puppies and cars they have up for adoption but rarely post about my guy (and, because this rescue is shelter-less, social media is really the only way people hear about their adoptive dogs). As time goes by, the foster dog has more and more behavioral issues (crate breaking, marking, general destruction), and I ask that the rescue find somewhere else to place him. They tell me that all of their foster homes are full. I take my foster to obedience classes that I pay for, put tons of time into working with him, but things don’t get much better and he’s a constant source of stress. \nFast forward to early December when the rescue posts on social media congratulating themselves/thanking people because all but one of their animals (my foster) has been adopted out. I call pissed off and demand that they place my foster elsewhere, since all of their other foster homes are obviously open. They tell me again that no one else can take my guy but that “they’re working on it”. I’ve had this dog for six months now and the holidays are two weeks away. I tell them that if they don’t find a place for him by the end of the week I will leave him tied to the railing of the rescue coordinator’s house (empty threat, but they didn’t know that).  Magically by the end of the week, they find an adopter for him, and tell me they will no longer use me as a foster parent and cut all ties. Suffice to say I wasn’t interested in working with them anymore either. \nAITA, because I no longer wanted to devote my time and money to a volunteer position that wasn’t working out and that could have been resolved if the rescue was doing their job, advertising the dog and placing him elsewhere if his current placement wasn’t working out?\n",

We met via Tinder. \n\nWe ended up sleeping together on the 4th date (I'm easy, I know) and honestly it just o.k. so I mildly ghosted him [still responding to msgs but not flirting, telling him I don't want to hang out again, etc]\n\nOn Saturday I was at a bar/pub with a group of friends in Big City. Turns out he was there with his band and some guys he used to play football with. I know others in his band so I waved at the group, smiled at him and went on my merry way to get lit with my good friend Jose Cuervo.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, I went over to chat with some friends in his group and he starts getting louder and louder spouting gibberish until I hear \"WHAT A WHORE.\" I stopped mid-conversation and looked at him, and he's staring straight at me. He starts spouting off some rude shit that I can't remember but I remember being shocked at what was coming out of his mouth. Stuff along the lines of \"your face just hides your shitty body\" and something about how much better he could do than me. \n\nHe stopped and I was pissed at this point, so I came out with \"You should know you're EASILY the smallest I've ever been with. And the sex fucking sucked.\"\n \nTwo things: I was about 2 rounds of Jose in at this point, am naturally loud and the music died out right as I started saying it. Everyone within a 4 table radius heard, and a few people burst out laughing. The girl he was sitting beside mildly side-eyed him and moved closer to his other friends. Our mutual friend leaned over and whispered that I should probably leave now, and I went to a different bar with some friends and drank the rest of the night away. \n\nSince then, he's been messaging me and calling me a bitch for calling him out like that and he was just about to get laid but I fucked it up for him and I need to learn to keep personal shit like that to myself.\n\nI feel like I was justified after the abuse, but I'm kind of starting to feel bad. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR - slept with a guy, saw him at a bar, he said mean things, i said equally mean things. he had a small peen.",

Anyways I go to Germany and a few days into the trip I meet a really pretty woman, we talked for a while and I see her almost everyday. The more I talk to her the more I realise how good we get along and how much we are really bonding. But sadly I have to leave. Before I left she gave me her phone number and home adress if I ever decide to go back. I'm now back in Canada since about a month now and we still text, call and video chat eachother. I think I am in love with her and want to see her again. Now the problem is that if I go back there I might not see my parents or family ever again. I don't see my parents anymore anyways so it's not like anything big will change.

This was fine, though somewhat annoying.\n\nNot more than a week later she downloads Snapchat, for a random American she spoke to online (Who had previously encouraged her to break up with me.), And I was angry, that she was speaking to him, and that she would download Snapchat for him, but not me (Her literal boyfriend). She then claimed that she installed it because they couldn't talk on other apps. \n\nI asked for her username, and figured that was that, but no, she uninstalled the app leaving messages unread and a few snaps unopened. Then again, refused to download it again just to check out the messages at least. \n\nTL;DR, AITA for being angry that she outright refused to download Snapchat to talk to me, but would for her American friend who allegedly couldn't talk to her on any other app, then uninstalled it without telling me and refusing to just check my messages on there.

      "description": "This morning while I was cleaning my room, someone I'd been playing Garry's Mod with called me on discord, he's been calling me a lot lately and it's started to get on my nerves since I try and hang out with multiple people and he's always calling me a dick and such for telling him I'm going to go and hang out with someone else (after we'd played for over an hour.) \n\nHe called me (I missed the call) and I responded \"What?\" he replied that he was bored and wanted to play and I asked \"Why are you coming to me\" (In hindsight I understand this was rude) he said something like \"You're the only one online, why are you being a dick?\" (Not as elegantly though) and I corrected some grammar because I am just sort of like that and I said \"I'm cleaning my room and you always call me when you're bored\" he replied, \"lol, what's wrong with that?\" I responded with the classic mom sort of thing that goes around \"You're a teenager, I'm sure you can find something to do rather than call me over and over when you're bored\" \\*Again to be clear, he always calls me when he's bored and or spams me on steam/discord\\* he said I sounded like his mom (I was kind of going for that) I said \"before I became your friend, what did you do when you were bored\" because I wanted him to do that, sounded reasonable to me he said \"Be bored\" like what? why... \n\nHe told me to \"clean my room instead of being his therapist lol\" (horrible grammar in the phrase but I didn't correct him) I told him to go and be bored, I'd call him when I was able to hang out or play and then took a stand on the fact that he is also always making fun of me for playing guitar and piano and saying I suck. (I have low self-esteem because I taught myself guitar and stopped piano lessons 3 years ago) I then replied \"Saying it's a joke doesn't fix anything\" because I figured he'd say that when he did that it was a joke when I pointed it out, he'd always say it was a joke and act like that fixed things. He said \"oh come on man, that's just me messing around\" and then he saw what I said and replied \"well my bad, I'm just a dick in general\" and then \"toughen tf up lol.\" \n\nI hate when people tell me to toughen up because I was never a jerk to him before this besides saying I wanted to play something else but when I confront him on my problems that he could fix he said toughen up (decent advice, I do need to toughen up but I still hate this.) I blocked him on discord. He started messaging through steam, a lot more of a jerk now. \n\nThe conversation started out with him calling me a whiny baby shit and to toughen up again and I replied with some cursing and overall made it clear I did care for him as a friend and liked him but wished he wouldn't say mean things and he said I sounded like his girlfriend and I said maybe he should listen to his mom and girlfriend since they made some good points and he said that I was white as f\\*\\*\\* and that he didn't like white people and said bye and that he was also white.

      "description": "My husband’s best friend got engaged, and my husband is in the wedding party. Because the Best Man has never actually planned a bachelor party before, my husband is doing most of the planning. In his friend group, they usually do a golf weekend. Also, this is likely the last bachelor party in the group as the rest of the guys are already married. \n\nHowever, we have a 2 year old and I’m currently pregnant with our second child and due on August 25th. When he started planning the bachelor party, I told him that planning something earlier in the summer would give him a higher chance of going for the full weekend.  I originally framed it as not wanting to be stuck watching our toddler by myself for a full weekend in my third trimester while he’s out golfing, which was a mistake. \n\nThey finally picked a date for the bachelor weekend. It’s August 8th - so I’ll be 37 weeks pregnant and considered full term. It’s about two weeks before my actual due date. The bachelor party will be in another state, about 2 hours away from where we live (without traffic). On previously golf weekends, he has been terrible about keeping his phone charged and it can be hard to get in touch with him.  Also, while he doesn’t drink, he does smoke pot, and would most likely be smoking the whole weekend. \n\nHe thinks that as long as he gets someone to watch our toddler while he’s gone, it’s fine to go for the full weekend (2-3 nights). This makes me incredibly nervous. I am willing to compromise and let him go for a night plus a day of golf.  I would also stipulate that he has to keep his phone on and charged at all times, and that he would have to stay sober in case I go into labor.  He seems to think this is an unreasonable compromise. I’m of the mindset that there are very few times in our marriage where my needs/wants/desires take priority over his, and that this is one of them. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting him to go to a bachelor party for 2-3 nights so close to my due date?

      "description": "I live in an apartment building in TN, USA and have largely enjoyed my experience here. However, the bane of my existence are my next door neighbors who continuously smoke weed inside of their unit which is adjacent to mine. As soon as I get off the elevator on my floor (which is inside, like a hotel), it stinks of weed. To make it worse, we share a wall and I'm assuming maybe some of the vent system too because my bathroom and bedroom that is nearest to their unit smell as well. This happens at all hours of the day, as early as 8am to late at night. I have politely asked management to tell them to stop, which has not worked. I called my city's non-emergency line, and a police officer came to talk to them..but it is still an ongoing issue. I personally do not smoke, and have nothing against people who do smoke. That is their personal choice. My issue is that there are so many outdoor spaces to smoke around like their apartment balcony, the courtyards at the apartment, a park across the street. Literally anywhere else. **I just want them to stop smoking inside.** What do I do here? I want to call the police again, I truly don't want them to get arrested or anything..I just do not want to be subjected to the smell in my own home as well as in all the common hallway our floor shares with them. Am I an asshole if I continue to call the non-emergency police line on them?\n\nAlso, I have not laid eyes on the people that live in this unit once. I am a female in my mid 20s living alone and don't want to put myself in any potential danger. That is my reasoning for not talking to them myself.",

He also doesn’t really fit in too much personality wise. \n\n-feels like I have to sit back with him and chat with him most the time, when everyone else is mingling having fun.

      "description": "Hey!\nFirst time poster here! English is not my first language so apologies in advance! This is a throw away account but I need help to figure out if I am the asshole here. \n\nSo me (17) and my boyfriend (19) are dating for 7 months now and we have a good sex life (idk how to say it in another way).\nBoth of us have twitter, mutual followers and friends there. Before january there were a few times where what he had liked appeared on my feed and sometimes were girls in lingerie and underwear. I was uncomfortable by this ( especically because some were like tied up and stuff ) so adding to other stuff that wasn't related to that, I uninstalled the app. Then simply told my boyfriend that I didn't really wanted to see that. He apologized that it got on my feed and that was all.\n\nHowever I still go to twitter on my computer once in a while. I saw that occasionally he had retweeted like boobs and models but that doesn't really bothers me. Idk why, but today I felt like going through his likes. A mistake now I see. This time, besides lingerie and underwear there was porn. Like PoRn pOrN. With other stuff of course.\n\nNow, my problem is not that he's seeing that. At all. I don't think porn is cheating or get upset that he likes other girls pics. I know he likes me :) The thing is, he does not have to like the porn. Yet he does. This bothers me and I feel a little disrespect but honestly can't really explain... The account is on public and that stuff can show in anyone's feed. As a couple I think each others choices reflect on the other and especially this nature of content links to me... I think that type os stuff shouldn't be that out there.. But idk...\n\nSo, would I be an asshole to ask him to stop liking porn on twitter?\n\nSorry if this was long, boring or not that deep, but a girl is struggling here...! Thankssss\n\nTLTR: My boyfriend likes porn on twitter. I don't mind him seeing it, just the liking it part. Would I be an asshole if i ask him to stop?",

A little thing about the DM is that he is terrible at balancing the magic items we get. Some characters are significantly better at combat than others. This wouldn't be an issue usually because I play a Bard (Musical Guy) and my specialty is not combat, but our usual sessions consist of fighting and fighting. When we are not fighting, we are talking with people with ungodly charisma stat that are impossible to persuade. \n\nRecently, we had an offshoot of that campaign in a battle royale style. This is already terrible for my character, but this combined together with some unreasonable calls on plays people wished to do and a specific argument about hitting people with a fireball made me kind of pissed. I also made some vocal complaints about how one character gets a +10000000 to hit on their bows and I can't even heal more than 10 health to my allies. \n\nThen, I just left. I said goodbye like it was just me needing to go somewhere and I packed up my things and left. \n\nI don't feel great about leaving, but I wasn't having fun there and felt like I would have escalated the situation beyond what it was already at and create a larger issue than the game. \n\nTL;DR: I left a D&amp;D session because game balance seems to suck to me, I wasn't having fun and disagreeing many times with players and DM.

      "description": "It seems I will have a few AITA posts today. For context, know that I used to live with my mom, but moved in with my dad after a custody case. My mom is also overweight. My step mom moved in a few months after I did. My dad won the custody case by saying that my mother and brother verbally, physically, and emotionally abused me, which for the most part is not true. I think I deserved what I got because I hadn't gone to school at all, and was all around being delinquent. I also have previously asked my dad and step mom to keep their ill will towards my mom to themselves. Finally, we will call step mom Crown, and mom Katherine. Now, onto the actual story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in the kitchen, and Crown was there with dad cooking some kind of pork. We made some smart comments back and forth as we usually do, and I began to clean off the table, getting ready for dinner. Earlier in the day, my dad got a letter for Friend of the Court telling him he would receive no child support from my mother, which angered him. At that point, Crown was angry too. She decided to say, \"It smells like Katherine in here!\" as she pulled the pork out of the oven. I told her to fuck off and stormed upstairs after spilling her drink. Now after writing this, it doesn't sound very believable, but when it comes to people disrespecting my mom, I get very angry. Anyway, she cried after dinner, and I did not eat with them. My dad wants me to apologize. Am I in the wrong?",

Anyway she made it a point to come up to me and tell me she appreciates how I pulled the weight of my partner and she saw what was going on, I thanked her because it truely was hard on me and I’m literally waddling around because my feet are killing me. She knows how bad I want to go home I ran out of energy at 5 and it’s 12. \n\n\nLater on in the night she comes and asks me if I worked the morning shift as they are letting people who did go home first. I said no because I didn’t. No one was claiming it, the people who did work the morning, wanted to stay because the tip pool is nice during the holidays. \n\nShe says okay and walks off to ask others.\n\nNow we are in a group, she asks me again, “did you work this morning?” She’s staring at me wide eyed and nodding her head up and down as to signal me to say yes so I can get out of there. \n\nI slowly said “yeees”. They captain behind her said “did u really though?” And this captain is not as empathetic and is a bit of a attempted hard ass. \nShe then said “nope you didnt I can tell, storing that in the memory bank.” \n\nWhat a shit situation. Here I had one of my captains try to throw me a bone and now I’m looking like a liar for taking her up on it. There is a part of me that thinks maybe she wasn’t giving me a signal but there’s a big part of me that thinks she was. \n\nJfc, my dad got me this job and it just don’t want embarrass him. ",

      "description": "So backstory:\n\nMy gym has a lot of fitness classes and has rooms for these classes scattered all around the buildings. Its a YMCA so their naturally  very accommodating for many people with disabilities. \n\n\nI was at the gym and i was sitting by the pull up bar training and one of the trainers, an older lady whom looks to be in her 40s, walks up to me and the exchange went like this:\n\nHer: Excuse me, can you do me a favor?\n\nMe: Depends, whach'ya need?\n\nHer: I need you to adjust this mans pants, hes disabled and his underwear is falling down inside of his pants. I need you to pull them up for me, it would be better if a man did it\"\n\nNow lets be honest, I'm totally down to help a disabled preson who can't do something themselves. The other day a blind dude wanted to deadlift so I grabbed the barbell for him, changed his plates to the weight he wanted to lift, and checked his form. No issue.\n\nIn a situation like that i'd even be willing to get over it and pull up the dudes underwear....If it was absolutely necessary, which in this case i felt it wasn't.\n\nLooking at it from her perspective I can see what she's thinking.  If a girl needs something like that done it would probably make most girls uncomfortable to have a man do it, and a woman would be prefered. However most men just don't care, as a matter of fact many might find a man doing it uncomfortable as well and would also want a woman to do it. \n\nEither way, I didn't feel it was my responsibility to do something for a student in her class that would obviously make me uncomfortable when she is just as capable of doing it herself, especially when its her job to attend to the needs of the class. I felt at best it was a simple misjudgment on her part and at worse her simply pawning a dis-pleasurable part of her job onto me.\n\nSo I politely told her that its no big deal if she adjusts the mans pants and she should do so herself.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "For the sake of brevity, the title misses out a lot of important information:\n\n**Context** \n\n\nMy wife and I are recently married, but have been having serious issues since the wedding. I'd been bullied and treated horribly for about 18 months at work and had eventually found another job just before the wedding. \n\nIt paid enough that we could afford an apartment together but only because it was a similarly high-pressure, toxic job like my old one. Since I started dating my wife years before our wedding, I'd also been clear that my current career was not the one for me. It was a practical choice pushed on me by my parents. The money was good (banking) but I wanted it to be a stepping stone to my actual passion as an artist. \n\nA week before the wedding, only 3 weeks in to my new job, I was fired. I still can't explain exactly why this happened - if I'm honest I think a lot of it had to do with my mindset after being so poorly treated in my last job. It was the last straw for me. I couldn't go back to banking after being kicked yet again. My wife and I discussed it on our honeymoon and I explained the plans I'd been making to start an art business.\n\nMy wife agreed, but understood that it meant staying with my parents whilst that business got up and running. She was however very cynical. She'd started a business herself and ran in to problems. She thought I'd fail too and asked me to promise that I would look for something else as a back up.\n\nI did, and all the while my art business was immediately in a good place. She and I fought every single day, however. Staying with my parents while I get this business off the ground was not the deal she wanted. I couldn't give her guarantees around the new business and she was afraid. To her credit, my parents are intrusive and our house is small. My dad promised to build an extension but seeing us fighting, decided against it. She was in a tough place too. \n\nI eventually promised my wife that we'd move out before the end of the year (that would mean we're at my parents for a maximum of 8 months). I didn't want to go back to banking but understood that, if I had no choice, I'd have to think about it. \n\nShe was fed up with everything - our fighting, the house, my parents etc and she left me. We kept in brief contact but other than that we were done. \n\n**The job offer**\n\n\nBefore the year was up, as promised - I was offered a job that could finance a new apartment. It was closer to banking that what I wanted and half-way across the country, but it gave me a fresh start and a truck load of money to keep my art business alive whilst I grew it in to something bigger. I never went looking for this job specifically. A recruiter called me about it and honestly, I only gave him a token effort to push the conversation further. \n\nMy wife knew I was interviewing for the job before she left and wasn't happy about the location. I felt that it wouldn't hurt to at least see if I could get the offer - maybe i could use it as leverage for another job discussion? At least it could guarantee us an exit from our current situation.\n\nBefore accepting the job, I met up with her with her to discuss it. As we weren't together and she did t think we had much of a future, she told me to take it. I offered her different options - maybe we could try to keep things going if she visited me every few weeks and I visited her?  I promised that if she did eventually move, that we would go back to our hometown (we live in the same town) together as often as humanly possible. That we could make weekend trips out of seeing her friends and family.\n\nNothing.\n\nI took the job and have been here for the past few months, but before I left we spoke one last time. She told me that I should have tried harder to convince her to come with me. That I knew she didn't like where I was moving to and took it anyway. That it isn't true to myself and that I'm an unpreducatable person.\n\n\n**So finally - AITA for taking this job?**",

      "description": " It’s my first year at college, and like all 1st years living in the dorms in mandatory. I got randomly assigned a roommate who’s usually fine, except for some small stuff I’ve tried to ignore (like issues with room temperature, dishes, the usual stuff). However, I came to school with a Nintendo Switch and over winter break picked up Smash Bros (a very popular fighting game starring popular Nintendo characters from various games), and now my roommate is always playing it. He doesn’t ask to use the console, just grabs a controller from my desk and boots the system and plays the campaign. There’s multiple slots for different campaigns, so his use of the game doesn’t interfere with my progression, except for the fact that he is ALWAYS using it. If he’s in the room and not doing homework, he’s probably playing Smash. At this point, I’m starting to get sick of the game because it’s on in the room so often, and even when I want to play other games on my console he acts offended when I kick him off. I asked a friend about this who said I was being a dick, because his gameplay doesn’t overwrite my progress, but I wanted 3rd opinions. ",

      "description": "OK so, I'm fairly sure I'm an asshole, but I'm not sure if its only me being one. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible.\nOK, so I've been sick for the last few years, and recently got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, this is kinda relevant.\nMyself and 2 friends meet up for lunch now and again. One of them, we'll call her T, I see a couple of times a week, we've known each other our whole lives. The other I see from time to time, we'll call her F, but we've drifted apart slightly over the last 15 years. Not for any reason other than we rarely see each other.\nI must add that both of them are good kind people.\nSo we met for lunch on Saturday, I wasn't feeling super great, I had been getting sick in the morning, but I wasn't feeling overly crap either. We met at 2, with T being late as always. A few times during lunch when I said something it was ignored and the other two just kept chatting, I really hate this and it pisses me off, but not a huge deal. Around 4 I decided I was going home because I wasn't feeling great but I was also fed up, so rather than ruin lunch by mentioning them talking over me I just said I was sick and went home. I text T later and just said sorry for leaving early, and that I would see her during the week. She replied with no worries (my name) \n\nOK, so fast forward to today, Tuesday, and I ring her saying I have to go to the town and I'd call in if she's about, I call in and she seems a bit off so eventually I ask her if she's OK. \n\nT ' well I might as well say it, but I thought you could have waited till we were all ready to leave at lunch, it ruined the whole dynamic of the lunch' \n\nMe ' yeah I should have, sorry, I wasn't feeling great' \n\nT ' I know you weren't feeling good but you could have waited another half hour' \n\nAt this point I'm getting annoyed as I've already apologised twice, so I say ' since we're being honest I was a bit pissed off about being ignored' then went on to explain \n\nT 'I don't remember that at all, I can't believe you'd think that'\n\nMe ' look it probably wasn't intentional, or maybe I was being paranoid' \n\nShe's getting tears in her eyes and getting pretty pissed, \n\nMe ' I should probably just go, I've got enough on my mind without falling out with people' ( meaning just being diagnosed with a lifelong illness) \n\nT ' we all have things on our minds, not just you' (she is correct, and maybe I need to take a look at myself to see am I thinking about myself too much) \n\n So I left, but I'm annoyed about it. I don't want to fall out with her, but I also don't want to take All the blame. She holds a grudge forever so it will be up to me to call first. \n\nSo, redditors of the world, before I decide to call/text her, is it just me being an asshole or do we both suck. I will accept my judgement. \n\n\n\n\n",

They showed us their plans and said that because of a local council regulation they will have to redo their plans or get our consent to build.  \n\nOur main concern initially was that the structure was going to be too close and then we wouldn't be able to build an extension ourselves without running into the same difficulty.  We asked them to check with the council and see if this is a possibility and they promptly replied that this wouldnt be an issue.  I then rang the council myself to double-check and discovered that what they said was regarding future build was accurate.  \n\nHowever the background that requires us to give consent in the first place was that their planned structure could overshadow our facing windows at certain times of the day.  \n\nWhen we saw the plans initially we asked about shadowing and they said there wouldn't be any difference.  The surveyor I spoke to said that there had been a shadow plan completed and submitted that says there may be increased shadows during the afternoon but not much more duration than we experience now.  \n\nAITA for being annoyed at then not showing  us all the details of their plans?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my current gf knows my main account name. \n\nI got my first smartphone (iPhone 4) shortly after turning 15, and soon after started seriously dating a girl in high school. Thinking it would be a cute thing to do, I changed my iPhone passcode to a combination of our initials, and shortly after when my parents allowed me to open a separate bank account from them (same bank, just not a joint account with my parents) I set my PIN number to the same 4-digit number. I started using that PIN as my passcode for just about anything that required a PIN, as I like to keep my passwords the same if not similar across all the things I use. The girl and I dated for about a year and a half, splitting up shortly before the second semester of my senior year started. I \n\nI left that code as my universal PIN not out of anything sentimental or trying to maintain my feelings for her, considering it was a mutual and amicable split. The only reason I left the code unchanged is because it had been the same for almost two years at that point, meaning it was muscle memory to use for everything. \n\nFast forward to today - I still have all those same accounts, and while I have upgraded phone models a few times since then, I have just left the same password. I am now 24 (soon to be 25) and have been with my current gf for just over two years. She found out the meaning behind my PIN shortly after we started dating, and just shrugged it off, I’m assuming as to not start a fight with me and/or hurt my feelings over asking me to change it. \n\nHowever, for the last couple months, she has been sort of passive aggressive about getting me to change the code. Keep in mind, at this point it’s been almost ten years since I had that high school relationship and started using that code. The last time she brought it up a few days ago, I tried to explain to her that I haven’t changed the code not because it means anything to me at all anymore, but because while it would be easy to change my phone passcode, it would mean changing the PIN/passcode on a dozen plus accounts (bank, phone plan, social media, two-factor verification, loan payments, etc) that I’ve had anywhere from the last 9-10 years, which would require a fair bit of work along with trying to remember the new password every time I access one of those accounts. I don’t favor the idea of going through the hassle of potentially getting locked out of accounts and the mess that comes with that for the sake of simply changing my password to get her to stop nagging me. \n\nThat being said, AITA for having a level-headed conversation with her saying she might be overthinking/overanalyzing the now completely irrelevant meaning behind my passcode and that I don’t feel like changing it because of the hassle it would create?

      "description": "Sorry this ended up a little long. I just wanted to ask a question but I ended up typing out more than I expected.\n\nSo a little backstory. I (22M) have always been like an older brother for my cousin (20F). We basically grew up together, not living too far away. Spending most of our childhood together, went to the same schools, relying on each other for emotional support through hard ships. She is not always the most reliable person, she has issues with money, relationships, and generally can be flaky. Despite all that I still will love her until eternity. I have a decent job so whenever we hang out, I like to treat her to a meal, or movie, or whatever. She doesn't reciprocate but that doesn't bother me because I view these things as a gift. I'm not expecting to be treated the same way. She has never taken advantage of this, and even offers to split or cover meals occasionally.\n\nShe moved out of their house a year and half ago and ended up with a deadbeat boyfriend. I say that, but he's not the worst guy. Just equally flaky and I see him as lazy, and unable to provide. They ended up having a kid really early into their relationship, and neither of them are working right now. My cousin got laid off, and her boyfriend has a broken leg at the moment so he's on disability. \n\nYesterday night she messaged me asking if she could borrow some money just for a few days ($400). Apparently their electricity went down, the fridge is full of rotting food, and they don't even have enough money for batteries (for flashlights), or candles, or food. The text message I got was a serious guilt trip. I'm letting their kid go hungry because I won't loan them anything. I told them I'd send a pizza over as well as some groceries, but I couldn't lend anymore money because I am broke (it's a lie, but I don't know how else to tell them). The idea of letting them borrow money again makes me uncomfortable. They accepted the groceries and pizza but it feels like I've created a strain in our relationship now.\n\nMy boyfriend tells me I'm being taken advantage of, which I guess is hard for me to see because I are about my cousin so much. I was raised with the mindset ingrained in me that family always comes first. We sacrifice and do anything for each other, but I don't want to loan my cousin money any longer. Am I an asshole because I can afford to but don't want to? How can I handle this without creating a deeper rift between my cousin and I?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been together for 4 years, married for 3 months.\n\nLast year, for my birthday we went out for dinner. While there, she got upset at me for taking too long while I was drinking my 1 beer because she wanted to go home and sleep. No gift, no card, or sex. I mentioned to her the next day that I was hurt that she didn't even get me a card, and that she made me feel like crap when we were out for dinner by rushing me home. We had a huge argument about it, and eventually she apologized. \n\nMy birthday rolled around again today and I was dreading it. I was working late last night and didn't get home until almost midnight. She woke me this morning at 7 AM by smushing my face and asking me how old I was.  I was extremely tired but I couldn't get back to sleep after - she left for work. I was off so I cleaned &amp; we planned for dinner out at 6 PM. \n\nWhen she got home at 6, she gave me a bag and said happy birthday. Inside the bag was an unwrapped t-shirt with a single piece of tissue paper over it. No card, nothing else. I opened the shirt (a generic gag t-shirt for pajamas) and said thank you, then asked when we'd leave for dinner. She said she was tired and wants to take a nap. She ended up sleeping until almost 8 PM. We took my car, and I googled the directions - she was texting the whole drive. While we were eating, she again says she's tired. I said to her that it would be nice to get a blowjob or even a handy. She said that she's tired and will make it up to me another night... I didn't make an issue about it, but jacking off on my birthday just I dunno, sucks I guess. \n\nWe get home, and she goes to bed. She sends me a long text about how she can tell that I'm not happy and that I shouldn't have such unrealistic expectations, that she's tired and she doesn't want to force herself. I told her that I felt like she did the bare minimum humanly possible, and that when we had this issue last year I made my expectations clear. I said that while I appreciated her getting me any gift at all, I felt like putting it in a bag with a tissue was so low effort it was almost insulting. I told her that a simple card was all I asked for and she didn't bother. I told her that getting my first blowjob of 2019 on my birthday isn't , in my opinion, an unrealistic expectation of my wife but I absolutely wouldn't want her to force herself. Lastly I told her that everything aside, I really wanted to just feel like she cared and wanted to make me feel good on my birthday.. instead I felt like crap. \n\nShe freaked and gave me this huge lecture about how she tries so hard and she's so busy and tired, etc. Telling me I'm nit picking everything and having these impossibly high expectations of her. That I'm spitting on her gift and this and that. \n\nI don't feel like what I was expecting was unreasonable.. a card, maybe a gift, preferably wrapped, and a blowjob. \n\nAITA? Am I nit picking and arguing for nothing? ",

And when I told him I didn't feel supported he told me I was ridiculous, my expectations were too high, and he was the paragon of support. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I didn't handle her passing as well as I could have - I was more snappy and had less patience in general - I did try to apologize though.\n\nWell, this leads to him leaving my stuff in front of his apartment in the rain.

So two months (February) I actually did break up with him because it was no longer a healthy relationship, and he just kept saying I had changed and that he had tried to handle me but couldn't anymore so I told him that he doesn't get to play the full victim and blocked him.\n\nAITA?

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to be in theater anymore?",
      "description": "In theater class our class is essentially made of two groups: Special Education Kids and Popular Girls. Earlier in class, I hit my limit and mentally decided against being in theater. Now, I'm not going to lie, the main reason I don't want to be in the class anymore are the people. I don't enjoy being in a class that people only take because we need art credits to graduate.\n\nAdditionally, today I embarrassed myself more than usual by sitting in the middle of a group of the popular girls on accident, then stuttering while trying to move. I had sat down in my normal spot that I had been sitting in for almost the entire class and I zoned out, sitting down in a group of people. One of the girls said \"Theres not enough space here.\" Leading me to look around and realize that I was sitting in a group. I then proceeded to get up and slur my speech, which I never do. The part that bothers me is that once I got up and moved forward a bit, as to not bother them, I heard one of them mumble something. I can't tell what it was, but theres no scenario where that could be a good thing.\n\nMy point is, I don't like the people there or at least spending class with them. I'm sure I could summarize it better, but theatre is a personal experience for me and I don't like having theater with people I'm not personally close to. I have maybe two friends in the class, and if not sitting near them, I feel like an outcast. \n\nTLDR:\n50% Special Education kids, 50% Popular Girls 1%&gt; Friends in class. Want to drop course because I sat in the wrong place, embarrassed myself, chose to move as to fix mistake and heard mumbling behind my back. Want to quit theater because I don't like the people in class.\n\nAITA for not wanting to be in theater anymore?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend (28F) and I (29F) went to Amsterdam for vacation a week ago. Before we left I had told her that I wanted to go see a peep show. I felt like it was one of those things you just have to experience while there. I really wanted her to go in with me but she said she didn't want to do that but it was okay if I did. I tried to tell her that if she went in with me and started to feel uncomfortable we could immediately leave but she said she wouldn't do it. I was torn because I didn't want to go without her but I knew I would be upset if I went to Amsterdam and didn't do it. \n\nFast forward and we are standing outside the peep show, one of those 2euro for 2 mins one. I asked her again if she's sure that she wouldn't go in with me and she said no so I went in by myself. So there I am waiting in line feeling super awkward and staring at the floor waiting. This group of women in front of me start talking to me and ask if it's my first time here. I tell them yes that I feel awkward but I just want to say that I've done it. They told me that it was the same for them, on vacation and just wanted to experience it. They asked me if I was in Amsterdam alone and I told them no that my gf is outside because she didn't want to come in with me. They started laughing and talking about all the sex stores they have been to and showing me all the things they bought. So I started feeling less uncomfortable and had fun talking to them. So it was their turn and they broke up into pairs to go see and one of the girls asked if I would go in with her because the rest already had broken up into pairs. I didn't think anything about it except that it would make it feel less creepy and more like fun bachelorette party or something. We go in and see the girl for maybe 30 seconds before we laugh, say we've seen enough, and then leave. I say goodbye to this group of women and say that I had fun and hope they have a good vacation. I walked outside where my gf was waiting and told her all of what happened. She made a comment about me going in with another girl but it seemed like more in a joking way than a pissed off way and that was it. \n\nWe've been back for a week now and she went out with some coworkers last night and now suddenly she's talking about how it's not okay that I did that. We got into an argument last night but I feel like if she had just come in with me none of this would've happened. AITA?              ",

      "description": "So for context, I live with six other people. One of the housemates is moving out in May, leaving us with a space to fill or we're all going to have to shell out for the missing rent.\n\n\nI'm the youngest housemate at 25; everyone else here is in their late 20s or early 30s. We all have to agree to a housemate before they move in, and we don't like to post classified ads for strangers bc it's so many people and such. We prefer to work our social networks.\n\nMy sister's best friend is 24 (I am 25) and I have known her since we were young kids. I've been encouraging her to consider the spot opening up while she finishes her BA at a nearby state college. She warmed up to the idea after visiting the house last night.\n\n I texted our group chat saying she was coming around tomorrow evening and that anyone who might want to meet her could have the opportunity. Someone asked how old she is, I said 24, and two people shot me down because she is too young (admittedly the two people I have the most conflict with). I'm already feeling defensive bc I'm only a year older than that, and I think I'm a good housemate--I pay bills promptly, I do intensive projects around the house, and I keep common spaces clean. Occasionally I nag people about the noise level, but I have the most acoustically vulnerable room in the house and I can't escape their partying (I have other feelings about drugs and sketchy people but I try to be patient).\n\nSince this potential housie is like extended family I am a little more inclined to push for her. Nobody else has mentioned interest in the room, but idk, am I feeling the urgency too early in March for a roommate on the first of May? I know I have a strong personality and am kinda anxious, so maybe I'm overreacting?\n\nAdmittedly I haven't responded in a way to define whether my behavior could determine whether iata, I guess I'm hoping Reddit can reel me in here.",

Also the family has broken english and i have a hard time communicating with them in our native language.( i am from the same country but was raised in the U.S)\n\nI am at a loss for words i don't know what to feel, i tried to compromise and went to study at a local starbucks and finish up my work their and come back for dinner with them.

      "description": "This is my first post on reddit EVER but y’all seem cool and this has been on my mind for a long time.\n\nTo explain some necessary backstory, here ya go. My parents got divorced when I was around 6 years old and the court decided that my sister (3 years older than me) and I were to see my father every Monday and every other weekend. Things were going relatively well for a few years until I was nine. It was at this time where things started to get tense and to the point where my sister decided to stop visiting my dad. The reason for this is because our stepmom treated my sister so horribly that she couldn’t stand being around her anymore. And to make matters worse, our father never stood up for my sister. Our mom respected my sisters decision to stop visitation and so from that point forward, I visited my dad on my own.\n\nOnce I was 12, the same thing that had happened to my sister started to happen to me. The cruel treatment and the absence of my fathers support. Therefore, I decided to stop visiting as well because the treatment was too horrible and I felt neglected and unprotected. \n\nAfter that, I lived with my mom full time until I was almost 18 when some financial struggle had forced us out of our home. My family moved to another state that was cheaper but that left me in my home state to finish my last few months of high school. I thought the best possible thing was to ask my father if I could live with him so that I could finish high school. \n\nMy father decided that we would talk about it over dinner with his wife. The dinner was awkward (It was like an interview). And seeing your father after years of separation and after puberty is very alien. Anyways, they decided that I could live with them.  \n\nLife at their house was fine for the first couple months but then towards the end, my step mom began to criticize everything in my life. Literally all my relationships (my mom &amp; sister, girlfriend, friends, teachers). This made everything hard because at that age I was very easily manipulated and so I almost lost all of those relationships. \n\nThen college acceptances came around and I got into the college I had been interested in and I told my dad and stepmom I wanted to go. Instead of encouraging me to go the college (which the has been doing before I got the acceptance), they said that I should stay and not go to college. That I could get a job at home and work on my relationship with my father. When I insisted that I was going to go to the university, they said I had been using them and lying to them this whole time. And said that I was manipulating them for my own gain. Also adding that I wouldn’t be able to support myself and succeed in a university. They topped it off by saying if I accepted the admission that I would be kicked out of the house.\n\nI accepted the admission and was kicked out the next morning.\n\nAITA?\n\nI’m open to questions\n\nTLDR: I chose to go to college instead of rekindling my relationship with my father.

      "description": "So I'm 19, and there was a kid a grade below me who just recently died in a workplace accident (worked for some waste management company and through their own negligence somehow got crushed by a dumpster. Horrible accident, I was heartbroken. I wasn't close to the kid but obviously I'm empathetic and felt bad. \n\nNot having been close to his family but having known his girlfriend, I messaged her and asked if the family had a GoFundMe or if there was a specific charity that I could donate to in his name. She wasn't sure but said she would get back to me. She posted on her Facebook that since Justin was a redneck who loved guns, the family would like people to donate to the NRA in his name. \n\nNow I'm not a raging liberal. I'm very moderate. BUT I really wouldn't want to donate to the NRA. It goes against what I believe in. It's not that guns are bad. But I disagree with a lot of the NRA's stances. That said, I understand it's my choice not donate or not donate, but am I an asshole for not wanting to purely because I don't like the charity they chose? Would it be rude to donate to another charity in his name, or am I better off not doing anything at all? What would you do if put into a similar situation? (If you're republican, pretend it was a woman and they asked for donations to Planned Parenthood, or an atheist and were asked to donate to the Catholic Church, or, you get the idea. \n\nTIA! ",

      "description": "So I’m a 17 year old guy, boyfriend is 16. Let’s call him James for this. Me and James have known each other since middle school. We didn’t go to the same school, we met playing a bike racing game online and have sort of kept in contact ever since. We started talking more last year, and it turns out we live in the same state. We start dating right before we meet up for the first time. James’ parents are pretty overprotective, so in order to get me over to his house he lied to them and told them I went to his middle school so they’d trust me more. We spent the day together at his house and had a great time, but his parents found out I was actually his boyfriend and they freaked out. They cut all communication he had with the outside world for 2 months, and wouldn’t let him leave the house unless they were with him. He came out to his parents and they gave him the usual “it’s unnatural” stuff. The only thing he had was an old 3ds that he emailed me on. We talked every night and when he finally got his phone and stuff back a few days after his birthday, we set up plans together and I snuck over to his house. I’ve been doing it about twice a month ever since, and we’re planning on hiding me until they lighten up. His parents refuse to speak to me at all, so in my eyes they’re making harsh judgments about me when they haven’t even gotten my side of all this yet. Theyve threatened him with hiding a camera in his room so he sneak me over. They aren’t gonna do it, but I still don’t think that’s a threat you should be making towards your near-adult child. While I understand they have rules, both me and James believe they’re massively overreacting and are ignorant for not listening to anything I or James have said. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have been reading this message board for almost a day but with that, this is my first ever reddit post so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. \n\nI am a 52 year old mother of 2 kids, aged 26 (girl) and 20 (boy). My husband and their father was killed in a car accident 14 years ago and I have never dated and obviously never remarried. That is not the reason for this post, just setting some background. I had been a very happy stay at mother who was jolted into reality with no work experience, a near worthless college degree and two school age kids. I was lucky enough that insurance and lawsuit were enough to pay off our mortgage so we never lost our home. But the first two years were a struggle like I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Through sheer good luck and timing, I got a job working as a receptionist for a large local company. I very quickly saw a massive inefficiency and in my first two months I was able to save the company over a million dollars. As such I was promoted, kept getting promoted, was offered stock and even a chance to buy into the company and now I am now sales VP. It's a miracle from where we were 14 years ago. But I despise my job. I literally get stomach aches on the way into work every morning and have to sit in my car and scream in order to even walk through the door. I am proud of what I've done but my blood pressure is through the roof and I am very unhappy. \n\nA few weeks ago my friend started a local coffee shop and all I want to do is go work for her for minimum wage and tips. She is struggling but she is very happy, she has regular customers who appreciate her and are happy to see her every morning. She has nice men that come in and I'll sit at my desk dreaming that maybe I'll find a connection with one of them find some sort of companionship. A start up coffee shop doesn't have a great shot but even then I could get some experience and work at Starbucks. My company would be willing to buy out my stake but that would have to be my forever money and I would have to (and gladly) cut back to much more of a subsistence lifestyle. \n\nNow on to my two kids. When I started making legitimate money, one of the promises I made my kids was that I would ensure they made it through college. After our two year struggle, I never wanted to see them in debt. My daughter ran with this, went to a local school, lived at home, got strait A's and she is now starting her first year as a oncology resident. My son went to an out of state school, rented a high end apartment he found on Instagram, probably did an incredible amount of drugs, who knows what with women and spent as much money in his first six months of college as my daughter did in four years. The money I'd saved for him was gone. I made a huge error in judgement in thinking he could responsible with his money and I provided no oversight. He was also put on academic probation because he failed every single class. \n\nHis second semester was a little better and I moved him into the dorms, he got a C average and did a little better. Well I just got the grades from his third semester (last fall) and again he failed every class. Somehow he was also able to take out over $25000 in credit cards and maxed every single one of them out and as near as I can tell hasn't made a single payment. I just flew him home and tonight we had an all out brawl with me telling him how exhausted I am from work and now I'm going to have to sell some stocks to bail him out because I don't have $25000 in cash.\n\nHe started crying and telling me how sorry he was and I thought we were having something of a moment so I started crying and told him how much I hated my job and how I wanted to go work at the coffee shop and what that would mean for him. Well instead of having an ounce of sympathy he exploded on me that if I quit and cut him off I wouldn't be able to pay for his debt and I would be breaking my promise that I'd made to him since his dad died (the timing is not correct, but he is correct that I made the promise). He has a terrific way of making me feel horribly guilty and I let him run all over me in the argument. He went slamming doors all around the house, got in touch with his high school friends and I'm not sure if he's coming home. \n\n\nI feel so stuck. I know that my alarm is going to go off at 5:15 and I'll be driving to a job I hate. I guess to wrap this up, would I be the asshole if I just quit tomorrow and cut him off?\n",

We where on call before all of this and he left for like 5 mins to do something. Not sure what it was (he clamed that he said brb but i never heard that) so i started whining and being annoying. After a while he said he has to go (he wanted to get me presents) so i said ok (very sadly because i didn't want him to go) and he hung up. I sent him some interesting pics and refuse to show too much (he asked multiple times). He was saying how he would tease me back for this and by nature i said \"try me\". He got mad and went off on me saying \"now i have a unappreciative boyfriend\" stuff like that. I never meant for it to turn out like that. I ended up saying \"i love you and im sorry\" at the end of it he left me on read. Without saying i love you back. I was already having a shitty weekend and this fucked me up even more. \n\nI have been full on sobbing for about 30 min just cause of being left on read. I get a text on Instagram and he sent me a post. I said sorry again and we both got in a little argument. It was about how he thinks i don't care for him. Again i said sorry and tried to fix things up. The last thing he texted it that \"you gotta make it up to me\". \n\nTo be fair i didn't tell him i was sobbing. But he knows im pretty much like a baby when im sad.",

      "description": "So here is the back story.  I work full time and sometimes two jobs since my wife won’t work. She says it’s too much to deal with kids and work.  She has been sick today in her defense and I am VERY aware that a stay at home mom job is extremely draining and full time as well.   \n\nHere is where I have some frustrations.  When I was working two jobs she would get mad that I wasn’t doing the dishes or the laundry or cleaning the bathrooms when I would leave at 7 am and get home at midnight or later 6 days a week.  Also she would stress the importance of giving the kids time and attention (which I completely agree is vital).  When I get home during my normal work week (one job only now) I play with the kids, make my own dinner, and then usually do bedtime with the kids and lay in their room till they fall asleep. Then I get to anything I wanted to try and do at home that day and finally sit and watch a tv show or something in bed on the iPad (usually my wife is trying to go to sleep now so I massage her legs while I watch)\n\nSo tonight really pissed me off because she was watching tv and has been sick today.  I’m fine with taking the kids all day on days like this.  I took them to church, played all day, did laundry, and the dishes today.  While I was putting away laundry our 3 year old kept trying to get my wife’s attention while she was cuddling with our 6 year old.  She finally left the room and said “I’m going to bed”.  That never happens so I went to check on her.  She said mom won’t play with me (she said look at this and my wife was too focused on the tv. So then my daughter said “mom, I love you...” and my wife said nothing because of the tv). This pissed me off so I said to my wife that or daughter was sad since she wasn’t getting her attention and my wife shrugged her shoulders like it was no big deal.  This pissed me off so I said that she shouldn’t dare shrug her shoulders like it’s no big deal her daughter was sad.  We started to fight and she pulled the whole I play everyday with them (I don’t disagree with that. She does, but also she goes out weekly with her friends and I always make sure they give her space when I’m home.) I said that’s great but she doesn’t need to play the victim over it and recognize that the fact that a 3 year old felt the need to leave the room and be sad is a big deal.  So am I the asshole here?

      "description": "This may get long, I will try to summarize at the bottom.\n\nTechnically, there are 3 potential assholes in this scenario, as 2 siblings (Sister and Brother) we my co-conspirators.\n\nSome Background:\n\nMy mother is somewhat neglectful and absolutely narcissistic. When my parents divorced I was 13, and I asked her why she didn’t just let dad have custody and she said to me, “Do you know how society looks at a woman who doesn’t have custody of her own kids?” As an aside, I am also angry at her because I am 35 and just realized I have autism which she probably noticed (she is a doctor) and didn’t seek treatment for because she didn’t want an autistic kid. But I digress.\n\nI do love her. She usually equates love to buying us stuff, and we are used to getting a huge Christmas. Even as adults she usually bought us each something nice we wanted, think washer/dryer or big screen tv.\n\nLast Christmas:\n\nShe prefaced the holiday by starting at Thanksgiving telling us she can’t afford more than $50 each, she wants to do more but can’t, etc. My 3 siblings all have 6 figure incomes and were equally annoyed at this because it is exhausting to watch a doctor who sometimes drops $1000 a week on designer baby clothes for one of the grand kids suddenly claim they are in poverty. We don’t care what she gives us, but don’t want to be guilted.\n\nAbout a week before Christmas she calls me and wants me to help her shop for this family she has adopted. We go out and drop $1500 at Target. She then spends like another grand with my sister at ToysRUs (RIP) Apparently she had a patient come in with a sob story, and instead of referring them to organizations like she should have she decides to help them herself.\n\nI will be honest, I don’t have a six figure income, and at this point was pretty near the poverty line myself. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t wicked pissed about the money. I would like to imagine that if I had more money I wouldn’t have felt this way. But as it was we usually just asked for cash in lieu of a tv or whatever to buy extra Christmas for my own son. When she said she “couldn’t afford” to give me more than $50 it felt like she was saying she couldn’t help me buy my son Christmas because she had to buy it for them instead.\n\nBut I bit my tongue, and even played Santa to her adopted family by delivering the gifts. And in January I asked her to loan me my rent, and she just paid it outright instead so I did get my Christmas present after all, and was very grateful.\n\nFast Forward to This Year:\n\nShe starts again with how she can’t afford Christmas, this time before Thanksgiving.\n\nI asked her to help me buy a stove, because we literally don’t have one. I have cooked on a hot plate and toaster oven for 6 months. She says it’s too much, but I found one for $400 black friday and she agreed to split it with me, but it counts as my spouse’s birthday gift this year and mine next year as well. Cool. I’m so fucking stoked, right?\n\nShe texts the whole family again earlier this week, and I will just include the good parts:\n\nMom, “So the family we helped out last year is asking for help again... They brought me a list of items and I’m wondering if anyone wants to help out? Thank you and if you don't want to just say so no problem.”\n\nSister, “Of course they want help again...\r\nLast year was the best Christmas of their life....Someone should tell them there is no santa”\n\nMe, “1. Told ya. 2. If you don't intend to do the exact same thing every year, until these kids are adults then you need to tell them the truth now, \"That the organization that you contacted last year is out of business.\" 3. I might be offended if you hadn't a. Already bought me a Christmas present and b. Didn't already give me a billion things this year. Let's not forget that you have at least one adult child who lives in poverty as the result of undiagnosed mental illness. But, I digress. And finally, 4. I would be happy to shop with you if you want, and deliver like last year.”\n\nBrother, “Yeah, you should actually help her fill out paperwork for an organization. Probably too late this year but you're basically setting a precedent for every future year 😂”\n\nLater my mom called me:\n\nSo, she calls me and asks why my brother and sister are being assholes, lol. She does this thing where she pretends like one of us wasn’t involved. Not sure the motive, but regardless I pissed her off and she hung up on me. This is basically what I said:\n\n“You justify to us not buying Christmas by saying, “I don’t have money.” Which is EXACTLY what you said to us last year. Then you turned around and dropped $2500 on them. It happened, I was there. So, what we want is honesty. Say to us, “I don’t want to spend my money on you.” And stop bitching about how you have no money. As adults we don’t NEED presents, but you act like you want to give us presents, but are just unfortunately stopped from doing so by the fact that you “have no money.” It clearly isn’t true if you can buy a whole other family Christmas. You asked why my siblings are upset, I explained. I am sorry it offends you.”\n\nHonestly, for my siblings I know it is about feeling neglected, they don’t need money, but can’t help but to hear, “I don’t love you,” when our mother starts bitching about giving us money. She did that to herself through years of not being home. There were whole weeks sometimes when we only knew she had been home because there was a stack of blank signed checks on the table. When she was with us she would just throw money at us.\n\nI’d be lying if I said for me the saltiness wasn’t at least a little about the money. I pawned my husband’s wedding ring today so I could pay rent *and* buy groceries. I did forget to mention mom did say I don’t have to pay for my half of the stove. \n\nWhat I really think I’m most mad about is the way she treated me when I asked her to split the cost of a stove with me, vs. how I know she responded when these relative strangers brought her a *prepared list* to their doctor’s appointment; I’m sure it wasn’t, “oh, boy, I want to, but I can only spend $50 this year.”\n\nWhen I told my bff the story she asked if my mom was taking lists from everybody.\n\ntl;dr: mom offered to help a needy family last year, this year they brought her a prepared list of stuff they wanted expecting her to do it again and it left a bad taste in my mouth, but maybe I’m just jelly?\n",

      "description": "Hi Reddit, \nI'm at a bit of a loss as to if this is justified by the other driver. Let me explain,I was driving along in the right-hand lane on x road towards a suburb and at 9:38PM Sunday 17th 2019. I overtook a white Nissan x-trail 2011 (travelling at 55kmph, I was travelling at 62kmph) , moved into the left lane after I was 30m ahead with my blinker on legally and prepared to turn left onto a road 500m ahead. Immediately, after I merged the driver (Male – middle aged) accelerated and began driving extremely close to my back and flashed on his high beams right into my car. I threw up my finger to attempt to get him to stop flashing his high beams and stop following me so closely. I then turned left on to y road after he followed me closely the entire 500m. He followed me onto this road extremely aggressively, his tires screeching as he tried to follow me as close as he could. I accelerated trying to get away from him. I then turned down another road and went down the road trying to escape this car. He followed me again and again accelerated extremely hard at my car. I was going about 80kmph at this point due to the fact I was afraid he was going to hit and damage my car and I attempted to slow down as we got closer to another road, but he refused to slow down. I was forced to swerve onto the right (wrong) side of the road at about 50kmph in order to prevent him from hitting me. He then rammed my car on the back-left side, shattering the left tail light and denting the back bumper badly. It also bent my exhaust. He then got in front and turned onto hull road. I attempted to follow. I followed him onto hull road, and he stopped his car. I pulled in front of his car stopped my car to get out. This was about 9:40PM. I got out of my car and he immediately revved his engine and then tried to run me over by accelerating hard at me. I ran behind my car attempting to avoid getting hit by him as he drove over exactly where I was standing. He then drove off as fast as he could and did not stay on the scene. I called the police at 9:42PM.\n I've never felt so targeted before, and I literally did nothing wrong to him other than the hand sign. I'm kind of at loss as to why he reacted so strongly and was wondering if I'm the asshole here.",

I even told them that I wouldn't drink anything, and that I could be the designated driver for my friends. They still said no.\n\nI asked if they would let my brothers go, and my father said yes!

      "description": " \n\nAITA for being resentful towards my wife for not wanting to have sex with me?\n\nOk so here is the deal. My wife and I have been married for 10 years this summer and in the last 2 years her libido has become almost nonexistent. To the point that we probably have sex once a month and I am extremely hurt and annoyed by this. I have tried a lot of things, and not just sexual things to get her going and nothing works. She has told me that she needs to connect with me in order to get in the mood and so we have had romantic wonderful dates, but when it comes to getting home and being intimate she doesn't want to. I have been patient and tried to be understanding but I need sex in my life.  \nLast time we talked I wrote down what she expected of me and it came down to:\n\nDon't watch porn,\n\nDon't masturbate,\n\nDon't fondle her,\n\nDon't pressure her about sex, just drop the subject.\n\nSo am I supposed to give up on sex altogether?\n\nI told her that as much as she needs to feel connected mentally to have sex, I also need to feel connected physically to feel romantic at all. Her continuous refusal has brought my self esteem to an all-time low and I have told her how much it hurts to be constantly rejected.  \n\n\nSo lately I've been distant. I don't kiss her other than a peck in the lips when she expects it or a small kiss when she asks for one. I've stopped all the romantic things I used to do for her and now that I also work nights she has to take care of the kids all the time like I used to do because she was stressed at work.\n\nWhen I feel like she wants something anywhere close to intimate I just don't act on it. This is possible because when I asked her \"why she never tried to seduce me?\" she said it was the man's job to seduce. When she wants sex all she has to do is a little extra kiss or a certain look and I'm usually up for it right on cue. But now I just ignore it. I don't even say I love you anymore because I feel mad and hurt.\n\nSo here I am wondering if distancing myself so much to make her feel my absence is an asshole move or if I'm right in feeling neglected.\n\nPS: I know she is not cheating, that's not the problem. We have such a tight schedule I would have notice by now and I'm afraid to say that I have also gone through her phone a couple of times because I am desperate for an answer",

      "description": "My (18F) mother (51F) and I were in a parking lot. She's had a bad fever recently and complains of aches in her body, so I'm often told to prepare a \"cupping treatment\" for her. For those not in the know, cupping treatment is an Asian treatment where cups are suctioned onto the person's body to relieve pain. However, I've done some research (not a lot, I know) and found studies that suggest that cupping treatment might be no better than a placebo. I decided to bring this up with my mom while in the car; it was parked, braked, and the engine was turned off.\n\nWell, she didn't react well to it. She started to yell at me about how I shouldn't be trusting a few studies over millions of people and thousands of years. She told me that I always focus on the negative parts of everything, and that I've been brainwashed by western culture. When I asked her why she was yelling, she told me that she did not feel well from her fever.\n\nThe drive home was very awkward and stressful. My mother pointed out how I'm poor at planning things and that I just don't care enough to succeed in life (which are both true statements), since the event that I drove for was poorly scheduled due to weather and a tight deadline. She has many valid points, but I felt hatred for her then and now I'm feeling awful about that hatred. I feel like I'm just conjuring these feelings to defend myself from having to improve.\n\nSo, Reddit; AITA?",

      "description": "I just want to start things off by saying that my relationship is long distance. Visits aren’t as frequent as we'd like, but they last a long time. I’m not sure if it’s information that should be taken into account, but it’s worth sharing.\n\nMy girlfriend is an artist. She’s done a lot of art of us and characters we’ve come up with (we’re furries). I figured I’d help make her process more efficient, as she was taking photos and coloring them in Paint at the time. Last May, I bought her a graphics tablet and had it shipped to her house. She was ecstatic to get it. She said she had to repay me, but I told her I wanted nothing in return. Giving gifts is great, and I like being generous.\n\nA few months later, she said she was planning on giving me one of her two GameCubes. My Wii’s disc drive stopped working in 2013, so I wasn’t able to play GameCube games anymore. I refused at first, but was happy to accept it later on. I asked her what models she had. She didn’t know. She was living in a house close to campus, and the other GameCube was at home. I was looking for a DOL-001, but I would have been perfectly fine with a DOL-101 model. They both play games, and that was just fine with me.\n\nI visited her in December, two days after Christmas. She gave me a box. I opened it up to find a model 101 GameCube. That was just fine with me. The thing is, there were no cables and no power source. It was just a system. She apologized and gave me a controller to make up for it. I said it was fine, and took the GameCube home after I left.\n\nAfter looking for cables and a power source online, I decided to ask a friend of mine, who has a collection of over a thousand games, where a good place to look would be, and if third party parts would be usable (I almost always prefer first party but it’s not always an option). He said third party cables would work fine, but a third party power supply could screw up the image. He didn’t know any other places, and recommended looking for another GameCube.\n\nA few weeks ago, I decided to start looking on eBay for GameCubes, specifically DOL-001 models. I told some friends at the house I live in for their thoughts, and they unanimously said that I was being ungrateful by looking for something someone already took their time to give to me. I tried countering back by telling them that looking for the parts by themselves would be too challenging, and that it’d be easier to get a new GameCube, the same advice my game collector friend told me. I asked my girlfriend about it, and she told me she understands and wouldn’t be offended at all. She also said it'd be nice to use the one she gave me as a backup, should my potential future GameCube fail. That was supposed to settle it, but I’m still being called ungrateful by my housemates, and it's starting to make me think that I might be making a moral mistake.\n\nSo, neutral minds of Reddit, I want to know. Would I be the asshole if I got myself a GameCube?",

      "description": "It's easiest to tell this story chronologically.  \n\nRougly 1 year ago: Backstory. I'm on a boozy river floating trip with a Meetup (group of adults that do things together sometimes regularly that can often include strangers). My friend Lindsey, at that time more an acquaintance than a friend, was there as well as a guy I had never met before, Jack. On this trip, I was incredibly blackout drunk, flirted recklessly with a ton of random people on the river, Lindsey was drunk, Jack was drunk, everyone was drunk. I do remember Jack trying to make out with me, and then me stopping him and saying I don't hook up with people in this Meetup because it'd make it weird to come back. \n\nAbout 5-6 months after that (I'm now pretty close friends with Lindsey), Jack asks Lindsey on a date. They go, she has a great time, and she texts me to tell me. She asks me if it's too needy to text him that night and say she had a fun time or not. I say, don't play games, if you had fun, be honest. She tells him. He responds something like \"Great, I'm glad! Me too!\" but then he never follows up to ask her on a second date. She tells me she's unhappy about it, and we don't talk much about it after that.   \n\nAbout a month after that, she hosts an event at her house. I'm there, and Jack, and a lot of our mutual meetup friends (a few who were close to Lindsey knew that she had a thing for Jack). We're all hanging out having a seemingly good time. After, she texts me that she was really upset about how the night went. She felt embarrassed by Jack, because our mutual friends had known she was into him and that he had asked her on a date, and throughout the night she felt he had ignored her the entire evening, and on top of that had felt that Jack was flirting with me in front of her. I honestly told her that I did not feel that way (did not notice him ignoring her or paying extra attention to me), that he had always struck me as a cocky player (like when he tried to make out with me even though I was blackout sloppy), and that if he wasn't into her, he's a clear idiot, because she's amazing and at that time she was one of my closest friends. She texts back a heartfelt thank you, I say a heartfelt no prob girl, and we don't really talk about Jack again. \n\n5-6 more months after that, we're all on an extended weekend trip together (again, with some new acquaintances but mostly a close-to-mildly-close mix of friends now). We're in a cabin in the woods doing lots of drugs. It's my first time doing anything harder than weed, so I'm kinda wired, and at this point in my life I'm also feeling painfully single. Due to the weird dynamics of the people we're on this trip with, I'm drunk and high and want to flirt really badly, and I decide Jack's the guy I'm gonna unleash all this weird energy on, because I knew that at some point he was into me so it should be easy and hopefully not weird. It doesn't really strike me to think about Lindsey's history with him, because there wasn't much of a history, and lots of time had passed. \n\nWe're all playing truth or dare, and Lindsey dares me to \"give a guy blue balls.\" I whisper in her ear that I'm gonna do it to Jack. She laughs back in response The game continues, but I never really get around to doing anything more PG than a footsie with Jack, so no blue balls were achieved (nor attempted).\n\nThe night winds down and we're all smoking weed on the porch under the stars. I get into some dumb argument with Lindsey and our closest mutual friend, so I go inside because I'm emotional (drugs?) and feel hurt. After maybe 10 or so minutes, Jack comes in to see if I'm alright. I invite him to cuddle on the couch with me. At some point it doesn't feel warm enough, so I go to our room to grab a comforter. My suitcase is all strewn out over my own bed, so in my sleepy state I take the comforter off Lindsey's bed (we were 4 girls in a 2 bed, but Lindsey and I were not sharing). I go back to the couch and am cuddled under the blanket with Jack. Everyone eventually comes back inside to go to bed. As Lindsey walks by, I tell her I took the comforter from her bed as a heads up, and does she want it back? She doesn't. She goes to bed, I fall asleep next to Jack on the couch.  \n\nThe next day, we split up and take different cars home. Over the car ride, it comes out over text that she is very mad at me. She feels I betrayed her as a friend by flirting so strongly with someone that had hurt her so deeply.  \n\nThis is where the two sides in the story really diverge.  \n\nShe claims that I knew how badly Jack had hurt her. She tells me that after the party at her house, she cried when Jack left, and I was with her in person and told her the \"You're a catch and he's an idiot\" pep talk to her crying on her bed in her room. She says I knew how badly he hurt her, and how could I do that in front of her? \n\nI tell her that I honestly didn't know he had hurt her so badly. I say I recall her being upset from the party, but it was over text, and I pull up the texts that show it. \n\nShe concedes maybe on the texts over the in-person crying situation, but still doesn't understand how I could be so insensitive to her when I'm the one always claiming that I'm so sensitive. She brings up my emotional overreaction to our dumb porch spat, says I always expect them to be so cautious around me, but why can't I be cautious around her? \n\nI say that if she had any issues with my behavior at any point, she should've just pulled me aside and told me. But instead, we played truth or dare, and she all but encouraged me to go ahead and flirt with Jack. She claims that she did not encourage me. I said \"You dared me to give him blue balls!\" She says she did not pick him, and that when I said I chose him, she nervously laughed because she thought I couldn't be serious, there was no way I'd be so bold and rude to her.  \n\nThis is what gets me - she says starts to feel like maybe I had a point, and maybe I didn't know the extent of how she felt about Jack. But then she says that she called a friend (not mutual) and explained both sides of the story, and the friend validated her. Said that any girl would know girl code means all guys from a girl's history are completely off limits. \n\nI'm confused. She had one date with him, well over half a year ago, and technically, didn't I have a history with him first when he made a move on me? \n\nShe starts bringing up a tally of things she's mad about that go beyond this. Her argument is now about me being a bad friend overall. For instance, she says that when we were on a pub crawl together, I ran away when one of our friends started throwing up and I called it disgusting.  \n\nI tell her my version of that story, but also, \"If you had a problem with that then, you should've brought it up then, because that was a year ago and our memories of it are completely different, so we can't even have a real discussion about it.\" \n\nThis goes on for awhile. We never really reach a resolution. We act like we're kinda okay with things, but she moves across the country a few months later, so we never really tried to fix this fight. We don't speak anymore. I lost a close, close friend from flirting with this guy. \n\nI'm just really curious ... AITA? ",

Anyway, her friends did make some jokes about her \"past\", which I passed off as jokes. For christmas we went back to her hometown, a small place where pretty much everyone knows eachother. \n\nWe met some of her high school friends, who made comments about me being a \"trade up\", and that she \"finally settled for *one* man\".or something of that nature. I pushed her about this, and she broke down saying that when she was in high school, she had some personal issues, and dealt with them by using sex, since she's always been really straight edge.0 It's a small town, so it's not super many guys, but still a fair bit proportionally\n\nI am furious with her, I don't trust her and I feel like I'm not even that special for her anymore sexually.

      "description": "Hello. Before I start, this did not happen to me. This happened to my friend (we'll call her Blue) and since she does not have a Reddit account I'm posting this to get a second opinion. \nA few things to note:\n\n-Purple and Blue are both in the grade under me. \n-We do not go to the same school. I met them through the drama company we're in. \n-There were more people involved in this but if I mentioned them too this post would be far too long. \n\nJust to clarify, I got her permission to post. So without further ado, let's start from the beginning. \n\nSo Blue, this friend (we'll call her Purple), my sister and I were having a conversation in a group chat about what we wanted to major in in college. The conversation then switched to what school we planned to go to. Purple said she wanted to go to a school in New York to \"escape the crappy town we live in\". I told her that we don't live in a crappy town, and she should be happy that we live here and not in the Middle East or some place like that. Blue backed me up and said that her reason for wanting to move so far didn't make much sense. Purple then got mad and told us to stfu. Then in a private chat between Blue and Purple (Blue sent me screenshots afterwards) Purple insulted the schools that Blue wanted to go through, and insulted the fact that she wasn't in advanced classes and said she was \"probably failing\" (Even though Blue actually has straight As) \n\nThe next day at school, Blue told me that Purple had been avoiding her the entire day, and she had turned one of their other friends against her. Blue also told me that Purple had been pulling some of her friends away from her and making them walk her to class. In addition, Purple also walked on the grass to avoid Blue and her friend. \n\nPurple has a tendency to say that she has social anxiety and depression. Blue told me that she's never seen or heard of proof of a medical diagnosis of these disorders, or even of any symptoms of them. She told me that Purple is an extrovert and loves talking to people, and she speculates that Purple is faking these medical disorders for attention. \n\nSo who's in the wrong here? Let me know in the comments if you need any more information on this matter and I'll edit it and add the information. Thank you for reading and stay safe everyone. ",

      "description": "Throwaway, this happened earlier today, and I felt like this sub could help me out\n\n**Background**\n\nI [21M] tarted seeing my current gf [20F] casually in the fall of 2017. Things got pretty involved within three months and we started exclusively dating 9 months ago. She’s gorgeous, wild, hilarious, sweet, and more than I could have ever hoped for\n\nWe’re both pretty laid back and just want the best for each other, and our relationship has done nothing but improve. We’ve both said we never see ourselves breaking up, and love each other so much. I still feel like we’re in the honeymoon phase well over a year later, she’s my best friend and the most incredible person I know\n\nWe’ve never fought, but a few times one of us has fucked up or upset the other and we always just talk it out, work on it, and resolve any issue without fighting. No bickering or petty disagreements\n\n**What happened**\n\nSo today we were talking and she casually mentions that next weekend she’ll be going to formal with a friend at a fraternity we’re both very close with. I’m unaffiliated so I couldn’t ask even if I wanted to. I just want her to be happy and have fun with friends (though I don’t know her date this semestre). I know she would never cheat on me or do anything like that to hurt me, so this didn’t come from a place of jealousy or trying to be controlling. However, it did upset me for a few reasons\n\n1. She agreed to go without even talking to me—same for her date not asking me if it was chill. Like I said I’m totally fine with her going, but it hurt that she didn’t think to ask me how I felt about it considering I can’t take her\n2. I’d love to get out of town for a weekend with her, but I’m really busy with classes and not working, so I can’t afford to blow several hundred dollars to take her somewhere nice for the weekend. I try to do everything I can to make her as happy as I can, and it made me feel kinda shitty that I can’t do something like that for her\n3. We are both super busy with classes and usually can’t find the time to do something nice like this together, but it makes me sad that we finally had a weekend to get out of town and do something special but she’s spending it to go to an event I can’t join\n\nSo I decided to talk to her about it and basically told her what I just told you, as gently as possible. I started tearing up because it’s so hard for me to tell her that something she did upset me when she’s so amasing that I hate to bring it up. She started crying pretty hard and held me and told me she was so sorry and said she didn’t have to go. I kissed her and said it was totally cool with me to go, I just felt upset. I assured her it was okay and told her how much I love her and we just cuddled for a few hours\n\nI really hate bringing up stuff that’s minor and inconsequential, like I said we never bicker over little things that don’t matter. But I can’t help but feel like maybe I was being a petty asshole and making too big a deal out of this\n\nAITA?",

I want to split rent/costs 50/50 but she wants it to be 85/15.\n\nI make around 200k/yr and my girlfriend makes around 32k/yr, which I realize is a big difference. But I have around 250k in student debt and GF doesn't have loans. I have around 10k/month after taxes but I would ideally pay off my loans as fast as possible, so I think paying 7.5k and living off 2.5k is doable. I don't mind living on a smaller income because that's what I've always done until now. GF has about 2k/month of after-tax income. The problem is we disagree on what price range of rentals we should be looking at and how to split the rent.\n\nI was interested in an arrangement where we rent a 2-bedroom with my old roommate for around 1800/month combined (GF and I would share a room and our roommate would pay for her room) so that GF and I would pay 900/each. I thought this is reasonable since 900/month should be doable for her but when I floated this idea she really pushed back hard and said since I'm making a decent salary we should get a better place and split costs proportionally. She looked something up which was a studio at 2500/month and told me we should pay $2100/$400 to reflect our income disparity. I don't mind paying a little more than her, but this kinda cut into my ideal plan of paying off loans fast so I'm torn.\n\nI don't want this to turn into a fight, but her idea is so far off from mine that I don't know how to bridge this gap. Am I being unreasonable?\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend wants to split proportionally but I want to split down the middle, although there is a significant income disparity.",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nMy husband and I are friends on social media. Usually he shares funny memes about anything and everything. Lately he’s been posting about how much he misses having sex before marriage killed his sex life. He shares posts all the time about nobody giving good head anymore. He shares stories that say things like “I wish I remembered what sex feels like, been too long.” And I put up with it for a long time. But I have never been comfortable with it. I toyed around with the idea of telling him to take all of it down, but was scared to overstep. \n\nWell one night after I was dealing with some serious depression and my sex drive was all but evaporated, my husband asked me if I would at least try to do it and see if I enjoy it or if I would just help him get off. I told him that I wasn’t in the mood for anything sexual at all. 20 minutes later, he posted on social media “Turned down again. Ugh. Don’t get married kiddos.” And it hurt my feelings so bad that I started crying because he was once again telling the whole world our personal life. So I told him to take all of it down. And he flipped out on me. He said that he had the right to vent about his frustrations and it’s not like it’s hurting anything and that I can’t tell him what to do with his social media and that it was rude of me to even try to tell him what to do with his own pages. So now I feel disrespected and guilty. He thinks I’m overreacting but I don’t see it that way. \n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for telling him to take those posts down and to stop posting things about our personal life and marriage behind closed doors, since they’re not my social media profiles?",

      "description": "So let's get it straight, I am not. I'm bisexual but my bestfriend isn't. He is straight with little to no fragile masculinity. To be honest, we haven't known each other for a while, he's been my classmate for 5 months but he has been the most wholesome friend I have ever known. Of course, its hard not to fall in love with him, especially with his humor and intelligence. \n\nWhen I was trying to move on with my boyfriend, our chats casually transformed from words of encouragement to flirts. He made it easier for me to move on. Although you can still see that he is maintaining a barrier between us, like he doesn't flirt back when I flirt but still calls me baby and stuff.\n\nI know he isn't serious with his flirting, like he was only messing around. But even so, I wanted to take it to another level. As a joke, I invited him to be friends with benefits with me, to have sex with me, but I meant it deep inside. He agreed immediately, saying he doesn't want to be a virgin anymore, and that sex would be the perfect stress reliever from academics. He was even more excited that me. Sexting, video calling, buying condoms, and he even scheduled a hotel for us to do it.\n\nSo we hit it off, it was the happiest day of my life. The way he talks, he chats, his eyes, his kisses, I just THOUGHT he was mine, that he was in love with me. I was so happy that I told half of my friends about it, and I know I shouldn't have done that especially for something so private, but I was just so happy that no amount of common sense made me do the most reasonable thing to do. \n\nAfter a week, he blocked me on facebook and twitter. It's been 3 months now and he still hasn't messaged me back. I've said sorry in real life and he still won't start talking to me. I just miss my bestfriend and I miss talking to him.\n\nSo he was angry at me for inviting him to have sex even if he was more excited to do it. AITA? \n\n(Please excuse my English, I am not a native speaker of the language.)\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend is a big guy, not fat, but tall and athletic. He eats a lot. I joke that he has a tapeworm. When he's at my place, he goes to town on my food. I honestly have no problem feeding him, or any other guests in my house. I'd be more than happy to whip up a meal, but my boyfriend is a grazer and eats all of my snacks. A thing of Oreos lasts me a month and he will eat all of them in one sitting. Same with cereal, Pop Tarts, cheese, chips, a jar of PB, etc. I don't eat junk food very often so these things last me awhile. I am on a very tight budget, so I can't go out and replace everything he gorges himself on and it irritates that I can't indulge in any treats for a month because he can't control himself. \n\nI have raised this issue with him several times and he just... doesn't get it. He says I'm welcome to anything when I'm at his place, but I don't have a third of the appetite he does so even if I did help myself to my heart's content, it wouldn't have even close to the same impact as him decimating my kitchen. Plus, he makes more money than I do. I've tried to explain this to him but he really didn't get the scope of the issue, so I started to track everything he ate while at my house. I made a spreadsheet that encompassed a single month to demonstrate how much he was eating and how much it was costing me. \n\nMy monthly food budget is $150, he was eating over a third of it at $54. I presented this to him and he seemed really confused? He said he'd give me the $54, NBD. But I don't want money, I want him to not go to town on my food. We kind of got into an argument about it and he called me a weird for making a spreadsheet and said it was passive aggressive. I disagree. Again, I've spoken to him several times and he didn't get it; so I decided to show him with evidence. He's acting weird and says he just won't come over anymore, which wasn't my intention. So AITA?",

      "description": "Before we start I realize there is a lot of posts regarding this topic, and in most situations the results lean towards the side of don’t assume people will trade seats with you on airplanes.\n\nFirst flight out of two flights for the day, so it’s a shorter hour long connecting flight on a very small plane. There is a single seat on the left side of the plane and two seats on the right side of the plane. \n\nFlying with American Airlines which does not allow you to select seats even at the time of check-in, only the option to purchase a seat change after they automatically assign you seats. These prices are about $45 USD each to switch. I purchased the plane tickets together and have both myself and my girlfriend listed as the passenger and it auto assigned us in the same row but not next to each other.  Now typically I wouldn’t mind, neither of us are afraid of flying or get sick or anything like that. But we had just downloaded a movie to my phone and wanted to watch the movie on the flight. \n\nI considered the option of paying the extra amount to ensure we’d be next to each other but I figured that if I asked the person sitting in the window seat on the side with two seats to switch to the left side which was also a window seat and they wouldn’t have anyone sitting next to them it would be like an upgrade or equal trade for them and they wouldn’t mind.  \n\nBoarding the flight directly in front of us was another couple in the exact same situation as us, they asked the female in the row with two seats if she minded trading so they could sit together and without hesitation she moved over to the side with one seat. Having seen this made me feel confident I wouldn’t have any issues with my request, especially considering the female in the seat I wanted to ask to trade had just witnessed the situation in the row in front of us. So I asked this female if she would also like to trade with myself and my girlfriend so we could sit together and she just said no. I explained that it was the same row and also a window seat and again she said no. A person from behind her asked clarification if it was just because I wanted a window seat to which I replied to them and said no it was that I wanted to sit with my girlfriend so we can watch a movie together on my phone. The female sitting in my row still refused to move, I sat next to her for the entire hour long flight, more bitter about the situation than I should have been. Neither of us said anything to one another. \n\nI realize this is not a big deal at all, but AITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone.\n\nMy boyfriend broke up with me and told me its because I'm a horrible person for not accepting him. He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this. \n\nTo keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.\n\nHe started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400€ (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.\n\nAround our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).\n\nOur relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.\n\nHe wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.\n\nHe accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me. He's been guilt-tripping me on social media and amonst our friends ever since and has made me feel horrible bc of this. The first few months afterwards I was honestly really freaking broken up about it and it's only been recently that I've been getting angry instead.\n\n## ",

      "description": "My friends and I, 8 of us in total, wanted to go on holiday together in January. We began organising it in October and by November we had booked 4 nights stay in an airbnb costing ~£150 each. I paid for this initially and have asked my friends to pay me back. However, one of my friends now (a month after we booked) has said that they cant afford to come, accommodation + flights + living costs would be too much for them. \n\nI think that's completely fair but asked them to still pay me for their share of the airbnb since otherwise I end up paying for it. I also said if they found a 7 man airbnb for us to stay in that everyone was happy with, we could cancel the 8 man and stay there instead.\n\nThey're upset with me and are saying we should either cover the cost of them not coming or find another place ourselves but I think thats unreasonable.\n\nAm I being selfish by expecting them to either pay for themselves or find us an alternative?",

I could honestly reasonably give 2 thousand..But the crux of it is I don’t want to ? \n\nWhy should I have to donate money to some one who could have just gotten the vaccine and saved herself the trouble..The thing is if he had the vaccine and ended  up contracting it. I would have no problem giving her the money. She decided not to vaccinate knowing that she could never reasonable afford the bill. Why should our family have to pay when she made a bad choice?  \n\nAlso I’ve done a lot for her in the sense of prepping meals and cleaning her house and caring for her dogs.

      "description": "TLDR at bottom but maybe the details are important.\n\nSo for context me and this buddy of mine have been friends since middle school and we are 20 now so we have known each other for quite a while. He is a pretty smart dude in certain areas but almost every person has expertise in certain areas. \n\nHe always ever since I met him thought pretty highly of his intelligence but in the past two months, every time we hang out he has been boasting about his \"intelligence\" for probably 10 percent of the time. So if we hang out for 2 hours he probably spends 10-15 minutes talking about how smart he is.\n\nHe often goes on tangents about \"how he doesn't see the world like the rest of the people, he sees potential in everything and it's like the world is feeding him information and he absorbs it and understands everything\" and how when he talks \"everything is lined up like a machine gun clip with precision and accurate articulation.\"\n\nHe is also very determined that he is going to invent some sort of high tech weapon that has never been made before and he thinks he has the key to building it. While I think it would be cool I think he grossly underestimates the complexity of what he is trying to make.\n\nHe has also told me without ever taking an IQ test that he thinks his IQ is around 140-160 which is 1 in 400 people. And the average American has a 98 IQ. I'd say he is maybe 110 maybe 120 tops because I know a good handful of people smarter than him. He is super arrogant about his intelligence \n\nBut then fast forward we are at my house playing Xbox and we were just roasting each other like all good friends do and he says to me as I'm a decently big guy (230lb 5,11) \"damn man, you got bigger boobs than most of the girls we graduated with\" and I said back a roast I saw from a r/roastme thread that stated \"if I ever wanted to kill myself I'd jump from your ego to your IQ\" and he got genuinely butthurt on how I insulted his \"genius mind\" and that \"I would never understand how smart he is\". And I said back \"your 20 working at a mall, haven't done anything yet to prove your smarter than 140 IQ and I frankly think you over estimate your IQ, your probably not as smart as you think you are buddy, I know intelligence is more than just an IQ but I highly doubt you have an IQ of 140-160\"\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR; friend often thinks of his intelligence and IQ superior than 99.75 percent of people (yes he thinks he is that smart) with no ever actual IQ test, the average in America is 98. While he thinks he is somewhere in the 140-160 range. I told him in a friendly roast session that I could jump from his ego to his IQ if I ever wanted to kill my self, he got offended and I told him he probably isn't as smart as he thinks he is because he just brags about his \"intelligence\" all the time",

She says he's a man whore but her best friend. All this concerns me cuz I don't know if a guy would touch her and if she'd allow it or not say anything cuz she doesn't think it's bad or would just be to afraid to speak up cuz of past experiences and I'm not there to speak up for her.

I'm not a talkative or energetic person, and even though I love going out when we can I equally enjoy spending time together, sitting together, watching stuff and all of that.

In the 8th grade he would always put me down and make DEAF jokes about my parents since they are deaf. I was fine with it at the time but for a while I’ve been contemplating the seriousness of the things he’s been saying. He always compares my traumatic experiences to something much smaller and insignificant and saying something along the lines of “My experience is real trauma”\n\nHe is nice to me but I notice he ignores me a lot when ever I try and make him laugh these days and I’ve been nothing but respectful to him. Today I brought it up the problem with him, saying I’m not okay with him making jokes about my parents and constantly comparing himself to me, and he reacted negatively. He said that he was “a changed person” for the better.\n\n(I’ve confronted him about being a jerk two years before this incident and no he hasn’t changed) \n\nA side note: Some of the things he’s said...I have never let go of. One time he told me “I would pick my girlfriend over you, dude” and he had known me for four years and started dating his girlfriend one month before he said that. \n\nHis girlfriend is a dick, and is in 9th grade which is one grade below me and meanf’s grade.\nShe doesn’t understand anything. She cries over someone not bringing her a change of clothes (in the bathroom stall with friends comforting her like it’s a huge deal) and I’m tired of their shit.\n\nAm I the asshole for giving up on the friendship?\n",

      "description": "As the title suggests. I know it’s a very small problem compared to the rest here, however, I feel like it is causing me some conflict which I need another viewpoint in. \nAfter coming in from work, I immediately rest myself onto my bed due to it being such a tiring job. Suddenly I’m immediately surprised by this shit, nose staining odor coming from the right side of my full-sized bed (I was laying on the left side as the charger’s outlet rests there) it was a small but significantly potent piece of shit with a ring of its liquids surrounding its outermost border. No dripping of liquid perforated the bed lining, but it still pissed me off because I’m fucking busy. I usually keep the door closed to my room when I’m not home, but I forgot to shut it before leaving that day (or this day). She usually sleeps with me on my bed every day and I don’t mind at all. Some days I don’t want her to sleep in my room for alternating reasons, but I always give up onto her as she chews the end of the closed door and rattles it with her claws. 1) I don’t want her to hurt herself. She already lost one of her claws due to this behavior before. \n2) on the other hand, I want to use this as a lesson for her.\n3) I also want to seek other contaminated areas around my bedroom area to dispose of unperceived  crap. \n4) buuuuuuut i also don’t want to here her shrieks at 3 am.

      "description": "My office has two light switches and has about 30 LED light panels stretching across the office, when you flip one switch half the lights go on, but they are all staggered so the whole office gets light, just not BRIGHT light. When you flip both switches its BRIGHT and slightly annoying to me. Also the walls have huge windows on them so ample natural lighting also.\n\nAnyways, I usually go into the office early in the mornings about 15 minutes early. I usually just flip one set of lights because its too damn early for a BRIGHT office. Ill get my coffee, make some breakfast and get ready to start work. My coworker usually comes in 15 minutes later and flips the second switch. Then its just BRIGHT and I just get slightly annoyed but w/e I deal. \n\nSo this has been going on for probably a year now and I guess I never realized how much it upset my coworker that she had to turn on the extra switch everyday. \n\nToday she had it, I was getting coffee ready and she comes in has a huge *sigh* turns on the second light and says \"Sorry to rain on your parade but I'm turning the second switch on, like I have to do everyday, because you refuse to just turn both lights on!\"\n \nAt first I thought she was being sarcastic, but as she walked closer to me I could see she was genuinely upset. Should I apologize?\nIs she over reacting or AITA?\n\nAlso besides today, I have a pretty good relationship with this coworker, which is also why I'm so thrown for a loop.",

      "description": "Update: thanks for all of the insights and support. I really needed to not feel fucking crazy for making such a big deal out of this that our marriage is in question. I am happy to say since our last fight the night I posted this, my husband not only has not driven impaired, but he has cut back on smoking as a whole. We also scheduled therapy appointments, but our local health care is so fucked we were put on a 3 month wait list. Also thank you for keeping me in check and pointing out the flaws in my logic as well. You provided a nice balance of perspective. \n\nDisclaimer: I love my husband a lot and really hope to spend the rest of my life with him, and I am very confused on if I should really care about this so much.\n\nMy husband and I both have smoked weed recreationally before we ever met, however he is considered the bigger stoner of the two of us. I have struggled with him NEEDING to smoke weed every second he possibly can, to the point where he won’t make plans with friends or family because he’d rather stay home, or he will whine and want to leave ASAP. \n\nI have told him that I don’t want to change him, but at the very least he is not allowed to smoke before he drive since this is a safety concern for himself and everyone he drives past. He has started a cycle of making excuses, telling me I can’t control him and shouldn’t ask him to stop doing things that bring him joy (smoking weed), and trying to convince me that he’s not high enough to be a danger, and then giving up and promising to stop and agreeing with me to get me to stop nagging him to stop. \n\nToday my sister told me that the same day he promised to stop smoking and driving, he came home on his lunch break and smoked and asked her to lie for him and hide it from me. This isn’t the first time I’ve caught him hiding it from me. \n\nI confronted him about that and told him it was unacceptable for him to lie to me and I don’t want to be with someone who is so disrespectful (which struck a nerve because his mom divorced his dad over him lying about weed). He yelled and complained and started the cycle again and the went to bed angry with me. \n\nI am hurt because I also smoke and don’t want to be a hypocrite or controlling of his actions. I am caught in this back and forth of not knowing if I’m that nagging wife that can’t allow my husband his vices, or if he is gaslighting me and i should see this as a red flag? ",

      "description": "So Xmas 2018 my SO and I are going to my parents house for a few days (they live out of state) and I made sure we are both staying in the guestroom... \n\nJust quick my parents are pretty old fashioned and when I was with my ex for 7yrs we were not allowed to stay together because we weren't married, so with my current SO I called to say if we werent staying in the same room we would get a hotel room because I'm 36 &amp; hes 39. My mother assured me we can, she then went on to say she actually liked my current SO, so no problem. I made this call 2 weeks before Xmas.\n\nCut to the Sunday before xmas and my sister texts me a picture and I notice its in my parents garage and I freak out with joy! She lives far away and rarely gets to visit so I'm supe'd shes in town for the holiday! Then I think, huh, I bet I know where they're staying and call my mom. She informs me that they are staying at the house of course, to which I reply \"cool, which room?\" Knowing full well my mom will say the guestroom. She does and I then ask, what room WE are staying in. Without missing a beat she say, \"well you can stay in your old room and SO can stay in your sisters old room.\" Uh no. Super uncomfortable rock hard twin beds in separate rooms is not how I envisioned my Christmas. Now,  this is usally what happens when my younger sister shows up, I get relagated \"to the back\", my parents always assume Im fine with whatever, most times I'm good, but this time it wasnt ok. I try to calmly explain to my mother that she could have told my sister that SHE &amp; her husband could sleep in the other rooms and she seemed taken aback by that and honestly surprised I even said that. I explain about my SOs bad back and how they can afford a hotel because they make way more than us. I really tried not to get upset, but its been years of taking the backseat to my sister. Hung up the phone and full on cried out of frustration and general wtf-ness. I then emailed my mother explaining why I was upset the most adult way I could with conviction. No reply. \n\nMy SO and I head down to my parents the next day, and stop by a few friends on the way so by the time I get there they are all down the street at a party we are also heading to. I go upstairs take one matress off a bed and bring it into the other bedroom. We are at the least sleeping in same room. Go to the party, have a great time, get drunk, eventually pass out and wake up Xmas morning. We have a great day and when night falls my SO and I pack up to head home.\n\nMy parents are confused and upset that we are leaving, but I calmly explain im not sleeping on the floor again and that I emailed them stating I would be leaving. \n\nThe next few times I talked to my mom she still asked why we didnt stay, as if it was some big friggin mystery.

      "description": "So last night my friend (18F) went out clubbing in the city with another friend (19F) of ours. Originally I (19F) was going to go with them but decided I needed a night in because I had been drinking a lot already this week and was feeling under the weather. Still, I told them both to come over to my place to pre-drink before they left, as per our original plan. Right after I got home from work that evening, I picked up my 18F friend from her house, which was about a 5 minute drive from mine, so she could have more time to spend pre-drinking. Our other friend met us at my house. I was happy to have them over so I could still spend some time with them and it was convenient for them because I live very close to a stop for the bus they'd need to catch in. However, early in the night I offered to drive them to the club instead. This would shave about 25 minutes and a lot of walking off of their trip. They were trying to get to the club before a certain time for free entry so I was glad I could help them out. While they were at my place we had a nice time, chatting and catching up while they drank wine. My 18F friend used my makeup to touch up what she'd done before I picked her up. When they'd finished the bottle of wine she brought, she went raiding my kitchen for more alcohol despite me telling her that I don't usually keep alcohol in the house, though I wished I did have some to offer her. Eventually it was time to go, so I dropped them in then came back to my house and watched a movie before going to sleep.\n\nThis morning I was woken by a phone call from my 18F friend. I asked her what was up and she told me to check my texts. I saw that she had sent me one a few minutes earlier asking me to pick her up from the city, where she must have stayed last night. She told me how she was too tired to walk to and from the train station to get herself home and that ubers were too expensive and offered to buy me lunch to make up for it. I considered it, then told her I was sorry but I didnt feel like coming to get her and I was going to go back to sleep.\n\nI have no problem with her asking, it just seemed like she had an expectation that I would say yes, which she might not have had if I hadn't hosted her and driven her around so much last night. Also, if I wasnt answering my texts I wish she wouldve figured out that I was probably asleep and not called me to wake me up, especially when the reason I didnt go out last night was to look after my health. However, I felt really rude and guilty saying no when she needed me, especially because it's the sort of favour that she would've done for me, it's just that I would never ask her to. So AITA for leaving a friend to make her own way home after a night out?",

      "description": "Ok, here we go \n\nI have this friend, let’s call her Meghan. She’s single and has been for some time.\n\nShe has a co-worker, let’s call him Glen, who she started liking a bit a couple of months ago. But she did not want anything going on with him, because of several reasons - one of them being, that he has a girlfriend. \n\nTurns out he was also keen on Meghan, and then it started. They flirted very much, to the point where other co-workers began noticing, and she kept telling me, that she was so tired of people talking, and they should mind their own business. Nothing was gonna happen between then, while he had a girlfriend. She was very set on that. \n\nBut the inevitable happened one night, while they were out with their co-workers - they kissed. Meghan felt very bad about this, because of the girlfriend and she did not want this happening again. But still she kept seeking him out and they went out together a couple more times (still while other people was present). \n\nI’ve always been the kind of friend, who says “you do you” and I’ve never been judgemental any of my friends, when they have made a questionable choice. Because I mean - who hasn’t? \n\nSo I told her, if she liked him, she should stop feeling guilty about it, because she did not know the girl he was with anyway. And I meant that. But at the same time, I told her to tell him, that she did not want to be with him, as long as the girlfriend was in the picture. Meghan did not want to do this, as she did not want him to break it off with his girlfriend because of her. \n\nThis went on for a while. Them going out with friends, ending up flirting, kissing, etc., her saying that it should never happen again, since he wasn’t single, repeat. \n\nI asked her a couple of times, what she wanted this end with, and she didn’t know if she wanted to be with him, and each time we talked about it, she would say that it should never happen again. I told her, that she should stop saying that and just accept that she couldn’t keep her hands off, and stop thinking about the girlfriend. \n\nOne morning, she got a text from Glen saying that he broke up with his girlfriend. In my mind, she should be happy, because now they could be together without anyone in the way. But instead she felt very bad and guilty and she was afraid she had caused the break up - which I told her, that of course she did. That same evening, he got back together with his girlfriend and Meghan was happy about that. I told her that I thought he was a douchebag and that he was trying to have them both. \n\nAnd yes, you guessed it, he has succeeded. Because not only is he still with his girlfriend, Meghan and Glen keeps doing the exact same thing as before. \n\nNow, I am left with this feeling of some sort of anger with Meghan, I don’t know how to explain it. Not because I think he is one of the least stand-up guys I’ve heard of in a long time, but because I have this feeling that she actually likes that he has a girlfriend. Why else would she be happy, when he decided to give it another try with her? And why would she keep being with him after that?\n\nI can’t help but feel some kind of strain on out friendship now, because it annoys me, that she is “the other woman” right now and seems to like that. Maybe it’s because I have a boyfriend of my own, I feel like this. I don’t know. \n\nBut there you go. So now I need to know: AITA for being annoyed with her for being “the other woman” and liking it? \n\nTLDR; My friend is dating a guy, who has a girlfriend and I am annoyed with her, because I think that’s the reason she is with him.

      "description": "I've been engaged to my fiance for about two months, and before that we dated for six months, so we've been together a total of eight months. Throughout that entire time, she has never been comfortable with my relationship with my female best friend who i have known since high school.\n\nMy friend is someone very special, and very close to me. She is smart, caring, beautiful, and an extremely loving and funny person. She honestly does mean the world to me and since freshman year in highschool she has been the one who has been with me through so many events in my life, including my moms passing.\n\nMy fiance has been in my life for eight months, and can't understand the bond that I have with my best friend. She has openly told me that it makes her uncomfortable how I spend time with her. I usually try to change the subject but now that we're engaged shes become a lot more hostile to both me and my best friend.\n\nWhat really pissed me off is that she almost drove my best friend to tears recently over dinner, basically indirectly criticizing her for always hanging around someone elses man instead of finding her own.\n\nI confronted my fiance in private and she just asked me to not invite her to the wedding. I put my foot down and said that I love her, and that the type of relationship i have with her comes once in a lifetime. I may have also crossed the line in the heat of the moment by calling my best friend my soul mate, as i was just trying to articulate how much i love her as it does goes beyond just being a best friend.\n\nMy fiance basically breaks down crying, (she does this a lot to get her way) and says that i must hate her. I say I hate the way you're acting. She then asks what my friend has that she doesn't, and I decide not to engage any further.\n\nLater I tell her the truth of the matter is that I love them both, and I just want everyone to get a long. She says im being emotionally abusive for telling her that I love another woman.\n\nAITA For telling my fiance that I love my female friend, or is she just being unreasonably jealous?",

      "description": "First, I'm on mobile. Sorry.\n\nI am a freshman (9th grade) in high school. I have 7 teachers, 6 of whom I don't mind, they teach well enough, and they give manageable amounts of homework. The other one, well, we'll call her Mrs. D. (different name)\n\nIn my state, school is divided in to 4 quarters, 9 weeks each. Last week was the 8th week. I had an 83 in her subject, Biology. It is worth mentioning that I am a GOOD student and had never made any grade below a 96 in science. In this story, grades are due 9th week, day 4.\n\n8th week, day 3: Mrs. D adds in a 112 out of 14 for an assignment, which equals out to an EIGHT HUNDRED PERCENT. It was obviously accidental.\n\n8th week, days 4 and 5: Fully expecting her to fix it, I think nothing of it. Mrs. D does not change the grade.\n\n9th week, day 1: I consider telling Mrs. D, but don't. \n\n9th week, day 2: I tell my 8th grade friend (at a different school) what happened. He says I should tell Mrs. D what happened. I do not.\n\n9th week, day 3: I get sick and could not go to school.\n\n9th week, day 4: (still sick enough to be out) I get on my computer. The 3rd quarter grade has been FINALISED as a 98.\n\n9th week, day 5: I go to school, and there is a 98 on my report card. oof.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the school admins could change the grade. AITA for not telling her?\n\nTL;DR: Teacher put a grade in as a mistake, didn't check her grades before finalising them, and I got a final grade 15 points above what I was supposed to.",

      "description": "I (25M) have been friends with Alyssa (24F) for over 12 years. We've been best friends since middle school and is the person I care most about. This past year she moved to the UK to travel and spent a year working over seas. Our friendship remained really strong and we eventually realized we had some feelings for each other. We talked about getting together and even planned how we'd make it work. I was going to move over there since I still had contacts from my year working there.\n\nShe disappeared for a month before visiting family for a wedding where I was her date. She arrived and called me immediately to meet up for some drinks and catch up. There I decided to ask her out and have us actually start giving it a try. That's when she revealed that she had met someone serious during that time she disappeared. I would normally stop pushing but I figured I'd still give it a shot and asked if her if they were official. if they weren't I'd still would love to take her out. She ghosted me for months. I tried to get in contact and when I finally did she shut me out completely.\n\nShe came back into my life and apologized and insisted that we can still continue to be friends. We had a deep conversation and explained our own sides of the whole incident. I thought we could remain friends. She would eventually be back and we can be friends again. \n\nToday she revealed that she has no intentions of returning back and is going to stay in the UK with her new boyfriend for at least a couple more years. I asked her where I fit into this new plan and she said ideally that I'd move over there and we can explore together like we had talked about before. I said things are different now. She says that she needs me in her life. But her making time for me is during her lunch breaks which are during my nights off. That time I could be investing in other people, being active, and going out on dates.\n\nWe decided to take a break and see if feelings changed. It didn't. I feel selfish. I don't want to manipulate her into returning or be a \"nice guy\" who is ends a friendship because she chose not to date me. I'm just aware that I've lost a lot of friends due to distance. I lost all my friends from the year I lived in London, many other friends from uni because of distance. The friendships that have remained are those I see at least once every couple of months and we text/call often. I've lost relationships due to distance because there was no end date in sight, there was no plan and so anytime I see those same signs I know that in the long run I'll be driving myself insane. As much as I hate not having her be consistently in my life, I feel that it'll be harder having her sporadically appear only through calls or facetiming because I will be comparing everyone to her (which is what we used to do and is what led to us talking about getting together).\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to end years of friendship because of the distance?",

We both are in our 20’s and we live together. \n\nWhat sparked the argument was me trying initiate a intimacy night with her. She said to me she wasn’t feeling well and I respected her choice. I decided to get some sleep and just lay on my side of the bed, she knew something was getting to me because I usually hold her when I sleep.\n\nI told her that I wanted to have some alone time with her because it’s been a day we both are free and able to fully enjoy each other’s company. She has a Gall bladder issue and is soon to get it removes due to it causing her not to feel well and she reminds me she doesn’t feel good. Sometimes it doesn’t affect her at all and when I do try to initiate when she’s not feeling like crap, she turns me down and I’ll just accept that and move on and hope for another time however being turned down over and over just takes a toll on me. \n\nShe asked me about my feelings and I just tell her what was on my mind. yesterday I took her out to have fun together because we rarely do, due to our work schedules and time. She works 12 hour shifts 3-4 times a week and I work a regular 40 hour work week, sometimes working on the weekends. She tells me that the only reason I took her out that day was to get “something/sex” in return and this is what I told her. \n\nI told her that I took her out that day because we rarely spend time together due to work, you deserved to be treated out because you work hard, I do things for you because I care and love you and I don’t expect nothing in return like making you breakfast every morning because I love you and I want you to come home to a meal and not starve when you just worked a 12 hour shift. I clean the house because I know you are tired working. I do all the chores around the house because I know you don’t feel good, I do small tasks for you like getting you a drink from downstairs or Microwaving popcorn so you can watch your tv shows because you mean the world to me and I will do anything for you. I don’t do things to get “something” in return, I do things because you mean something to me.  \n\nI then proceeded to tell her how I don’t feel cared about, I told her, you don’t say I love you to me unless I say it first, you don’t text me how my day is unless I text you first, you don’t initiate sex unless I do, you don’t do small tasks for me when I ask for it, i.e grabbing a soda from downstairs for me. You don’t take me out or treat me in anyways like I feel cared about unless it’s a holiday. \n\nAfter I told her all that, she just said she was sorry and I just left for work and now I feel like an asshole for telling her how I feel.\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons, yknow. \n\n\n\nSo I work at a chain restaurant that specializes in fried chicken from Kentucky. Store’s not in Kentucky but nearby, still in the backwoods. \n\n\nA guy came through the drive thru one day while I was on shift, and orders some bbq chicken. The manager that’s working the drive thru takes his order and immediately comes back to the grill and kitchen area. He tells me that the order that just came in belongs to a known klan member and overall hateful and hated person, and that I should do something to his order and he’ll look the other way. \n\n\nI had some clear hot sauce that I got for Christmas one year. It might have been expired, but it was still really hot. So I grabbed some of that and mixed in a really stiff amount in with some of the bbq sauce. Apart from it smelling like spicy bbq sauce, you couldn’t tell anything was wrong until you actually ate it. \n\n\nLater on, earlier today actually, I learned that the guy whose food I sabotaged was actually a co-chief of the fire department one town over, and he’s actually a really nice guy and has never had anything to do with the Klan. Turns out the manager that told me about him was actually passed up for lieutenant at the department a few years back by the co-chief and was still really pissed off about it. I guess the manager thought I’d really screw with his food since I’m black and the guy was supposed to be in the klan, I dunno. \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\n",

It's about a 30 min uphill walk from the station to the uni, which I have to do twice a day. I had 2 x 2 hour lectures today with no break inbetween apart from the 10 mins to get from one room to another (which is another uphill walk, the rooms are in 2 different areas of the city)\nI got home with an hour before I start my 4 hour shift (which is high activity level, I'm an ice steward) all I wanted to do was grab some food (hadn't eaten today) and chill for half an hour before my shift.\nMy mum comes home and asks if I wanna help her carry bags to the charity shop in town. Usually I'll do anything my mum asks of me, but today I wanted to stick up for myself because I am shattered.\nI tried to explain this and offered to do it with her tomorrow afternoon when I didn't have a shift. \nShe then completely changes, says that she's going to remember this, that I'm horrible and selfish and proceeds to lock herself in her room and cry and refuse to talk to me.\nAm I really that much of an asshole for wanting a 30 min chill period? I was polite about it, she knows how tiring my commute is (plus I struggle massively with the uni degree I'm studying and find it hard to keep up sometimes) but she's acting like I'm a horrible person for saying no for once.",

      "description": "So, this story has a lot to unpack, and this is my first real post on here but I really needed to share this somewhere unbiased. \n\nFirst some back story. \nI'm originally from Poland (17 F at the moment) and we moved to the Netherlands in 2009 to find a better life than back there. And so did uncle Raphael (mum's brother) who was also my godfather. But he moved a couple of years before us. \n\nOne day, somewhere in 2014 maybe, he got with this woman, let's call her Mal, and got a child with her almost 2 years later. Which I wasn't too happy with because I didn't like that woman, but it's not my place to judge his actions and choices in life. \nThat woman is kind of a lazy one, she doesn't really clean or cook well, and also doesn't go to work. She also has 3 kids from 3 different men, so yeah, those are kinda red flags. \n\nThey ended up having money issues within the year that the child was born, and reached out for help to my mum and their sister back in Poland. But since we also were kinda tight on money then, and my aunt wasn't in the best situation to get a loan or give him a load of money either. \nSo he turned to my grandmother, and she ended up getting the loan for him because he's her poor oldest son, even though she wasn't in a great situation to do so either. \n\nNaturally my mum and aunt confronted him about it because not only does his perfectly healthy girlfriend not work, he also tries to get a lot of money from my grandmother. \n(While I understand that money issues are complicated and really bad, we went here to make our lives better and help out our family back in our homeland, so it's weird that he needs financial help in the \"better world\" from them in the \"poorer world\")\nThat was a little bit upsetting to me as well, but as a 15 year old I didn't really meddle with financial issues. \nThe thing that triggered my strong feelings of disdain is what he told my mum. \n\nFirst he made a Facebook post about how horrible our family is to him, going 2 against one and some of that jazz. So naturally my mum called him to calm the situation down. \nHe ended up telling her he hates her and that he excludes my mum and aunt from the family. And after that he blocked her and my mum bursted out in tears, and no matter what we did to help, she was really hurt by his words. And so was I, to be honest. Those words made me feel like we, and especially I, were unimportant to him unless we do what he wants us to. \nThat was when I made a vow to myself that I'll make him feel exactly this. Being hated by your closest family, feeling excluded and alienated. And I ended up complying with his wish not to be family again. \n\nFast forwarding through the cold war until a few weeks ago, we get to my mum's birthday. And, of course, with his sins forgiven by all but my and my dad (which can be a whole other story), he gets invited. \nI was aware of that and decided to keep things passive with maybe just a tone of obvious annoyance, so the party doesn't get ruined. \n\nUncle comes over with his girlfriend and walks around the room, shaking hands with everyone. The he got to me, and this wasn't purposeful, but I ended up ignoring his hand and kept eating because I thought he was shaking my sister's hand and had time for one more bite. Turns out it was intended for me. \n\nNow my brother won't stop chastising me for not shaking our uncle's hand and still being upset. And now he has everyone but our dad complaining about me still being upset. \n\nAnd yes while it was ride of me not to shake his and and it is fairly petty to hold on to that anger for so long, I feel like I haven't accomplished my goal yet, something in me refuses to let go of the anger. \nNowadays I am aware that he was also a bad person before, and the lack of consequences from any of those events just like the lack of them now just makes me feel angrier. \nIt just feels wrong to let go of so many feelings that have grown over the years.\n\nTldr: I didn't shake my uncle's had at my mum's birthday and am still upset about a situation from 2 years ago. \n\nAm I the asshole for holding on to the anger I felt? I never did anything except blocking my uncle on social media and just ignoring him because I don't do confrontation but I most likely wouldn't be taken seriously, since they just see a petty silent treatment. \n\n",

      "description": "Background: I don’t know the exact generation but a great grandfather was in the civil war for the losing side. His cousin was also in the war but for the north. After the war thier grandmother commissioned a photograph of the two of them together with what was left of their unforms and an American flag and a weird version of the confederate flag she had made (it has the flag we know as the kkk flag in the corner and the rest is white and red). My dad still has the picture and he still had the flag. As an aside he took it on pawn stars though the segment was never aired and the historian guy verified that the flag my dad had was the flag in the picture. \n\nMy dad is in hospice and doesn’t have very much but everything he does have will go to me. The first thing I want to do is pitch the picture and the flag. I’m not a racist nor a magaite and I want nothing to do with garbage and racism, and I don’t want my kids to have to worry about this trash as well.\n\nMy cousin is about to have a hissy fit and thinks I should give it to me. I saw no, it’s appropriate place is at the bottom of a landfill. \n\nThis is pretty simple as I see it, but just in case, would I be the asshole?\n\n",

(Note: I live in Europe so it's common to sit just down and wait for your order until it's done) There's about 3-4 tables busy out of 20 which means that it wasn't busy at all. About 25 minutes pass and still no sandwich for her, she didn't eat anything that day and she was starving so I get up, approach the waiter and this how our convo went:\n\nI: so hey is the sandwich ready yet?\n\nWaiter: oh yeah no man we are out of bread, is pizza okay? \n\nI: no man it's not, you shouldn't have told me that way before.\n\nWaiter: well I didn't know.\n\nI: Well I'm not the waiter you're the waiter so you're supposed to know.\n\nAfter that the waiter is just starring at me while I ask my gf that we leave.

      "description": "Whew! This is gonna take some explaining.\n\n I work at a record store, the mall I work in is the worst mall in the city and is next to one of the city's most dangerous/ghetto neighbourhoods. This is only important for the context of my character and what I put up with daily.\n\nThere is a gentleman who comes in frequently, I have described him in the past as a stage 5 time waster. The only plus side being he does make small purchases here and there. He never remembers the conversations we've had and he'll lose focus while talking to me because he noticed something (e.g. The manufacturer of the tamagotchis we sell.) I only noticed these habits a week after I yelled at him.\n\nBut why did I? Well, he came into the store and made a small purchase (his purchase barely moved the needle on target sales.) Then, as he normally does he started talking to me, now there's no one else in the store and I am at the counter folding band shirts. So I'm kinda stuck. Whatever though, I can work and chat until he gets bored of me. After asking talking about a bunch of unrelated topics he asks me if \"I believe that we landed on the moon\" without thinking I blurt out \"of course!\" He says \"oh well I don't.\" I interrupt him before he can add on to it, \"sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I would rather not talk about this subject.\" I figure this to be a reasonable response, as the last thing I want to do is argue with a customer about a belief I think is frankly stupid. The customer presses on by saying \"I'm just saying if you look at the evidence... \" I quickly cut him off \"sir I politely asked you not to continue this conversation.\" I'll admit my tone harshened slightly because I felt I wasn't respected. He pressed on \"But I saw this video on YouTube that points out how we didn't have the technology...\" I cut him off again \"SIR. I have asked you nicely twice now. I do not wish to talk about this topic.\" \"But why?\" he presses. \"Sir it's just not something I want to talk about.\" by this point I was absolutely frustrated and was for sure taking a tone with him. He continues \"all I'm saying is if you look at the evidence...\" I snapped.\n\n\"SIR. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS I POLITELY ASKED YOU TO CHANGE THE TOPIC AND YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME.\" (The all caps represents the tone not the volume. I don't have it in me to yell at people.)\n\nHe finally left just saying \"jeeze\"\n\nNow I don't know for sure that this man has any sort of handicap, and it is for sure wrong for me to assume he does.

My roommate has also yet to take it to the vet to get him check out ( you know, no more fleas, has all it’s shots, he’s fixed, etc..... )\n\nI have no issue with him rescuing a cat or wanting to keep it.  The thing is he’s been constantly late on rent/utilities and he flat out told me he doesn’t have the money to take it to the vet.  My roommate is also going to visit his parents out of state so he’s trying to find somebody to watch it ( I can’t bc I work and will also be visiting family ).  I’m also concerned if the cat decides to not pee I the litter box/it spread fleas in his room.  My roommate is leaving in 2 months and I know for a fact he won’t have the money to get his room cleaned before my 2nd roommate moves in.\n\nThere is nothing in our agreement explicitly forbidding him having a pet and my apartment is cool with cats.  Plus I also kinda like the little fluff ball.  But I know he doesn’t have the income to support it and since the cat hasn’t been checked out, I want the cat to find a new temporary home until my roommate moves out.\n\nI own the lease, so I could tell him to get rid of it, but i feel that would be an asshole move.....",

I’m an anxious person so my friends are the same. Most of the time the people at the party aren’t there for me it’s to talk to everyone else. So at the very least I want to invite who I want. Like my friends I often have one or two (a bf if I have one) and then yeah so I’d want to invite my friends we hang out for the day and I get cake and pizza.

      "description": "We've been dating for about 2 months.  A few weeks in she got into a blow out fight with her mother and I offered her to crash with me until they made up, which I thought would be a few days.  It wasn't.  \n\nTwo weeks ago she tells me that she hasn't had her period in 4 months and has been too scared to take a pregnancy test until now and sure enough it's positive.  There's no way it could be mine as I had a vasectomy in my early 20's.  \n\nWe've been having problems since she started staying with me.  It just never really got to the point to where I was over the edge and break up with her yet, but the relationship was likely going to end.  Her being pregnant is the nail in the coffin for it.  The reason I had a vasectomy is because I have no interest in being a father, let alone to another man's child.  I told her the first part of that and the break up was surprisingly easy, or so I thought.\n\nSince then she hasn't made any moves to make up with her mother or move out on her own.  She's tried initiating sex with me a few times, but for once my brain and my penis are on the same page as far as what a bad idea that is.   She also keeps talking in a way that makes me think that she believes we are going to get back together.   I've told her she really can't stay here forever and she says she knows, but then makes no effort to do anything as far as I know.  \n\nI feel like she is just expecting us to get back together and not even trying to make up with her mother and the only way to get that to happen is to kick her out and not give her a comfy alternative.  \n\nMost of the reactions have been in agreement with me when I spoke to my friends about it.  My mother really surprised me though and shamed the hell out of me for wanting to kick her out.  She wants me to try and make it work with her.  I think some of it is because she was a single mother herself for some time, but I really wasn't prepared for her to want me to torpedo my own happiness for a two month long relationship that was already going south.",

      "description": "My best friend came out to me as trans roughly 1.5 years ago. She pretty much instantly became hormones but had no surgeries yet. I've known her for only 2-3 years prior to her coming-out due to us both studying literature in Berlin, but we quickly became best friends. These things changed after her treatment started.   \n\n\n1) She's copying me. Not only my style or how I talk, but she'll also hang out with the same friends, have relationship problems when I do, get frustrated with her job when I need to search a new one. All these things would be innocent if they were single events, but the amount of \"coincidences\" is incredible and suspicious.  \n2) Sometimes she's not invited to events. At the start, that just happened (y'know.. sometimes there are group size restrictions, sometimes an old clique meets up after a long time..). On every of these occasions, she would find reason for drama, send me dozens of texts on how the group is excluding her and how this is unfair and any other reason why we should have invited her and how she now feels like shit.   \n3) Very often she wants me to promise to deal with things for her that she can do herself. She almost always agrees that she'll have a change to do it and knows that there is no guarantee I'll do it (its NOT stuff like \"if you go shopping, can you buy xyz for me?\"). I've told her that she basically dumps her responsibilities on me and that it stresses me out, but she simply disagreed and got angry that I denied her simple favors.\n\n4) She has a history of bad friendships and this leads to her often being paranoid and untrusting even towards me. When we plan to meet, she'll double- and triple-check that I'll really go with her. She'll always get a backup even if I promise to be there with her. She'll ask three others to make sure I'll have time and not planned anything with someone else.  \n\n\nBy now, I argue with her at least once a week. She's obviously also getting more annoyed at me or gaining more confidence, as she more and more started to call me out for being a bad friend, not having her back with whatever or how she's disappointed that I don't want to do xyz for her and that I always treat her badly. She also once told me that some of her other friends would urge her that I am an asshole and that she should avoid me, but because she's so nice and believes in our friendship, she still deals with me. I told her in some discussions that if I'm so bad, maybe she should just stop talking to me, but she's refusing. There is also at least on friend who severed his ties to me because he wants to avoid her.\n\nI feel almost constantly pressured into needing to agree with her, think of her, include her, get her into events/parties just to avoid more fights, drama and guilt-tripping. I'm frustrated and stressed, I feel trapped in a friendship thats maybe just not working anymore. \n\nWIBTA if I told her that we should spend less time together and find other friends?",

      "description": "  So this year I have started studying a lot, like leaving home for school at 8am and get home finally at 10pm from cram which leaves so little time. This happens every day except for Saturday and Sunday. \n  My parents are divorced and I am living with my mom's family so to see my father I have to take the bus and the subway which would take at least and hour and half to get there. I know it's not that much but I would like to mention that staying on my father's house is really exhausting I have two half brothers and man they spend their time differently and I'm like running from one to the other back and forth in the house and I can't have my only 2 \"free\" days (I still have things to study at home in those days) to be exhausting too. In terms of communication that leaves me with just the phone but whenever I have called him without having the intent to visit the house I feel a cold tone in his voice so that makes me not wanting to be the one calling but he won't call me ever unless it's birthday or new year and his way of thinking if he isn't calling I ain't calling (I'm 17 in case anyone want to know). \n  I would not get mad about this the thing that changed the situation was that last week at some point I felt a bit bad about the whole thing so I would send him a message to apologise cause I can't visit him cause of studies and I got no reply, nothing. This screwed emotionally my whole week I can't concentrate the least while studying. It got me wondering AITA?\n  Also about the distance I have a strong fear when I use the busses in my city, I get extremely anxious and paranoid like everybody will try to harm me. My city has a bit of a bad name and I have been some times in the scenario of getting threatened for money or my phone even inside the subway in my city with people around and it was at day.\n  I think I covered as much as I could.

      "description": "So I signed up for an online psychology class at university. Sixty percent of the grade of the course was comprised of 8 different essay assignments (one due every 2 weeks). The rest was from quizzes and such that did not need to be graded by the instructor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second week of the course, the professor sent out an email saying she had broken both wrists (among other injuries) and might be late on grading. Completely understandable. However, I had just submitted the first essay when this happened and was eager to get feedback so I could fix any problems for future assignments. I've found in college that even when being careful to read the assignment grading rubric, sometimes a student's interpretation of the expectations for the course are not very clear, so feedback is vital to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, by the time the 2nd essay was due, the 1st essay was still not graded and no feedback was provided. I understood that, even if I was a bit disappointed. However, by the time the 5th essay was due, the 1st essay and all other essays were still ungraded and no feedback was provided. I was quite annoyed at this point. I could be failing the course without even knowing it and it was approaching the deadline to drop a course. I sent an email pointing this out and asking if there was any way she could dictate the grades to someone else who could type them, etc. She responded in a furious manner and said I wasn't being understanding of her traumatic situation and there was nothing she could do. I felt **mortified** after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation ended up being pretty inconsequential as I passed the class with a good grade. She finally graded everything in the last few weeks of the course (no feedback though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut really, am I the asshole here? I feel horrible that she was injured, but students pay a lot of money to enroll in university courses. If she wasn't able to provide any kind of feedback, perhaps the class should have been cancelled. I'm particularly interested in how professors feel about this situation and how it could have been better handled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much!",

      "description": "My (21F) boyfriend (23M) swore in today for the army. I've been upset with the decision to enlist for a while because I feel it was made abruptly and without thinking about our future together. (4 year relationship) I came to terms with it and accepted that it was something he wanted and felt he should do, and tried to focus on the positives. (Like job training in the career he wants, nursing, and education funds)\n\nWell, today he swore in. I couldn't be there as I moved home in November due to my mom getting sick. I saw the pictures on his mom's Facebook page, where she mentioned that he would be headed into the airborne infantry, and hopefully become a ranger one day. For four months while this has been building he's told me he was doing something medical he just didn't know what, he would send me the title as soon as it was official so I could research. I got really upset at seeing this, and texted him asking if it was a mistake or something. When he responded he told me he \"withheld the truth\" because he knew I wouldn't be on board and if \"I waited for your approval we would be going nowhere fast I did this for our future\". I asked him how he thought I wouldn't find out and when he planned to tell me and he said he knew I'd figure it out somehow but he assumed I'd just be happy and supportive that he's doing something he wants to and bettering himself.\n\nSo, AITA for not being supportive of him taking a job we didn't discuss?",

We stayed at a fancy hotel the night after the wedding so we could have a little post-holiday celebration together. Bot once did he bring out his phone to document our experience. I’m not a fan of uploading every single activity on the internet. I took a few photos. He didn’t ask for me to share to him the photos I took. Asked him why he didn’t want to take photos of us together. He said he’s just not the selfie kind of guy. Ok.\n\nBF is now overseas with colleagues on training.

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, and apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile. For privacy reasons I will not share my main account name (thus the throwaway), nor the other account in question. \n\n\nBackground: I do art. And I always sign my art. Recently, I've found my work being reposted, with most of the time me as an artist being credited. I have no problem with this, in fact, I always feel honored when I see this happen. \n\n\nSituation: someone has reposted my work without crediting me, however my signature has not been removed from the work (so it's obviously not theirs). I cannot comment on their post to publicly ask them to fix the credit (commenting turned off), or take the post down. An OC (original content) hashtag in the description leads me to believe they wish to pass it off as their own. \n\n\nThis has happened once before with the same person. When it first happened, I gave them a warning to please take it down. Nothing changed, I also got no response from them. I post new work, and within a few hours I find it reposted on the aforementioned account, my signature has not been removed, work copied exactly.\n\n\nI contacted them again, this time warning them to take it down within 24 hours, or else I will send a copyright infringement report. These forms are a huge hassle to fill in, and I'm worried that I'm over reacting (especially considering my signature is still on the work), but the fact that they used the OC hashtag tells me that they're stealing my work and pretending it's theirs (which is illegal, I think).\n\n\nSo... AITA for threatening them with a copyright claim? And WIBTA for filing it if the post hasn't been taken down in 24 hours? I'm really at a cross roads cuz... On the one hand, exposure, but on the other hand, its my work...",

      "description": "I know this sounds shitty and kind of invasive of me. I am not judgmental and I understand that mental health is a serious thing. My boyfriend and I have been thinking about trying to have a baby soon. I have had a long history of anxiety/depression as well as my father, and his father. I know my bf’s mom has some serious mental health issues. She takes antipsychotics but i’m not sure what for. I have tried asking my boyfriend if he knows anything but he just said no he doesn’t think so. I don’t think he even knows what’s going on with his mom because 1. I don’t think she’s told him. and 2. I don’t think he even knows what antipsychotics are for. His mom talks to herself and he always laughs and goes oh don’t mind her she talks to herself a lot. But I don’t think he even realizes it’s not a normal thing to do. \n\nAnyways, my doctor told me that my anxiety/depression is most likely genetic. I fear my future children will struggle with that alone. Now add in whatever his mom may be dealing with. It worries me to think of having a child that will struggle mentally. Especially since a lot of serious mental health disorders have a genetic component. I have not brought this up to my boyfriend in this context because I do not want him or his family to be offended. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to know what’s going on? ",

      "description": "For context I want to start with the fact that my dad has severe bipolar disorder. Like to the point now where he barely goes outside of his bedroom. He lives with my elderly grandma and I worry about how much care the two of them are getting. He spends most of his days buying guitars, listening to music, making spreadsheets, and texting my brother and I. He hasn't always been like this, but it started in about late 2016 and has been escalating since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn his texts he talks about guitars and music; but mostly talks about being wronged by the doctors he's seen in the past, that America wants to execute the mentally ill, and that no one understands or loves him. He's convinced that if someone moves out there and devotes all their time to care-giving for him, he'll feel better. That's his end goal. On average, he'll send 7 texts (about 10 lines each) every time he texts me. So when I was texting him more often, it would be constant! He would send 7 texts, I would respond as well as I could in one, he would 7 more texts and accuse me of ignoring most of the stuff he was saying and not texting him the way he prefers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have moderate anxiety and depression, and also stomach problems, which I am regularly seeing my doctor for. During one of my regular check ups I was having a particularly hard time with this. My doctor asked me what was wrong and I explained and showed her my phone. She glanced at the screen and only had to see the volume of texts before saying \"He's not being treated.\" She continued on to say that those with bipolar can behave like this if they aren't being treated or taking medication and that I need to ignore his messages. The more I respond, the more it encourages his behavior and reassures him not to get treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've started following this advice, and I do admit I've started to feel better. I only respond to short messages or pictures at this point, and ignore all of his rants. At the same time though, in the back of my mind I feel like an asshole for just ignoring the problem. How long am I supposed to keep this up? Forever? What about if I get married? Am I supposed to ignore him then too? From his side, he doesn't really understand why I've stopped talking so much because I haven't really explained it at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. Reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "   For reference me and my ex are both 16 and sophmores in High School.\n\n I broke up with her at the end of November 2018, ending our 7 month relationship. I ended it because of some personal issues and overall just us growing distant.\n\nSince then i have recieved a text or call every few weeks basically telling me she still liked me. Qhether these texts were from her or mutual friends. This last weekend we had a short conversation in which i told her i wanted her to stop telling me this because I always felt really akward about it and didnt like it. This was a sunday night. \n \n   Monday at school three mutual friends walked up to me asking what I did to her. I was confused by this but they all shared a similar story, my ex told them all that she wanted nothing to do with me because i was an absolute asshole through text and how I kept leading her on. Mind you i am an emotionally oblivious person and very friendly but i was always clear that i didnt think we should be in a relationship.\n   \n  On Monday night i called he best friend for clarification because i was frankly pissed off about being lied about. After a 20 minute conversation and sent screenshots it was decided that she was lying theough her teeth about me being an ass.\n\nNow comes the moment of questionable Assholishness. Something to preface this, im not confrontational, neither is she, but come thursday i was beyond mad. Four of her best friends had walked up to me and insulted me and one actively knocked my phone from my hands because she was angry at me. \n\n    Thursday morning rolled around and i decided enough was enough. I waited till after 2nd hour, when i knew she'd be at her locker for a while. I walked up and called her out on her BS, she started to deny it and her friends there started to try and insult me. I had known this would happen so i pulled my phone out and showed them the conversation. Her friends all seemed really mad that she lied to them about me. ( I was pretty good friends with some of them before all this.) \n\n    My Ex stormed off saying she never said i was an asshole and said i could believe the people who said she did or i could believe her. Friday morning she walked up to me and said once again that she never called me an asshole but if i believed them over her then i was an asshole.\n\n   Im sticking with what my friends told me she said but i dont know if i handled it well so am i the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "We’re doing a project in my high school English class. We couldn’t choose partners but both of  the girls in my group act like they’re too busy to work on the project. They want to divide the work based on free time instead of having everyone do an equal share. The only activity I do outside of school is soccer and that only eats up 2 or 3 days of my week. I also have a job but I only work weekends and only if I don’t have a soccer game. That means I have 4 or 5 days where I don’t do anything after school. Both of my partners have more extracurricular activities than me and they’re doing a full AP schedule and have another project whereas I’m only taking 3 AP classes. They’re arguing that because I have more free time then they do I should do more of the work as they’re already busy with National Honor Society, French Club and other stuff. I  use most of my time off for leisure but I still think it’s unfair for me to do more then them.  The teacher says maybe this is for the best and the other groups already started working as well so I can’t switch groups.",

      "description": "First off, sorry for mobile formatting\n\nBackstory. I’m the oldest of 3 kids. I’m 19, my sister is 17, and my brother is 15. My brother is bipolar and a serious handful to deal with. He tantrums daily, sometimes even multiple times daily. My dad is also extremely volatile, and therefore, my parents have agreed that the best course of action is to leave my brother to my mom. She deals with him every day. \n\nSimultaneously, my mom is a lawyer, and holds the position of legislative counsel to the legislature of my county. She deals with a lot of shit from there as well. My dad recently took over for one of the legislators who retired. He’s been serving as a legislator for 4 months. This technically makes him, at least partially, my mom’s boss. \n\nI’m a super introverted guy. I don’t bother anyone. I just stay home and play video games. I don’t like emotions. I bury them as deep as i can so i don’t have to deal with them. Therefore, I usually come across as a soulless, emotionless guy, who doesnt care about anything. I’ve never had a girlfriend, and I have very few real friends in life. My sister, on the other hand, is very outgoing, and very emotional. She also has severe anxiety, and worries about a ton of things that nobody at her age should have to worry about. She also has had multiple boyfriends, has ton of friends, and she loves to travel. So for her winter break every year, she goes on a vacation, usually with one of our parents as a guardian. This past week, she went on a cruise with my dad. The cruise line only gave them 1 internet connection between the 2 of them, so they had to trade off. On the first of the trip, my dad was getting into the shower and asked my sister for the WiFi. She got suspicious, so she ave him the WiFi, told him she was leaving, then snuck back in. She heard my dad having phone sex with an unknown woman. The night, she confronted him. He said that he never slept with anyone except our mother during their marriage, but she wasn’t sure if she believed him. She still isn’t.\n\nNow I’m in a bind. My brother is starting to get out of hand. My mother is fraying around the edges and, due to extreme stress both at work and at home, I’m worried that this might send her over the edge. Even if my mom manages to take it without cracking, I’m nearly positive that 1) this will end in their divorce, 2) my mom will have to work for the person who cheated on her, 3) my dad will be able to go on as if nothing ever happened. When my sister came home, she said she didn’t want to make this decision on her own, so she talked to me about it. She wanted advice from me about whether or not to tell my mom that my dad was cheating on her. I stay out of everybody’s way, and as crazy as this may sound, this sudden development probably should bother me more than it does. I don’t want to have to go through my parents getting divorced, but at the same time, my mom is turning 50 soon, and my sister thinks that if she doesn’t get out now, she won’t be able to find a guy that will make her happy. The problem is, I’m selfish, and i don’t want to go through the cray. Wibta for telling my sister not to tell my mom so i can just keep going?  ",

      "description": "So I was out Friday night, but I had to coach people the next morning and had driven to the club with some of my friends. One of them was turning 21, and had taken drinking a little bit too far - 2 hours in, he was basically trying to get with any girl there was, falling over herself, generally being a bit of a mess. So at this point, me and the others decide that we should probably take him home. We bundle her into the car, and start driving back, but midway through the drive he said that she wanted a McDonald’s, and that she wouldn’t get out of the car unless she got one. I figured that a drunk person could do a fair bit of damage to the car and McDonald’s is like 5 mins away, so I said yeah sure. When we’re halfway there, he says he’s feeling sick, so I grab a plastic bag from my trunk and give it to him. We get to McDonald’s, he gets his Big Mac meal, and we start to drive home - and then he’s sick mainly into the bag, but also around my car. He then also drops a bunch of the burger around. \nSo the next morning, I get a message from him saying sorry about being such a mess, and that he’d pay to have the vomit cleaned up if there still was any. After he’d puked, I’d sprayed some weird anti-vomit spray on the interior and to be honest I couldn’t really notice a smell anymore, but I’m really tempted to tell him that it needs to be properly cleaned.\nBefore I’m judged too much, this particular friend is a bit of a pig in my car - every time he goes for a ride with me and my other friends I always find candy wrappers and stuff in the door pocket, and once he mashed some gum into the carpet which I still haven’t gotten out. I’ve confronted him about it, but he insists it’s not him each time - to be honest, I’m only really friends with him because he’s part of my friendship group...\nAlso, a bit more context - the next day he had his birthday dinner and invited like 10 people, not including me... that kind of made me feel more justified if I do end up asking to have him clean it. Anyway, what are your thoughts?",

My family is not American, we grew up in South East Asia but both of us children are quite westernized due to our education.\n\nMy parents are relatively well off in their country, they can comfortably pay for my tuition to study abroad here in the US, although this hasn’t always been the case. When I was growing up, my parents have just started their own business and we were in a lot of debt and poverty until I was around 10 so I saw a lot of the struggles and grew up to be pretty careful with my own spending, money and needs/wants. \n\nMy brother on the other hand was born when they started to become a lot more comfortable and now they have a lot more spare income to spend on things. I know kids will be kids and shouldn’t have to worry about parents money etc but I feel like my brother is starting to take all of this for granted. The following are some examples:\n\n1. He asks for a trip to the USA each winter to visit me and gets relatively upset when they say no and he complains to me as if he’s entitled to the trip. \n\n2. He got a 200usd pair of Bluetooth headset for his birthday and is now begging parents for 1600usd laptop for school. \n\n3. He’s looking to get some protein for weightlifting and is adamant on getting more expensive brands of protein isolate instead of just regular whey protein. (For those unfamiliar, in the simplest term - isolate is a more refined version of whey with less carbohydrates and is more expensive)\n\nEtc.. \n\nI know a lot of this behavior have been encouraged by my parents and I’m trying to talk to them about it. I feel part of it is them trying to compensate for what they weren’t able to give me.. but I feel this is really bad for him, \n\nI want to explain to my younger brother about why he should be more considerate about what he wants and think whether he really needs something or not before asking for it. \n\nAlthough this is not my money, and if my parents are allowing it then maybe it’s ok? I’m not sure what to do. WIBTA for giving the kid a talk?",

      "description": "We bought a house this year, and I have been super excited to really go all out for Christmas for the first time. I tend to be \"Buddy the Elf\" excited about Christmas, and husband is more muted, but it is still his favorite holiday. He has been pointing out trees that we could wrap lights around, and we stayed in the front yard for like an hour mulling if there was something we could do this year to make the process a lot easier for years to come. (Options ranged from cup hooks under the eaves to running a cable to an outdoor outlet in the middle of the yard, lol.) \n\nAfter Thanksgiving, and one afternoon when we weren't doing anything, I asked if he wanted to start getting boxes out of the attic and we could go put up lights outside. It was too cold, he said, and we could do it in a few days when it was supposed to warm up. Ok cool. A few days later I asked again and he was tired and said not now. Then later it was too dark. Then later he was in the middle of a Rocket League game. It was always something, and always \"not now\" without giving me a time or day that he would be interested. \n\nSo when I got home from work yesterday, I just did it myself. I hauled the ladder out of the garage, hung the lights, got the tree out of the attic, set it up, and was in the middle of decorating it when he got home. He gave me a sad puppy dog look and said, \"you hung the lights without me?\" I told him he didn't seem very interested in doing it, so I just went ahead and did it, but if he wanted he could start getting ornaments and we could finish the Christmas tree together. He got mad and said \"What the fuck is the point?\" Which started a fight. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone. Regular poster in need of opinions. Forgive the mobile format.\n\nI'm the head coach at a mixed martial arts gym. In addition to that, I sometimes run specialized classes teaching practical self defense to women, law enforcement and so forth. \n\nThese classes are meant to teach essential skills women can use to **survive** attacks, not the flashy, ineffective nonsense you'd find in some seminars. In short, it's meant to be taken seriously and everyone who shows up knows this.\n\nThis time a woman attended and had an attitude from the second she walked in with someone else, mentioning to other people that she already knew all of this, all this shit was fake etc. I had asked her what she hoped to achieve by coming, and she said her friend had dragged her along. Ok, whatever. Everyone is entitled to learn.\n\nSo as we're going along she's disrupting, asking sarcastic hypothetical questions clearly meant to challenge my credibility and half-assing the demonstrations with a partner which deprived the women paired with her of their experience.\n\nShe essentially rallied some others into a \"why should we have to learn this, we can protect ourselves\" sentiment, which is a dangerous mindset. So I asked her if she would be comfortable pairing with me and simulating a real life scenario in which she'd have to defend herself against an assault, and she agreed. She comes up and I explain again that she'll be in no real danger and I'll stop when she asks, but it will feel real and I want her to show me how she'd handle the situation to the best of her ability and asked again if it was ok. She agreed.\n\nI took her to the ground and pinned her down, explaining what was happening to the class. She tried kicking, flailing at my face and escaping but obviously couldn't. At no point did I do anything to cause her pain, but I was physically overwhelming so it was realistic. She told me to stop, so I did. Take note this is **common practice** with men and women. Hands-on demonstration is essential to learning.\n\nI used the opportunity to teach where she went wrong and what she could have done to the others who were eager to pair up and repeat the drills among themselves. However, this woman took me aside and told me I made her feel humiliated and helpless. I re-iterated the importance of the information and the seriousness of the subject, and told her that the drill was meant to show her the reality of the situation so she'd be open to learning as I don't want her to rely on misconceptions to save her life. She got her friend and left.\n\nI don't think I was an asshole, it was standard practice and misinformation can have terrible consequences. My reaction from women has always been extremely positive because I don't baby those who attend. But I'm also not a woman and don't have a female perspective on this, and I do feel bad because my intent was never to upset her and no one has walked out before. So if I did something wrong, I'll gladly accept that and fix it. AITA?",

      "description": "So in short- we had a French test and some people didn't know anything so they decided to skip and not attend the class that day.\n\nBut they didn't just go, they started persuading other students to skip the class too and since they are the \"popular ones\" most of them followed.\n\nWe were left 5 people including me who couldn't skip another class because they would loose their scholarship if they did not attend. (There was one person tho who just didn't want to skip the class, he never skips). But they did not stop persuading and telling us things like one for all (which is ironic).\n\nSo we decided that we should just fake skipping and after the lunch brake we came back to the class.  Now our classmates hate us.\n\nAre we the assholes for having different opinions, for not wanting to follow the group? Should that affect our relationship with our classmates?\n",

      "description": "I (24F)  am in a serious relationship to where I spend I spend a good amount of time with my bf (23m) and on weekends (Th-Monday morning)  he has his almost year old son. We are also lucky enough to work together and often have the same hours. \n\nWe have our routine already that on Thursdays we run errands with the baby and spend time as a family. Friday’s we spend time together before either one or both of us goes to work that night. \n\nI still live with my mom(47), unfortunately her husband is currently in another country and we are waiting on hearing when he comes back. Now she manages a university so she has a normal job where she works 8-6pm and I tend to close at my job. SO lives with his dad and brother but it’s much chiller than my place. And lately I’m spending more time there anyway. \n\nSo I’m free to go to my SO’s during the day and then I go to work from there. I change into my uniform there and he lives closer to where we work so I’m less likely to be late. \n\nNow with the holidays having been these past two weeks, she gets out earlier on Thursdays and Friday’s. My usual is to go to SO’s then either go to work, he goes to work or other. So I’m already going to SO’s today per usual, and then I would go to work. However mom texts me that she’s getting out early and will be bringing food. \n\nI go to SO’s for a bit and then go home. To where she had shown up half an hour before she said she would, I was late but she had already eaten and was sleeping while I eat. If she had wanted to spend time with me then I think she could have talked.  I feel like she expects me to just sit home alone and doesn’t take into consideration that I now have plans when I am able. \n\nThe same happened the day before with it being Thursday, I was with SO and baby. We were all trying to nap. She tells me my dad is delivering some chairs to our house. I need to be there to put them inside. I was going to pick them up later that day. So I leave a sleeping baby and SO, race home, dad gets there 45 minutes later than when I was told, then I go back to SO’s to see him before he had to work. ",

He doesn't do it on purpose, it's more so the case that the pants fall down on their own without his knowledge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been going on for over a decade.  The pants fall down exposing his entire buttocks, and no he doesn't wear underwear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's in his 30s and this has been going on since I knew him in his late teens. For his age I feel it's ridiculous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last few months it's been getting more frequent, this has happened over a number of occasions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad to bring it up due to how he might react.  He often gets upset due to small issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past I have hinted at it and he has just ignored it, until this week...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were going down the street and by chance we saw an actor we knew from a movie series that we watch.  We said that we would go over and approach him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople were chatting to him and his pants dropped right in front of the actor and the crowd.  He had no interest to pull up his pants.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people just ignored it, while others were laughing.  At this point I felt bad for him, but he was doing it to himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on that week I brought it up as brief as I could,  about him needing to to get a belt and how he is in his 30s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis reaction was fine at first, until he began talking about it.  He began to get aggressive as he went on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe blamed it on his parents for not getting him the correct size?  Than went further on and said that I'm a bad friend for judging his appearance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continued and said that he'll keep letting his pants drop down because he doesn't care what people think of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that he stop talking to me.  We haven't spoken since.  I think the entire event is childish and immature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for even bringing it up in the first place?  What does r/AITA think of this?",

      "description": "My parents divorced when I was about 3 and my older sister was 6. My dad lived about a good 15 minutes away from my mom which sometimes caused a bit of an issue with leaving school supplies at one place or the other but it was bearable. What wasn’t ok was my dads anger. In about fourth grade he wanted to build a bookshelf and told me and my sister to help him and we both had no idea what we were doing so he just told us to hold it in place. Eventually he got so worked up he just started screaming and cursing and told my sister to go to her room and for me to “play my fucking videogames”. \n\nThere were other occasions where his anger went over the top but that’s not what I’m here to talk about. While my sister was taking her ACTs he got a house close to my moms and by our school so he would be more accessible which was good at first but eventually my sister didn’t do so hot on a practice ACT and my dad actually called her stupid. With that she up and left. I didn’t want to be there alone with his anger honed in on me so I left too.\n\nThis was two years ago. We still meet up for dinner sometimes but he acts like the ultimate victim. He texts us about how we betrayed him and how we don’t care about his side of the family and then the next day he apologizes and wants us back at his house.\n\nAITA for living with my mom?",

      "description": "This happened about an hour ago, and I'm still feeling kind of messed up from it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was doing my homework and finished a good chunk of it, so I decided to take a break and play some league. My mom noticed me doing this and said I have to get back to doing my homework, which I was a little bit annoyed by, but it is true I didn't work for very long, although I did do a good portion of what was due. I sat back down to get to work when my brother also goes to use the computer, and I told him that our mom wanted us to keep working for a little while longer \"because she's stupid.\" Obviously, this wasn't a serious insult or anything, but I was annoyed and it slipped out of my mouth. I felt bad immediately after saying it and said so, but I didn't think it would really bother anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n My mom overheard and was furious. She came out screaming, calling me ungrateful and, basically, an asshole. I tried to explain that I really didn't mean it, that it just slipped out, etc, but she wasn't having it. My mom then said that if I'm this bad already, in a few years I'll probably be doing hard drugs and ridiculous things like that, since I'm \"always\" betraying her trust and misbehaving now (what she means by this is that I used to do things behind their back, like stay up late on my phone, ditching church, etc). This wasn't the first argument we've had, but it's for sure one of the worst. Although my parents really do try to raise us well, I've always had a tough relationship with them. We just disagree on too many important things to have a healthy relationship all the time. However, I had always thought my dad was the one who hated me. It really hurt to learn that my mom really thought that little of me, but I think she's definitely pushing it by saying I'm gonna become what she believes to be a criminal. What I think is the problem here is that her idea of a bad person is very different from where my boundaries are, so when I called her stupid that must have immediately pushed me into the \"bad\" category. AITA here for calling her stupid?",

When we run out of something I usually tell a waitress it's 86 and they relay the message to the other attendants.\n\nThis time around, we ran out of gravy. I tell one of the waitresses and they're fine with it, and they make due for about an hour. I get an order from another waitress (W) with gravy. I ask, \"you know we're out of gravy, right?\" She didn't say anything, just looked extremely annoyed, then went up to the manager (B) \n\nHe begins yelling at my co-worker (J). I'm in the back at the time stocking, so I come out and tell B that we ran out and I figured the other waitress would relay the message. This is how the rest of the scenario plays out:\n\nB, angrily: We have some stock in the fridge. If we're out, make some. \n\nJ: What have you been doing? You've just been sitting on your ass all day. You're the manager, you should be helping.\n\nB: Excuse me?\n\nI leave because I don't do extremely well with conflict and wanted to remain neutral, as well as to find the gravy the manager was talking about. The next thing I hear is J saying \"fuck this, I'm out\" and he begins packing up his things.\n\nI had already worked a double that day, so I wasn't about to close as well (this would have been a 14 hour shift). The manager had to close with about 3 hours remaining.\n\nSo, AITA for not telling all the waitresses or the manager we were out? I wasn't even aware how to make it or if we had any to do so.

I thought why not let him try it on while I think about it, in case I end up not wanting it (I didn't think he'd take this as an admission of me giving it up). He asked me to see how it fit on him outside changing room. When talking about how it fit, I mentioned that the sleeves didn't even reach the wrist but it was \"up to him.\" Now, these three words are what got him really mad at me. I meant it as if it was up to him to decide whether it fit him (because we were talking about size). He thought I meant it was up to him whether he wanted to buy or not. He went back to change and I decided I did indeed want to buy it &amp; thought because I had found it, I had \"dibs\" on it. He insisted that I basically forfeited it to him by then.

Most of it hit him and stayed, but some of the chunks went over and hit her. She got ENRAGED and instantly started screaming at us. It wasn't even like big chunks of snow, just small bits that went onto her left cheek and her hair. I instantly started apologizing, saying it wasn't meant for her and that I have terrible aim. She still started screaming and told me she will report me to either school authorities, or to my parents. She told her mother and her mother, just wanted my mom's phone number, without even hearing my side of the story. I ended up giving her the number, and the mother said that I will suffer.

      "title": "AITA for moving on after my girlfriend broke up with me?",
      "description": "My girlfriend (15F) broke up with me (15M) last week and I was pretty devastated. It happened like 5 days before our two month anniversary. Granted, our relationship wasn't like what it had been in the beginning but it happens and I thought it would get better but we had a school dance and she was kinda avoiding me so I noticed I didn't feel the same about her but I still wanted to maintain our relationship and I was certain it would get better.\n\nFast forward to last Monday. She broke up with me. I was extremely sad and a mutual friend (15F) noticed. She had just broken up with her bf the week before, but she still offered to come to my house and comfort me. At first I was hesitant but I thought that it would probably be better if I wasn't alone. So we walk the dog and go to my room and I discover that we have so much more in common than me and my ex-gf had. She gave me some kisses on my cheek but I didn't think much of it as she's a very outgoing and loving person. \n\nI bring her home and when we say goodbye I try to kiss her on the cheek but she does the same so we end up in an accidental lip situation but it only lasted for like half a millisecond. That was when I realized she was so much better for me and I kinda had a crush on her. I wasn't over my ex yet, of course, but it dit happen.\n\nFast forward to Thursday and we're hanging out again. We get to my room and 5 minutes after getting there we started making out. It all happened extremely fast but it did feel right. We both confessed our love to eachother and such and it was awesome.\n\nThe next day after school I was hanging out with some friends in the city and they said they suspected me being with the new girl. We promised not to tell anyone but we both couldn't hold it in and I made my friends promise not to tell anyone. They said other friends caught onto it too, so almost our entire friend group kind of knew. \n\nHere comes where I fucked up: I decided to tell my ex. I still don't know why I did it. A friend recommended doing it, and I was afraid my ex would hear from someone else, but I still shouldn't have done it.\n\nNow my ex is mad at me for being over her so quickly and getting with a new girl. She said I am crazy for loving someone else so fast and all that jazz. They are pretty close friends though, which isn't great. But my ex says I am a dick for moving on so quickly and that there is a minimum amount of days between relationships and some more stuff I felt was really weird. She is also saying her and the other girl can't be friends if she goes for me, which really hurts.\n\nSo, AITA here? Is it possible to get into a new relationship so quickly?",

      "description": "Now I know the title sounds bad, and it might be, but that's why I'm here.\n\nSo I already posted this story on r/CasualConversation about a month ago, but it was removed. I'll just give you the shortened version of that story.\n\nI'm 25M and I got out of a very abusive relationship a little over a year ago which left me pretty broken (more so than I already was). When I say broken, I mean that I have very very low self esteem, depression, and can overall feeling of worthlessness and that I don't deserve anything, and I've only recently started to attempt to put my life back together. This information is important only because it's why I acted the way I did.\n\nI work in IT and I had fixed a coworker's laptop. This coworker is female and is also very very attractive. After I fixed her computer, I thought that would be the end of our interactions. However I ended up seeing her again a bit later when I tried actually eating in the cafeteria/break room. She saw me and then sat down to talk to me. She was different because unlike most people, she didn't seem to show any contempt for me, which I found strange. I didn't think much of it until the next day when I just decided to eat at my desk and she actually found me and talked to me again. It was revealed that neither one of us had Valentine'a Day plans ( It was February 13th and Valentine's Day was the very next day.) and she asked me to go out with her on Valentine's Day.\n\nI was very very nervous for this since I had not been on a date in forever and thought I would screw everything up. The day comes and I go to my little apartment to get ready for the date. I buy her some flowers and try to look presentable and I soon go to the restaurant. The line was right next to the bar and I could see the main dining area. While in line, I saw her already sitting there and I swear my heart stopped. She was so so beautiful and she almost appeared to be glowing. My anxiety shot through the roof and my only thought was \"she deserves so much better\". So what I did was I stepped out of line and looked around the bar. I found a pretty good looking guy who for some reason, was there by himself and I gave him the flowers and my card and told him to have dinner with her that night, which he did. Once he checked in, I left the restaurant and went home and just curled up on my floor (I live in a very small studio and own no furniture)\n\nThe next day, I see her and she appears to be happy. During lunch, I actually approached her and apologized for my absence and told her the 15 second version of what you just read. She invited me to eat with her and we talked and talked. A couple days later, I asked her out to dinner and she said yes. We had a nice time and then caught a movie and we even had our first kiss that night. We're still seeing each other almost a month later, but I can't shake the guilt of blowing her off on Valentine's Day and I still feel like I don't deserve to be with the beautiful and amazing woman that she is.",

      "description": "Long story short, I was at a party during which I had consumed a good amount of alcohol and was inebriated - not fall-down or blackout drunk, but certainly not capable of safely driving a car. At some point late in the night there was a lot of mutual flirting between me and a girl (\"Jane\") that I knew but was not quite *friends* with; she's a friend of a friend (\"Sadie\"). I could tell while speaking to her that she was about as drunk as I was, and so somehow I didn't think it inappropriate for us to go back to my place and hook up. \n\nShe spent the night, but was up and out before I woke up. I remembered every detail (at least I think I do) but was still a bit surprised at what happened. \n\nWithin a couple hours I'd gotten an angry text from Sadie, calling me a scumbag for taking her friend home when she was in that state. I immediately felt bad (and still do to an extent) and texted Jane to ask if I had done anything wrong or made her uncomfortable. She said I hadn't, but echoed Sadie's feeling that it was irresponsible and that she felt taken advantage of somewhat. And that's the latest interaction we've had. \n\nAs I said, it's upsetting that she feels that way... but I also can't *quite* get myself to think that I was actually in the wrong. I read the signals, we talked a lot, she never seemed anything less than interested. I admit that it's very possible that a misunderstanding could have taken place, given the state we were both in. But the fault - if any - isn't obvious to me. \n\nMeanwhile my roommate says I should not be at all surprised to get a summons over the matter, or if the situation escalates (we're in college, yeah). I think that seems extreme, but I'm biased. Was/am I the asshole? ",

He was very clearly gay from when you talked to him( not being homophobic, that’s just the vibe he gave off). So naturally being around a bunch of rich douches, some started making homophobic jokes about him. He took this very hard and was a mess for days and his grades dropped. He comes back with a no fucks given attitude and proceeds to be an absolute asshole. I’m talking being a dick to teachers, pushing/slapping kids for no real reason and calling innocent kids the same slurs used against him. I want to call him out on this but I feel there is no way to do it without being rude and mean to him. He clearly doesn’t take confrontation well but is very comfortable being a confronter. I don’t want to let him do this to anyone else but I don’t want to mess him up again because he is still trying to recover his grades from when he was gone for like 4 days (it’s a very academically rigorous school). WIBTA if I confronted him?\n\n\nTLDR: Gay friend bullied, misses a few days of school, returns and proceeds to physically and verbally abuse kids with the same slurs used against him",

After she dropped a few f-bombs, I got snappy back and told her to stop being crappy and she freaked out and basically told me I treat my family like shit and she's never going to help me again etc. And dropped out of my life.\n\nThis is event happening in my life, and I just needed some time to get my thoughts straight.

She also works second shift at her job (3:00 PM -11:30 PM) while I’m on a more typical 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM. So she had planned on staying up until late last night so she wakes up late enough to leave today (November 20th) after her shift ends. \nOur typical routine is that I’ll stay up until she gets out of work and we’ll call/FaceTime so we can talk, which usually lasts until 12:00 AM or occasionally later than 12:30 AM. I wake up at 7:30 so I can get ready for work, so I’m I’m not getting an ideal amount of sleep but it’s kind of the only time we can actually talk instead of just text so I deal with it. \nWhen she called last night she lead off with asking when I planned on going to sleep, so I hesitantly said 12, which she said was fine and I should be assertive about it but also said she was disappointed because she had to stay up and would’ve liked to me to stay up with her to keep her company. \nWe talk until a little after 12 and she asks if I’m going to be going to bed and I say yes, which I probably wouldn’t have brought up for a little while if she hadn’t done it first (which is usually how our conversations end up going later than 12). She’s clearly upset by this but remembering that she has told me to be more assertive (more than just earlier, it’s a thing I need to work on) I tell her I love her, which she responds “whatever”, and after some silence I say goodnight, with the same response, and hang up and go to sleep after another pause. \nAITA for going to sleep and not staying up with her?

He told me when we cancelled our plans that he would take me out when we got back. I don't want to be insensitive or rude, but he hasn't brought it at all and I kind of would like to.

      "description": "I had a very close friend for 6 years, where we would see each other regularly, do activities, have dinners and get-togethers, and leaned on each other for support. Several months ago, he asked me if he could tell me something very personal, and that I would promise to not tell anyone else. I said yes. \n\nHe told me that he is being accused of sexually molesting his nephew many years ago as a child. Now his nephew (who is an adult) is threatening to go public with it. But because he is very close to his sister (his nephew's mom), his nephew will wait until his mother dies to go public. He was very upset that he would lose everything and we didn't talk about this for a few months. \n\nMy ex-friend has always been a very openly sexual person, but I never thought it would be possible for him to actually do this. But there was always this nagging voice in the back of my head that he may have. One day at dinner I asked him point blank to look me in the eye and tell me he did not do this. \n\nHe looked me in the eye and said \"it's complicated\". I felt a burning sensation in the depth of my stomach. We didn't talk for a month or two. In that time, my wife gave birth to our first kid. He came over to say hi and wanted to take pictures with the baby. I told him not to. \n\nAfter a few more months, I told him that we can no longer hang out. I also told him that I needed to tell my wife. He tried to convince me not to, but I didn't want to lie to my wife anymore on why we are not seeing our friend. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "Long time lurker first time poster.\n\nMy friends and I have a WhatsApp group as we’re spread around the country and use it as a convenient way to keep up with each other and general banter. In practice it amounts to sharing music, cheap jokes and idle chit chat\n\nThis fine afternoon, I received a “prank joke video” from a colleague with a misleading headline and seemingly innocent screen image. One of those videos that starts off normal enough and then, WHAM!, two old guys having at it with some good old fashion up close, cock up the bum action. Not exactly safe for work, shocking and for the most part, not exactly what you want to watch on your average day. Cheap chuckle. Flash my colleague on the other side of the office the stink eye and without thinking I forward the video to my friend WhatsApp group with the same misleading headline. \n\nWell! That was a mistake and all hell broke loose. Very long story short. Accusations of being anti-gay, denigrating homosexuals, lacking any kind empathy, being “psycho” and an immature dickhead (definitely immature). This got to the point where one friend threatened to never see me again. I definitely fanned the flames at first, trolled my friends and played devil’s advocate but realized quickly they were serious and perhaps some of the tongue in cheek comments were lost in text. I leveled with them and things sorta cooled off but with the demand to never make any such “joke” ever again.\n\nDespite all that, I’ll grant that it’s low brow humor, immature and ultimately disrespectful to someone who is LGBTQ. \n\nBut at the same token, there was no intent to disrespect, it’s a dark humor riff (but barely), there should be no sacred cows in “comedy” (though you should know your audience - my bad), and the reaction was way out of proportion to the minor slight.  For context, it’s four straight guys - all fairly liberal and got no problems LGBTQ (including myself).\n\nAre my friends overly sensitive or AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My sister gave birth to my niece about 9 months ago and since she's returned to work, my mom's been traveling an hour each way to her apartment to watch her granddaughter all day. They've negotiated the schedule down from 5 days a week to 3 days (my sister works from home one day and her husband another day). I'm due to give birth to my first-born next month and besides the initial few weeks of help, I don't (and would never) expect my mom to watch my baby for me for so long. Granted, I work more freelance from home and my sister works in a corporate office so that's more doable for me. However, my sister and brother-in-law are extremely comfortable financially and can easily afford daycare. They've been contemplating the idea but lagging on actually researching ones in their neighborhood. \n\nIn our last conversation, tensions rose when I told her directly that even if I didn't need our mom's help long-term, she should still enroll her daughter in daycare to spare our 70-year old mom from the trip and responsibility of childcare. Any new parent knows how exhausting it is to watch a baby an entire day alone so to expect free childcare from a grandparent seems selfish and cruel. I also think my mom's put in her time in raising my sister and I and should be enjoying her retirement now, not spending a 2-hour commute to another \"job.\" Maybe I would feel softer on the idea if they were in the same house OR if my sister was actually dropping my niece off and picking her up, but neither of those is the case. My sister made it clear that she would prefer my mom watch her daughter than put her in daycare. She also clearly didn't appreciate my thoughts and said pointedly that that decision was between her and our mom. I said childcare decisions should be between her and her husband, as my mom would never say no to anything they needed (even if it exhausts her). My husband thinks I may have overstepped my bounds as I can't make anyone do anything, just share my opinion. But this is my mom too! AITA?",

      "description": "So, for a bit of backstory, I'm a university student who is currently living on an on-campus apartment with a roommate I had not previously met before moving in. Everything was going fine the first semester, although there was a slight (but tolerable) odor coming from somewhere in the room.\n\nFast forward to this semester, and I noticed the smell was getting stronger, and i realized that it smelled especially bad after she showered. It seemed like the smell was coming from her towel, and it then clicked- everytime she would leave the dorm on the weekends (I always stayed), she would bring her laundry bag with her, but her towel was never included. Even over winter break, the towel was just hanging, folded up on a hanger by the rest of her clothes.\n\nAfter a few weeks of trying to deal with the smell, I decided I should just let her know. I said something along the lines of \"Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Lately, I've noticed a smell in the room, and I think it might be coming from your towel...\"  She didn't take it well; she got very defensive and said she didn't smell-- even though i never said she smelled, just that it might be her towel.\n\nSince then, she's been completely silent with me, as well as being very petty/passive aggressive--slamming the doors/coming in the room just to turn on the light and leave while I'm asleep (she knows I'm a very light sleeper). \n\nAnd then today--I woke up this morning and saw her portable heater on in the room, but she was not there. There have been several occasions where she's turned on the heater and just left the apartment, so I decided to turn it off. Turns out she was just in the bathroom, and when she came back to the room, she was angry and said \"please don't touch my belongings.\" I said \"okay, but you turned it on and then left, and it was starting to smell kinda smoky\" (not like burning, but like an overheated-plastic kinda smell). This turned into an argument between the two of us, where she repeatedly said \"I don't touch your belongings, so don't touch mine\" and eventually lead to her calling several people to complain about me, and even called the campus police, saying i was touching her belongings (although avoiding saying what \"belongings\" it was that I touched). I did not wait for the campus police as I had class, and didn't want to stay in the same room as the roommate who had just previously called someone (before the cops) to tell them that she wanted to choke me--while I was still in the room--because I was \"pushing her too far.\" \n\nSo, am I the crazy one here? AITA for turning off her heater? Or for telling her that the room smelled bad?\n\n(Also, first time reddit poster!-- and on I'm on mobile, so I had some issues and you might noticed I submitted/deleted this several times..)",

I think she's being unfair in trying to deny me this opportunity that she had.\n\n\nBoth our parents are coming over to help her during the first few months. The father of the child is also committed to helping financially. She argued that both our parents are elderly and would not be of much help. But I don't feel like that's my problem to solve. I've been looking at some affordable domestic workers/hired help to do the household chores so that she can focus on the baby but she shot that suggestion down because she doesn't want to pay extra for outside help. She would rather make me miserable for free. I arranged the baby shower that she complained was too small. I know she's family. It's duty. I don't want my future nephew to suffer. Etc. But I do want to go on this full vacation.\n\nSo AITA for choosing to go on a vacation instead of staying behind to help her with her infant? ",

      "description": "So, quick backstory. I suspect this girl has always kind of disliked me I don’t really know why, maybe she finds me annoying? What will happen is that I ask her the most mundane questions and she kind of snaps at me.  i.e. \n\nme: have you watched xxx show\nHer: *angrily* No\n\nMe: *walks up to talk to a friend she’s talking to* Hey (friend’s name) \nHer: Uhm can you please not interrupt me when I’m speaking (this one is kind of on me for interrupting her, but she didn’t have to snap at me, and I didn’t even know she was talking because she was so quiet.)\nMe: sorry *walks away*\n\nSo what happened this time was she was talking to the same friend again and my friend was kind of giving her a pep talk for the musical she was about to do saying stuff like “you’ll do great” and “you’re so amazing” she then turns to my friend and says “k thanks. So as a joke I said “wow you just K’d her” and she turns to me and says, “Mind your own business.” Now this didn’t really bother me as I’m used to her saying things like that, but then my friend turned and looked at me and said “(my name) chill out.” And I don’t know what it was, but the way she said it made me feel really bad. So what I want to know is did making that joke make the the bad guy? Was I annoying? She may have also been upset about something and that’s why she was getting the pep talk, but she didn’t look upset, but if she was I know that instantly makes me the asshole. Thanks\n",

      "description": "First post on mobile, sorry for formatting;\nI am a cashier at a big box hardware store with 3 checkout locations (SCO- self checkout, PRO- customer loading area, and GARDEN- outdoor garden). I have an anxiety disorder which makes me go into crying fits when too overwhelmed, and this is a thing all of my coworkers know. I told my interviewer about them, told my direct supervisor about them, told all the cashiers i work with about them. I don't get them often and I'm very vocal about when I feel one coming along and if I need someone to cover me while I ride the attack out in a back office. Most of the time when i have an attack at work i call out the next day due to exaustion and the risk of triggering another anxiety attack, but came in today because i knew no one could cover my shift.\n\nSCO is a major stressor for my anxiety because our checkouts are designed for small items and small purchases, which is the opposite of what most customers have. These are shit machines and I cover all 4 of them. With our busy season starting, I get left alone during rush times and can't rely on getting any backup since, you know, it's rush time. PRO, on the other hand, is relatively slow and is a normal register so it's made for larger purchases. There is a lot of down time between customers so busy work can get done.\n\nI had an attack yesterday at work. It was bad enough I got sent home early despite not having another cashier to cover me. I'm still exhausted and my supervisor, let's call him E, from yesterday was surprised to see me come in (because I usually call out). I told E it shouldn't be too bad today as long as i could get away from SCO, and he told me i was free to switch as long as I got the PRO cashier to agree to switch.\n\nPRO cashier is this girl I'll call N. N has autism and doesn't like how hands on SCO is and does not like interacting with customers (she will ignore and avoid them). I asked her if she would switch and i told her about the anxiety attack, and she said no. Specifically, she did that wince and sucking in air thing before saying \"I don't really like self checkout, and im scheduled down here all day...\" I know a no when i see one and I say okay and go back to SCO. Obviously it's not that okay.\n\nThis really upsets me because I've had anxiety attacks around her before and she was nice to me then, and I've switched registers with her before because i knew she didn't like SCO. In the last 4 hours at SCO, I've had to walk away three times to keep myself from having another anxiety attack, and seeing her do nothing down at PRO makes me incredibly mad. I managed to trade with the garden cashier so I'm finally able to calm down, and now I feel guilty for being upset with N for not switching.\n\n",

I let my self in, find the room and notice a strange smell.

      "description": "Backstory: my sis in law and I haven’t always seen eye to eye. My niece, “L” was the only child in the family for a long time and she was the center of everyone’s world. Cue me getting pregnant with my daughter “B” and having her 2 days before L turned 3. Christmas was the next week and they spent it with us. L was being a typical 3 year old - getting into stuff, whining, tantrums, etc. Sis in law told me that it was because she wasn’t getting the  attention from me that she usually gets. She asked if I’d take L on a day date, just the 2 of us because she was feeling jealous. I said no because I was recovering from a really traumatic labor and taking care of a newborn baby. Sis in law got mad, Christmas dinner fight, the whole shebang. Anyway, that was 4 years ago and it’s the same thing, constantly. L is feeling jealous of my daughter, B. Sis in law doesn’t think that L gets enough attention. \n\nBecause Bs birthday is so close to Christmas and we always had something going on, we never had a big birthday party for her. Just cake and a few balloons on her birthday. L has always had huge Pinterest inspired parties and I’ve only missed one of them because my mom had to be admitted to the hospital the day of and I was the one who took her. Anyway, this year B turned 4 and wanted a party with all of her friends. I scheduled it for beginning of December so all of her friends could come and it didn’t interfere with holiday stuff. Everything went great, B had a great time. Sis in law has decided against a birthday party this year for L because they’re taking her out of town next month for a big celebration. \n\nYesterday was my daughters actual birthday and even though we already celebrated with a birthday party, I still wanted to make it special for her. We had a full day planned: breakfast at her favorite spot, movie, manicure then home to get ready for a Christmas party with some close friends at our house. Sis in law calls me. She’s decided that L does need a birthday party and it’s going to be that night (last night). I told her that we couldn’t make it because (1) we had plans and (2) it’s my daughters birthday, not hers and I don’t think it’s fair that my daughter has to share her special day.\n\nSis in law called me multiple times during our Christmas party, niece called multiple times and left messages, asking why we weren’t there. I feel guilty now that I didn’t even make an attempt to go but I’m upset because I feel like my sis in law scheduled her party on my daughters birthday on purpose. \n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like an asshole. ",

I bought her cheap ticket in the stadium and we just stood in the back or I shared my seat with her. \n\nDuring this off-season, she insisted that she join in on the season tickets so she could come to every game. Before purchasing her a season ticket right next to the group (we have 5 seats in row, so I was just going to buy the 6th), I asked the group if they minded if my wife joined in on the crew. One of the responses I received (mind you this was from the best man at my wedding) was that \"the only reason he buys these tickets is get some guy time in, and that every other day of the year he is with his wife and kids, sorry buddy\"\n\nAfter this response, I didn't push the subject. I went and started my own account and bought seats 6-7 in the same row. Now he is saying why did I bother asking if I was just going to ignore the responses anyways. I didn't ignore them, I left the group account and started my own account.\n\nAm I being an asshole here or is he being unreasonable?",

      "description": "I work six days next week, meaning today is my only day off. I work around 10 hours a day and its physically demanding. Typically I'm so exhausted afterwards that I quite literally go to to the second I get home.\n\nSo last night I get home and my mother calls me and says.. \"Remember how we said we were going to have a family dinner once a month?\" And I reply with \"sure but why are you saying this all weirdly?\" The way she was asking it told me I wasnt going to like what she was about to say.\n\nSo she goes well were going to \"Janes\" house for the dinner. And I said well that's more than an hour away, and I work Monday and I would like to have a day to myself to relax and recuperate from my work week. Because in this instance they want me to ride with them, and I will absolutely be there all day.\n\nKeep in mind I had zero knowledge of this happening until last night, right when I got home after work  before the start of my day off. So they (my mother and her wife) proceed to guilt trip me by saying \"I'll be gone one day then you'll have plenty of time to yourself.\"\n\nWell guilt trips dont work on me and I'm used to my mother guilt tripping me, she has done it my entire life and I hate it. So I told her I'm not going because I worked my ass off all week and I deserve a day to myself. Promptly told them that they made me feel like a shitty person and that I was going to bed.\n\nSo a little context here is that no one listed here is blood family except for my mother. Her wife has two daughters similar in age to me. They got together when I was a sophomore in highschool and to be honest we have never acted like family. I feel like I tried to get closer to the younger sister who is the same age as me, at the very beginning.. But she wasnt very receptive to me and I gave up.\n\nNow all of a sudden they're wanting to act like family and to be honest I just want to go live my life without them. My mother is my family and that's it  I can spend time with her. And it doesn't need to involve everyone else, as well as my entire only day off.",

      "description": "So I graduated high school last May, and I quickly moved out of the house. I felt as though I needed to grow up and there was too much going on at my moms house for me to be able to focus on work and going to school. So I celebrated with my mom, her boyfriend, and his kids the day before my birthday. Then yesterday (my birthday is on Valentine’s Day) I went to work 8-5 had the night off from school, so I decided to celebrate just me and my girlfriend and treat her to a night out and celebrate my birthday with just her. So this morning on my way to work, my mom texted me this long paragraph about how on grateful I am and how she can’t believe I didn’t see her for my birthday and how I did the same thing at Christmas (at Christmas we celebrated before Christmas Day, so I went to a buddy’s house). She doesn’t try to plan anything with me so I am assume she doesn’t want to do anything so I go hang out and do something. Am I the asshole in the situation or is she overreacting? ",

      "description": "Me (M20) and my girlfriend (F19) have been in a relationship for a little over 4 years now. We’re both attending college about an hour train ride away from one another and make it a point to see each other at least 3 nights a week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday or Sunday) and I always spend the night at her place because she has a cat to care for. \n\nLast Saturday I had made plans to compete in the Nintendo Super Smash Bros Online tournament, and not knowing how long it would take, decided to make plans with my girlfriend to see each other the following day to watch the Super Bowl at my place and then go back to her place after. The tournament ends earlier than I expected it to, and I check my phone to see a text from a friend of mine who’s a girl. She wants to know if I’d go with her to the grand opening of a Milkbar (really good ice cream) in the Harvard area. I say yes, swing by her dorm, and we take the train over together. I’ll preface by saying this before any comments ask: I’m not attracted to this girl, at all, but we have great conversations and I don’t have very many other friends at college besides my suitemates. \n\nIt hasn’t crossed my mind to tell my girlfriend where I’m going or who I’m with, as we’re on the train we just send snaps of our faces back and forth. When we get to the Harvard stop I get a snap asking where I was, I respond that I’m going to the Milkbar opening. She follows up asking if I’m going “alone?” I respond with a snap of me and my friend smiling. \n\nWe get in line for the opening and my girlfriend starts sending snap after snap, berating me that I’m “Okay waiting in line for the Milkbar for hours but won’t go to the art museum with her” or “Can do that but act annoyed about going in with her to Forever 21.” Earlier in the week she asked if I wanted to go to the local Art Museum with her on Saturday and I said no because I wasn’t sure how long the Saturday tournament would last for. The Forever 21 thing is true though, I hate going into that store for upwards of an hour.\n\nWhile we’re in line I tell my friend about how my girlfriend is jealous, and she comments about how that’s kinda crazy and I should dump her. I defend her, saying that she’s not always like this and how there’s more to our relationship than just this one instance. But as the snaps keep coming in, it becomes apparent that reasoning with my girlfriend was an impossible\ntask and I eventually stop answering altogether. \n\nFlash forward to today and me and my gf are fine now, but this isn’t the first time something like this has happened with her getting unreasonably jealous whenever I decide to hang out with a friend who’s a girl.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: Hung out with a friend who’s a girl, didn’t tell my gf until we were already hanging out, gf got very upset",

I was diagnosed with testicular cancer in September. Went through chemo in November. She broke up with me in December because of “how I treated her.” \n\nI called out her character and told her straight up that I thought it was shitty that I didn’t get a visit after surgery or during chemo. Not just no visit, but she expected me to drive 5 hours to visit her both two weeks before chemo started and again a week after it was over. That’s what led to the break up. I basically said “hey, we have different views here. You have no idea what I had to go through and sorry but cancer and it’s treatment should be more important than your med school.” She didn’t think that I was being considerate of the stress she was under while I was undergoing an immense amount of stress and shock. \n\nI understand med school is difficult, but I expected a little bit of care from her. We just finally cut ties today after she finally gave me a chance to talk to her after she broke up with me via text in late December. \n\nAITA for thinking that my situation was more dire and required more support than her medical school?",

I just got a message from her saying we all owed her $38 for the gifts she ended up compiling ($228 total). None of us got a say in what she bought, she just rocked up with gifts to surprise them and we all kinda just played along like we had this all planned out. \n\nI live alone, I pay all of my own bills, I’m in debt (car loan), $38 is me eating for a week and a half. One of my other coworkers has two kids that just started a new school and she’s just had to pay thousands of dollars for their tuition, uniforms etc, the others (like myself) just started university and have just spent hundreds on textbooks. None of us were never consulted about a budget, she just spent a bunch of cash, gave us a lame “oops!

      "description": "This needs a bit of backstory. My gf got a new apartment from her parents. They asked her to pick stuff for renovation since it was empty - no floor, doors, blinds on windows, no kitchen or bathroom, no lights besides single lightbulbs on wire, nothing. That was about 6-7 months ago. \n\nI moved in about 4-5 months ago. The deal was she focuses on her studies and house, and I help decide on things and look for work since it was a new city. At first I was more at home, so I was cleaning and dealing with her \"student-life\" way of forgetting small things. She's a great girl, but very quiet when problems or decisions arise, so it was getting harder to talk  about the state of the apartment. When I moved in, only the bathroom was done, since her mother urged her to pick one - back then it seemed very harsh and pushy, but the bathroom was nice.\n\nI decided to never push her about things, since at most I thought with both of us it might take a bit more time, but be less stressful. I'm here half a year later and nothing was done. It's her apartment and her parents told her they will pay for renovation, and since she's a student I pay the bills so it's easier on her overall. It's her last year and she had a ton of free time to either work on her degree or the house.\n\nWindow blinds I put in only a week ago, myself, since she couldn't decide on paying someone, and there were non commercially available for our big main window. It can't have blinds and we finally decided on curtains, it took is months. Doors we ordered only 3 months after I moved in and it took another 3 months for them to get here, we'll have them installed in a week, and we ordered them only after visiting the same place few times and always having the same conversation. We had 3 months to paint the hallway before the door came and she didn't decide on any color. No wall is painted in the entire apartment. We have no kitchen since she can't decide on furniture, we visited the same places and always nothing moved, I made a 3d kitchen plan on IKEA's program to show her parents at least something. We sleep on a couch I took with me when moving here, since no bedroom. We only have desks and chairs to work on PCs at home because I didn't want to leave the shop without picking any. And I refuse to put in the money for renovation (besides some smaller things here and there) since it's her apartment and her parents are willing to help her so she can have a nice start (and I help by paying the bills at least). I just think they might get mad at her at some point.\n\nI love her. I do. She's now feeling awful after another of our arguments about the entire thing. Am I the asshole for telling her all this and that she has to make up her mind, since she neither focuses on her degree and is paralyzed when has to work on it nor does she do anything with the house? Am I the bad guy for going mad from living without blinds, doors, and a kitchen?",

      "description": "So some background info, I’m 21year old female and have been with my 21 year old boyfriend for 5 years. On Monday I got a tattoo of an outline of a jasmine flower tattooed on my upper left side(completely hidden pretty much unless I turn and lift my arm) since it’s has a significant meaning to me. It’s the national flower of my country and my sisters name is jasmine. \n\nAnyway, I tell my boyfriend after the fact and he starts attacking me and the tattoo, saying I should have gotten something more artistic and tattoos should be pretty and nice for people to look at. So obviously this is my first tattoo and I feel like shit about it and I keep getting his negative thoughts about it so I lie(I know i should) and tell him it was only temporary and his smile reached ear to ear. So I’m like whatever. Anyway today I tell him the truth because like wtf and because I was really liking the tattoo today. And he hangs up in my face and starts yelling at me about it again. Now we just got into another fight and again he repeated his points about how it looks like marker and that a kid drew it. And who gets an outline?\n\nBut the his whole point is that he accepted my tattoo, which he really didn’t. And that I shouldn’t have lied to him about it, which is a mistake on my part but all in all, AITA? \n\nTl;dr: I got a tattoo that my boyfriend thinks looks like shit and I lied about it being fake to get him off my back. Now he says everything would have been fine if I didn’t lie? ",

So the whole time we're walking home I'm trying not to freak out, but he's spending the whole time being fucking annoying with it, asking me if I know the guy who went up to us and when I claimed I've never seen him before he would ask if I'm sure 100 times. He kept trying to make connections to us and the guy, it wasn't helping. Anyway, we get home and I go into the room and close the window Because well, of some person is out there robbing people, why take my chances and give them a direct way into my home. My boyfriend got pissed because he was hot and doesn't like sleeping with the window close because it's uncomfortable for him. But I don't want to take the chance and possibly get put in danger having it open while we're not paying attention or sleeping. I suggested that we turn the cooler on and keep the window closed tonight because I was uncomfortable with it open while I slept. He got mad and asked me why I was so scared and adamant about having it closed. He claims the only reason why I would be that insistent on it is if I KNEW someone was out there and I knew something he didn't. I convinced him finally to allow me to close the window but he was angry because the cooler costs money and I am overreacting. ",

      "description": "This happened during an assignment we had to do a couple semesters ago. We are put into groups of 6 and have to come up with a concept and working prototype of a computer program, in our case, an interactive calendar.\n\nSo, we literally have 5 weeks to do this assignment. Its plenty of time, theres no reason it cant be done. So our group meets and we dole the work out between all 6 people. Theres not much work to do, its literally maybe 4-5 hours each. We work out what classes, functions everyone has to write.\n\nThis is where everything seems to go to shit. One group member, lets call him A doesnt finish his assigned tasks. The problem is this program is so small, it really cant be tested until all parts are complete, except for unit testing of functions. A's excuse is he cant figure out how to do it, he is incredibly lost. At first, we try to help, even basically writing one of his two classes for him, walking him through past assignments. At this point, A should be good. The other class uses similar functions and we have learned what these functions need to do in previous courses.\n\nA still cant do it.\n\nWere now 3 weeks until deadline. We dont even have a functioning prototype of the program and we still have to design a GUI and hook the backend into the GUI. We spend another meeting basically walking A through his other class and his functions. Another group member shares with me after the second meeting that this isnt fair anymore and that weve been paired with someone who cant actually program. I feel the same way but what can we do?\n\nBecause we have basically hand held programmed two classes for A, we ask A to do the mock up design report for the wireframes for the app (basically drawings that show the basic app layout). This is possibly the only part of the assignment A does, but, he draws them in a skecthbook, they need to be in digital format (not scanned, using any program, even powerpoint).\n\nA declares he has done his part, someone else gets to translate them to powerpoint. Except that it was agreed A does the whole section of the project since hes doing no programming in a programming class. A absolutely refuses, say were dumping \"all the work\" on him and we have to do it. Another group member finally reneges, and translates the paper drawn wireframes using inDesign.\n\nA also believes he doesnt have to help with the front end GUI because he did the wireframes. Theres a bit of argument, but in the end A walks and tells us they are done and we get the rest.\n\nWe finish the GUI, the program works and we have to write a written report on who did what, with all group members signing the report. I write the \"who did what\" and very much emphasize A has done next to no personal programming on the assignment and only drew the wireframes on his own. A is furious and wont sign it. He wants full credit for their programming.\n\nAt this point myself and another group member basically say we will pull the wireframes from the project, submit it and tell the teacher he has done no work (because if we dont submit the one thing they did, they havent contributed). A basically says he will go to the registrar if we do. We go to the teacher and explain the situation, even admitting they did the wireframe portion but no coding. The teacher basically tells us that if every group member, other then A, signs the doc and everything (including wireframes is submitted), A will only get marks for the wireframes. So if the wireframes are absolutely perfect A will get 10/100. Teacher does advise that A may have an academic integrity case against us if we pull his wireframes and submit without him because he did \"sit in while you coded his code parts\". But the teacher wont give him marks if he cant do even simple functions himself.\n\nAbout a day before the assignment is due, we tell A were submitting without his signature on the \"who did what\" report. But we will submit his wireframes. A doesnt bother responding.\n\nFrom what I heard, A got 7/100 (7%) on the assignment. We ended up with a 77%. A appealed the grade and they ended up giving him 25% on the assignment. (found this out through a mutual friend).\n\nIm putting it down, Am I the Asshole in this situation, should I just have let it slide?",

      "description": "Hey, here's the context\n\nSo I(16M)'m in an organization called deca. I could go on as far as what it's about but that would waste time. Anyway in deca, there are 2 competitions: state and national (aka ICDC). To go to icdc, you have to place top 3 in your event. So Oklahoma deca was last tuesday and wednesday (last week feb 11 or something)  and I got 1st in my event. That friday, our deca advisor (or teacher) said to begin to decide whether or not we're going (total cost is about 1200). \n\nThe next week, on monday feb 18th, I had no school due to school district thing that was scheduled in beginning of year. That night at 11 pm, (i was sleeping), our teacher sends the permission form via email to those who are qualified to go to icdc (as well as parent info form)\n \nDue to an expected snowstorm, our school closes on tuesday feb 19. The advisor then sends messages via remind that she needs those forms signed and a pic sent to her. I would have done it, but I dont have a printer and my parents were working. I thought I could just bring it to her thr next day.\n\nHowever, she sends a message at 2:54 pm saying that she needs the pic at 5pm, 2 hrs away or else we couldn't go to icdc. I text her that i dont have a printer, and she responds with 1. Why did it take u all day to respond and 2. She needs something from my parents saying that i am committing to go and that they are committed to paying the cost (im paying the whole myself).\n\nSo I frantically call my mom to send her an email. She does around 4:10 ish. Afterwards, the advisor says she is still awaiting to get the permission form (I thought she said the email was needed in place of the form). \n\nSo the next morning, I go to give the advisor the form. She scolds me for taking forever to respond and also for making her go over an hour. My mom is mad at me for waiting until last minute to do this.\n\nNow before you put YTA, i would just like to say a few things.\n1. The form was given and due in less than 24 hrs (11 pm to 5pm)\n2. The parent info form says all paperwork needs to be in by feb 21st, \n3. I couldnt do anything until the next day anyway (no printer/parent).\n\n\n",

I asked him \"what are you thinking\", because he also shuts me out when he's thinking. He did not respond. to me, these seem like signs for me to leave him alone. Apparently not. \n\nI did not comfort him. He did not tell me what he wanted. I told him why I was upset. He still refused to tell me what he was thinking about or what he was feeling, other than I should have hugged him and said are you ok. He said \"will you support me if I don't tell you anything\". That was his hint that he wanted me to give him hugs. I took it in a different way (support as in yea I'm ok with you not telling me, but it would be nice). \n\nI feel like if he told me what he was feeling, and asked for what he wanted, it would be a lot easier to help him. It just feels like he doesn't trust me with his feelings.\n\nI'm kinda frustrated, so I can't tell if I'm the asshole.\n\nThanks guys.",

      "title": "AITA for dating a girl that my friend has a crush on?",
      "description": "A few months ago (during the first term of our my freshman year of college), I met a girl who I was really attracted to, but was soon informed that two of my close friends also liked her. It seemed like the situation was putting a lot of stress on their friendship, so I decided not to tell anyone (aside from my dad) how I was feeling, as to avoid drama. A lot of time passed, and neither of my friends made a move, while she and I became pretty close friends. When we flew home for the holidays, we texted all the time, and even skyped a few times. Despite this, I didn't think she was romantically interested in me, and part of me hoped that she would start dating one of my other friends, and everything would blow over. On a few occasions I pushed my friends to tell her how they were feeling so that the situation could be over with. A few weeks ago, though, she confessed to me in private that she had feelings for me. I, not thinking, kissed her in that moment. That night, she said that she'd like to date me, and I concurred, but said that I'd have to talk to my friends before we made anything official.\n\nI talked to both of my friends one on one. The first friend told me that he had moved on to someone else, and that he didn't care what I did with her. The second friend told me that while he was sad that she wasn't interested in him, he wouldn't hold it against me if I started going out with her, and that he would do the same thing. So, following my heart, I took her to go bowling, and we've been dating for almost a month now. \n\nA lot of people (external from the situation) seem to be really mad at me, and tell me that I'm a bad friend for doing what I'm doing. It seems crazy to me to not date someone you know has mutual feelings for you, but what do you think? \n\nAm I The Asshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA for denying someone a trip to Japan",
      "description": " So there's a bit to unpack here. A couple of friends and I are planning a trip to Japan. We are going to be nine people and we are leaving in about a year. Since we are so many people Pete (not his real name) and I are spearheading this operation. We are doing most of the planning and we've both spent many hours trying to find the best and cheapest to exist over there. I've set up a financial plan and everything including a very basic to do list while we're there. We even had a PowerPoint presentation that we showed the group to make sure everyone has a basic idea what they need and what will happen when we are there. We are the leaders of this group. This will become important later.\n\nSo with all that laid out I can introduce you to Jay (again, not his real name). I've known Jay since ninth grade. We've always gotten along with one another but over the past few years that's started to change. The more I watch and listen to him interact with other people the more I realize he's kind of a bully. He treats others (especially people he doesn't know) like shit and takes tremendous pleasure from ruining other peoples days. He loves to talk shit and tilts anyone playing video games with him. Now I have to say that I fucking love banter. I love talking shit to my friends and them doing the same back. That's just how we show affection. But there's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it. Jay does both. If you stand up for yourself and fire back, he only ever uses light-hearted banter against you. But if you don't and you're too nice to say anything back then he loves to tear into you. And hard. Most of us fight back against Jays comments but one guy in our group doesn't. His name is Pat (I think you get it by now).\n\nPat is a super awesome guy who never really talks shit and is generally just a good dude. But this means that Jay loves to really tear into him. Whenever we play CSGO Jay blames almost everything on Pat and really tries to drive home the fact he is better and Pat is a waste of space (his own words). The more we played the more toxic he got until one night after a game he wanted share a \"meme\" he made so he posts it in the text channel (We use discord to talk). The \"meme\" had the caption \"Can you tell the difference between these pictures?\" with the left side being a picture of Pat and the right side saying \"a failed abortion.\" We tell him that it really wasn't funny and Pat deleted it. Jay then posts it again. Pat deletes it. Jay then spams that \"meme\" as fast as he can. After about 10 to 15 minutes of trying to delete these posts Pat leaves and Jay bursts out laughing. When I ask him why he's laughing he comes back with \"that pussy just couldn't handle it.\" I get really angry with him and chew him out for being a bully. I leave the call and text Pat to say sorry for not sticking up for him earlier and to see if he was okay. He was genuinely distraught and felt like shit. Since then I've been sure to shut Jay up anytime he even talks to Pat since Pat doesn't really like him. That was first big incident.\n\nThe second incident came a week after when Pete and I were discussing Airbnbs. Pete, Jay, Pat, a few others going on the trip, and I were all in a call. We asked the others to ask questions but if they didn't have anything constructive to say they should keep it to themselves. Halfway through the discussion Jay sends us a link to an airbnb in Beverly Hills saying that it's only $5000 a night and we should do this if Japan doesn't work out. We kind of dismiss the idea and tell him that this is 100% happening. He then proceeds to send us more Airbnbs from all over LA that are $5000 per night or more. He interrupts us multiple times and really wants us to change subject to his idea. Pete then tells him that no one cares and if Jay doesn't be quiet he'll server mute him. Jay then says \"well i don't care what you guys are talking about.\" Pete then server mutes him and Jay leaves the server. Not just disconnects from the call but leaves the whole server so hard that he has to get an invite to be allowed back in. 30 minutes later he asks for an invite back into the server and wants all his admin privileges back. We let him back in but give him no privileges. His comment about not caring really hurt Pete and me. Both of us are putting in hours upon hours of research in where to go, what to see, who to meet, etc. We are learning to be conversationally fluent in Japanese by the time we get there so the rest of the group can just relax when they they are there. We both want this trip to be amazing for everyone and hearing him dismiss all of that effort really hurt.\n\nPete and I were pretty done with his bullying and disregard for this trip so we decided we were going to talk to Jay. We didn't want to immediately kick him out the trip so we came up with a list of things he needed to change if he wanted to go on this trip.\n\n1. He's needs to stop bullying people\n2. He needs to understand that we will \"ambassadors of the US\" while we are there so we cannot be rude\n3. He needs to cut the childish behavior like in with the Airbnb fiasco\n4. He needs to learn how to not wake up after 3 PM everyday\n\nWe meet him in person and talk to him about this. We make sure to not bring up Pat and how he feels so the bully so it doesn't get worse. He really didn't seem like he was paying attention but he repeated most of things back to us so i don't know. Pete and I decided that we would see how he acts at the upcoming PowerPoint presentation.\n\nThe presentation is the same one I told you guys about in the beginning. Just basic, but very important, information about the trip. Jay was on his phone the whole time. Never looked up once. Kind of hurt.\n\nAt this point we don't know if we are going to not let him join us. He has definitely limited the bullying but he seems totally not interested in this trip at all and still has his childish outbursts. I don't want to tell him he can't go because I believe traveling is the best way to spend your money and broaden your perspective but it seems like we might have to. I want everyone else to have a good time and I don't know if that would happen if he came along. Would we be the assholes if we told him he couldn't go?\n\nTLDR; My friends and I are going to Japan but one of us is a bully. He calls another friend a \"failed abortion\" and \"a waste of space.\" He has also shown disinterest in the trip and my effort to make this trip happen. We gave him a chance to change but he hasn't really. ",

My oldest brother is gay so she knows the only kids she’s getting out of him is via surrogate or adopting. (He’s already voiced his opinion on not planning on having kids while he’s in college with no place of his own)\n\nMy sister can’t have babies so same goes for her. \n\nToday, at the dinner table, the discussion of babies come up. Everyone talks about when they plan to start having kids and majority of them says when they’re financially stable. My mom asked me, “well, OP when are you going to give me BIOLOGICAL grandchildren since -brother- and -sister- won’t be providing me any”. I’m 16. \n\nI tell her i’m not even needing to think about that kind of thing. At this point I was a little pissed off so i told her to basically shut up about me even having kids cause I really don’t see myself wanting any at all. At that point she gets up and storms off calling me selfish for depriving her of being a grandmother and having biological grandkids. \n\nI feel like I could’ve dealt with it a better way but she really pissed me off.

      "description": "17 years together, 11 married, and a 4 year old daughter. He has struggled with depression forever. It's cyclical and he has ok times and REALLY bad times. He wont get therapy or meds. It seems worse in the winter.\n\nOur marriage has never been great, he's always hurt me by never putting me first, not showing me love, having a short fuse with me to the degree I ignore most things because I hate making him angry and stirring the pot. When he gets angry he shuts me out for days, barely speaks to me, sits on the computer for any moment he's not working, etc.\n\nIt got so bad last year that I moved out at the end of August. I stayed with my parents for awhile but In November, he was STILL unwilling to make any changes...all of our talks were getting no where. I finally found a very small and cheap apartment that didn't require a lease or deposit so I figured it was perfect to not be so crowded with my parents, and have a space of my own. When I told him I found a place, he got so angry and swore he'd never give me money, he'd rather take all our savings (30k+ I think, he won't tell me how much) and bury it in the back yard and off himself than see me get any money of \"his\" (All our assets are \"his\" because he has contributed most of money during our marriage). I got so hurt and upset and told him I needed just a bit because I was paying all of the childcare out of MY paycheck as well. He said he'd give me $250 a month and that was it (he makes 60k, I make 27k). I asked for a small chunk ($1000) to get started since I had literally nothing but my clothes to bring with me. He was not budging but I kept persisting and he finally said \"do I need to pay you to leave this house? FINE I'll give you the money.\"\n\nThe next day he apologized for how he acted the previous night and gave me the money and said he would go to couple's therapy with me finally.\n\nNow, we've been in counseling since Mid-December and its improving. We have been spending a lot more time together, he's been more respectful, better with our daughter, better with not being on the computer so much, etc. I'd been planning on moving back home very soon!\n\nIn the past 10 or so days he seems to have hit another major down and has totally shut me out again. Barely any contact for days, nothing nice, got ANGRY at me for sleeping/watching tv all night long after having surgery that day and wouldn't speak to me for DAYS after that, etc.\n\nI know his depression is a sickness. It makes me feel really torn on what to do. If he was a jerk I wouldn't feel so bad. I know not all of it can be helped. I do love him. But my stress this past week has been through the roof. I feel sick all the time, my chest is tight, stomachs a mess.\n\nDo I need to give him more time, more help? I wish he'd see a therapist or get some meds but he won't. I don't know how else to support him...when is it enough?",

I had one headphone in and I was really trying to listen, but he wouldn’t stop talking. So I cut him off and said “hey man, I really don’t care I’m not religious” and he said “it’s not religion it’s about your soul” and we just went back and forth until I yelled at him to leave me alone. My manager came over and we separated.\n\nlater he said ,out of nowhere, “me comprende, you comprende ok?” And I feel like he’s mad but, He’s acting ok, yet I  feel like I was being a dick? I told him to stop talking to me and he kept going on and on and I couldn’t take it! I haven’t apologized yet.",

However, a majority of the time I will tell them that their papers are fine, even if I find multiple mistakes, because I just don't want to take the time to correct them.

      "description": "So I live with 2 roomates, A couple. They have 2 pets, one dog, and one cat.\n\nI came home at 3am from a tinder hook up, singing to myself with a snack in my hands. I notice a fluffy thing on the floor above me and think its someone walking their dog. I stop singing because idk strangers at 3 probably dont want to hear you sing? \n\nI had a weird feeling about it, back up, and it's this sweet and fluffy cat coming down the stairs to me. Me being the person I am, ofc I want to help this little dude out. I have 10 years experience with an animal shelter and gave been fostering a good chunk of that since I lived with my mom who ran the shelter. My experience kicks in, I bring it inside, put her in the bathroom and go to my roommates room to inform them of the situation. I ask for a cup of food as I dont own a cat and am getting food after work for the kitty.\n\nThey complain a little, say sure. Cool I feel good, gonna go micro chip scan this cutie after work and hopefully find an owner, if not I know where to surrender for no kill. And if not that, vax and keep my first pet. \n\nI get to work this morning and they both blow up my phone for me being disrespectful to them and saying how I endangered their pets lives. Which I can understand... however they have refused to vaccinate their dog and cat for over 2 months because one of them doesnt have the money to split the vet bill in half, the other got a huge lump some of money from deceased relative and doesnt work.\n\nThey continue to claim the stray cat is going to give their pets diseases and continue to say how I dont love animals and am selfish and how dare I bring this creature into the home. \n\nI separated the cat, no contact at all or shared litter box. I've dealt with this situation before, except my pets were vaccinated.\n\nI text the one roommate who sits at home and plays games all day that it's their responsibility to vax their animals and cannot put them getting sick solely on me. Probably our worst fight ever.\nI accuse them of not being financially prepared or caring enough to vax their pets to keep them healthy and that exchange lasts a long time of us going back and forth constantly about who is wrong.\n\nI just wanted to help a cat out.\n\nTLDR; I brought home strat cat. Lazy roommate who has unvaxed animals berates me for endangering their animals. AITA?",

      "description": "I have a group of HS friends that I keep in contact with. 3 girls (including me) and 2 boys. We talked throughout college (we all went separate places) and was able to all meet up a few days ago in Japan for the first time in over 5 years. It was great! We had a lot of fun catching up and hanging out.\n\nWe're all on different schedules right now since we're all doing our own things. My vacation time was over, so I left first and the rest of the group was able to meet up a few more times.\n\nThe 2 other girls and I have our own separate group chat. In it they told me that the 2 boys admitted to cheating on their gfs. One went on an overnight trip with a different girl behind his gf's back. The other basically has 2 girlfriends who obviously don't know about each other. My girl friends said the boys weren't necessarily bragging about cheating, but would deny or change the topic if the 2 girls in our groups called them out for cheating.\n\nWithout going into boring details, life turned out so that I will probably be able to meet those 2 boys again in the near future. But now that I know they're openly(?) cheating on their girlfriends, I don't want to maintain my friendships with them. I dunno, it just makes me uncomfortable. What I specifically want to do is to never schedule time to see them in particular again. If we were in some large group function (like a high school reunion maybe) and I ran into them, I'd be cordial. They already started another group chat with me, but I haven't responded yet.\n\nI told this to the 2 girls. They said I was overreacting. One said she was glad she was friends with them and not dating them. The other said that since we don't know/have never met any of the guys' girlfriends and have no way of contacting them, it's fine. Basically she's saying the situation would be different if the girls being cheated on were people we knew, but since that isn't the case, I don't need to feel uncomfortable remaining friends with the boys.\n\nI consider everyone in this friend group to be pretty good friends. Like I mentioned, we've all been friends since high school, and even though we didn't have the chance to meet up very much in the past, it was just like old times when we finally were able to hang out. I really enjoy talking and keeping in contact with them.\n\nBut AITA for wanting to distance myself from the 2 boys? Am I overreacting? I'm starting to think that since our lives are all so separate from one another, maybe I'm overreacting after all. The people around me have given me mixed reviews, so I decided to ask Reddit.",

      "description": "A friend (let's call him Dick) was looking for accommodations for school and couldn't find anything in his price range.  Dick and I had been roommates before in a campus residence, where he had the inner room, and I the outer.  He had to pass through mine to get to his.  He asked me if I'd share a place with him and I agreed.  He did all the looking and found a place for us, handled the security deposits etc and financially committed.  I arrived the day before school started and found that he had taken the ONLY bedroom.  I was to sleep in a dining room area that had giant glass doors, so no privacy. The layout was such that he had to pass through this room to reach his (just like on campus).  We were to split the rent equally.  I guess I looked miserable, because his GF said \"He doesn't like it.\"  My friend said that if I didn't like it, I didn't have to stay there.  I think he was pretty sure that I was stuck with it.  But I said \"Thanks!\", grabbed my stuff and left. At that point I would have commuted from my home town rather than stay there.  \n\nI happened to be able to get a much better place, much closer to school, in a much nicer building and move in that same day.\nAfter a few days Dick contacted me to ask me to come back, offering first to reduce my portion of the rent and then to swap rooms.  I was by then financially committed to the new place and couldn't afford to switch, even if I wanted to.  Dick ended up having to borrow money from his parents to survive the semester, and we weren't friends any more.    \n\nThis was many years ago, and I've always carried some guilt about this.  I was lazy in allowing him to do all the work of apartment hunting and was committed to staying until he said I didn't have to.  AITA for not just accepting the result?",

      "description": "\nSo some backstory. \nCurrently I live in a decent sized dorm room with two roommates. One who hardly shows up, and the individual involved, my vegetarian roommate. \nThis is the first year we’ve been together since I lived elsewhere previously, so it’s only been around 8 month of us sharing a room. \nI come from a very meat eating family, and occasionally my parents send me chicken and such as little presents. This had not been a problem at my old residence, but with my roommate it’s been difficult for me to eat how I normally would have while also respecting her beliefs. \n\nFrom stage 1. she had some “ground rules” which I tried to follow best I could. Things like, no keeping meat in the kitchen ( I bought a mini fridge to keep my food separate), don’t cook anything meat involved in the kitchen ( we have a community kitchen a couple floors down, so I would pack up all my food and cook whatever I needed there) just in general when it came to meat, keep it as contained and away from our space as possible.\n\nEarlier this week after coming back from work and having picked up a chicken from home. I messed up and kinda just started cooking. I guess I was just out out it from work, but I grabbed my pots and ingredients and ended up making soup.  Me and my elusive roommate had some and I packed up the rest in my fridge.\n\nI cleaned up as best I could. Wiped all the counters, hand washed everything before a round in the dishwasher.  I removed the pot I had used ( most of the pots and pans were mine) and boxed it away so she wouldn’t have to worry about accidentally using it. But when she came back from classes it didn’t seem to matter how clean the kitchen was. I don’t even know how she knew, my guess is my roommate must have told her, but she got pretty pissed at me. Yelled for a bit before locking herself in her room.\n\nWe haven’t talked in a couple days now, just the passing “Hello” before she’s out the door, and when she is here she’s in her room.\nI’ve apologized countless times but I still feel like shit about it.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n",

      "description": "This afternoon we attended a child’s birthday party at one of those bounce house play grounds. We were chasing our 2 year old around, climbing on the obstacles. At one point my husband was taking pictures of my butt as I climbed a ladder. When reviewing the photos together this evening I came across the pictures of my butt. There were at least 4. I deleted the one that I thought made my butt look bad. He then asked that in the future I ask his permission prior to deleting a photo off of his phone. I said that I don’t see why that’s necessary when it is a photo of my body. He disagreed and said it was disrespectful for me to do it without asking him despite the fact that he would have no problem deleting it if I were to make that request. I argued that I don’t believe that is a fair expectation as it is a photo of me that made me feel uncomfortable and I believe I have the rights to do as I please with that image regardless of whichever device it is on. That I don’t care whether he would want to delete it or not because it is me and it’s my right to delete it. To be clear he takes photos of my body in compromising positions often and I don’t mind. I just didn’t like the picture and didn’t think I needed to ask his permission to do as I please with my image. AITA?",

On the other hand he has brought me into his fold wi th people close to him. We are not \"Facebook offical\"or anything. He does all the classic gaslight ish shit of protecting his phone, tell me I am \"tripping\" about stuff. I have learned to mostly keep my \"insecurities\" under my hat because we are old (me 47 him 54). He is a public figure and I get that appearing single is easier in life or whatever. Also, he has been married 3 times. Now I dont think he is a cheater but he definately \"works\" people with his charms.  So we go to this conference because he has a nice room in a nice hotel comped. He has his two employees there. I walk into the hotel and reintroduce myself to his one employee. She thinks I am a conference goer and I tell her \"I am here with x\". Her face melted right in front of me. It was so awkward. We went out for drinks later and she was sitting across from him leaning in the whole time. I don't drink and maybe they were just sloppy but I was really uncomfortable with the tension. I told him, that  the intensity of th e eye contact between hima and his employee made me really uncomfortable and he did th e classic thing of saying I am tripping. Now, he told me numerous times that he is trying to get her on full time so she can leave her husband. I thought it was weird that he is involved with th is part of her life but he is a do gooder. He tells me, we share stories... I ask him why he doesn't share stories about me with her about ME and I got told to fuck off. AITA?",

      "description": "Image post will be at the bottom.\n\nSo,  my friend has this annoying habbit of posting frown emotes and nothing  else, of course prompting people to ask her whats wrong. It's a childish  move, but not a sin by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHowever,  when you post \"goodbye\" with no other context, then refuse to answer  your phone or comment when people start calling to ask if you are  alright, I think we move beyond childish into downright emotional  terrorism. I called 5 times in a panic before waking someone else up (current roommate) to go check on her, at midnight.\n\nShe  is sad because her roommate is moving out over what everyone I know  (even the people who don't like my post) agree are issue that the girl  in red caused through her OCD, and plain selfish behaviour. She made it  difficult for the person who had moved in (as a favour to her to help  her make rent in a nice building) to stay, to the point where she's not  leaving. Figured that backstory is important.\n\nAnyways,  this vague \"goodbye\" post sent me over the edge a bit. I have people  who agree it was the right thing to do, and one person saying I was  being an asshole... which made me think of this sub. Figured it's always  good to get a second (or 5th) opinion, so here's what I posted on her  wall. Am I the asshole here?\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rgB1h1l.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgB1h1l.png)\n\nEDIT:  And I feel I should clarify, the reason it was posted to her wall and  not a message is because I felt her friends who saw that goodbye post  and were worried needed to see it as well. It can be difficult for  people to confront someone on their frankly shitty behaviour, but I find  when someone else brings it up and starts the dialogue, it gets others  to be more forward about it as well. If it was just me, she might brush  it off as me just being crazy. If her friends agree, she might actually  look at her actions and change them.",

      "description": "Last night I had the last date with a girl that I have had 3 dates with. We first started talking about 10 days ago, through a friend of a friend. The 3 days we had had, counting last night, went perfectly well. We got along, and didnt argue or disagree very often. \n\nLast night she stopped me in her driveway, at the end of driving her home, to say that things were not working. She then proceeded to tell me why, clarifying that I am \"unattractive\" to her, as well as lacking a satisfying kiss on our last date. That every guy she had ever kissed she had felt \"something\", and that with me she felt \"absolutely nothing\". I really didnt respond besides nodding or chuckling to myself as I felt more and more insulted. \n\nEventually she told me I should say something, I responded \"what do you want me to say, I thought things went great, just get out of my car\". She ignored my statement and started to repeat herself about how she does not like my personality, which I will say again, I did not criticize her or really even comment. After about 5 more minutes of being berated I said \"were done here, get the fuck out of my car\".\n\nShe wanted to be friends with me after this \"break up\", and I knew that would never work. But I still dont understand how her criticism would have led to that. \n\nAlright, I can give some more context in comments if anyone wants it, but AITA",

Sucks, but not terribly hard to fix but she goes through the unending cycle of \"I want to change -&gt; I can't change -&gt; What is wrong with staying in my comfort zone?\". What's worse is that whenever I get the least bit confrontational, she runs away / closes off. For the last 1-2 years, her problems have affected her professionally (getting into trouble with her boss and coworkers), mentally (incl. suicidal thoughts) and health wise (her abusive BF refuses to let her use the air purifier because he hates the noise but insists on smoking inside the apartment despite her asthma), so I've pushed her more strongly to change but all she does is run to new friends who are less familiar with her problems and more likely to just compensate for her (like writing her emails for her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, we met up for supper and when it became explicitly clear that nothing had changed and nothing would change, I told her outright that I was getting tired of it all. She insisted that although she understood how I felt, as a true friend, it was my job to comfort her no matter what her choices were. Taken aback, I immediately argued that wouldn't a true friend tell you the truth as it is and actively help you out of your problems? But she insists that no, and moved on to a different subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's an adult, she can make her own decisions but I am emotionally spent and can't deal with it anymore. If she is hellbent on destroying herself because it is comfortable, I don't see why I should have to hold her hand through it. I have made the decision to become a more \"superficial\" friend and avoid heavy subjects with her. She clearly values herself less than I do her, so what's the point?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I'm tired of being my friend's psychoanalyst especially when she doesn't listen to advice so I want to distance myself, but she insists that if I were a \"true\" friend I would comfort her no matter what she decides to do. AITA?",

      "description": "Back in december my friend and I agreed that we'd go to a music festival in may of 2019. I told him that it might overlap our senior prom, but he said he was fine with that, so we agreed to buy tickets for the festival.\n\nWe both bought tickets, 200 dollars each.\n\nW while after that, I confirmed with him that he'd still go, despite prom. He said he'd for sure go.\n\nA few weeks ago, he said he might not actually go since he really wants to go to prom with his girlfriend.  He asked me if I'd still go without him. Since nobody else listens to the music that would be at the festival, and its a 14 hour drive, I said I wouldn't. He then said he'd for sure go, and that it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nJust today, he told me he's pulling out. \n\nThis really upset me for a few reasons, 1. I spent 200 dollars on a ticket, and it's nonrefundable. I'd either have to commit insurance fraud, or sell the ticket within a few days of receiving it (since I receive the ticket so close to the date of the festival). So, I might not get a refund for it. 2. He reassured me multiple times that he'd go on this trip with me. I've been super stoked about it since december when we bought the tickets.\n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed at my friend?",

      "description": "This is a huge first world problem and a while ago, but I'll post it anyways.  \n\n\nSo a little Backstory: I always were into gaming and nerdy stuff. There is a ton of it online and every time I see something like a figure of star wars or something like that I instantly want it. Looks cool, but mostly not gonna buy it since they can be quite pricey.  \n\n\nMy Parents never really wanted to get me anything like that. As long as I can remember they didn't want me to play video games and always were mad at me when I played them. Naturally now that changed since I was 18, but they still did it in the past and their attitude didn't change about it.  \n\n\nWe had a couple of weeks before Christmas a talk about what to get me for Christmas. My sister got a Mountain Backpack for her trip with her BF to Sri Lanka. And that was about 170 € for that. So OFC, I give them some tips and clues on what to get me. They reply that I need to give them more detailed information about what to get, since they don't want to get something for me that I won't like again, because that happened before, because they refuse to get me something I actually want. I reply, that they can just as well give me cash, since telling someone exactly what you want for Christmas ruins it. They say ok, they'll deal with it.  \n\n\nFast forward to Christmas eve. I'm German, here we celebrate @ the 24th after eating dinner. Everything was set up, and the exchange began. Keep in mind that for the first time since about 3-4 years, I couldn't get anyone anything since I didn't have a job. So we start, my sister gets her enormous backpack, her BF gets her a trip they can go on together (they love traveling together), my dog gets a couple of new toys and then me. I get a box which some could carry an umbrella or some sort of yoga Mat. My parents get their presents and I open mine up.   \n\n\nThey got me a dart Mat. Something you put under the dart board, so you know how far to stand away from it and it protects the ground. Only thing is, that this was completely unnecessary, since my parents knew that the rug in my room already was the oldest in the house and needed no protection and I already googled the recommended distance from the board and marked it with duct tape. So my parents basically got me something I absolutely had no need for.  \n\n\nOn top of that, it's worth about 10€ and my father even told me that he just stumbled upon it. So they weren't even searching.  \n\n\nI always try to give my giftees (if thats a word) something they wouldn't get themselves, thats like rule no.1 for gifting things, but they still like. My father is into cars for example and I got him a mug of a VW T1 that shows its insides if you warm it up.  \n\n\nI've been thinking about it and every time I try to bring it up with my parents my mother tries to make me feel guilty, saying things like \"another gift wasted\" or \"I knew you wouldn't like it\"  \n\n\nCan't seem to think anything other than my parents wanting to shove it in my face that I didn't want to give them specific directions on what to get me and wanted to punish me for it.  \n\n\nWhat do you think guys, AITA for being a spoiled brat?",

      "description": "\nToo long, did not read: My roommate made fun of me and took my charger. Then I mixed his alcohol with water to make it useless for his party that night.\n\nBackground:\nI (21m) am a chemistry major at  a university.  To cut costs I decided to become roommates with another student (23m). Just as fate would have it, he is the popular “guy” at our campus and throws alcohol parties regularly. There are about 5-10 people over each Sunday to party aged from 20-24 (legal drinking age is 21 here).\n\nNow let’s get to the story:\nOn Sunday morning I asked my roommate if he was going to throw another party, and the answer was yes. I told him that I was sick of all his parties and that I had to leave for work early. He told me that he could not change his plans and I should have told him earlier. I threatened to complain to the university that he was serving minors alcohol and then he lost his shit and called me a sissy and made funny of me because I had no friends. He then stormed outside and took my computer’s charger with him. I am usually pretty chill but this made me lose my cool and I decided to get his liquor out and I mixed his alcohol with water so that they could not get drunk that night and make my roommate look uncool. The party rolls around at about 10:00 and after a while they realize that the alcohol has gone bad and leave our flat to go to another party. My roommate has not given back my charger yet and he knows that I need my computer to work (had to borrow my friend’s for today. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*The total value of the alcohol was about $40\n**I made sure that the alcohol was safe and that no one would get sick.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I've recently started dating someone (though we've been friends for a long time) and we decided to take a weekend mini-break, but were having trouble picking where to go. I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and she mentioned that she and her boyfriend were spending their 10 year anniversary in a small town/village, around an hour outside of London. It sounded like the perfect destination, as neither my partner nor I had been before and it was very convenient to get to. \n\nBy coincidence, the weekend we'd chosen to go away was the same as my friend's anniversary trip. My partner asked if I thought they might have a problem with us going to the same town on the same weekend as them. I said it wouldn't have bothered me in the reverse situation, and I doubted they'd care either. Yes, it's a small town, but we weren't booking the same hotel or anything. I doubted we'd bump into each other. \n\n   We booked the trip and I mentioned it the next time I saw my friend. She froze, went very quiet, and became awkward for the rest of the evening. That night, I received a long, angry, text from her (usually, very placid) boyfriend. He said he couldn't understand why I'd chosen to book the same holiday as them, and that I had in effect ruined their anniversary. He also claimed that they when I'd mentioned I was looking for a place to go, they specifically asked me to chose somewhere else, though I honestly have no recollection of this. I think they were mainly upset that I'd decided to take someone I've been dating for two months on the same trip they'd planned for a significant anniversary. \n\n I called to apologise, and he did accept, though he also insisted on providing me with an itinerary of the restaurants they'd booked over the weekend so we could make sure we'd avoid being in the same place at the same time as them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spent the entire weekend on edge, worried we'd bump into them, and frankly it ended up spoiling our trip since we were so anxious about it.     \n\n   \n\nAITA for booking the same holiday as my friend's anniversary?

Since moving in she got a job and my wife just graduated and started her career, so I am full time student/full time caregiver right now.  The problem I have is my nephew is the whiniest little shit I have ever met in my life.  He shoots my 2&amp;1/2 year old with a Nerf gun then balls like his arm just got broke when he gets shot back.  He never listens to anything anyone says, throws massive tantrums, and literally just sucks at life.  I had so much fun these past couple of years raising my son while my wife focused on school and now I just want to get two jobs to get out of the house.  \n\nMy new daily schedule is basically half the day repeating the same there sentences over and over to my nephew, and half the day pulling my hair out because he doesn't listen.  \n\nThe worst part is, my kid looks up to his older cousin and is starting to act like him.  He was a super happy, really chill, creative toddler.  Now he's starting to act like his cousin because my sister gives in to his tantrums.  I'm at my wit's end with this little shit and I believe he may be the first person I have ever hated this much.  \n\nNow before anyone tells me this is how kids are and all that crap. I love kids, I volunteered at elementary schools, babysat younger cousins, abd I'm even the adult who entertains the children at the family get together because I have more fun with kids than adults at those things.  However I have never in my life seen a kid this annoying in my life.  I truly want to know, AITA? ",

We didn't really get to know each other, we just talked about memes 'n shit (sounds kind normie, I know).

Can you do me a favor at school?\n\nMe: yeah sure bro, depends on what it is.\n\nSo he asked me to sign him up for a late bus because he had to do something for ROTC I think. I thought it was a doable task, but then I got to asking for the details of where the list is.\n\nMe: alright who's the teacher's name and what's the room number?\n\nHim: I don't remember\n\nMe: *Wtf.jpeg* Well uh. I kinda need that information to help you.\n\nHim: well I don't remember! You can find it, it isn't that hard to find in the English hallway!\n\nI'm autistic, I get REALLY overwhelmed when I'm given a thing to do and I don't know where I'm going. I just end up cowering back to a place where I'm comfy and not doing what I was told to do.\n\nSo of course I tried to explain that I can't help him without knowing where I'm going. He proceeded to get an attitude like I was in the wrong, which made me feel terrible.\n\nHe ended up asking someone else who's in the same class as him and he got on the late bus.\n\n\nSummary: This one guy I quote memes with asks me to sign him up for a late bus, didn't tell me where I had to go, then made me feel bad when I couldn't help him.\n\nSo tell me Reddit, AITA?

      "description": "She is Vietnamese and everybody else in the story is white. For context she grew up within an hour from us, English as first language, and has the same accent as us. I brought her back to the apartment (I live with my brother and two friends in a four bedroom apartment) and introduced my girlfriend to my brother's girlfriend in the kitchen. Everything went well. I told my brother previously that my girlfriend was president at three minority organizations while at college, so she would be unlikely to find certain comments humorous. We walked into his room and I introduced her. Her name is a very common Vietnamese name and is a short, easy to pronounce, one syllable name.   \n\nHe responds \"Chang?\"   \n\nIt got pretty quiet, I made a nervous chuckle and said \"No, her name is x.\" She gives me a look that anybody can read which is basically did that really just happen?   \n\nHe responds \"Chong?\"   \n\nI told him \"Stop.\" His girlfriend nudged his shoulder and told him to stop as well. I'm pretty sure my girlfriend just said \"wow\" or something similar quietly under her breath.   \n\nHe responds \"Ching?\"   \n\nUnfortunately this isn't a made up story. I really wish it was. At that point we just walked away. But now six months later he continues to make rude comments. He toes the line on what I'd say is racist because if we react in anyway he can just say we are overreacting. Just this morning he was mad and saying I've changed and get so offended so easily. I told him to stop insulting us and being so aggressive. He responded with \"Come at me\" \"Threaten me\" \"Its too late\" \"She can eat Sushi\".   \n\nI'm not well versed on social race issues. My girlfriend and I don't always agree on things, but that to me is another racist comment. I tried to explain it to my mom as well as brother how that's racist. My mom thinks its a dumb little thing that we should just get over. I don't think so. It's constant little comments like that. He's just trying to make it tame enough to claim we're overreacting. To me though that is the equivalent to if my girlfriend was black and he said \"She can eat watermelon\" or \"she can eat fried chicken\". It's not cool to me and I want it to stop. He goes about a week of not saying anything horrible and then he just goes off for a day or two. He's always had anger issues but to me he's just being a racist asshole to my girlfriend and then goes in for a second attack if we say anything at all about the first not being cool.   \n\nReddit, am I the asshole for wanting him to stop making comments on her race, stop attacking us for not being okay with his comments, and for him to apologize for the racist comments he's already made? I know he doesn't believe that minorities are below white people or anything supremely racist like that, but his comments are still racist right?   ",

I'm actually a drummer, and i mentioned this, and i phrased the video as being some casual stuff for fun. The video clearly shows some bad/amateur piano playing, but it sounds pretty good to me by ear, and i think i have a pretty good ear for music. Obviously, that's subjective.\n\nSome dude constructively critiqued \"less pedal/reverb?\" verbatim. (I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he was consciously being constructive)\n\nI responded verbatim: \"Nah, the reverb hides my mistakes.

This leads to a lot of the students being impartial to the teacher since they are forced to be there, creating a sense of \"we don't like you and this class sucks\" for my teacher. Today before class started we saw a few other teachers give our teacher a giant teddy bear. I thought it was because it was my teacher's birthday because she didn't look sad and because I had no idea what else a giant teddy bear could mean. Class ends and its just me and a few of my friends straggling behind with me when I get the great idea to say \"What is the teddy bear for? Is it your birthday?\" while smiling like some kid who found a hundred dollars on the street. She pauses for a bit then says it's because her mother is **terminally ill** and she just found out recently. Well F\\*\\*\\*. No one really knows what to say and we all start leaving. I try to mend it with a \"hope your mom gets better\" and slowly gtfo. My friends are now blaming me for being an inconsiderate asshole but I had no knowledge of her mom and was just trying to make her day better. AITA?",

      "description": "First post bear with me. For context, my mom is 48 years old and over the past few years has been in a couple accidents which have left her with severe back pain and what I believe ( I'm not phycologist) is pain related depression. Now she already has 3 kids. My brother (31) myself (21) and my little sister who was adopted just a few years ago (7). We also currently have in our home a year and a half old baby, who as far as anyone can tell, will almost certainly go up for adoption within the next few months because her deadbeat parents are finally get there parental rights terminated. Now, over the course of fostering this wonderful baby, my mom's back problems have gotten worse and worse, and as a result of that, I and my SO have taken more and more work on for her. Nothing to wild mostly just the heavy lifting and we watch the baby and take care of it a few days a week. Neither of us have any problem doing this AT ALL. My SO and myself love the child, and if we were able, we would raise it ourselves. But we are both to young and not anywhere near financially stable enough to give it the home it deserves. As well as that within the next 2 years we will be moving away to go to college, about 2 hours from our home town. So we cannot keep helping indefinitely. My mom has told us repeatedly that she isn't sure she could do it without us, but she love the baby and wants it to have a good home, and she is very aware of how messed up the adoption system can be here in the U.S and worry's about where the kid could end up. My conclusion with all this information in mind is that she should not adopt the baby, and I have told her so. Doing so was extremely hard, because like I said above I do very much love this kid, but I don't think my mom can go it alone, and I'm soon simply not able to help her. Telling her this honestly broke my heart and hers. Am I an asshole for playing the devil's advocate? I would also like to note she isn't completely alone, but my dad works a job where he is gone 6 months of the year at a time.",

My boyfriend met him a few weeks ago at a bowling event thing for my job and he seemed to like him fine when they met. \n\nThis coworker and I have gotten pretty close over the past year and we’ve been teasing each other back and forth about me cooking spaghetti. I’m 3rd generation Italian American and I’ve brought spaghetti to work events 3 times but he always missed it because he was at school or out of the store for some reason or another.\n\nSo we’ve had this ongoing joke about me making spaghetti for him. So a few days ago he randomly texted me and asked about it and I had the ingredients so I made him basically a pot of spaghetti. \n\nI told my boyfriend about it when my coworker texted me to say how good it was and he got pissy with me about it. Now suddenly he has an issue with me having picked up this coworker and driven him to work a few times and with he and I having lunch together and apparently he came to our job once and saw us hug and he’s been upset about it for months. \n\nThe one thing that I’ll admit is fair is that at work there’s an ongoing joke in the store that me and this coworker will get married and have pretty babies together but this was started by an old lady who works there and it’s just good fun. I haven’t been totally innocent because at work we are flirty and I guess sometimes I have gotten a bit too close but I never crossed a line.\n\nI feel like he’s just dumping a bunch of unreasonable emotions on me. I haven’t cheated. \n\nTl;dr- my boyfriend found out I made another guy spaghetti and all of sudden has issues with my friendship with him that he’s held grudges about for like a year.

      "description": "Throwaway acc. Technically asking for a friend.\n\nI have a friend ('James') that is currently 20. He was active on tinder, and a girl that he met on there ('Emma') got pregnant. They practiced  safe sex- the pill &amp; condoms. James wants Emma to get an abortion,  and she says she isn't sure if she wants to do that. They had this massive argument over it. Details below, TLDR summary at bottom.\n\nJames is an international student, from a wealthy background. His tinder profile was pictures of him in sports cars and a pic of him in what is clearly a private jet seat. He has his own apartment and two luxury cars.\n\nWhen they were 'together', Emma would post snap/insta stories that showed the logos of the cars. She would also push him to bring the 'sports car' when they went out. After she discovered the value of the watches James wore, that too also became a fixture of her snap/IG.\n\nJames' grandparents are conservative Christians, as well as the source of the wealth in the family. James is the oldest grandson so he's expected to eventually take up the family business. This means that he's expected to marry someone from their 'class' and from the home country, preferably someone from a major business partner's family. There may be a racial aspect here too- while some of his relatives married spouses from other 'races', they were all from the same 'class', and weren't in line to inherit.\n\nIf James ends up fathering a child with a foreigner who doesn't benefit the 'family' he'll most likely end up not inheriting. He has a younger brother, two male cousins and a near-genius sister, so the grandparents have alternatives. Taking over the family business one day is very important to James- he's been groomed for it since he was born.\n\nJames doesn't think that his 'relationship' with Emma was anything more than FWB. He continued using tinder after meeting Emma, and his snap stories regularly showed him in close contact with other girls (never anything explicit, but 'close'). His insta account also doesn't have any mention of Emma.\n\nI'm personally involved in this because I told James to get tinder when we were on vacation, and because he's the closest thing I have to a brother. Dickish as his behavior may have been, I don't want him to get his future hurt by this. From a more selfish POV, James inheriting the family business is good for me since I know him far better than his brother/cousins.\n\nTLDR  \nJames thinks Emma is only considering keeping the baby because she knows he is from a wealthy family. Fathering a kid at 20 is not something James wants at all, and doing so out of wedlock and with someone from a foreign country will almost certainly lose him the inheritance/family business. James has also been seeing other women while 'with' Emma.  James wants Emma to have an abortion, Emma was hesitant, and they argued about it.\n\nAFAIK abortions are free where they are at, but James is completely okay with footing the bill.",

      "description": "I'm going to preface this by saying I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression, both of which I feel are having a pretty big impact on the situation.\n\nSo recently my husband and I were having a discussion about famous singers, and we somehow got to Nicki Minaj. He pointed out how nice her ass looked, to which I responded it is clearly fake and it's actually starting to droop down, looking pretty dang bad recently. The conversation moved to the topic of 'Thick' girls and I started getting uncomfortable. \n\nHe mentioned how he's been wasting his time looking at this instagram page of literally obese girls' asses. I don't think it needs to be said that I find it unattractive and a little bit yucky to allow yourself to gain such a tremendous amount of weight, so I got a bit offended when I realized this is what he finds attractive. \n\nI've put on a good amount of weight recently (I'm very upset about it) and I felt almost as though this interest has been spurred by my sudden weight gain. This may seem completely ungrounded, but I used to be a very thin person and back then his porn was filled with girls even smaller than I was. I'm 100% confident he finds me attractive, but his porn history (which he is very open about) seems to be an exaggeration of what weight I'm at, how long my hair is, my outfit, etc.   \n\n\nI'm very confused, and so is he. He has no idea how I could get offended by what he finds attractive, and I have a hard time vocalizing my worries without coming off as crazy.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Alright so I'm currently backpacking in Thailand right now. I met this cute girl in my hostel, we hit it off and went out and got a couple drinks. When we were leaving the bar, I asked her if she wanted to dance. She said she has to find her friend first but she'd love to dance and that she'd meet me there in about 10 mins.\n\nSo she shows up 2 hours later but whatever, I'll deal with it. I go up and ask her to dance she says she needs to get a drink first. So she goes up gets the drink and walks past me without looking at me. For the rest of the night. Anytime I'm near her she proceeds to go in the exact opposite direction. Even if I'm simply dancing with some friends, she would walk towards us and then see me and walk in the opposite direction. So finally at the end of the night, the parties settling down and I see her and I walk up no longer wanting to dance and told her to go fuck herself and then walked away with my friends.\n\nI wouldn't have minded if she said no to dancing or if she simply said alright I don't wanna dance with you anymore. But it's the fact she went out of her way to avoid me at all times that pissed me off.\n\nTL;DR: Ask girl to dance, she says yes, she avoids me all night, I tell her to go fuck herself.",

      "description": "There's this girl. She is my boyfriend's ex. She used to be my best friend. She got jealous easy and we drifted apart (She never responded to me) and I started talking to her bf. We became fast friends and she didn't like it. Despite nothing happening she broke up with him because of it. She also tried to ruin my life over and  over. But I won't go into details. Fastward almost 6 months. I realize I'm polyamorous and I'm dating a grilled that I have been for 2 years and her ex. I realize that the girl is abusing me emotionally and cut it off in a not at all rude way. I take all the blame offer to repay her for everything she ever bought me. Etc. She didn't take it well. But I kept trying to appease her cause she meant alot to me still. So she tells me she's been talking to my now bfs ex. And I'm a bit hurt cause my ex knows this girl has cause me so much pain. But I brush it aside. Later that day. Someone comes into our group chat and drops a screenshot of my bf talking to his ex and her flirting. I went to his dms and asked him what the deal was and if I could have the full convo. Turns out that his ex gave the friend of ours a cropped SS in an attempt to break us up. I slip and mention it to my now ex. She apologizes over and over and I'm confused. The next day. Another Friend approaches me. And send me screenshot after screenshot of the ex's plotting to send the ss and to hurt me. I'm livid and end all communication with my ex there. But not before she told me that she cheated on me with this girl. So it bugged me for a while but she wasn't the cheating type and the girl wasn't gay in the slightest. So we concluded she manipulated her into cheating on me cause she hates my guts. Now. I just found out. One of my close friends still talk to her. And I'm upset but he doesn't understand why......am I in the wrong here? \n\nI can give more details if needed \n\n(Also not everyone agrees with polyamorous people but it was consentual on all sides so idk)",

      "description": "Okay so a little bit of backstory to this:\n\nI'm not really a Facebook person but I have one only for the sake of connecting with close family and friends, with that being said I don't personally post a lot but I do on occasion have pictures of happy times in my life like family get togethers and birthday outings. Every now and then I like to look back on them but recently I've run into a bit of a weird issue.\n\nWhen I started doing a while back this I quickly realized that for what ever reason my Bfs cousin who I had added on FB a while back has felt the need to tag me and my bf (along some of his family) in multiple random posts that don't even involve me, and not like photos of their family or stuff but like pictures/videos, quizzes, products, etc. Don't get me wrong I appreciate that they want to show me things that they think I would like to see but my FB timeline looks like a clusterfuck build bored of random junk posts. \n\nI did point it out to my BF but he doesn't mind that his cousin does this as he's more into the things his cousin shows him but did understand my annoyance with the fact my timeline had more posts from his cousin then from me, so I figured I would just un tag myself from the mass of posts that really didn't involve me and if his cousin was truly heart broken about it and asked why I would explain my reasoning. I know I could of told them to stop but I am a very anxious person and I don't like conflict and I figured they would get the message and stop tagging me in all these random posts. It was such a minor thing that I quickly forgot about it and moved on with my life, until the next time I checked my FB and quickly realized they did not get the hint.\n\nOnce again my timeline is flood with these random posts and I'm seriously annoyed now and I want to straight up tell them to stop for the love of god but I'm afraid I'm going to come off as a jerk to his cousin who I know would take it as me not liking them.\n\nSo Reddit I humbly ask you would I be the asshole if I told them to stop?",

      "description": "**Short background:** I dated my ex for seven years. About a year ago, I broke up with him because our long-distance relationship was stressing both of us out. He wasn’t good at calling or messaging even once a week and was reliant on me for everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year went by. We stayed friends. Things got better. Once he was finally on his own for truly the first time, he grew up, his mental state got better, he was more communicative, and we started falling for each other all over again. Well, shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NOW:** I’m in Japan for 17 more months. The two of us have talked about getting back together once that time is over because we’re more in love than ever despite everything. I told him we could think about getting back together in 17 months, and ever since I expressed interest, we’ve essentially been acting like we’re long-distance dating again, despite me lightly reminding him that we aren’t dating yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut 17 months is a long time and I don’t really want to be alone for all of it. While he has his support system back home, I have nothing. My friendships here are more shallow, my apartment is owned by my employer, I can’t be in consistent contact with my family or even see them, and everything in my life has an expiration date. I’m lonely. In 17 months I go home and start all over again from scratch, and sometimes thinking about that makes me miserable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve made plans to go on a date. My ex is livid. While he hasn’t explicitly told me that I can’t date anyone else, and he also hasn’t asked me to start dating him NOW, he has this mentality already that he won me back, I am already his, and he doesn’t want me to hang out with other guys. His reaction to hearing that I might go on a date was essentially, “Fine, go ahead, do what you want. I don’t like it, but if you have to.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur friends have expressed that they think I’m not being fair to him- if we’re already acting like a couple, by dating someone else in the meantime, I’m just stringing both guys along because I know I have something easy to fall back on. I don’t see it that way. The guy I MIGHT date knows that our relationship would have an expiration date even if things go well because I don’t want to stay in this country forever, and my ex knows that we aren’t exclusively dating. I’m not doing this behind his back, and I’ve encouraged him since we initially broke up to try seeing other people- he just isn’t interested in trying. I don’t want to be alone for 17 months and “saving myself” for someone I’m not yet officially dating again, but my decision to go on a date is clearly frustrating him. I understand how he feels, but I think that unless he explicitly asks me to be in a relationship with him, I’m going to continue acting like I’m single and enjoying myself.\n\nAm I being cruel and stringing him along without even knowing it, or is it fine to date other people while we’re on a “break” because of the long distance?",

And last night I asked if she needed help waking up today, she said yes.\n\nSo this morning I called her several times (its always like this when trying to wake her up, even before we were dating her girl friends would have to ring her up several times in a row to wake her up). \n\nBy the second message on WhatsApp and the third time I was calling I knews it could take a while so I put it on speaker and went browsing, opened up instagram and she was online.\n\nSo I just said to her:\n\n-Ok, saw you online and didn't bother picking up the phone or answering my IMs, I will just go back to sleep since I don't really have nothing to do for another one and a half hour.\n\nThis bothered me of course. But I know I could have phrased that better. Still, I don't know what I should do. After that she got pissed at me for, in her words, 'thinking she doesn't care about me'...\n\nAnd now she is feeling like she doesn't reciprocate as much to me and got sad about the whole thing... To give more context, this is not the first time she ignores messages from me for a few hours, but that never bothered me, I do it too, I just never did it when I told her to contact me or I could lose an appointment. This is the only time this bothered me and I think I overreacted.\n\nI think I mishandled the situation, but I need some outside input.\n\n",

      "description": "For a brief background, this was during summer internships, which are a mandatory part of our MBA programs.\n\nSummer internships are an opportunity to get yourself a job offer, much before companies start to come on campus looking for candidates. So you are looking at straight 7-8 months of chilled out life, with a job in hand and no study to do while others are freaking out for placements.\n\nSo here goes: Turns out in our induction that there is an opening in HR analytics(her project) while nothing is mentioned about my area (career management &amp; development). My first intuition is that I have to do well on my part, as well as to derail her to have a shot at the job offer. She doesn't know much about analytics, so that makes my job much simpler, because I can pitch in, talk to partners about her project details and implementation which she cannot do.\n\nI systematically push for being a part of her project too, because of the above mentioned agenda and also the pure interest in working on HR analytics, my somewhat favourite area in HR. I take her data, do my own progress, share nothing with her while she is handcuffed to come to me for help, because it is not her area of expertise. \n\nAfter the mid review, turns out that they are not very keen at looking at technicalities of the implementation and all, which has been somewhat of my focus till now. I get an epiphany that if I do a good job on this, she'll get all the credit(it is her project after all) because no one is bothered about the technical aspects. I tell my manager about it, clarifying clearly that I want something end-to-end(MBA jargon) and that I want out if there isn't anything of that kind. He agrees to me backing out of her project. \n\nSo her project is left in a shabby state, because I derailed her progress, and wasn't obliged to share mine, which I didn't.\n\nIt may turn out that I clearly attempted to sabotage her project, but it was out of the need and self-interest of securing myself a job from my summer internship in a good company and to enjoy my last 7-8 months before shitty corporate life.\n \nSorry for the extremely long read.\n\nAITA?

      "description": "I had a friend, lets call her T. T was a new friend but we had become really close. She had a bf, K. K had cheated on her and broke up with her. T was a mess. After about a week, she wasn't sad, just angry. What did she do? Found K's new girlfriends Instagram and tried to be her friend, when K told T that he didn't want her talking to his new girlfriend or him, she went berserk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMultiple times, she would go through and comment multiple terrible things on many of her posts. Things like: \"Ugly\", \"Whore\", \"Slut\", \"K is going to cheat on you\", \"K loved me first you bitch\", etc. She would also message her and say the same things. This is already too much for me, but then T would do it in front of me and expect me to laugh with her. I always just kinda sucked it up and gave a few pity laughs before redirecting my attention elsewhere. It made me really uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 2 months of that, I made the decision to stop being her friend. I told her what i had planned out after ghosting her for two days, a mistake on my part, and she yelled at me for letting *them* bully *her.* She screamed at me that I was someone who just let bullying happen and that she was \"just standing up for myself.\" That was the last straw and I've avoided her ever since. Anytime she gets the chance though, she makes a giant scene of how I was the one who made a stupid decision and that she was being bullied by them. All her new friends agree with her and also do the same thing. Her old friends and my parents think I did the right thing, but I still feel really guilty over it and think I could've handled it better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: T dated a serial cheater and when she got cheated on, verbally attacked K's new girlfriend. When I stopped being her friend and associating with her, suddenly I was the asshole. AITA?",

      "description": "I and my best friend are friends for more than 12 years. We are neighbors and basically see each other every day. We even were pregnant at the same time, and we both were overweight (238 lbs.). \n\nAfter my second child I decided to lose weight and managed to lose 70, 50 lbs. \n\nBy then, it was already a difficult period, because she doesn´t (want to?) made the effort and I didn´t push her. But I was doing so well, that our relationship changed. I had that feeling that she thinks that I am now judging her for not losing weight. I was definitely not. I just changed my eating habits and let cake, snacks and soda untouched, when I was at hers (she didn´t listen when I told her, that she doesn´t have to serve me these things, I will not eat/drink i anyway). She even nag once in a while, because of my new behaviour and that I should go easy on that. I just thought she was jealous and didn´t want to argue about it, but sometimes her comments were just annoying. I just did my thing because I felt great for me, and sorry for her. No need to risk our friendship.\n\nAfter years, our kids grew and it was visible, that her daughter (a few months younger then my son) already struggles with her weight. At one point my friend said herself, that her daughter should lose some weight, she already complains that her feets hurt. The daughter had almost 117 lbs. at the age of 8. \n\nI tried to give some advices, carefully since our relationship is already different since my weight loss. I told her only basic things and offered my help. She was not mad at me, she mentioned it first, but she was neither happy about me not being more supportive in that way she thought I would be (to say things like “she will grow out of it”, “when it starts to border her, she will lose weight on her own”). \n\nNeedless to say, that our friendship suffers even more and that’s why I struggle with my decision. Because, I was at my friend´s house yesterday (after not seeing them for a while) and when I saw her daughter it hits me right in my face. She gained so much weight, I couldn´t believe this was even possible. Of course I didn´t say anything, I was just happy to see them. But I am really concerned about her health. My friend´s mother told me, that her granddaughter has now 172 lbs. at the age of 10. Granny is also worried and argues a lot with my friend, but she just refuses to listen.\n\nI want to tell her to take professional help. First from a doctor, than from a nutritionist, and of course the help of family and friends. \n\n**WIBTA to give my best friend this wakeup call even if I know that this could be the end of our friendship? Or is it just non of my business?**",

      "description": "So I've been in a relationship with this girl for 1 year, we lived together for half of it.   \nOur relationship was started on the premise her leaving the country and not wanting an *anchor* when she goes backpacking in Asia for 6 months. I'm new to relationships - I've 2 good ones and 2 average ones.   \nThis relationship is by far the best I've had, but I still have a fear of missing out and a fear of commitment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore she left she ended up changing her mind during our time together - and wants to give our relationship a serious go for the long run. Honestly I could see it as a possibility, but I can't shake this urge to explore different minds of new girls.. And I know it will only grow - or I will eventually resent her or myself at a later date when the relationship eventually falls apart and I lost my prime time (She's 24, I'm 28).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been transparent about this, and shared all my thoughts. My biggest concern isn't the 6 months, it's the following 2 years she will study in a city far away from me, and I'm tied down with a job and appartment that I can't sell before another year passes.   \n\n\nFor new-years she gave me an ultimatum, either break up or stay together while she travels. Knowing myself I would be miserable in a long distance relationship, and I would never be able to resist exploring, so I countered by saying that we'll have a break when she travels, and when she comes back we'll rekindle the relationship and see how to progress when the future is clearer. She's then worried I find someone else - so we couldn't agree. . So we broke up..   \n\n\nThere was still almost 10 weeks of living together, and I thought it was a shame that we couldn't just enjoy our time together - as our relationship is truly happy, spicy and fun. So we both caved and we compromised to a solution where I would get two \"green-cards\" allowing me flirt and sleep with two girls while she was travelling (with no romantic feelings involved, and being transparent about not wanting anything serious).   \n\n\nNow we're 4 weeks into her travelling and I met a cute and fun girl that I would like to take on a date. So I asked her if she's still okay with it and I gave it a day before I'd ask the new girl out. The following day I get a heartfelt message that didn't say I wasn't allowed to, but that she felt really bad about me being with a new girl, and that it hurt..  \n\n\nSo here I am - currently making a decision of what I'll do - so I ask you, reddit community - AITA?",

Usually, if I go in the other room and close the door, I cant hear it. \n\nThe first time I asked him to turn it down, it was about 9:45p on a Wednesday and I went down there because the music was louder than usual and I needed to work the next day. He didn't answer the door but he immediately cut off the music. \n\nYesterday, the music was SUPER loud. Like, it might have well been in my apartment, but it was far outside quiet hours (~6:00p and quiet hours start at 10). I tried my best to just leave it alone but no matter what room I was in, I could here it very clearly. So I went downstairs to knock on his door and said \"Could you turn that down? It's really loud and I hate it.\" He didn't come out but he immediately cut off the music and, no lie, left the apartment complex for 2 straight days. \n\nI feel bad about asking him to be quieter outside quiet hours when he's also in his own home.

I would do anything for them and I do. \n\nBackground story-\n\nCurrently, I live at home because I goto community college and my parents pay for the school. What isn’t cover in financial aid. I have offer to pay it numerous times. They tell me no. Because they paid for everything in college for my sister.\n\nI am a 20 year old in college and I have a part time job. I work around 25-30 hrs a week while going full time to college. My work load is a ton! On top of that I do projects around the house that a 20year generally doesn’t do. Recently I bought them a new laminate floor and fixed our shed up! I did this with my money. I didn’t respect anything in return nor cared. I did this for them.\n\nMy mom torn up our bathroom floor for some reason... so I had to fix that during midterm week. Which I did, though I couldn’t finish my laminate floor because of how she ripped up the bathroom. It was a mess... so I had to switch projects. Therefore my laminate flooring isn’t done.(need to do a closet). She threw this up at my tonight for no reason. \n\nI also pay for my own car, gas, and insurance. They even use my car sometimes... when things break down on theirs. \n\nThings I want to be able to do!\n\nSo I have a girlfriend that goes to college 2 hours away! We alternate weekend on who comes down to see who! (Her family lives close to mine) Now I think I should be able to spend the night at her apartment when I want! Because her parents are fine with! \n\nMy mom get very angry at me for even mentioning spending the night. She doesn’t like the idea. Meanwhile my dad couldn’t care less if I do or not. Though he won’t tell her because she goes ballistic fast... \n\nI shouldn’t have to ask if I can do something with my friends. \n\nOr get questioned on how I spend my money.. (I have a student account from high school that is linked to theirs for transferring money when I was in high school) \n\nSo reddit WIBTA If I wanted new rules for me? Because I think I do a lot of things and deserve theses things. Any advice is greatly appreciated! \n\n\n",

However, my plans changed drastically due to a very unforeseen turn of events (it’s family related, but I’m not going into detail due to privacy reasons). \n\n\nBecause of said turn of events, I need to move back home for a while. And by a while, I mean the foreseeable future. Home is in another state. \n\n\nI told my roommates and landlord this as soon as I knew I was moving. My landlord agreed to let me find someone else to take over my portion of the lease. My roommates, however, don’t like this. They agreed to live with me, not someone else. I told them they can choose whoever they want, but they don’t know anyone. I said I’ll find someone and make sure they approve of them, but they’re still not budging. \n\n\nI really don’t want to be stuck paying over $5000 for a year of rent for a place I’m not living in. Plus my share of internet and utilities. The lease hasn’t even started yet!

      "description": "So, a little back story before we get into the main issue. My niece is 4. Her whole life, my parents have picked up their dogs bc my sister and niece don’t want them around my niece. My aunt has done the same for them. \n\nSo here we are, my niece is like afraid of dogs basically. No one has ever taken the time to show her dogs are not bad, they aren’t gonna hurt her. So anytime she comes to my house or moms, or my aunts, my niece demands we pick up our dogs, put them in the kennel. My mom and aunt obey. I don’t. This same situation happened about a year or two ago, and my sister cursed me out, called me every name in the book, all in front my neighbors. I ignored the fuck out of her bc I know how she gets and when she’s like that, it’s pointless talking to her. \n\nSo, today, I walked outside and I see my sister, niece, and grandmas walking over. And I instantly cringe bc I know my niece and sister are gonna want me to pick up my dog, and I’m not gonna want to, so it’s gonna be some bullshit. My sister is also pregnant again, so, moody ya know. I should also say, my dog is super small. A Jack Russell terrier. I was hoping if I ignored my niece wanting us to pick up my dog she’d be ok and shut up about it. She didn’t. My fiancé doesn’t wanna have to hear them complain about it, so she picks her up in the kennel to avoid the bullshit. I’m different. I don’t feel like I should have to pick up my damn dog in our own house. My fiancé agrees, but she doesn’t want drama. My grandmaw was holding my niece bc she knows how my niece is gonna get if she puts her down. The whole time, my niece is constantly demanding us to put up the dog. My fiancé puts the dog in the kennel, and I say not to. My sister makes some remark about I’ll be ok, to get over myself. So I take the dog out the kennel and say she doesn’t need to be locked up. \n\nMy sister begins yelling at me at this point, and cursing at me. So once she gets into one of these moods, I know there’s no having a normal conversation with her at all. So I told them alright, that’s enough, time to leave. And I walked them out the house. The whole way out, my sister is screaming at me. \n\nShe basically said were fucking idiots and we’re stupid. Called my dog stupid. Said we got the dumbest wildest dog (she’s not, she just gets happy when people come over.) She said this is why she never comes over. All while screaming once again, in front my neighbors.\n\nI just said “ok, yep. Gotcha. Ok, love y’all, goodbye”. I didn’t say anything mean, or insensitive. But I know there’s no reasoning with her when she gets like this, there’s no having a normal conversation at that point. And I’m not gonna sit here and go back forth with her like that. I’ve also gotten to the point in life where I’m realizing it’s really rare in life that you change someone’s mindset on something. So why sit here and argue? So that’s why I said it’s time to go. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "This is very trivial, but I feel it's a matter of common decency, manners and good sportspersonship. There is a certain code of good play at the site, you always say good luck\nto your opponent, some people give their location etc.\n\nI usually play 2 minute fast scrabble games, but had got chatting to this particular player in the lobby and ended up on their friend list. As such, I would often join longer games with people I had gotten to know, chat while playing etc. This game was 10/10, meaning 10 minutes long and you get 10 extra seconds with each move.\n\nAbout 4 moves in, my wait for my next turn stretched to over 8 minutes, the opponent was clearly away from the keyboard. Finally they returned with only about 1 minute left on their timer. They informed me that they had taken a phone call.\n\nI considered it rude that she hadn't either informed me or opted to request to pause or adjourn the game, both of which are game options. I would have done so for any opponent, but especially one I was friendly with. I personally would have been able to play while on the phone, but that's besides the point.\n\nFrom then on, she didn't have enough time to plan her moves, as she is a slow player, so she basically passed and threw the rest of the game.\n\nI expressed my annoyance, that I thought it was rude to not simply write a note to say she had to take a call. It's not as though it was an attached wall phone either.\n\nShe justified that the game was set for 10 minutes, she can use her allotted time any way she chooses. In theory, I agree that she operated within the set time, however I still considered it rude.\n\nIs my thinking unreasonable?\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my real account. \n\nMy boyfriend has had a rough week, and because I'm so busy with school and work during the week, we usually mostly see eachother on the weekends. Lately because of events and things we've been invited to, we haven't had a lot of nights with just the two of us, either. However, my boss offered me today (Friday) off of work if I stayed late on Monday and Wednesday to help with a big project we were finishing up. So, I texted my boyfriend on Tuesday and let him know that I would be off on Friday, and that I would love to take him out to dinner and then spend the night since he's had such a rough week. I told him I'd take him out for Mexican food (his favorite restaurant, if only for the margaritas). \n\nWe texted throughout the day on Wednesday and he said twice how excited he was to see me and how dinner together sounded really great. \n\nI worked 14 hour days on Monday and Wednesday, stayed late at school on Tuesday and stayed up super late to finish a paper all week so that we could have a date night. \n\nHe texted me Thursday afternoon and asked if it would be okay if he invited his friend out with us. \n\nI honestly didn't want to make a big deal out of it, because he did have a tough week and I wanted him to have a nice night, so I said okay. \n\nWe had planned to meet at his place at 8 (earliest I could do after school last night). Instead, he and his friend headed to the restaurant around 6:30-7 and ordered margaritas and apps, an hour an a half before I could even get there. By the time I showed up, they were on their 3rd margaritas (the 40oz ones) and had had a couple shots and the queso and apps they offered me (because they saved me some) were ice cold. They had placed their food order about 10 minutes earlier, so their food was arriving before I even glanced at the menu. I was a little annoyed but tried to go on with the night. Realizing I would be driving us all home, I ordered a water and a couple tacos. They ordered another margarita and a shot each before we were done eating. \n\nI was so frustrated. I had busted my ass all week to have a nice dinner with my boyfriend, and this is what I showed up to. \n\nThen the bill comes, all on one check, because apparently my boyfriend requested it. I asked for them to split his friend off of it. Politely! I said \"Oh, we're actually separate, I'll get just his\" and gestured at my boyfriend. He asked for them to keep it on one check, since \"we\" offered to take him out. \n\nI still payed the check, because the whole Mexican dinner thing was my idea and I had offered to take him out to dinner. \n\nI ended up paying like $170 plus a tip for dinner and margaritas that I barely touched. \n\nWe went back to his place and his friend hung out until way after I went to bed, because I was exhausted from all of the extra work this week. We didn't even get 5 minutes to ourselves the whole night. \n\nI brought up this morning all of the reasons why I was annoyed by last night, and basically he thinks I'm overreacting and that I couldn't be annoyed about the check when I offered to pay. He doesn't recognize that I felt very put on the spot and that the dinner was not at all what we agreed to or what I was looking forward to. And now we've been pissy with eachother all day over this. Am I really being unreasonable? \n\nTl;dr : Boyfriend and I had a big date night planned, he changed everything by inviting his friend, and I'm annoyed that I had to pay $200 to show up to the restaurant when they were both already drunk ",

      "description": "Hi, first of all I would like to say that if I sound obnoxious, really stupid or fishing for attention to just ignore me. I don't know if I have any self-awareness.\n\nA little bit more than a year ago I (19yo) was kicked out of home by my father. For my mother (51yo) that was the last straw and left my father, even if she still waited a couple of months to leave the family home because of my brother. At the time I was bouncing from friend to friend until I was allowed to stay at the house of my late grandmother. I also feel the need to clarify that my father might have said to leave his house, but I was to one that did it and never came back even if he told me it wasn't serious.\n\nMy mother has suffered a lot and all her life has had her children (me and my brother, who is 16) number one in her priorities. She suffered two decades of marriage only because she wouldn't feel safe leaving us with my father alone. She doesn't have any friends left because of that, so she usually relies on me for friendship (not at all a strict mother). \n\nAfter she separated from him she came to live with me at grandma's house, and my brother bounced from us to him. I'm not the best at home keeping, but I was doing my best and nothing was ever broken or ruined, I had clean clothes and surfaces, and never starved. I feel confident saying I was doing pretty good because nobody had ever teached me anything. But she doesn't see it that way, at all.\n\nThe first months of the two of us living together were me taking care of her, because she was feeling pretty bad and hopeless, worrying about my dad. She took over the house, making it her own and disregarding everything I did, making me like a child, my only space being a tiny room. Even so, she also helped me and made me feel less lonely, feed me and Idk, helped around making everything nice. \n\nThat was a bit of a time ago. Now she still expects lots and lots of emotional labour of me. My house growing up was never a particularly dear place for me and my house now feelt like the first place I could call my own and be happy, but she has taken that away from me. I love her so much and I would give her everything, exept that I already feel like I do. I'm her therapist, I make sure to go out with her and shopping wherever she wants, I bring her gifts to try and make feel better, cook her favourite things when I think she will be tired of work... She tells me things like that \"she feels like she could have separated from my dad a lot earlier and made our childhood better\" or \"the thing that she likes most about their separation is that she feels like she has me back\". I need to reassure her that it's not true, that everything she did was the best, that she's a great mother and to not think about the past even if I know that (even if she had the best intentions) she is absolutely right about her fears.\n\nThis is getting too long but, my mother has done the best she could for me, but I don't want to baby her all my life. I can't voice my problems because they will make her upset, I work for her and my brother (so he can study and her not be worried about money) and I have lost all my space. But she has donde so much for me! I have nowhere to go, no studies, no nothing, but I still have the impulse to abandon them and go away. I know they will suffer greatly if I do! But I kind of feel like I shouldn't be caring for my family, my parents should be caring for me!\n\nAm I being and asshole or entitled brat? Thanks and sorry, feel free to call me out. (If you need more details I will respond, I didn't want to make this even longer). ",

      "description": "It sounds bad. I know. But hear me out. \n\nMy friend, who I will call L, myself, and a few other friends of mine were all talking about our plans for after high school, university applications and whatnot. All of us had applied to universities or colleges except L. They said that they were going to do a fifth year. That’s cool. Then they said they’re taking TWO gap years to travel around and explore themselves. They don’t plan to work during this time. Not really my problem. They can figure that out. But they said after they’re not going to attempt to get any degree, and just jump straight into the workforce. They said they want to do freelance photography (which I agreed, you don’t need a degree for) or be an engineer. This is where I had a problem. \n\nEngineering is a super competitive field that is difficult to work in without the proper knowledge and education. I said to them that they’ll never get a job in engineering without a degree. They said they can, with proper job experience. I asked how they would get this job experience without a degree. L was planning to go into engineering on a HIGH SCHOOL CO OP and nothing else. They said they’re smart and believe it would work. I said “just because you believe the world is one way, doesn’t mean it is.” They seemed really upset and it’s been bothering me for a while.  \n\nSo, I ask, \nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: for clarification, L had a very much “holier then thou” attitude about it. Basically trying to say they could be way better then any of us without going to university because they’re so smart and bright. And it was in fact a conversation where we were bouncing ideas off each other. \n\nEdit: alright, I accept my judgement. The way I phrased things was definitely not great, and while I never apologized, it blew over very very quick. It was on a Friday, I didn’t see L all weekend, they were completely fine when I saw them again. The only thing I’m salty about is people insulting me for saying you can’t become an engineer without some kind of degree. Engineering is something that requires a lot of specific skills and knowledge not taught in high school. Idk, if you’re an engineer without a university or college degree, leave a comment. \n\nEdit: I googled it and you legally cannot become an engineer without a degree where I live because of safety reasons",

      "description": "So I am curious of who is in the right and who is in the wrong here so back story: I am a 16 year old homeschooled boy and I have a cat and a dog since we live in the country. The dog is new and not house broken yet so we are trying to crate train him but yesterday he got into the kitten's food and had an upset stomach all day. So of course last night he shit in his crate. \n\n\nNow I am 16 and I have had a puppy before so even though it was 10 pm for me last night, I got up and cleaned the kennel, got new towels for him to sleep on, found and alternative to the box that has shit on it now, and put the towels in the washer. I had meant to stay up to put the towels into the dryer and go to sleep but by the time they stopped Fini (the dog) was asleep and so was my cat so I didn't want to wake him and listen to him whine for 15 or 20 minutes because it was already past midnight. \n\n\nSo even though I am homeschooled I wake up at 3 am to pack my mom's lunch for work and I am expected to stay up afterwards, even though I don't always do that because I am always tired, today though my mother over slept and I didn't get up to pack her lunch. She complains about her lunch being too small anyway so today she can have what she wants, but on top of that I accidentally toss her sweatshirt into the water bowl from the couch because I am too tired to move and she starts getting upset and calls me lazy for not wanting to get up off the couch. She just sounds really disappointed so after she leaves I try to stay awake out of some version of spite but that ends up going to hell. \n\nI have to call my mom hourly because of reasons and when I do at 8 am she gets upset and says that she will take away the cat and dog if I keep using them as an excuse but I don't think that  am using them as an excuse, at least I don't mean to be.  But the thing about that that makes me really mad is that she said that she cares about my education more than them but when she stay home from work for some reason I get barely any work done because she keeps calling me every five minutes. \n\n\nThis is mostly for a rant but I am curious on who is right or if I need to apologize to her, Im going to go eat now and hope for a reply soon, opinions and critics are welcomed.\n\n   ",

      "description": "I feel as I might be exagarreting. But everyone I have talked to has told me my roommate is a creep and i should report it to my school campus. \n\nWe are both women sharing a room on our college campus. I tolerate her most of the time..we have had our conflicts but they have been resolved. More like I try to keep the peace and don't make a big deal. But last night I was sleeping and all of a sudden woke up and my roommate was just there standing by my bed staring at me. I of course screamed and said, \"What the Fuck is wrong with you!\" She got scared and turned around to go to her bed. I was justified in feeling freaked out. This all happened at 4 am. She then apologized and said she was trying to tell me that my breathing was a bit weird. That I wasn't snoring but that my breathing was weird. That she was going to wake me up by shaking my bed!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFist of all she could of just nudged me to wake me up. Or called me by my name...instead if just creepily standing by my bed staring at me at 4AM! And deciding that shaking my bed was the best course of action! If I hadn't woken up I don't know how long she would have stood there. And honestly I would have let that pass if her previous actions hadn't weirded me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night I told her she talked in her sleep, just joking about it. I wasn't mad...I just thought it was a bit funny. Well the next night she decides to voice record my sleeping and laughing that I grunt in my sleep. I'm not offended by her making fun of the weird noises i make in my sleep but going to the point of recording me in my sleep? That just doesn't feel right. If she felt offended by me just mentioning the fact that she talks in her sleep, she could of just told me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen a bit later I fell asleep mid day in my bed. I expect to at least have the semblance of privacy in my bed. I woke up form my nap to find out she had taken a picture of me being asleep. She told me this herself, and showed me the picture of me sleeping with my eyes a bit open. This weirded me out again but I brushed it off as her sense of humor. Mind you my roommate is 26 and I was 20 at the time. Who takes pictures of people in their sleep? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have had some issues before. When we first met since we have another roommate we had an issue regarding toilet paper. Im assuming my other roommate put a poop stained piece of toilet paper in the bin and my 26 year old roommate took a picture of this poop stained paper and sent it to us by text. I told her next time she has a problem or concern to just tell us in person. Instead of sending me someone elses poop stained papers by text. She always complains about my cleanliness and I am quite clean. My other roommate is much more dirty and leaves her pots on the stove. The one time i left it she complained about me...yet she never complains about the other girl. She also got annoyed by my coughing when I was sick and complained that I was being too loud on the phone. I'm always as quiet as I can be. I feel that im being restricted because i can't do anything without feeling her judge mental eyes. Yet the other girl is gross...she constantly farts loudly at any time of the day and yet she doesn't tell her shit. I can go on but I'll stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with what happened last night I don't know if I am justified in feeling freaked out and calling someone on campus so I can tell her to respect my boundaries. AITA for wanting to clear things up and am I justified for feeling weirded out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We first met up 2 weeks ago at my house and hung out 5 times already and I weirdly already met her mom who thinks highly of me. \n\nAnyways, we planned to hangout Saturday after she went shopping with her mom. I text her earlier in the day to ask what time she was thinking of coming. I see her call me like 10 mins later but don’t answer because I didn’t feel like talking and I was about to take a nap (Why do people gotta call when you text them... like just text back smh). \n\nSo I call her like an hour later. She says she can come around 6 and I say, “I can’t wait until my tongue is in your pooper again” . I don’t hear anything for a few seconds and I say “hello?” and then she hangs up. She texts me 20 mins later and calls me an asshole because I was on speaker and her mom heard and her mom doesn’t know we had sex yet. So she cancelled the plans and idk if we’ll hang again. \n\nFirst I’m thinking wtf was the point of putting me on speaker phone? Why can’t you just talk like normal person and not have everyone around you hear your convo? But then I kinda feel bad because her mom had respect for me now idk if I’d be able to look her in the eyes after that lol. So Am I the asshole?? ",

Our child has seen this.\n\nThey were together for a few months 8 years ago, they then broke up and a few months after they broke up he passed away. I know she had kept some of his stuff and I did not have a problem with that. She also does have a tattoo of him on her (her only tattoo).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may be worth noting that once I left after our big fight, she went through my stuff and found a shoebox with some things my ex of 5 years made.

      "description": "I’ve been in a friends with benefits relationship with John for the past five years. During this time it has been on and off, and our arrangement would always stop when either of us were dating other people or in a serious relationship. The rules were that we were always honest with each other if we were seeing someone else, and we would immediately halt if this were the case. \n\nTo give some context, I have known John since I was a kid, as we are close family friends. However, when this agreement began John was adamant that we must keep it a secret as it could be problematic if our families found out. \n\nAfter I returned from overseas in April this year, we resumed our FWB ‘relationship’. In June, I became suspicious that John was seeing someone else after a mutual friend made a comment about seeing him out with another girl. I asked him about this, and he said that he had a girlfriend while I was overseas but he had broken up with her before we resumed. I found it a little strange that he did not tell me this, but since we had always been honest with each other in the past I brushed this off (big mistake). \n\nA few weeks ago John messaged me and asked me to come over. As I was at work, I told him that I would message him that night. When I finished my shift, I invited him over to my house. He responded and said that he couldn’t, as he was at Bonnie’s house. When I asked who Bonnie was, he said that she was his girlfriend, and that he thought I knew that. I freaked out and immediately blocked him on Facebook messenger. I now know that this was some kind of weird power play, but I am ultimately still confused as to why he decided to tell me this way.\nAfter he realised that I had blocked him, he texted my phone and asked if I was okay. He apologised, and said that he had “some things to work out”. I asked him how long he had been dating her, and he reluctantly told me that he had been with her since February. Keep in mind that I had also seen his family since then, and no one had ever mentioned that he had a girlfriend, nor did I see any posts on social media of John and Bonnie. I was unaware that this girl existed until this moment.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusting and messaged some of my friends to tell them what had happened. Each of them all said the same thing- that I should tell Bonnie. I was hesitant to do this as I did not want to ruin this poor girl’s life. I slept on it and in the morning I found her on facebook (through mutual friends and thankfully Bonnie isn’t that common of a name where I’m from). I sent her a message request explaining the whole situation, and telling her that I had screenshots if she wanted to see them. She was shocked and told me that her and John were actually planning to celebrate their one year anniversary soon (more surprises) and that he had lied to me about when they started dating (not that it even mattered at this point). \nShe asked for the screenshots and told me that she would break up with him the next day. Despite the horrible situation, she was thankful for me for telling her.\n\nA week later I received a message from John’s best friend, Kane, telling me that what I had done was absolutely disgusting. Although he was angry at John, he said that I was in the wrong for breaking up their relationship. He explained that Bonnie was suicidal and that I had caused her serious harm. He also said that John’s mother (who is my mother’s best friend) did not believe that I didn’t know John had a girlfriend. Kane also said that all the mutual friends he has spoken to think the same thing. Obviously this is untrue, as this whole thing wouldn’t have happened if I knew he had a girlfriend. I had to tell my mother what had happened before she heard it from John’s mother, and now this has caused a rift between the two of them.\n\nI honestly thought that I would want to know if I was being cheated on and that telling Bonnie was the right thing to do. I’m not looking for sympathy at all, but I know that I have told the 100% truth in this situation and I have the evidence to prove it. I don’t doubt that John has told a different version of this story to his friends, however I still feel like absolute trash, despite this being entirely his fault. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling her?

      "description": "Some back story for context:\n\nMy wife usually doesn't drink alcohol because she's allergic. Her hands and feet and face will turn red and she says it can be quite painful at times. In the past, when she'd have the occasional drink, we'd have to leave venues or events early because she wouldn't feel good.\n\nWe eventually discovered that if she takes a tablet of Pepcid AC before she drinks, the bad side-effects that she usually experiences are muted enough that we can enjoy a couple of drinks together, which is really nice for me because we can both cut loose for awhile. Plus, she's usually a very stoic, quiet person so it's great to see her laugh a little louder and speak up a bit more.\n\nCue the night where all this came to a head. I was out at dinner with my wife and one of my friends. My wife decided that she was going to order a drink with dinner. I reminded her that she hadn't taken any Pepcid AC and that after dinner, we planned on going back to my friend's house for a night of gaming. I suggested that maybe drinking wasn't such a good idea. She decided to get the drink anyway but couldn't finish it. However, my friend overheard this and I guess he had a real problem with this because later that night he confronted me and called me very controlling and that I had no right to dictate what my wife can or cannot drink. \n\nI tried to explain to him all the info above but he wasnt hearing it. I was so shocked and hurt that he would just jump to this conclusion about me even though he's known me for years. \n\nSo, I dunno. Was I the asshole in this scenario? Was my friend justified in calling me out for this? I'd like to know other people's opinion. If you all find me in the wrong for this, I'm totally willing to apologize to my friend and wife. But I still feel like he didn't totally understand the situation and that it wasn't really any of his business...",

      "description": "Some quick background.  My wife and are mid 30 professionals, together for 7 years with 2 kids, age 4 and 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my wife has been getting more and more upset lately with the fact that after she goes to bed I like to load my vape and smoke some weed, often resulting in me falling asleep on the couch until I eventually wake up (usually around 4am) and crawl into bed.\n\nI smoked weed before we met and during the onset of our relationship, when I still had a lot of \"me time\".  Obviously as our lives started becoming less about us and more about our family, my weed smoking slowed.  Just recently though, weed became legal where I live and I got back into it, more frequently.\n\nWhen I began smoking more regularly, she let me know, that she has never been a huge fan of hanging out with me when I'm stoned.  I don't see a huge difference in my personality when I smoke, but it is obvious to her, so I agreed that I wouldn't smoke when we were together.\n\nMy wife has always been an early to bed type person (like 10:30ish), whereas I have always been a night owl (1ish).  So, lately I use that time when my wife goes to bed smoke my dope and reddit or watch youtube or movies or whatever.\n\nThe issue she says she has is that I often end up falling asleep on the couch and either she will wake up without me in bed and feel the need to come downstairs and wake me up to come to bed, or when I wake up on my own and come to bed, I'm disrupting her sleep.  My wife is a light sleeper, and in the past would use earplugs and a blindfold when sleeping to block out any possibly stimuli, but sine we had kids she doesn't use earplugs because... kids.\n\nI have tried coming to bed when she goes to bed, but I just lay there watching netflix at a volume that is barely audible until I fall asleep at my usual time, and it is miserable and makes me feel resentful.\n\nWe've talked about all of this and have come to an impasse.  I tried to explain to her that I enjoy the few late night hours that I have to myself to do the tings that I enjoy and I don't feel they have any significant impact on her.  She does not agree and feels that waking up in the middle of the night to \"bring me to bed\" or my coming to bed is a huge interference in her sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?  I have no idea and await your judgement.",

      "description": "So yeah - from that title alone I sounds like the asshole but there's a fair bit more going on there and I'm in quite the dilemma.\n\nOkay so my direct family consists of me, my older brother, and my two parents. My parents are pretty wealthy, so ever since we were little kids my brother and I have always been told not to worry about college funds, our parents would pay for it.\n\nSo last year, I was still in school and figuring out where I wanted to apply, and my brother went off to college. Now his college is several hours from where my family lives so we don't really hear much from him other than the mandatory \"one text per day\" rule my parents established when they agreed to pay for our colleges. Aaand a couple months into his college, we got a call from one of his roommates.\n\nSo apparently my brother had disappeared the previous day and his roommate was panicking, so he tols us what my brother had really been up to at college. Bro had been using all his spending money on drugs, hadn't gone to any classes since the first week, and was basically wasting money.\n\nAnyway, my mother at this point was freaking out, not just because she learned that her son was messing with drugs but because his roommate hasn't seen him in days and because my brother isn't responding to any texts or calls.\n\nThankfully, he shows up at our door, safe and home from college, and announces that he's dropping out of college. \n\nSo now it's several months later and my brother had been living at home until my parents finally told him to get his shit together. They told him that they were going to use some of the money they had planned to use for his freshman year of college to get him clean and then get him some round flight tickets so that he could see the world, do some volunteering, figure out what he wants to do in life.\n\nBasically, they're giving him a gap year - my parents are traditional and value college education highly, and are still hoping he'll go to college. But now here's how I come into the picture. \n\nThese past few years, I've been really working hard, getting experience, building my resume, and my efforts have been rewarded...in the sense that I have the opportunity of a lifetime, to go to my dream school. \n\nMind, this dream school is NOT college but is ONLY a preapatory school, but is still the best in the country, and will probably set me up for life. It's still possible, though, for me to go just as far if I don't take this opportunity.\n\nAnd in addition: this \"opportunity\" is as expensive as college. Exactly the same amount as is left in my brother's remaining college fund. And thus, my dilemma. If I go, it's going to be from HIS (currently unused) college fund. My own college will still be provided for. Also, my parents have made it clear that these funds are only to be used for education, so he won't be getting any money from this unless he decides to go to college.\n\nSo AITA if I use the money that was originally alotted for him for my own education? If he sticks by his decision, the only difference will be whether I go to my dream school or not. If he changes his mind, it'll be much harder for him to take back his decision to drop out of college. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone, hoping to get some insight on a recent issue. I am struggling to see the issue from their POV so I thought Reddit might help.\n\nThe past weekend was my country’s national holiday, with celebrations taking place on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOn the Saturday, a good friend’s partner organised for us to go on her parent’s boat as they go to the foreshore every year to watch the fireworks. Just 5 of us were originally going (three of which were high school friends plus me and the other girlfriend whose parents who own the boat). This girl (who I’m pretty close to as we have hung out quite a bit over the last year and she’s great) then suggested also inviting me and my partner’s roommate, and then I suggested just one more friend who lives around the corner from us, as he is is very close to both my boyfriend and my roommate, and we had discussed what we were going to do on aus day previously.\n\nThe day was great and we had a lot of fun, however two girls who went to school with the main group have not been happy. They feel like they are left and out and excluded often. While I get that would feel shit (we’ve all been there) I’m confounded for a few reasons.\n\nThe first girl, who I’m a lot closer with and see more often (social sport) is pretty much always included. However, she is pretty flaky usually bails on 80% of things she is invited to, if not more. Sometimes extremely late as well. My boyfriend hosted a games night in December last year, she was noncommittal about coming doing the whole “ooh sounds fun maybe” then waited till about 9pm on the night to text him saying she wasn’t coming. Also in the entire time I’ve known her, she has never once organised a dinner with me or my boyfriend or invited us to do anything. Last year I messaged her a week or so after the games night asking her if she was free to come bowling with the same group who went on the boat and she left me on unread. I made an effort to reach out to ask her if she was okay and if I had done anything to upset her and she said no she’s just been super busy.\n\nThe other girl is very nice but I’m not very close to her as I barely see her. She doesn’t attend pretty much 99% of the things she’s invited to, and like the other girl, I’ve never been invited to do something with her and her partner, despite making several attempts to invite her out.\n\nAs a protest to not being invited on Saturday, both girls refused to come to me and my boyfriend’s party on Sunday, which they were invited to. Again, this doesn’t make logical sense to me.\n\nPlus, as everyone knows with boats, you can’t just invite whoever you want due to finite space. Plus, we were crashing their parents party, and the girl hosting wanted to invite a couple of her own friends she didn't know through her boyfriend. One of the girls indicated to another friend it would have been nice if we did something that everyone could be included in (Sunday?!) he asked her if she was planning on organising something and she said no.\n\nWhile I totally acknowledge it feels shit to be left out of something, it feels just as shitty to constantly be rejected after making an effort with people. Also this was organised by a friend’s girlfriend, who one of the girls would only see once or twice a year. Plenty of times the two girls will organise hanging out with my roommate and their other friend and none of us are invited, so I don’t understand the double standard? Are we the ass holes? Is there something I’m missing?\n\nWe are all late twenties if that matters.",

      "description": " My roommate has a lot of anger issues. He yells at me a lot, and on occasion has threatened to call the cops and tell them I'm  threatening to harm myself to get me on a hold. He doesn't do that often, but he's done it enough that I take it seriously. FWIW I am not suicidal, don't self-harm. He knows this. He also know that psych holds scare me.  I'm moving out without any kind of heads up. My friends are going to help me move all my stuff out in one afternoon. Electricity is in my name, as is internet. I'm transferring them to my new apartment. He'll have one day of a heads up to get his own electricity and internet. He can't afford rent without me. I'm not on the lease, but he does rely on my rent payments.  He's a terrible roommate for a lot of reasons. He's a total slob, just disgusting. And while that's a deal breaker for me in a roommate, the reason why I'm moving out on the fly with literally no warning is that he scares me. He's thrown things at me and left bruises. His laziness and refusal to clean up after himself puts my dog at risk. His dog is horribly untrained, and has knocked me down/snarled at me. But really, what it comes down to is I'm afraid he's going to fly off the handle and hurt me or follow through with his threats to call the cops on me. I do see a psychiatrist, but I'm nowhere near being a threat to myself or others. I just get super anxious sometimes. He yells at me a lot, talks down to me, tells me I ruin everything, I'm a bad person, I've ruined his life. I need to move out, I know this. But I've never left someone in the lurch like this before. My friends helped me plan this, and they say it is for my safety. I feel like I'm doing something very wrong. AITA? ",

      "description": "First time poster and sorry doing this on mobile\n\n\nA little background first: \n\n        \n\n      My father who is 49yrs owns a motorcycle and a 1990's lexus 300. Around this time of the year the mornings are a bit tough here in San Diego,\nSo naturally he has been using his car instead of his motorcycle. \n\n      I live with my girlfriend at her family's house.   I own the ford and she has a honda but she can't drive yet.\n\n\nMy Father was getting new ignition coils for his car (1990's lexus 300e) and he put them back in the wrong order therefore causing a miss fire. He works a lot so he doesn't have the time and apparently the will to go back and fix his mistake. \n\n      So I let him borrow my used ford that I just bought 2 weeks ago until he fixes his car because I know how much it sucks to ride in cold mornings. My gf says its okay if I use her honda car instead. \n\n     2 weeks goes by and he still hasn't fixed his car. \"Okay\" I say \"He works a lot and getting the intake manifold of his lexus takes time\".  So I just text him if he has fixed his lexus. Apparently he want to sell the lexus and buy another used car. Okay fine.\n\n     I text him every other day bugging him about my car and he says he will get it done \"next week, sorry\" ...he says the same things for the next 2 weeks. \n\n     Its been a month now and he still has my car and no work has been done in the lexus . I agree its  100% my fault for telling to use it as long as he needs it but Im I the asshole for bugging he constantly to give me back my car? I just feel a little guilty since he is my dad and he is provided me with so much...but  idk Im a selfish little brat too?\n\n     He knows how to fix his car its just time consuming and tedious. \n\nHe owns a 2001 Honda crb just is you're curious\n\n",

Hes a pervert, hes creepy and lazy. He loves to make out like he does so much work when he really just shoves all thos responsibilities onto us other workers. It's very well known no one likes him. \n\nOne shift, DL comes into the store clearly in a foil mood and begins to complain about the other staff members loudly in front of customers. Two in particular. Talking about how they hardly did anything the sift before (had a huge delivery and they didn't manage to get it all out) where one of the workers places things, everything he could complain about he did.\n\nNow,I'm on really good terms with the workers hes complaining about and I asked if he had told then he didn't like how they were doing things and he said he had multipul times. I know what a bullshitter this guy is. So I asked them. And he hasn't said a thing. I told both co workers what hed said.\n\nIn the end one of the co workers sat him down and confronted him about it. DL blamed ot on his diabetes, that hed been stressed and he didn't mean any of it. Everyone hates him even more. \n\nI told my dad this and he looked at me like I'd done the wrong with and I was just stirring shit and shouldn't have said anything. But I felt like they had a right to know since it was about their job and it was the manager complaining?\n\nI dont know. Was I the asshole here? Should I have kept quiet?",

      "description": "My boyfriend moved to my state to live with me and go back to college.As he had no job here when he moved I paid all expenses for several months totaling several thousand dollars(which I am not especially upset about but it is relevant to the rest).1 month or so after he moved was my birthday. He had no money at the time so I bought my own birthday dinner and he said he'd pay me back when he got a job. Well he didn't. He did pay his half of rent and food to be fair but not his half of utilities,internet, renters insurance,phone bill and never offered to pay me back. He started school and quit his job(which to be fair would've interfered with school due to the hours required) and took less than the full amount of loan money he was offered which meant that I had to cover food expenses by myself every month. Again to be fair he would occasionally contribute but more of the financial burden is on me and I'm Also putting myself through school(and in addition I'm working 20ish hours part time to make up for the fact that I'm paying for more). So I explain to him that he needs to take the full loan this semester and he says ok and that over break he will work more hours(he just stared rating ads online which pays like $100 a month). Well it's been a month and he did neither and break is almost over. In addition, this month he was short on his half of rent by $150 which long story short meant I had to drive 2 hrs to my nearest bank to deposit my Christmas cash to barely scrape by. My last boyfriend did similar things and I think that's why it upsets me because I feel taken advantage of but don't know how to start a conversation about this. He acted like he felt really bad about not being able to pay for stuff before... Am I the asshole for caring about the money?",

      "description": "So we arrange to meet at a busy burger place, I arrive on time and look for her outside, then inside by the door. There's a lot of people standing around, I scan the room a couple of times and then notice her waving; she's already got a table, sharing with three strangers.\n\nI come over smiling and say hi, but she's not happy to see me. She says \"That was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen\". I sit down, not smiling any more. I take off my hat and gloves and put them in my pockets. She says something like \"Oh you're mad at me now because I called you out on being dumb?\". I say I'm not dumb, but she insists. I say \"I was expecting to meet you by the door and it's busy so I didn't see you at first\". She keeps arguing. I say this is a date and I think we should be nice to each other, and if she disagrees we can leave. She says \"You being overly sensitive is not my problem\". I repeat that I'm going to leave if she doesn't want to be nice, and she keeps yelling so I start to get up. She throws her hands up and yells \"Really!?\". I walk out and my wife doesn't follow.\n\n----\n\nI'm not sure whether I did the right thing. I know it's rude of her to be so vocally critical and insulting, especially in front of other people. For some reason she thinks if we meet up and she sees me first that I've done something wrong, like I don't care about her or I'm being lazy. I've tried to talk about it but all she says is that I should try harder. She's naturally very observant while I tend to start with where I expect things to be and narrow it down. Obviously I don't think this is important enough to argue about since the extra time I took was maybe 5 seconds.\n\nFor context, the burger place is right by our house and she wasn't in any danger walking back by herself. She says I am an asshole for leaving her, but I feel that the ultimatum \"stop calling me stupid or I'm leaving\" is such an easy hurdle. I didn't want to leave, but I wanted to sit there having a shit time eating an expensive burger even less. Am I the asshole?",

I told her that she needs to sort it out and I won’t be paying any fine as it’s all her fault. She said she can’t clean it and asked if I would. I said I would for £24.50 as she shouldn’t have left it out in the first place and we don’t clean each other’s stuff and it’s annoying to see her grim dishes left out all the time. She just ignored me after the request for money. I’m my head a fine will stop her and make her be more tidy. The dishes are very dirty some kind of food still left in them and just water poured on top luckily the window is near the sink so I just leave it open. Should I have cleaned the dishes for free or am I the asshole for asking for money to stop her from getting a fine?",

I go to the library but many weekends/weeknights I just like to study in my room (do laundry, eat real meals, etc). I'm also on call, so sometimes my sleep schedule is awkward (I work in the healthcare industry).\n\nI loved my apartment until the downstairs neighbors moved in. I have no issue with them as people, but the fact that they play the drums, bass, guitar, keyboards and sing \\*directly\\* below my bedroom. It's an old house. Thin walls. I bought a pair of Bose QCII noise cancelling headphones. It doesn't do the job. I own two fans and a white noise generator. Carpeted much of my room. I still just feel/hear bass and drums no matter what I do. Again, old house (1800s).\n\nThey won't play after 9:30pm on weeknights, but often play from 7:00-9:30 when I'm home. The exact hours I am awake/alert for studying. They'll play all day on weekends occasionally. I get no advance notice (which I've asked for), and they aren't great at checking their phones during performances.\n\nLocal laws aren't clear on how loud you can be during the day. I can say my grades have sharply increased since going to cafe's every night to study instead of going home, but so have my credit card bills. I called the cops on them one day and they were pissed, but I enjoyed being able to study and relax in peace. It was great.\n\n1.) Is it so hard/expensive to just play with headphones when playing solo, or to just play in their own rooms?  \n2.) Is dealing with drums in residential areas just a part of city living? Is playing with mutes really that bad for solo drumming practice?  \n3.) When I say the walls are thin, I mean I can hear muffled conversations downstairs pretty well.\n\nHaven't decided if I ask them to stop playing when I'm home or I just sublet my bedroom. I could handle \\~3 hours of scheduled band practice on a weekend but my course load is quite high to deal with much more than that. I'd be open to exceptions.",

      "description": "Background: So I’ve (F25) been seeing this guy (M29) for about 6 months now.  It’s hard to tell how serious we are because he won’t open up with his emotions and quite frankly - I can’t even tell if he’s had a gf before. We’re exclusive at the very least. \n\nSo last night, home for the holidays, I post a Snapchat of me and my male BF for the past 8 years who also has a gf. I didn’t think anything of it honestly, but now as of today, he’s deleted me off Snapchat and won’t tell me why.  I realize this is high-key ridiculous and immature, but AITA? My mom says I should see it from his point of view where I would be upset if he was posting pics of other girls. I mean I feel like I would have at least asked who it was before deleting and ghosting. \n\nThanks for your judgements in advance. ",

      "description": "I recently bought a home in a dead end street. My home is at entrance to the street but the yard/property itself is on the larger side, and the old owners used to let people walk through the yard to reach the connecting street. I guess on reddit it'd be known as a desire path.\n\nNow I'm not a bah-humbug sort of guy. I like having neighbors and I'll say hello, wave, make small talk, etc. However, I also like my privacy and space and I'm a big lawn sort of guy, so I've started personalizing it and have asked numerous people not to cut through my yard. I'm in the process of having a large privacy fence installed around my property to prevent it from happening.\n\nNow if I had many acres and someone was walking along the edge, I wouldn't care. But this is 20 feet from my home, and I feel uncomfortable having so many people go through my yard and I don't want to leave my curtains closed 24/7. It also wore a path in the yard, which is unsightly and I was hoping to set up my lawn ornaments, do some landscaping, etc which wouldn't be possible with strangers coming through. Not letting them use my yard adds *maybe* 2-3 extra minutes to their walk.\n\nA few neighbors have expressed their complaints and feel I'm being unfair. I've gotten a lot of looks and whispers as well. In particular, a family with like 6 kids who used to use the yard are very rude now. I've never been rude or hostile, just asked they don't use the shortcut and am now putting up the fence.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\n\nSo there isn't much context needed here but I have a dog that I've had for 5 years and we are currently living in a house with 9 other people (ages vary) They're all family but the house can only house 3-4 people realistically before it starts to feel cramped so theres always a lot of tension\n\nAs a the dog owner I try my best to keep my dog in line and well bahaved which works because her only major problem behaviorly** is strangers \n\nHowever, she sheds ALOT. I bathe her as often as I can and brush her but i do admit that, due to my horrible memory, I don't do those often enough which leads to hair getting stuck to EVERYTHING (food, clothes, beds, etc)\n\nThis leads to fights amongst my family members and it hurts me to see my dog treated poorly because of something she can't control\n\nShes screamed at, locked into a room for hours, hit (pretty rarely though)\nAnd when I try to defend her and try to keep them away from my dog they start to go after me with the verbal abuse\n\nNow the recent happenings, she loved getting on my bed but now that I've converted to a bunk bed and I'm on the top bunk with my sister at the bottom, she doesn't understand that she's not allowed on my sisters bed.\n\nEvery time I or anyone sees her we tell her to get off and she does with no compliants but she still does it everyonce in awhile and my sister is sick of it. \n\nToday she decided the best idea is to kick her out the room before she goes to school. But my dog doesn't exactly listen to her nor anyone really if she's woken up. It normally takes her a minute or so. So she didn't leave when my sister woke her and yelled at her to get out. She also didn't listen to me when I told her to get out once my sister woke me up. So my sister proceeded to get a broom to coax her out (bad idea because her previous owners used to abuse her with a broom) my dog attacked the broom and refused to budge. \n\nNow I'm annoyed that I was woken up (at that point I had 2-3 hours of sleep) and pissed that my dog is now stressed out and my sister is pissed cuz I need to \"control my animal and stop being a little b***h\"\n\nTL;DR my family hates my dog for shedding all over everything and verbally abuses her and me \n\nAdvice would be nice but I really just wanted to rant..what do I even do at this point?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "She’s the youngest of us (we’re four, my other two sisters are 14). I’m the oldest at 21. I’ve felt weird about this situation for a while, mostly because it’s “wrong” to hate family, and because she’s so much younger so I should behave more maturely for my age.\n\n\nEverything is a constant competition for her. She always wants to be the best, and if my other sisters do something to outshine her, they’re “bragging” or “stuck up”. She’s very toxic and like a snake, I guess. \n\nThe other two usually refrain from telling her things because they know Youngest will find a way to use it against them. \n\nShe likes to pick on them. For example, she calls them prostitutes and perverts to insult them. She compares her underdeveloped body to their more developed bodies, and sneers about it (they don’t wanna grow up). She’s stuck up, laughs at their misfortune, and is always causing conflict about something. She’s also mother’s favorite because she’s sweet to mom and does everything she asks for, but tries to undermine us. I always say Youngest is becoming a budding narcissist.\n\nWith me, she doesn’t respect me at all and parrots my mother (‘you’re always butting in where you don’t belong’ when I try defending someone), among other things. She has a huge victim complex and always provokes and taunts and is overall nasty. I’ve never met a 12 y/o so evil before. \n\nBecause I’m so sick of Youngest, I’ve been ignoring her lately. If she starts picking a fight, I’ll ignore her. I’ll tell her to stay out of my room, too, and usually don’t share stuff with her or interact the way I do with my other sisters.\n\nI don’t like being unfair and having preferential treatment, but I can’t handle her personality. I can’t handle somebody who would harm others and be so poisonous. My other sisters have their own share of flaws and selfishness but they’re not toxic by putting others below them.",

      "description": "Hey everyone! I answer a lot of questions here so it's nice to finally ask if what I am thinking of doing is the right thing or not. \n\nI live in a nice apartment in the downtown area of a major city. I rent this apartment (as in I'm not the owner just a tenant) and three other people also live there (none of them are the landlord). It's a good setup for me as I'm a college student, the room has it's own bathroom, the rent is a bargain, and the guys I live with are pretty cool.\n\nRight now I don't have classes so I came back to my hometown where I am busy studying for finals. I recently got a phone call from a housemate. He told me a friend of his is coming to stay with him for a few days. That is not the problem. It's perfectly normal at our house for this to happen. We have this foldable bed that can be wheeled into our rooms for guests or they just stay in the living room in that bed (what usually happens is this).\n\nHowever, my housemate has asked me if I the guy can crash in my bedroom. And I have a problem with this. I don't know the guy (though he doesn't sound like a troublemaker), it's my room (which I guess sounds petty and probably is but it is my place) and it's not really clean (it's not dirty as I usually clean it weekly but the last week at college was crazy with all the group projects and tests so I didn't have time to clean). Besides, the bed is fitted with my sheets and all. It is worth noting that my housemate says he will make my bed with sheets that belong to him and will clean the room. But I'm weirded out by the thought of him going in there and clean the place, the bathroom and change the bed sheets. I don't really want him to do that. And I don't want some guy I don't know sleeping in my bed. It's weird. Why can't he sleep in my housemates bed or in the guest bed at the living room? It's the way it always is. I don't get why this guy should get special treatment. I would never ask anyone for this.\n\nSo, I'm supposed to call him with a reply today. WIBTA if I said no?",

      "description": "My roommate and I are currently stuck together on a lease. She hasn't had a valid ID for 2 years. When her ID expired, I kept reminding her to get a new one. She kept putting it off. Neither of us drive, but I found 7 different people who all offered to drive her. However, she was too busy playing on her 3DS to accept any of the rides. She always just said \"I don't want to go right now. Some other time.\" Some of the people offered more than once, but she always refused to put down her 3DS long enough to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swear, she is addicted to it. This went on for 2 years. Every day, whenever she wasn't at work, she would just sit in the living room and play on her 3DS from the minute she got home until the minute she went to bed. She wouldn't do anything else. No house chores, no errands, nothing. I kept nagging her about getting a new ID, telling her how much she needs one, explaining why it's important, but she wouldn't even listen to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago, her debit card expired, and a new one wasn't mailed. She has no checks because she just never wanted to get any. She can't go to the bank for her new debit card because she needs an ID to do that. So now she has no access to her money. Still, she wouldn't do anything about it. She expected me to just start paying the full rent and utilities by myself, as well as buy her groceries. I can't afford all that easily on my individual income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she still refused to put down her 3DS and do something to fix this, I hid the charger while she was sleeping and told her that she can't have it back until she gets a new ID and new debit card to be able to access her money and pay her half of everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter only 1 day of her 3DS being dead, she started flipping out. I mean, she went nuts. She was like a drug addict having a crazy withdrawal. Still, I didn't return her charger. This seems to be working though because she finally went to the BMV to get a new ID. She still needs to wait for it to come in the mail before she can get a new debit card though.",

      "description": "So basically I’ve known this lady for about 4 years now and on and off throughout that period she has tried to recruit me to become an Arbonne consultant. She hasn’t been too hardcore, just checking in one or two (well maybe three to four) times a year to see if I may be interested in being a consultant or purchasing any of their products.\n\nThe last time she contacted me we ended up meeting up because I felt so bad as she is honestly a lovely lady apart from the whole MLM thing. After I turned her down again as “network marketing” is definitely not my thing, she asked if I would want to host a party. Feeling guilty I said I would possibly be interested but never fully committed to a date. \n\nSince then she has texted me a few times asking me to let her know when a good time to host the party would be and I honestly feel so guilty but I keep pushing it for (mostly legit) reasons. The thing is though, I am 100% not interested in hosting a party and after asking my friends, none of them want to come, nor are the interested in buying anything from this company. I could probably convince maybe one or two of friends to come but they wouldn’t buy anything so it would be wasting even more of her time. \n\nI’m going to text her over the next couple of days and let her politely let her know it won’t be happening but my guilt and anxiety is eating me up even though I never fully committed in the first place.

I don't want to discourage him by any means but honestly I have a higher paying job than him which pays way more than his 60k$ job. \n\nWe always wanted to have kids and we bith agree that its the righr time because I'm 37 and I'm not getting any younger. He was involved with some start-ups which were a disaster and he lost a majority of his savings. He's just not lucky with money. He always keeps talking about how commercialising space is going to be the next big thing or about how he wants to start a VR based streaming service etc. I tried to be supportive but lady luck jever favoured him and I dont ridicule him for that. But honestly he has little formal education and he's dumb.\n\nBut he's depressed. Now, he wants to start another business. The idea is good enough but it will take a long time for it to be implemented and I'm sure it's going to end up badly for him. I decided that I've had enough of his antics. I dont want him to be depressed anymore. Maybe it's time to think of something doable now. \n\nYesterday he was crying and told me that he wanted to do something but he felt like a complete failure. I told him that he can be a good fathe r to our children and asked him to quit his job and stay at home. I just wanted to make him feel better and wanted him to be more practical. \n\nBut it ended up upsetting him so much and asked me if I resented him. I just told him that his new idea would not work out( I'm an investment banked and I've seen enough people just fail at things) . He just left and hasn't returned. I dont know where he went. I told this to my sister and she told me that was very rude of me.\n\nAITA for being practical? Could I have done this better?\n\n",

      "description": "AITA if it only slipped??? \n\nMy sister [17] is always talking down on things I [16F] do. She always mentions how I’m a “catfish” for wearing makeup, and criticizes the way I dress. Which, I’ll admit bothers me but I try not to pay too much mind. And she always runs to tell my mom when I do something “bad,” like getting a tattoo. \n\nBut the other day she keep insinuating that I’m “promiscuous” because I spent 3 nights away from home, in which I would only come home to shower and leave again. In reality, I was helping a friend who’s mom just had a baby, by driving them around and just babysitting so they could rest. My mom knew this but my sister didn’t. She kept making comments and calling me a “hoe.” \n\nI didn’t really care much, as I know who am I and my mom knew where I was. But she just kept going on and on about how it looked bad, and saying it’s not fair that I don’t get in trouble for doing “those kind of things.” \n\nSo I just blurt out, “ At least I’m not sending nudes.” I only knew she does because she sent some to a friend of mine, and he was being a jerk asking me to send some too, so he could “complete the set.” \n\nMy mom just turns to look at her, and my sister’s face drops. She got her phone taken away and she can’t go out “until further notice.” \n\nMy sister and I don’t have the best relationship, so I don’t feel bad that she got in trouble, I just feel bad because of the disappointment in my mom’s face. I feel like that was something my mom could’ve gone without knowing. And now everyone in the house is super tense and I just feel bad. \n\nBut AITA if it kind of just slipped, even if it was out of spite? ",

      "description": "I really just need to know and what other ways there are to look at this situation. I'm sorry if there is a better place for this, but most other subs seem to be biased towards the child and that wont help me. The background to help render your verdict:\n\nEver since I had my first job my parents (my Father specifically) has asked for money. When I was young and in high school I didn't really think anything of it. We occasionally had some hard times and my mom wasn't always employed so i figured it was my way of giving back. The amount was never all that much either, 50 or so dollars every now and then. \n\nAfter my first high school job, I saved up some money, around 1k, and went to college thinking I would take out some loans and have that 1k to pay for books and be a little buffer. During the end of this year my grandmother passed away leaving my parents and two uncles their belongings and estate to be split equally. This ended up causing my uncles to bicker and fight, but in the end everything was as it should be. Meaning my parents came into a not large, but not insignificant amount of money. Some of this was to be used for me to get braces. My parents made the decision to go through with this and rather than pay the total amount, set up a payment plan.\n\nAs my junior year approached, I was in between jobs and my cushion was gone. I hated it so much but I asked them for 250 dollars to help pay for rent. It killed me inside to do this, but they helped and I was able to make rent. Later on I learned that my Father asked my uncle (his brother that he was still on good terms with) for this money. My mother later on deposited some more money without me asking into my account (somewhere to the tune of 50 dollars a month for 8 months). I told her not to do this, but she told me it was her money and that was how she wanted to spend it. That it was coming directly out of her paycheck every time she got paid and that she didn't want to go through the effort to undo it. My Mom is stubborn.\n\nMy senior year rolls around and my Father gets into a car accident. I go to see him in the hospital the day of and he seems fine and in good spirits. Over the coming months, he takes off of work due to pain and health I believe. My understanding of the situation becomes more and more hazy after this point. All I care about is that I managed to graduate and land a job straight out of college. I start throwing every penny I have at my student loans.\n\nWhile going back to the orthodontist I learn that my parents haven't made any payments on the amount that my braces cost. I take on this debt as well and pay it off. My parents start asking for a bit more from me every now and then, and they only contact me to ask for money. The most being 400 which I am unable to give. I ask them about a budget and to see what their finances look like. From what I can see, they should be able to afford everything without any help from me. I get on to them about asking money from me at this point and begin to get a little upset. I'm working really hard to pay off my loans and pinching pennies but they are unable to budget and get their act together. I stop giving them money at this point.\n\nSome time in the following months two things happen and I am not sure which occurs first. My dad becomes unemployed and he has several digits on his foot removed. I don't know what happened first because I get a text from my Mom saying as much and which hospital room he is in. I go and check it out and again nothing crazy, the doctors aren't sure if things need to be removed or not but they will keep him over night. I go back to work.\n\nI get word that they did end up removing some of his toes. I feel bad but Mom tells me not to worry and that she will take care of Dad. I still get texts asking for money every now and then, sometimes I give them 50 or 70. A year goes by and Mom tells me that my Dad has tried to kill himself. I'm out of town for the week, but when I get back I visit my Mom first. At this point it occurs to me that my parents are living without power, and are behind on rent. Dad planned on committing suicide the around the time the power was going to be shut off. Mom is furious when I see her because according to her, she was unaware that he was asking me for money and that she had no notice that the bills weren't being paid. She tells me he had their only phone for the majority of the time and that now that he was in the psych ward, she had seen the messages from debt collectors. She also informs me that he has been \"talking to other women\" as well.\n\nWe visit my Dad together and she refuses to hug him. I can't really blame her if what she said is true. I decide not to bring this up since he already tried to commit suicide and I don't want to upset anyone further. This is the point where I get really numb to the whole situation. Dad seems happy he's in the psych ward and talks about the warm food and heat they have there. My first thought is that he did this just to get out of his miserable situation at home. I tell myself that's not true, but I can't keep that out of my head.\n\nAnother year goes by and after all this, my Mom goes to work and my Dad sits in his chair in their house collecting disability and doing I don't know what. I continue to get texts asking for money, and a little while later I'll get another one saying they don't need it.\n\nI stopped giving them money and I feel like that lead to this. I feel emotionally manipulated because it always seemed like they were both asking for money. I'm still not sure if what my Mom said was true. I'm emotionally drained and honestly I don't want to see or talk to them anymore. I'm not sure what to think or who is at fault. I am not even sure if I know the whole story.\n\nAm I an asshole for feeling this way and causing all of this?",

      "description": "So maybe 7 or 8 years ago in high school, I used to take an IT class along with a few of my mates and this kid who was disabled. He was a nice enough guy, and very timid and softly spoken. I think it was muscular dystrophy that he had so he found difficult to coordinate himself and could not walk. This kid, let's call him Dan, struggled with the IT coursework and I think I'm right in saying (although I'm no doctor) that muscular dystrophy does not affect the brain, so he was just a bit plain old slow.\n\nBecause I was pretty good at IT and had a free period after the IT class, the teacher asked me to spare an hour after each class (twice a week) to help Dan with his coursework. Although I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of losing half my lunch break twice a week, I said yes because I felt bad for the kid and hoped this would give me some sort of extra credit from the teacher.\n\nThis went on for the rest of the year, maybe 4 or 5 months, until we broke up for the summer break. When we came back to school the next year, Dan wasn't there and everyone just assumed he had changed schools or dropped out for whatever reason.\n\nFast forward another couple of months and one day, during lunch period, the headmaster gathered everyone in our year group into the common room. This had never been done before so we assumed there was an important announcement. With a somber look on his face and in a serious voice he told us \"I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but I've just been informed that Dan Secondname has passed away\".\n\nDan, while not having had many friends, was known to be a lovely guy and liked by everyone so people were understandably upset. Girls were crying and me and all my mates looked at eachother in shock. The headmaster went on, \"it was known to Dan's parents and all the teachers here that he did not have long left and it was his parents wishes that none of you, or Dan, be told that his condition was terminal, so that he could lead as normal life as possible\".\n\nI got to thinking, why the hell would the teacher have gotten me to do all that work with him (I ran the maths, like 30 or 40 hours worth) when she knew full will he was gonna die! I'm also not sure how I feel about Dan's parents' decision not to tell him he was going to die. Pretty sure I'd want to be told of something like that so that I could live my life to the fullest.\n\nSo what do you lot think, am I the asshole?",

I was born a year after they got married and my father and his family were extremely contolling and manipulative to my mom. They got a divorce when i was 3 and my mom got soul custody. My stepdad came into my life a few years later and he has been such a blessing the last 20 years of my life. He has gone above and beyond taking care of me and my mom, In my eyes my stepdad is my only father. With that said I havent seen my biological father in atleast 5 years and I would be lying if i said he hadnt tried reaching out. He has tried to gain access back into my life and everytime ive tried to give him a second chance he is nothing short of a manipulative asshole. I got to the point where i blocked all forms of communication with the entire part of my family, that was 5 years ago. They are toxic people and i'm done dealing with it. Anyway to get to the point my biological father died and a friend of that side of my family contacted me telling me that my father passed away. To be frank Im not sad im not angry and honestly I dont care. He's a stranger to me so why would i spend my time and money to fly out to go to his funeral. I got into contact with one of my aunts and very politly told her that i wouldnt be going and that i offer my condolences and she called me a selfish asshole and called my husband and my 3 month old daughter worthless N*****. They act like just because he donated his sperm I have to be apart of that. So im curious AITA?",

      "description": "Heyo, I‘m sorry if this sounds weird, but I just got into a really bad argument with my roommates and they make me feel very guilty.\n\nSome information you might need first: I have been anorexic for about two years, I‘m in good therapy and have made progress, but I’m still about 10kg/20lbs under my lowest healthy limit. I’m still very scared of food and I need to control everything about it or I won’t be able to eat it. Recently however I‘ve been feeling more motivated to eat and wanting to gain weight. Eating Disorders aren’t something you talk about a lot in my country.\n\nI live in a dormitory with about 50 others and multiple kitchen, however I am not allowed to have and store food in my room, but I do it anyway since eating around people makes me anxious and I cannot keep it down yet. However I really like to cook (common paradox among anorexics haha) and since I obsess so much over food, I‘d say it’s really good and everyone always begs for a bite. But since I‘m trying to gain weight, I try to make myself calculated portions without cutting out calories.\n\nRecently however, all of my cooking miraculously shrinks. Whenever I leave it unattended, my group of FRIENDS take parts of it or even the entire container if I prepared it for the next day. Whenever I asked them, they never deny it and just tell me I‘m being selfish, since they cook too for the group (they do, but so do I occasionally). I was very emotionally distraught by that and threw quite the fit and told them about my issues, but there wasn’t much of a response.\n\nI also keep little snacks I see as safe foods in my room, if I didn’t get enough calories or want to up them for the day. A few hours ago some closer friends out of that group came over to my room since I have a nice TV and we wanted to watch a movie together. After a while one of them suddenly got up and went to my secret stash in my wardrobe, got all my food out and threw it on the bed and began eating. I was extremely shocked he knew about it, but very enraged and snatched most of it away apart from what they had already opened. I told them off and began bawling my eyes out again, but they said I should stop being so selfish and secretive with good food, especially when I‘m going to throw it all up anyway. They said that isn’t what friends do and they at least always have the curtesy to offer me food, even if I always decline.\n\nWe now have a big argument and I feel like everyone is against me. I do not necessarily feel like what I do is wrong since I’m trying to get healthy and not die. Is this behavior really that unacceptable? Should I apologize and plan them more in? What should I do?",

      "description": "Note before you read\n•I am on mobile. Sorry.\n•I also just created this Throwaway. Sorry.\n•This happened months ago. \n•This is a long one I think? Sorry.\n•Sorry for the formatting.\n•Also if you the person I'm talking about is reading this I want to you know I'm not sorry. \n\n\nIt all started back in February of 2018, my friends and I have been all excited to find out about this convention that was to be announced. We got the dates and that night we hoped into discord and started looking at hotels. This is where we kinda messed up, They're was a total of 8 of us going, but when we were looking for hotels there was only four of us secured on going(This will come up later.) We find an incredible place with a great deal! It was truly a luxurious hotel the best part, was the fact the convention was 1 block away. \n\nWhen we paid for the hotel it's was pretty pricey and it was non-refundable. All of us went in knowing this. A little less than $400 each for the entire trip 4 days 3 nights.\n\nHere's where I now know where we went wrong. Because we booked the hotel in February and the convention wasn't until October. I told my friends I would pay for the hotel on my Credit card, with the idea that they would just pay me back before we went on the trip I wasn't to strick on the deadline on paying me back but I knew the guys were good for it. The first one who paid was my friend that we met online lived close to the convention maybe a 30 minutes drive but really wanted to stay with us during the whole thing. The other two guys I had went to highschool and till this day still very good friends both paid me before we had left in October. \n\nAt this time we had 3 more people tagging along and because our group is based off of equality, we told them that they wouldn't just get to crash in the hotel we paid for. So asking them for some cash to help pay for snacks and beer and supplies. One had already paid and there was a miscommunication to which he had believed to paid for both him and his brother but in fact we were asking the money from each of them so it was going to be double what they had thought. To them it looks like we're trying to make money off of them. They need to talk more.\n\nThe hotel situation was that since four of us were paying so much we had thought we're paying for style, we each got our own queen size bed and 2 separate rooms, But we we're going to have to get cots and we didn't know how much that would be and the hotel was no help since we booked through a third party. \n\n(If you've made it this far it's not much more I promise)\n\nThe first friend who lived near by informs the group one month before that he had requested the wrong weekend off. All of us were bummed but he said he was still gonna go. I'm thinking okay.. but now we have an extra bed and that frees up the room and all the cots. So he then proceeds to tell everyone how he wants his money back for the hotel. And I kinda said I'm sorry but you knew it was non-refundable. He insists that I have a pot of money and don't have to pay for the hotel until after and he wants his money back for the convention. At this point I've saved up my own for this trip and I wasn't about to pay him out of pocket for him confusing the weekends. But what I told him is that if the other 3 people go it would be enough to cover the cots and his F**k up. But that's when I found out they were all talking and thinking I would just take money from them and use it on weed and stuff. (I'ma smoker but c'mon we're not all bad. Hell most of us are pretty outgoing and Incredible people.) The 3 guys that were going to sleep on the cots all back out asking for their one payment back which I did still have because that was after we had already paid for the hotel back in February. I'm reiterating because it was so far in advance I felt bad for the guy. I told him sorry I won't be able to cover your fees. And he just didn't take it. We ended up having a friend fill in last minute agreeing to pay what the other one wanted for the bed that weekend.. \n\nWe're at the convention and now all 8 of us are there awkward kinda but trying to put it past us and that we we're all just trying to enjoy the con. Fast forward to the last day. He offers to drive us all to go get Thai food nearby. We agree head over and there's only 5 of us the others stayed back. The check comes and it's over a $100 for this one guy who was a week earlier asking for a refund for the trip. So I told him \"I'm not letting you pay the whole thing let me pay some how much you want I have cash\" \n\"No worries, I got it\"\n\"Are you sure\"\n \"yes I'm sure\" \n\"Let me at least leave the tip\"\n\"No no it's okay it's fine I gotchu\"\n\"Thank you man you really didn't need to buy your friends lunch.\" \n\nFast forward to the next Friday which is kinda like half our groups pay day. In our groupchat with friends who didn't even go to the con.\n\n\"Hey ThrowawaySorry, what's your Venmo so you can send the $14 for the lunch I bought you last weekend?\"\n\"I'm sorry. Sure $14? But can I ask why wait until a week later to ask me for money? I had cash on the trip why not then?\"\n\"Sorry sometimes I just tune you out, but yeah can you send me the money I know it's payday. I assumed you were broke because you couldn't pay me back for the hotel room.\"\nThe whole conversation went on for awhile and I tried to hold my composure, and even admitted to being petty.  came back to if I didn't pay him the money I could kiss the friendship goodbye so that's that. I don't talk to that guy anymore, my friends do but it's because he hasn't \"done\" anything to them which I get I'm not asking my friends to stop being friends what I'm asking is Am I The asshole for not paying the $14? Should I have just done it and shut him up or did I do the right thing and stand my ground? ",

      "description": "Mobile formatting, blah, blah, sorry, blah.\n\nThe dog in question is mostly my mom's, maybe her favorite dog she's ever had. We got him when I was a kid, picked him up off the side of the road,  and he has been an angel of a dog ever since. \n\nUnfortunately his health is deteriorating and it's coming time for him to be put down. He has bad pancreatitis that isn't responding to antibiotics, and prostate issues caused because my mom didn't want to get him fixed. He is incontinent and in pain so I've been trying to bring my mom around to the idea of putting him to sleep. \n\nShe just lost her other beloved dog a couple months ago, and is prone to depressive episodes. Last time we had to put a dog down she went in with him for the process, and seeing him die threw her into an 8 month depression. \n\nI don't live at home anymore, so I can't be there to help if she goes onto a depression again. I have volunteered to go in and be with Scruffy (the good boy in question) as he is put down, but she says she wants to be there. \n\nI know she has a right to be with her best buddy in his final minutes, but if it's going to cause her emotional trauma that will cripple her for months I'd rather she not be there. And there's no way I would let scruffy leave this world without someone he loves with him, I just think it should be me instead of my mom. \n\nWould I be an asshole for pushing the issue? I'd like to be nice and gentle about this, but he has a week max in the condition he is in. \n\nAlso I want to get her a puppy for Xmas but she insists she wants a few months to grieve. Imo the best way to cope with letting go of a dog is a new puppy. Should I try to get her to adopt anyways? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So I'm a chef and recently did a tasting for a job (this is when you cook for the person hiring). It was kind of strange in that I did it *with* my competition, we were given the same mystery ingredients and everything.\n\nThe guy ended up being really cool and we chatted the whole time and exchanged numbers before I left. He ended up getting the job offer (which I learned about a week later when I texted the guy hiring to follow up); it was disappointing but the guy was very good so I didn't take it to heart. And he's a good guy too, so that helps.\n\nSo a week after that, I get a call from the hiring guy saying that things have changed and now they'd like to offer me the job.\n\nI texted the chef that originally got the job and just asked, \"Hey out of curiosity why did you decline the job?\" because I was wondering if he saw some red flags that made him decide to go in another direction.\n\nHe texted me back. There was a problem with his background check and he's been working with HR to resolve it. He has *no idea* they have offered me the job; he still thinks he's got it.\n\nPretty sure he's calling the hiring guy now to give him a piece of his mind, and now I'm worried that I just fucked myself out of a good job by being nosy. On top of that, I feel AWFUL that he had to hear it from me that his offer was being retracted - I feel like they didn't tell him because if I'd said no, they might have considered keeping him. I apologized to him in the text but he hasn't replied (and the hiring guy didn't answer my call back) so I feel like he's called in to light someone up over this.\n\nI'm swamped with guilt and nerves now over creating this situation.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I got into a fight. Earlier that day she tried to smash my face into a cupcake because I wouldn’t stop tickling her when watching TV. I dodged and it got on my shirt. I was fine. I changed shirts. No big deal. We moved on.\n\nLater that night we were watching tv with friends. Her Apple watch came on, it said get up and move for a minute. I took her drink and set it on a table. I picked her up and started trying to dance. I was laughing, I guess looking back now I shouldn’t have forced her to get up. But then while I’m trying to dance with her. She says, “Friend Name, cupcake me!”. It never occurs to me that she would try to smash another cupcake into my face so I don’t hesitate or flinch. She leans back with her other hand grabs it and puts the frosting all over my face and beard.\n\nI’m upset by this, she and my friends are laughing. They start grabbing their phones to take a picture of me. I run into my room slam the door and run into the bathroom to get it off. They run in after me and pick the lock to the bathroom to get a picture. I knock the phone out of one of my friends hands then curse at them to get out of my room. I just didn’t want a picture of me with pink icing all over my face. I said the F word like 3/4 times honestly.\n\nI take a shower and go back out there. My girlfriend doesn’t apologize to me or anything. We then get into an argument in front of our friends about how she doesn’t feel like she needs to say she is sorry. She thinks that it was funny and she thinks so did everyone else. So in her mind there is no reason I should be upset about it. \n\nThen we don’t talk about it and at the end of the night. We talk and she still doesn’t feel she is in the wrong. She calls me childish for not letting it go. She thinks I need to grow up. I keep bringing it up because I’m upset that she didn’t feel like she did anything wrong. I don’t know if I’m justified or not. AITA here for not letting it go?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend smashes a cupcake in my face when I light heartedly make her get off the couch. She thinks I’m childish and in the wrong for not thinking it’s funny. ",

      "description": "Me and a group of friends get together every few months to play pathfinder. Recently we decided to start a new campaign, because the old one was fizzling out. The person who first introduced us to the game and knew the most about it decided that he wanted to GM a full open world campaign that follows directly off of pathfinder lore, but he didn't want to run a module, he wanted to run a homebrew.\nThe day after the idea came out, I went on a camping trip with the person in question. We aren't best friends, but he doesn't have many friends, so he invited me to go with him.\nOn the second day of the trip, he decided that it would be fun to create my character, and much to my surprise he pulled every single pathfinder rule book out of the trunk of his car. After looking over the classes and races, I decided to play a Tiefling rogue. \nMy friend said that it would be cool to use one of the pathfinders devils/demons as my demonic heritage, and I thought that would be cool. He told me to roll a d20 and after I said my result, he said \"Well, your father can now posses you once per session.\" I told him that was not cannon and that I didn't want a drawback like that and he said that I became proficient with his favored weapon and it was slightly more powerful in my hands, and at higher levels had extra magical damage. \nThe first session started and we were doing an intrigue mission for someone, and while sneaking into a building my father possessed me, and I tried to kill the party. I was knocked unconcious by the fighter and my character did nothing for the next 2 hours. \nWe returned from the mission, and the quest giver turned out to be a god in disguise and she gave everyone in the party, but me, a magic power that they could use at will. \nI asked the GM why I didn't get anything, and\n he said it was my whip, and that he was trying to balance the party. I was annoyed, but I let it \npass.\nThe next session started, and I was alone in a tavern asking around in the main town that the campaign was set in, and my father possessed me, and I killed half of the bar before being taken by the guards into a holding cell. The rest of the party came to rescue me, and when they pulled me out of the cell, the god from earlier came down from the heavens and gave them all an additional magic power that they could use at will. I asked why I didn't get one, and the GM\n said that it was because I didn't contribute to the rescue mission and it ruined the other \nmission. \nI lost my shit and told him that I didn't want to have this shitty father possession thing and I was fine if I lost the whip as long as the party could be balanced. I asked if I could rewrite my characters backstory and if the party could lose these super powerful abilities or if I could gain them (we kept having encounters that were a much higher CR than the party, and the rest of the parties magic abilities allowed them to clear the encounters while I stood in the back and tried to not die.)\nHe said no, and I fudged rolls until my character died so I could created a min-maxed character to try and keep up with the party. \nI wanted to build a monk, but for my race, I wanted to be one of the example races from Advanced Race Guide, and he told me that I couldn't, even though they are cannon pathfinder. I got pissy and created the most overpowered build that I could find. \nHe repeatedly tried to kill the new character, and at one point during the last session I ever attended he had a tarrasque corner me in the middle of the woods and killed my character. I got very angry at the GM and the only girl in the group (who's first ever roleplay experience was this session,) told me to get my shit together. \nNext time we were supposed to meet, I got messages in our groupchat, but no one ever asked if I was coming. I decided not to go, and left the groupchat, screaming at the GM and callung them assholes. \nI know they still meet, and I have made amends with the GM, but the girl has since joined our other campaigns and is snarky and rude to me in all of them as well. \n\nTLDR; I joined one of my friends pathfinder campaigns and he was prejudiced against my character and I yelled at him. \n\nAITA for getting so upset.",

      "description": "So my partner and I have been living together for the passed few months and on and off living together for almost a year (staying at each other’s for long periods of time.) I’ve lived alone for almost 3 years and I pretty much learnt how to take care of myself with common sense or biting the bullet and calling my mum up to ask. One of the things I used to call her about was laundry as I have nice clothes and really don’t want to ruin them. \nMy partner however says he’s taken care of himself but that really only means he occasionally cooks for himself and gets himself to bed on time. Other than that everything was taken care of for him at home until we actually moved in together. Even when he would stay at mine I would make sure everything of his was clean and put away because it was my room and it wouldn’t get done if I’d been petty and only cleaned my things. \n\nSince we moved in he doesn’t exactly pull his weight, he’ll usually only tend to do housework when he has a day off and even then it’s usually just the dishes, he’s not once picked up the vacuum, ironed or anything else etc. But is able to put a load of laundry on more recently which I taught him how to do because he has no idea how to work the machine or how to separate colours and fabrics etc. \nOver Christmas I was at my parents house and he was back at our house, during that time he told me he put a load of washing on which I thought was great, I’d get back and have clothes to wear when I was at home. When I got back I’d noticed he’d put a few of my knitted jumpers on to wash, they had dried and had been put on the chair. I then saw that my favourite jumper and another jumper I’d spend a lot of money on had been completely unstitched. I was pretty upset because my favourite jumper was a gift from my parents and at the time they really couldn’t afford it, I absolutely love that jumper. I didn’t get annoyed with my SO though, people make mistakes, I’ve turned things different colours before. So instead I spent an hour fixing the jumper until it looked okay to wear again, the other I just use for comfort now. \nI really stressed to him though that if something is out of the ordinary (t-shirt and jeans etc) then it shouldn’t be done on a hot temperature that it was done on and I’m not gonna be annoyed if he leaves out things like that for me to do because I get they’re hard to wash and I’ve been doing it for years.\n\nSo last night he put another wash on, he told me it was underwear which I thought was fine.\nThis morning I pulled everything out and low and behold the settings were on very high and for exclusively cotton. Long story short I’ve had to throw out a bunch of things I got for Christmas and also 2 of my nice bras because they have been decimated, a lot of the other stuff is discoloured as well but it doesn’t matter cause it’s underwear.\n\nSo now I’m torn, because it’s a nice gesture that he’s done laundry and helped me out, but he didn’t listen to anything I told him and has destroyed a load of my stuff, which he 100% could have asked for help with, and I would have done it. AITA? \n",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom, so introducing myself and the situation, I'm a 17 year old senior who attends an fairly small interconnected high school and middle school, although generally separated in timings. My (former) best friend named Dan, who is also 17 years old and in 12th grade, recently started conversing with a couple of 8th graders who also attend our school; named Kate and May, who are best friends.\n\nDan never really had any sexual encounters throughout high school, nor a serious girlfriend. Recently he has attended the school musical in which he has interacted with middle schoolers much more, and began an unhealthy relationship with Kate. They started talking in October and officially became a couple in December. He asked advice from me whether the relationship could work and whether or not it was correct to date a 13-year-old, to which I protested, and he just started an argument. I proceeded to let him continue, assuming they would just break up.\n\nHowever I felt uncomfortable leaving the situation as it was, I did not want my friend do anything that he would regret, nor have an underaged girl to do the same. I asked May a few days ago regarding Kate and Dan's relationship and according to her they had been very serious.\n\n\nThe next time I met Dan, I borrowed his phone while he was in the bathroom to find out that he was pressuring her to send inappropriate images. Today, the first day at school after winter break, I reported him for harassing underaged girls to the staff.\n\nI broke my friends trust, I betrayed him by reporting to the school staff, and I may have ruined his future. However I was afraid things would escalate.\n\ntl;dr my 17 friend engaged in an unhealthy relationship with a 13 year old and pressured her to send nude photos so I reported him to the school.\n",

He has an online GF, R, who he has met IRL probably once a year that he has been dating since high school.\n\nMe and E are best friends. Like, legit. E also knows I have pretty much had a lowkey crush on him the entire time I have known him. It's NBD; I'm in a lovely relationship ATM and never pressured him into being with me. We playfully flirt often in a friend way but both understand we are each in a relationship.\n\nYesterday, I told him he needed to break up with R. He is about to finish college and move across the country to live with her. I am 99% sure she is emotionally abusive.\n\nI typed that out, with reasonings to this conclusion (tldr; guilt trips, victimizes herself constantly, expects his time on a whim, makes him walk on eggshells, etc), apologies for saying it so bluntly, and empathizing a lot, as I have been in a handful of abusive relationships.\n\nI know he would not be safe or happy living with her and this is only his second relationship ever. But - he knows I am and always will be kinda into him. I hesitated to say anything but he implied last night he was going to propose to her. I genuinely fear for his well being - and I have tried telling him this just short of literally BREAK UP WITH HER.\n\nSorry if this sounds like seeking validation; I know abuse needs to be stopped and intervened, but was I too blunt? He had not responded since I send the message last night. AITA for being so blunt (or for taking so long to finally say anything?)",

      "description": "Little back story me and my girl have been for around a year now and we currently live together. The problem I’m having is she refuses to tell me the truth about dumb stuff that doesn’t matter and doesn’t respect my wishes when I ask her stuff. Every time she drinks she refuses to tell me the truth about how the night went. She’ll lie to me about what bars she’s been too, or say she’s only had 1 drink when she is clearly drunk, or that she’s with her girlfriends when she’s with her male coworkers( I don’t have a problem with this I trust and know them) I try and explain to her and we’ve had this conversation at least once a month minimum since we’ve started dating. That I don’t care about the individual events she’s lying about it’s the fact that she continues to just lie to me about dumb stuff that shouldn’t matter and refuses to tell me the truth which makes me question other stuff she says to me. We’ll fight for a little while and then I’ll eventually cave in and cuddle up next to her and fall asleep\n\nAnyways on to this particular event that happened tonight. I was having a pretty shit day at work, 12 hour shift, problems with management, to the point where I told my boss I’ve had enough and they need to start looking for a replacement. I’m texting my girl info about this throughout the day and explaining that I’m just in a shit mood and can’t wait to come home and hang out with her. We’re talking and I say I want some margaritas and to smoke and chill when I get off. Fast forward a little bit and she tells me she’s getting a drink with her sister at her work after her shift and then going home. Another like hour later I ask how she’s doing and she tells me her and her sister have moved to a local bar. That’s fine cool I got another 2 hours at work. I end up getting home around 2am ( we stay up late just about every night 4-5amish we’re both service industry) and she’s obviously passed out. I kiss her on the head and nudge her a bit and she groans and squints her eyes towards me. I ask her how her night was. No response. I say hello 4 times trying to start a conversation which obviously isn’t going to happen. Her eyes are red as hell so I ask her if she had been smoking at the bar and she said no that when she got home took hits out the bong and went to sleep. I’m annoyed at this point because she couldn’t wait the 45 minutes she had been home from the bar for me to get home to smoke with me and be in a state to hold a conversation after I told her that’s what I was looking forward to all night. We talk a little bit more and she tells more dumb lies about like how much she drank which I’m numb to at this point and I tell her to just go back to sleep and I went for a drive to cool off.\n\nI still haven’t been able to sleep because I’m upset that she didn’t have the respect to at least wait for me to get home to smoke so we could hangout after she knows I’ve had a shit day.\n\nThank you reading",

      "description": "So basically this conversation happened on another subreddit and I just need to check if I’m the asshole. I don’t think I am but a lot of people do. The situation is copied from that post. \n\nBasically I just need to know if I’m the asshole for sending food I don’t like but was technically prepared right back and expecting not to be charged for said dish. \n\nI always read the description and I also ask for modifications if any ingredients are in it that I don’t like. I generally know what I like, but yes I like to try new things, I have a pretty solid stomach so if it’s just mediocre I’ll still eat it and just remember not to order it again. Out of all the times I’ve eaten out I’ve sent food back 3 times that I can remember.\n\nHere’s all 3 times just for you:\n\nCrab fried rice at Eddie V’s - it comes with butter and just the description sounded fucking delicious. Cool. We order it. Come out. We both got a hefty spoon full for our plates and taste it. Shit it drowning in butter. Like it tasted okay, but the butter was too much my friend hated it, I didn’t like it, so we told the waitress she asked if we wanted to try it without the butter we said sure. Get that bowl. It’s so bland I could die. This is a $17 bowl of rice I expect it to taste good. It doesn’t. We tell her it was a no go. I expected to pay for one since we did order it twice but she took them both off. she was sweet. Got like a $25 tip on a $50 order.\n\nVeggie Lasagna at Vapiano - description sounded good. It said it had a cream sauce vs ricotta cheese. I’m okay with that. I get it take one bite and I’m like this is not it. I’d have rather thrown it away then eaten it. Like it was bland and fucking gross. It was pretty but it just tasted like dirty vegetables and milk. I refused to eat it. But I was nervous about taking it back but I told the manager anyway. He tasted it. He said he liked it but he can see why I didn’t because it was bland but he doesn’t like strong flavors. He was super sweet and took it off and I ordered something else.\n\nGorgonzola Steak at Olive Garden - I was 15 and stupid and I got this knowing I love cheese and beef. But little did I know Gorgonzola was a type of blue cheese. The menu didn’t state this and I would not have ordered it if I knew it was blue cheese because I HATE blue cheese. Took one bite and then immediately flagged down the waitress because this was not the move. I was 15 and didn’t know they would take it off. But this makes sense since their menu wasn’t explicit in saying it was a blue cheese and the waitress felt my pain.\n\nAll of these times I didn’t know it was going to taste like that. The food was just like surprise bitch I’m nasty. So yes I expect to get my money back because your menu catfished me and I can’t even stomach this.",

      "description": "I (19) go to the same college as my sister (22). We get along, but I’m a lot better at making friends than she is so she feels a lot more isolated. A few years back, she was abused and gaslighted by a guy at her old college. The trauma from his actions as well as the abuses suffered later on have caused her to have serious trust issues and also caused her to start seeing things. I’m one of the few people she trusts, but I’m the only one she trusts that lives in the same city. Because of this, whenever she’s even slightly stressed (which happens all the time) she goes to me about it. She’s also convinced herself that she’s awful and that nobody should treat her poorly at the same time, so she’s wallowing in self-pity while also being somewhat abusive to me because as her brother I “have to support her.” She’s been verbally and, once, physically abusive to me and I’m just about done dealing with her problems since she gets overwhelmed so easily. And the way she vents always takes on a whiny tone and she starts talking about how she doesn’t deserve to be treated this way. Not once have I vented to her. Not once have I said “go ahead and vent.” If I vent to someone, I almost always try to take a deep breath and think about if it’s really worth getting riled up over. We have good times, but lately she’s been getting worse and worse. So, Am I the Asshole for wanting to tell her off or is it okay?",

They always tell people to bring their dogs over and it's a super dog friendly household. \n\nSecond, we never let her out of our sight, she was our other friends dog and we were only supposed to be watching her for a few hours. Ffw hours later and I texted my friend and said to be careful not to drink and drive and if it came to that then just to leave the dog till morning. She replied by saying that her arrangement with us was for us to keep her late the next day. OKAY. I guess. NOT what we discussed but it was her birthday so whatever. \n\nThird, this dog did literally nothing wrong. She didn't bark, pee, chew on anything, break anything, etc. She was literally a perfect angel. \n\nSo they finally come get her at almost 10 pm (ugh) and the moment they leave our roommate (let's call him A for asshole) says,\n\nA: By the way, next time y'all want to have a dog over in MY house, y'all better let me know.\n\nUs: uhh okay sorry about that. \n\nMind you, neither of them said a word the entire time to us until then and when we tried to explain he just stalked off angrily. Now are we the assholes for feeling hurt because we felt he took it too far? He basically said it in a threatening manner. We have been the perfect roommates, I clean everything and even take care of their dogs and their fish tank and do their laundry. I thought we were friends. We moved in on the premise of it being a friendly agreement as opposed to a landlord/renter relationship. We had the chance to move for free but didn't take it because they convinced us to move to their house in order for us all to save up money.

      "description": "I'll keep it short, But I want to give proper context. I work at a family business, essentially my dad is the owner and I take care of the business every afternoon (he only works at morning) during this time I take care of the whole business, I'm essentially the boss. so all of my \"co workers\" are essentially my \"employees\" for lack of a better term. I find it hard to be serious with people I get along with (big personal flaw of mine) so I tend to be a bit distant/cold with them. Not harsh or cruel or anything, I just try to be firm and not strike up conversations or friendship with them. It's not who I am normally but I find it necessary to properly manage things. (There are reasons why I believe it's best this way but I'd rather not reveal too much personal info on reddit) most of the time the employees just treat me with the same firm atittude once they realize that's how I'm gonna go about my work, so it's all good.\n\nAnyway, the problem is we got some new employees and they're extremely nice. Like they try to strike up conversation often (which I shut down) and they even invited me to go out a few times though I didn't accept. Again, I don't mistreat them or anything, worst thing I do is raise my tone a bit when they don't follow orders. (I feel like follow orders makes me sound like a villain, English isn't my first language) I'd like to know from the perspective of employees with strict bosses: AITA? Or is this an acceptable way of doing things ? ",

      "description": "Looking for some real judgement here. About 3 months ago my mom was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and really couldn't move anymore, so I let her move in with me. I am broke as fuck and I live paycheck to paycheck so it's been a struggle. At this point we are just waiting for hospice to be approved and the doctors to decide when we move her over. \n\nOn top of all this my mom has never been a nice person, she's still not. She's rude, she's demanding, she's half out of it 90% of the time which makes her even worse. She was abusive to me and my brother growing up. I'm letting her live with me because honestly I hope I get some real karma out of it and maybe some day my life will turn around. I don't have a lot of motherly love for her and really I just tolerate her being around. \n\nHer last real pleasure in life is Popeye's chicken. She loves the stuff. But it's expensive as fuck and very honestly I can't afford to stop there 5, 6 even 7 times a week. So after the first week, every time she'd ask for it, I'd just grab a Popeye's box from the trash, stop by the grocery store (if you buy their fried chicken after 8pm it's literally 1/5th the cost of Popyeye's) and fill up the Popeye's box. \n\nFor a while it was fine and she didn't notice the difference but recently the doctor's have slightly altered her post-chemo medications which I assume means that she regained some sense of taste and she threw a holy fucking fit. She called the local Popeye's and bitched out every one she could. This saved me for a few days because they gave her two gift cards and one this like huge ass picnic meal that kept her in Popeye's for the last few days. \n\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do when the gift cards run out...I really think my thing is to keep buying the grocery store chicken and hope she doesn't notice. \n\n\nso here's the question...\n\n\nAITA?\n",

Then I kid you not goes on for about 10 minutes making fat jokes. \"I married a pair not an orange.\" Is the only one I can remember. So I ask my fiance who has a better view how old he looks. Fiance says \"about 30\". I then say, a little louder than I should have, \"Imagine being that old and still sounding that imature. I thought he was a high schooler.\" Well then it basically launches a wierd talking about the other tabel off. Mumbling vauge rude things without making eye contact until his date asked him to stop. We paid and left. Because we had been there before them and we were nearly done before it all started.\n\n\nI think it was petty of me to engage with him.

So now instead of playing Anthem he's playing Resident Evil 7 that he bought on an impulse buy a couple days ago. \n\nFor the record progress is supposed to carry over to the open demo for everyone but not to the actual game. \n\nI readily admit that I fucked up but I had all but forgotten that I was on his profile. \nI feel like he's overreacting.",

This is done on a throwaway account cause I'd like no trace of this to my name but I can't get off my chest, also on mobile so excuse any spelling mistakes.\n\nG = Girl I like\nSG = The girl who tried to neck herself\nD = A friend of mine\n\nBasically, I met this G in French and over 20 weeks I developed feelings for G, and she takes interests in my as well so for now we're linking. And after a couple times together SG sees the way we act around each other and talks to me, it goes like this;\nSG: \"What do you have to G?\"\nMe: \"I really like G and she likes me so were linking \"\nSG: \"No fuck off, she's mine\"\nMe: \"No, G isn't yours but yes we're trying to make something work.\"\n\nSG then went off and asked her out, G said no and I was happy cause SG was mentally unstable and G didn't see this. So it's all cool, we continue with our lives like normal. D comes to school one day and I realised SG isn't walking with him like they usually do and D says;\n\nD: \"You know my Lesbian neighbor?\"\nMe: \"Yeah SG.\"\nD: \"She tried to neck herself, I heard SG's parents say it whilst I was leaving my house.\"\nMe: \"Ooh that sounds shit.\"\n\nBut actually this made me really happy, G would finally notice how mentally Unstable SG is and realise she it isn't smart to go out with her.\n\nFast Forward\n\nMe and G always talk between 9 PM and 1 AM and I casually pretending to care to ake the news, the conversation went like this;\nMe : \"Is SG okay?\"\nG: \"Idk, why you asking?\"\nMe: \"Oh, you don't know? She tried to neck herself.\"\nG: \"Oh God, I hope she's okay, that sounds awful, I didn't know.\"\nMe: \"Yeah, I know\"\n\nG didn't text SG to ask if she's okay cause I asked about SG two days later and she said they never talked.\n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA for being happy that the girl I like will be happy and ,in my opinion, safe from this mentally unstable girl even if it was at such a price.\n\nQuick summary for anyone skim reading:\nAITA for being happy that a crucial point was made to a girl I really like but at such a massive cost - attempt to neck herself - that I had no control over but was still happy it happend cause I feel like it took this much to finally make G realise SG isn't a safe person.\n\nQuick note: I myself have attempted to neck myself the past but I stopped any doing it two years ago and helped my previous girlfriend stop it as well so I know how bad it can be that's why I care about G so much.",

      "title": "AITA for not being willing to sew things for kids?",
      "description": "I learned how to sew at a young age and am quite happy with my skills. Most of my wardrobe is me-made, and I take a lot of pride in it. Over the years, I've made various items for friends and family members. It's rare for anyone in my life to come out and request or ask for something specific, but on the occasion they do, I'll take it into consideration and charge them appropriately for my time, skill level, and materials. In the past, I've had requests for things like skirts (easy peasy), and one of my friends comes to me for alterations on her clothing often.\n\nA few weeks ago, a friend of mine approached me with a request to make an Easter Sunday outfit for her two daughters. I politely declined, and gave her the contact information of a friend who delights in making things for children.\n\nMy friend pushed me on it a few times, and eventually I told her this in a message:\n\n&gt;I get why you want me to be the one to make it, and I'm flattered you think so highly of what I can do. It really means a lot to me. But I have to be honest with you: I've found that it's just not worth it for me to make things for children. It's a lot of time and effort to go through the whole process for an item they could only wear once, and especially since kids are not always careful with their clothing, it's easy for them to get ruined. They just grow too quickly for it to be worth it for me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I know this may not make sense to you, but think if you'd put hours and hours of effort into a painting for someone only to find it viewed once or twice, and then placed in a room no one goes into. That's what it's like to make handcrafted items for little kids. If it's easier to understand, know that I would also decline making an ornate wedding gown as well.\n\nNow, I understand people are pretty sensitive about anything involving kids, and I tried to be as polite and tactful as I possibly could be. But it wasn't graceful enough, and my friend showed me that. She was polite in the response, but I found out quickly from mutual friends that she (on a filtered post or in a Mommy group or something) blasted me. From what I understand, a lot of the other people who responded to her agreed with her and a few of them went so far as to rip into items I've made (I have a clothing blog and a FB page) knocking on the quality, style, and even going so far as to rip into my looks. \n\nMy first thought? Some people really hate being told no, and others hate being told their child is not the center of someone else's universe even more. But as I looked through those screenshots of people all piling on me, I had to wonder if I was actually an asshole after all.",

      "description": "I've been dating my current girlfriend for 2 years. She actually initiated sexual contact with me, she would tease me about using a vibrator and masturbating and stuff. Eventually we ended up masturbating together (she doesn't want to have sex until marriage). She's Muslim and I'm an atheist.\n\nAbout 6 months after we started doing sexual stuff she wanted to stop because she felt guilty because of religion. I said okay and backed off. I would still flirt with her \"Nice ass babe\" stuff like that but I never tried to initiate anything.\n\nThen she eventually got super horny one night and decided to start up sex again. I was like \"cool\". Well, couple of weeks go by and she changes her mind again... Decides to stop having sexual contact. I was a bit annoyed because it felt like she was jerking me around and using me when she wanted sex.\n\nShe doesn't have anywhere near the sex drive I do. I get horny a lot and she gets horny like maybe once a week. I'm starting to feel like she's holding me at bay, telling me she doesn't want it for religious reasons only to break down when she's horny enough, jump my bones, then go back to nothing sexual.\n\nShe's gone back and forth about 4 times now and it's really starting to annoy me.",

She blatantly ignores our emails, and then sends out emails with “missed actions” or “missed deadlines” and CCs our superiors, without acknowledging anything we’ve done or our emails on the case. \n\nShe just sent us another email and put all these tasks on us that are legitimately her role, and CCed our immediate superior saying we missed a meeting with her yesterday (which we told her we had to cancel a week ago due to scheduling conflicts.) \n\nOn top of it all, I’m most frustrated at how she shortened my name for a nick name that I never go by. I find it disrespectful in how she ignored how I sign every single email, how I introduced myself, and calling me something that she just wants to call me by. \n\nI don’t want to put my name here, but some examples of how she changed my name- calling someone named Melissa as “Mel,” or “Katherine” as “kate,” or “Olivia” as “liv.”\n\nUltimately I feel like she’s using this to belittle me further and make her seem more in charge, but please tell me if I’m reading too much into this. \n\nThank you!",

      "description": "Here's some context: My gf [17F] and I [17M] go to a exclusive boarding school. Her dad went to Columbia and is fairly famous. I'm a scholarship student (I get full aid since my mom makes 45k a year) and I've been attending the school since 7th grade. \n\nAnyway, in 9th grade, I almost got kicked out of the school. I'm naturally a procrastinator. I was able to make it work, kinda. What happened is that I couldn't seriously study unless it was *the day of the test* (the exception being history, since I love history). My strategy was to waste time everyday on my phone, jerking off, playing clash of clans. Then I'd wake up really early on the test and study. At first this worked, and I aced the tests. Then the tests got more constant, and I began doing this almost everday. I got sleep deprived, my grades dropped. I was almost kicked out, but I convinced my history teacher to convince the school to give me a chance. This next part is probably stereotypical as hell, but I decided to change my life. I looked at how I was then- unproductive, skinny as hell, unpopular. I decided I had to change all that. I limited my jacking off to once every 2 weeks, joinrf the debate team, signed up with the rowing team, started looking up productivity tips, all that. I asked my only friend at the time to take my phone from me at my at 7 AM until 9 PM, so I could focus on all my stuff. \n\nBy this year (11th grade), I'm pretty popular and start dating my current girlfriend. Honestly I see a lot of me in her, even though she's the next level: never goes to class, has a 1.7 GPA, not involved in any clubs, and has a 1530 SAT on her 1st try with no preparation. Yeah. She's the smart but lazy kid on steroids. She only goes to the school honestly because her rich dad is a huge donor. \n\nAnd this frustrates me. A lot of people stereotype her as a basic bitch or legit stupid blonde. She's one of the smartest people I know, but doesn't gaf and spends her time on her phone out with her friends. Those aren't wrong, but she should spend less time on them. She has the potential but she's wasting it idling away.\n\nI tried convincing, pleading, begging her to do something. I didn't expect it to work- didn't for me- but I hoped. Well, it didn't. So yesterday afternoon, we were hanging out. When I was leaving, I swiped it. At crew practice this morning, I threw it in the river.\n\nI don't regret doing it, but just now I was talking to her, and was so panicked. Like almost in tears and screaming type of panic. I don't think I did the wrong thing, but her reaction makes me feel kinda guilty. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "A while back I had a pretty toxic friendship with “Lynne”. She treated me like a servant, and I put up with it because I can’t stand up for myself. There were a few blowup fights when I reached snapping point and told her how hurt I was, but the cycle would always start over. After one of the fights, I was finally done. I didn’t want to make things awkward for our mutual friends so I tried to keep in touch through texting. The texting followed the same pattern as the real-life friendship did, and I pulled back quite a bit. Lynne didn’t really respond to me much, or reach out on her own. I felt she was being pretty clear that she wasn’t interested in being friends anymore so I did a slow fade.\n\nFast forward about ten years. I get a random text from Lynne, paraphrasing “you don’t have to respond to this but I don’t understand why we’re not friends anymore you don’t have to respond to this.” I was annoyed because I feel that I did tell her on many occasions the ways she was hurting me, plus she never made any attempts to reach out to me. But I did bottle up my feelings until I exploded on several occasions, so I wasn’t perfect either. I did kinda want to apologize about the dramatic meltdowns, but I didn’t want to respond rashly, so I called my sister to hash out what to do about the text.\n\n40 minutes later, I’m still on the phone and I get another paraphrased text “you don’t have to respond but if you’re going to do it soon.” 15 seconds later, “fine NOT FINE bye!” I blocked her immediately, which I felt pretty good about until I mentioned the text to a few of those mutual friends. They were all annoyed with me, and said things like “it took so much courage for her to send that!”; “oh she just got nervous, don’t be so mean!”; and “why don’t you just forgive her?”\n\nI can appreciate that texting someone who hasn’t spoken to you in years would be tough, but I feel like the ensuing hissy fit puts me in the clear. But now that they’re made all these comments I’m less sure, and I both feel like an ass and like I was justified. Ruling, please? Do I suck?",

      "description": "sorry if this just seems like stupid HS drama but I don’t really know who else to ask!\n\nSo for some context: \nMe and my boyfriend have been together for almost 3 years and he is one year older then me. I am a senior in HS this year, he graduated last year. \n\nLast year, I went to his prom with him. He didn’t want to dance, and I’m not really close with his friends so it was kind of boring but I was thankful to experience it with him! I convinced him only to dance to a couple songs but he was not into it at all, his friends weren’t either. They pretty much just wanted to sit at their table (it was only my boyfriends friend group) and just talk and make jokes. Which I wasn’t mad about, it wasn’t my prom so I just tried to be there with him. \n\nWe’ve also been to several parties and events and he is the type of person who would rather sit and eat and talk than dance and get “lit” lmao. It’s okay because I understand people are different. I can feel awkward like that too but once I get my friends encouragements I just want to be loose and have fun, and it’s awkward with him because I can tell he’s upset if I leave him alone but I know he also doesn’t wanna dance. \n\nSo this year is my prom and I kind of.... don’t want him to go with me. I love him but I’d much rather go with one of my girlfriends who I know I can let loose and be free with. And i want to be with a group of my own friends, and he doesn’t really know them THAT well. I feel like if I go with him I’ll be glued to the chair all night. I haven’t had a really good high school life and I want to be able to end on a fun note:)\n\nSorry this was so long but... yeah, would I be the asshole if I tell him I don’t wanna go with him? He has expressed he does want to go with me and keeps asking if he’s going to be my date but the way he asks he’s saying he does wanna come and has even suggested that he should because I was HIS date for HIS prom. So yeah I’d love ur opinions! ",

      "description": "On occasion I use Uber to go to and from work when I’m just not up for the subway. I work in a busy part of my city so I’m not the best at checking the make/model or license plate when they roll up. Today I wanted to get home to help pull together a party for my husband tonight and got an Uber. Weirdly his picture was further away, kind of a profile (not straight on), and not fantastic lighting. I ignored it figuring I was lucky to even get one when it’s busy. \n\nI was listening to a podcast and noticed a car pull up in front of my office and I just ran to it, opened the door, and said “Hey are you X, here for plzstoptalkingg?” He said yes and I just took him at his word. I know my city pretty well so after about two minutes I noticed we weren’t even close to going in the right direction. I check my app and the map wasn’t updating and it never said “picked up/how was your pick up”. I restarted the app and it just said the whole “where do you want to go” I got a little panicked but we were still in the nice part of town so I just politely asked if the typical bridge I take to my side of the city has construction. He just said “I’m following what the phone says” I mention that I think we are headed the wrong way because we are going towards a tunnel not the bridge and he just shrugs. I told him I’d be more comfortable going the normal route and if he just followed a different street I could tell him how to get to my house (which is not reachable by the tunnel). He told me he was taking the tunnel and that Uber would fire him for going off course. \n\nI keep trying to pull up our ride on my app and panic that he’s not listening to me and I can’t see that I’ve been picked up. At this point we are one light away from the tunnel and I ask one more time if he can just take the bridge. He turns around and yells at me if I want to get him fired or what. \n\nSince we were stopped I opened the door, bailed, and snapped a picture of the car when I was on the sidewalk. I got out and walked straight to the police. I gave a statement and made my husband pick me up. \n\nMy husband thinks I’m overreacting and that it was just a guy that thought he knew better than a GPS and thinks I’m paranoid for making a statement to the cops. I know I listen to a lot of true crime and tend to get caught up in my head in unlikely scenarios. Am I an asshole here?",

      "description": "So I have this boyfriend, that I reallyyyyy like and want to feel comfortable with me... He has a lot of insecurities and I made an effort in the beginning of our relationship of telling him that he could and should be himself around me. But suddenly he started to fart all the time. And I really do mean, ALL the time. Sometimes it doesn't smell, but sometimes it really does. Sort of like sweet and rotten cheese mixed with something like raw meat. I think he might be broken on the inside.\n He doesn't go away to do it. He even does it when we are lying together watching movies - sometimes when I'm doing oral on him. Sometimes it's fun, but it is starting to bug me and it's hard to be romantic. Sometimes we have serious conversations and he farts and waits for my reaction in the middle of it. It's hard to stay focused in such a situation - Especially when I have to hold in a gag because of the smell.\n\nI wanted him to act naturally, but I didn't know it would release this reckoning of smell of all smells.\nAnd now I don't know how to tell him without hurting his feelings.

      "description": "So, I work for a travel healthcare company as a telemetry tech. I started at a hospital a few weeks ago, and even though I'm not contractually obligated, I've also been a precepter (sp?) for some transfers/new hires. And I don't mind. It's a challenge, I can help people grow in a one on one environment, etc. Recently during a meeting, my supervisor was telling me about the possibility that since I've trained these people, they would need hours doing the job, and therefore might have to move me to doing secretarial/unit coordinator duties. Which, I usually don't mind helping, but I specifically went to school so that I wouldn't have to do jobs that I don't like, such as a UC, which would be constant phone/call light answering, listening to families and patients complain, bothering medical staff with more phone calls and messages (which I get is necessary, but knowing how hard Nurses and CNAs work, always makes me feel guilty). I expressed my concerns professionally and open minded, but this supervisor has previously gone behind me and messed with stuff like trying to short me on hours, which my travel company would have to sort out. So, I called my recruiter and expressed my concerns. I was basically told that it's my role to help the hospital as much as possible because I want the best possible reference, and then told to think of the manager in a sympathetic light. Basically that I could be their knight in shining armor. But even after that, along with the fact that my job would be miserable, I would almost feel taken advantage of because the people doing my contacted job would be the ones that I trained without asking for more pay (even though I had every right to, but I didn't find out until after the fact).\n\nSo, am I an asshole for looking out for myself? Am I being selfish in all of this? I felt I was justified until my conversation with my recruiter, so now I'm not sure and I feel a little guilty.",

      "description": "I was friends with this girl for 7+ years. \n\nThen she had first child and we were low/no contact for a while and after her second child she started reaching out again.\n\nAfter baby number two, I started noticing that she only contacts me when she needs support. For example, when she got kicked out of a playgroup, she called me for support.\n\nThe conversations always started with the pretext of her wanting to call and see how I'm doing and then switching directly to her and her issues before I've said anything.\n\nFor example, she called to say she wanted to know all about my sibling's wedding, talked about herself for an hour, and then hung up when she had run out of time. She never found out any information about the wedding and she never noticed that we didn't talk about it.\n\nI put up with it because her husband travels a lot and she has no other adults to talk to at this point and clearly she just needed someone to vent to from time to time.\n\nIn November, she called and started demanding to know when I was going to have children, something that may never happen for me.\nI explained to her that I did not want to talk about it and that I didn't know if I would ever have children. She kept pushing, saying that I should be able to answer her because I can just ignore whatever else is happening in my life and give her a hypothetical timeline. I explained it a dozen different ways that I didn't want to answer that question and she kept not taking no for an answer. So I said I had to go and hung up.\n\nThis friend had trouble conceiving and always complained to me about how hurtful it was when people drilled her on her baby plans, so it shocked me that she would forget all the pain those conversations put her through and force this conversation on me.\n\nDespite knowing that she has lost her longterm friendships and that she gets no support form her family, I stopped taking her calls.\nShe called me multiple times in November and I texted her that I was too busy with school to have chats and she told me to contact her as soon as I had more free time when I finished school by January.\n\nI know I shouldn't have used the school excuse, but I felt that if I told her why I didn't want to talk to her it would end up being a rather nasty email since my feelings were rather hurt at that point.\n\nI want send her a message now that I've had some time and distance from the event explaining why I ended the friendship since I know that several other friends have ended friendships with her for similar reasons, i.e. her being really insensitive.\n\nIt's now nearly April and I haven't talked to her since I texted her in November.\n\nAm I the asshole for ending the friendship knowing that she's in true need of a friend and has no one else?\n\nOr for telling her that I would contact her in January and never doing that because I've had so much stress in my life that I can't handle her antics?\n\nWould I be the asshole if I sent her a message explaining why I ended contact with her?",

      "description": "Ok so i know i post a lot on this subreddit but this is a serious issue i continuiously have. So this is basically 2 stories in one but i will start with the least problematic , This kid in my class is pretty arogant. He's in a special needs class despite the fact that he has no mental problems and simply doesn't want to learn anything. On top of that he barely ever comes to school , missing every day that he can. He has a binder that was given to him by the special needs teacher with simple math problems in it. Example: 2+4. \nHowever instead of even doing simple math he decides to talk and goof off during class. The worst part however is that he asks , No , Begs for money. Every chance he gets , \"Hey Jacob you got 2 dollars?\". He asks almost everyday and I'm not even in high school yet so I'll be dammed if I'm gonna spend 2 Dollars every day. Every time he asks for money , if I do give him 2 dollars he says , \"Actually can I get another dollar?\" , It is living Hell During break nowadays. I always have to avoid him , But recently he has asked less and less which is why it isn't too much of a problem anymore , But that was just the icing on the cake. This other kid asks me for money too , but he is WAY worse. He asks for a dollar ,  sometimes two and over and over again if I say no. I pass by him on my way to school every morning and he lives in a \"poor neighborhood\" , I use the word Poor lightly there because his family has multiple children and buys school clothes and merchandise , and distributes spending money to at least two of them. Not to mention the lunchroom prices. That would mean that they set aside 120 dollars for school clothing alone! But I always feel guilty when I say no , on account of him living in a poor neighborhood , regardless if his family is poor or not. He also curses loudly when I refuse , \"Oh my fucking GAWD!\" , Which still doesn't stop me from feeling guilty. My parents and friends don't think I'm in the wrong here but people on reddit are experts on this so make of this what you will.",

      "description": " \n\nI play on a co-ed indoor soccer team that meets once a week to play another team in our league. Everything is supposed to be clean and fun. We've played 7 games this season and their seems to be a mutual respect between teams. Except for this last team.\n\nFour of their players were being pushy, tripping players and pushing them into walls. Two of the got blue cards(warnings) but the refs weren't really doing anything else about it and it cause the whole situation to escalate real quick. They got a couple penalties at the start of the second half and my team started flopping, trying to pull more penalties. Both teams were kind of a mess.\n\nAnyways, throughout the whole game this one guy on the other team is playing really rough, swearing at us, flopping, and begging the refs to make better calls. He got a penalty in the first period and continued playing aggressively afterwards. In the second period I'm trying to cover this guy and the ball went over our heads. We both race towards it and he give me a shove (I don't fall over or flop) but the ref whistles and calls it in our favor giving the guy a warning. I can see on his face that hes upset with the call.\n\nAt the point something in my brain goes off. I know that if I push this guy far enough he'll get a red card. So I tell him \"Maybe you should try falling over again.\" He glared and called me a pussy. This is all within earshot of the ref by the way.\n\nPlay starts again and soon enough we are fighting for the ball again. He throws a shoulder in my face and the ref immediately stops play. I tell him real smugly to cool it off. He says \"Shave your fucking mustache you ugly fuck.\" Or something along those lines. Ref gives him a red card and sends him packing.\n\nI feel bad for sinking to his level but I justify it to myself that he was making the game less fun for everyone and putting my team's safety at risk. He should have been taken out of the game earlier in my opinion. What do you think?",

I walked up to the counter and said that I think that because i only got half of what i payed for and didn't want to pay full price for half of what i actually payed for. the woman at the counter just said that they don't do refunds, never. so i kept going that half price for a half day isn't wrong and both parties get it as good as they could in a situation like this but she just kept saying, \"we won't do refunds\". at this point am i getting a bit irritated at the situation. at this point did one of the skii patroll step in and started of pretty rude by just saying that \"everyone was informed that there is a risk of the lifts closing and there won't be any refunds\" me pretty confused at this point asked him how and when i was informed about this and he just said that I shouldn't ask such stupid questions and just leave and this is when I made it my mission to get the 2000 yen back of the 4000 i payed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso i went full attack mode and demanded my money back and at the same time running the skii patroll over by just answering his questions and countering with telling him that what he says makes no sense and gave him a counter argument. this went on for 45 minutes when the lady at the register went to get her manager and i pretty much repeated what i said to the cashier to him and after 30 minutes of arguing did the manager just tell me to give him my bank card so he could give me a full refund. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nafter this ordeal did i meet the cashier at the lokal bar and apologized for my behaviour and told her that she could have any drink she wanted on me as an apology and we proceeded to talk for a couple of hours and before i left did she tell me that i'm not the first, nor the worst. and the fact that i went up to her afterwards really warmed her heart cause that showed that i wasn't mad at her but their policy which she agreed on was a bit stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry if my english isn't 100%, it is my second language.",

      "description": "So, background info;\n\nMy biological mom and dad got divorced when i was 2 (spent my time 50/50 at my bio moms and dads still), he met his now-wife when i was 4, and I'm now 21. My dad have problems with alcoholism; neither me, nor my (half)sister noticed anything, until i think 4 or 5 years ago, were my dad broke completely down and went full on alcoholic for a month, wanted a divorce with his wife/ my bonus-mom, and ends up in the hospital because he just binge-drank and he stopped cold. \n\nAt around the same time, I more or less moved out; first at what amounts to a boarding school, then a year off to work where i stayed with my bio-mom (she moved out of country) and now i've been studying at the other end of the country for 3½ years, living at a campus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad still have problems with alcohol - he likes to drink, but he can't handle it for shit. He takes antibus (if you drink you get ill) to stop drinking, but he won't stop drinking completely; sometimes he gets \"days off\" where he is allowed to drink, and isn't on his medicine. \n\nAgain, tho, he can't hold his alcohol for shit, and he's an he usually turns into an idiot when hes drunk; if you point out that hes drunk, he gets mad, and then he and my bonus-mom, and usually my sister ends up just shouting at each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't live at home. I visit like, once a month; i haven't experienced any \"episodes\" in the last month or so, but hes still drinking, and he still can't hold his alcohol, so I'm not holding my breath - and anyways, thats not really important. \n\nUsually, when my dad went off to bed, my bonus-mom would ask me to talk to my dad; tell him that he was being a douche, and would he please not do it again? \n\nI've tried that. Multiple times. Either he doesn't listen, or he listen, but decides my bonus-mom made me do it (which, tbf, she did, but that doesn't change the fact he was a complete twatwaffle all those times) and he becomes angry at her (and she then kinda become angry with me and my sister). \n\nIf I don't say anything, then my bonus-mom think I'm a coward and more or less an asshole for not saying anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, i guess the question here; Am I the asshole here, for just being... done, and not bothering anymore? I get why my bonus-mom want me to bring it up, but it doesn't solve anything - rather, it usually only make more problems; besides, I'm not even living at home. Also, sorry for the wall of text.",

      "description": "I'll be referring to my friend as Rob and the accuser as Sarah. \n\nSo we're all juniors in high school. Rob and I have been friends since 2nd grade. He and I both met Sarah last year, in 10th grade. I'm close friends with Rob and less-close-but-still-friends with Sarah.\n\nRob started dating Sarah at the end of the last school year. He told me about how she slept with him. He also said he expected her to be a virgin since she's super religious, but she wasn't and apparantly lost her virginity to her ex. \n\nAfter a while, Rob breaks up with her.\n\nTwo weeks after that, she accuses him of raping her on snapchat. On snapchat of all places... Basically, she posted on her story how Rob raped her.\n\nNow, immediately after this, I decided I wanted to look into this to see if her allegations held any weight. Of course, I'll probably have some unconscious bias toward Rob, but I like to think of myself as a logical person.\n\nSo, i examined her story. And it just doesn't add up. She used a defense of 'hey, I'm Christian, why would I sleep with a guy?' But remember how Rob told me she wasn't a virgin and said she lost it to an ex? That ex goes to our school, so I asked him. He said yes, they had sex.\n\nNow, I think this is decent. But at the end of the day this is just he-said-she-said. So it wouldn't hold up.\n\nSo I asked both Sarah and Rob their specific sides of the story: when this alleged rape occurred, what led up to it, what happened, after, etc. \n\nSarah gave me a date and time: October 9th, right after getting home from school. So I was checking to see if this was true. And nope, it didn't add up. School ends at 3:22. From the school (according to google maps), his house is 17 minutes away. He and I were texting each other consistantly from 3:25 to 4:13, with no significant gaps of time without him replying back. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, that's pretty damning evidence. \n\nSo I tried to decide what to do with the evidence. I decided, fuck it. Since Sarah used snapchat, I would too. I created a google doc with my evidence and linked it on my story. \n\nSarah saw this and is calling me a huge dick for not believing her. Am I? Personally I feel the evidence doesn't support her.",

      "description": "Hey there, this is going to sound weird, but here we go. I should also mention that this is my first post on here, so I apologize if I’m doing anything wrong here.\n\nBACKGROUND INFO: I had a friend named Andrew. We were very VERY close and bonded over several things. However, he lived in Vermont, and I live in California. So, we never met.\n\nI have a few more friends that were also friends with him, however they live in Michigan, Tennessee, Utah, and Texas respectively. None of us live in the same state.\n\nOur friend Andrew expresses thoughts of suicide multiple times, leading all of us to contact his parents out of concern.\n\nHis parents thanked us and took him to the hospital where he was put on suicide watch. \n\nWe had no contact with him for weeks.\n\nWhen he got back, and was said to be doing better, he texted all of us to catch up. \n\nThen the next day we found out he took his life.\n\nThat was a little over a year ago. \n\nJanuary, 2018. \n\nHe was a very kind and loving person, and we all miss him very very much. \n\nNow, for the actual story.\n\nI have a new group of friends now, some that actually live in my town and go to my school. \n\nI was talking to them about stuff that had been going on, and we got onto the subject of why I had been growing distant.\n\nReason: Andrews One Year Anniversary was coming up. \n\nI didn’t tell them. They decided that we should all hang out sometime, to try and get my mind off of whatever was bothering me.\n\nWe hung out, like normal, and when they were at my house, I was on Instagram, like normal, and all my friends were posting the date, and hearts, and pictures of Andrew. Then I remembered, that Today Was The Day. I told them all to leave, shitty, I know.\n\nI had been growing more and more distant, until a few days ago.\n\nThey finally confronted me, and I knew something was going to go down.\n\nI was at my friend (let’s call her Maria) Maria’s house, and we were hanging out. It was around 9pm when this conversation started. It was around 1am when it ended.\n\nMy friends (Ashley, Nicole, and Bonnie) were asking me what was wrong. (Those are fake names, of course.) \n\nI told them I missed Andrews one year, because I wasn’t hanging out with them.\n\nThey told me it was normal, and they didn’t understand why I was so upset. \n\nThe conversation went a bit like this:\n\n(keep in mind, this was days ago, and I left the groupchat after. I have screenshots that I can post if needed, this is 100% real.)\n\nA: so... what’s the matter? \n\nMe: i missed andys 1yr because i was with y’all\n\nN: Thats okay, don’t worry, he’d have wanted you to be happy\n\nMe: i can’t do that to him. \n\nA: have you moved on yet, [my name]\n\nMe: i’m trying, yeah\n\nA: so... you haven’t moved on?\n\nMe: at the moment? no\n\nN: that’s unhealthy\n\nB: are you okay?\n\nMe: what do you mean?\n\nN: it’s been a year dude\n\nA: yeah you gotta accept it\n\nMe: i have accepted it, i’m just taking my time moving on and reading through all our texts and emails and praying that he’s finally found peace\n\nA: praying? are you five?\n\nMe: excuse me?\n\nA: you need to accept it. praying isn’t going to bring him back, sis\n\nMe: i know it wont. i’m praying for his soul to have found peace, and for his family to find happiness\n\nB: i didn’t know you were religious\n\nMe: i’m not. i was raised on faith in the after life and eternal peace. not jesus\n\n(For context, my family is agnostic jewish)\n\nB: that’s cool!\n\nA: you gotta accept it broski\n\nMe: i have. \n\nA: you haven’t\n\nA: praying for him won’t help\n\nA: he. is. gone.\n\nN: he’s dead, [my name]\n\nThat was it. My final breaking point. I started typing as fast as I could, screaming profanities through the screen, telling them how they didn’t know him, they can’t tell me how to move on, and how they need to back off, and how i was going to take one more day to remember him, since i was robbed of that on his Anniversary.\n\nMe: you didn’t know him, you weren’t close to him like I was, you don’t know how hard it was for me to lose him and not be able to tell ANYONE about this, because when this happened, ALL my friends were friends with him. no one else knew him, I didn’t have any friends outside of my friend group with him. You didn’t know him, don’t tell me how to move on\n\nA: we’ve all lost people, chill\n\nN: one more day isn’t going to fix anything. He is GONE\n\nMe: no, I’m taking another day to remember him and look through out texts and remember what he was to me, and how he helped me through more than any of you did\n\nN: really, what’d he help you do that we couldn’t have done? \n\nMe: he helped me come out, he talked me out of SUICIDE, which none of you EVER would have done, because you’re too busy with yourselves\n\nB: i’m so sorry, [my name], i had no idea. you should take that other day.\n\nN: no, it’s unhealthy\n\nA: you need to calm down\n\nI kept blowing up, and blowing up, and at this point i was sobbing in Maria’s bedroom, and she hugged me while I was crying.\n\nThey all eventually told me I needed to go to sleep because i was over reacting.\n\nI apologized to them for how I acted the next day.\n\nBonnie was the only nice one, and I will forever thank her for being supportive when Ashly and Nicole weren’t. Maria was also more supportive than I could’ve asked for.\n\nI have trouble opening up to them now, especially since today has been one of the worst days of my life. I went to tell them about it, but they went “Oh, same” and moved on.\n\nI can’t tell them ANYTHING anymore. \n\nI’ve had a crush on Nicole for almost as long as I’ve known her, and I told her the other day. \n\nShe said it wouldn’t ruin our friendship, and it led to a conversation, but that’s a whole different post. \n\nSo please, Reddit, tell me, \n\nAm I The Asshole?\n",

      "title": "AITA For Wanting My Brother To Get Rid Of His Rabbit?",
      "description": "About a year ago, my family got rabbits. We originally had three - brothers - and each one of us had one rabbit dubbed as \"theirs\". For a period of time after we got them, everything went fine. We all took turns cleaning out the hutch, feeding them, filling up their water, ect. \n\nHowever, about six months after we got them, a fox managed to break into their hutch despite the precautions we had put up, and two of them were killed. The only rabbit that survived was my brother's. Shortly after this happened - at my brother's request - we bought a smaller hutch and moved his rabbit inside. As our house is fairly small, the rabbit ended up being moved into my room since I had the most free space.\n\nI didn't really mind as I was assured that my brother would take the main burden of looking after it and, for a while, that's what happened. But barely a month later, my brother just completely stopped. I quickly became the sole caretaker of the rabbit. My brother would refuse to clean his hutch out or even give him water. I would attempt to get him to do it, only for my mum to tell me to do it \"just this once\".\n\nJust this once turned into every time. I have limited mobility of my left arm thanks to nerve damage from an accident and, let me tell you, cleaning out a rabbit with only one arm is HARD. For the past six or seven months, my brother has done jack to look after his rabbit. The only time he shows any interest is when he wants to get him out of the hutch to play. \n\nI'm sick of it. The rabbit isn't even mine, yet I'm the only one who does anything to take care of him and there's a large chunk of my room taken up by a creature that I'm not even allowed to claim ownership over. \n\nLast night I snapped and gave my mum three choices:\n- My brother either takes over caring for the rabbit and stops forcing me to do everything\nOR\n- The rabbit becomes mine and my brother will no longer be allowed to barge into my room to play with it\nOR \n- The rabbit goes\n\nMy brother went into a screaming meltdown (He's 10 and he literally threw a tantrum over being asked to take care of HIS rabbit) about how I'm so horrible for wanting to get rid of the pet that he \"loves\" so much. My mum got snippy at me, telling me that it wasn't fair for me to expect my brother to look after a rabbit when he already has to deal with school and being on a sports team. \n\nI lost it at that point. I am barely three months away from my GCSEs and I'm currently being forced to juggle studies and a part time job. When I get to college, I know my workload will pretty much be doubled. I repeated my points again and told her either she picks an option, or I take care of this myself.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love that rabbit, but it's getting too much. My brother goes mental if I just take the rabbit out of his hutch to play without calling him into the room to join in.\n\nI am not willing to do all of this for a rabbit that I'm not even allowed to play with. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am currently training someone to cover my job for when I go on leave at the end of march. They have repeatedly forgotten appointments/  told me a day would work for them, then booked it up ahead of time without leaving room for what I needed to show them. We make our own schedules.\n\n3 weeks ago, I booked this person to meet me at 2:20 today and we would drive to where we needed to go, to be there for 3. I have text confirmation. This morning, I texted them that they would have to meet me at the place at 3, (because I had an appointment nearby and it did not make sense for me to back track to pick this person up when they also have a company vehicle so it doesn't really change anything for them, they just have to drive). Nothing else changed. \n\nThey asked \"can we not do it earlier?\" , I said no, thats the time we booked with the place 3 weeks ago. I asked \"can you not make it anymore?\". They tried to say that we had scheduled it for 2pm, but I looked back in our text conversations and we 100% booked it for 3pm and my coworker confirmed. They are going to come for the correct time now but they told me AFTER, they wanted to do it earlier because they were supposed to take a family member to the hospital. I felt like an ass and offered after they told me that to see if we could change the time and they texted me short responses like  \"no Ill make it work\" \"k\" sort of texts back and I feel like they are upset at me. \n\nI decided to just leave it at that with the coworker and not look into changing the appointment....

      "description": "I've been dating my wonderful, patient, amazing, gorgeous girlfriend for a little over two years. We're both in two different stages of life, so we don't see each other very often--usually, once during the week (if we're lucky) and, on the weekends she doesn't work, we spend all weekend together. I love her and I'm IN love with her. \n\nHowever, I don't like talking on the phone. It just isn't a form of communication I enjoy. I don't like talking on the phone at work, i don't like talking on the phone with my mother, brother, father, or friends. Once in a while to catch up? Sure! \n\nBut with my girlfriend, it's all throughout the day texting, then it's a phone call on the car ride home, then texting all throughout the night, and then a phone call before bed. It feels like it's constant communication, even when she's not around. \n\nI feel like it's like she thinks our phone calls are \"quality time\" where as, for me, it just feels incessant. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to talk as much as we do?",

When I asked him how long I'd take for me to contact him \"in a normal way\", he couldn't give me a concrete answer (for the record, I know this Isn't some way to get rid of me, every time something bad happens in his life he pushes people away and then tries to act like nothing happened after some time). The thing is, this stresses me a lot. I wouldn't mind a \"contact me in a month and if I'm still feeling like crap then contact me 2 weeks later\" or something of the sort, but an ominous \"I don't know when I'll be better\" tears an emotional hole though my chest and doesn't let me sleep at night. \n\nThis already happened with an ex-friend some time ago; she was going though an incredibly difficult time in her life and just ghosted me, after a couple of days I had a mental breakdown and told her to get out of my life.

      "title": "AITA for being upset that my roommmate keeps locking me out of my room to have sex?",
      "description": "This is my first time posting so apologies if I miss anything. Trying to give backstory so it's gonna be a long read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy roommmate (let's call him R) and I roomed together in a college dorm as freshmen, and we had a great time. We were compatible as roommates and were good friends the first semester and decided to room again in a shared room in an apartment for sophomore year, which has a living room. We couldn't afford to pay for single rooms. So second semester of freshman year rolls around and R meets a girl and they start dating. They start having sex and spend long times in the dorm, kicking me out frequently which I was actually fine with as I genuinely wanted R to have fun and experience that stuff so I was leaving the room almost every day for 4 to 8 hours for them the first 2-3 weeks, then gradually lessened as they began to calm down the pace to like 4 times a week. R and gf did sleep over a good amount during this semester as well, which was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we roll around to sophomore year and theyre still dating, and I'm still good friends with R and somewhat friends with R's gf. R and R's gf continue to have sex and ask me to leave often, which I always do. I would say about 3 to 5 times a week this would happen, mostly late at night. This would happen by all 3 of us being in the room and R then would ask me for the room, and I would then go study in the living room until they let me back in 1-2 hours later which was admittedly an improvement from the previous 4 to 8 hours of freshman year. As a side note I did have to leave my desktop and gaming set-up in the room which kinda sucked. They also spent a good amount of time (3-6) hours studying and talking in the room rather than the living room, about 3 to 4 times a week. At this point I am beginning to get irritated as I didn't sign up to room like this and at this point was just wanting to be in my room and chilling without feeling like a third wheel in my own space, especially when there was a living room for them to be in when they weren't having sex. As a result of this, I decided to room for junior year with a different roommate as I'm tired of dealing with the sexile situation. R and I still will be in the same apartment, just different rooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother fast forward to 3 weeks after the start of our second semester of sophomore year, and I'm fed up with being locked out of my room. Now, instead of asking me to leave the room (R knows I get annoyed when he asks me) or giving me a heads up text, they just have sex when I'm out and without knowing when I'll be back. During the first period of the semester, I came in to my apartment and my room was locked and they would be having sex. I would say this happened about 6 times in 3 weeks. I have never gotten a heads up text. Ironically enough I have a key to my room but I just knock and wait outside for them to finish, which is usually about 10 minutes now. I feel uncomfortable being with them in the room afterwards as I know they were just having sex before I interrupted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, last week some mutual friends are over to hang out and R and his gf are hanging out with us. In the middle of it, (we are all in the living room), R and his gf go into our room and have sex for an hour, locking everyone out of the bathroom as well. This upsets me as I think this is rude (as do our friends) and after everyone has gone, I tell R that I'm irritated and need to talk to him about setting some room guidelines. Instead of trying to be receptive or inclined to discuss the situation, R gets upset with me and says that he tries really hard to schedule his sex so that I am not interrupted, even though I was still locked out of my room several times already this semester but for a lesser duration. I then ask him to be more discreet about having sex and to do it when he knows I'm out of the room (side note: R's gf and I have several classes at the same time) which is at least 2 times a week outside of conflicting schedules. I then also ask him to hang out with his gf in the living room when they are studying and talking as I feel it is unfair to have her in the room while I'm there as I feel like I am an unwilling third-wheel and the living room is a reasonable option. In response, R becomes upset and says that he feels we aren't friends anymore, ever since I decided to stop rooming with him. This is his first time saying this and I interpreted this as him using our friendship as leverage against me as a roommate as it was unrelated to what I brought up. Following this, we get into an argument for this reason alongside the fact that he didn't show that he's grateful for all the times I've left the room for him and the fact that I've never kicked him out of the room. He did acknowledge that having sex while friends were over was wrong and he won't do it again. Otherwise, living with him has become super uncomfortable, as both of us think the other is in the wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been accommodating my roommate and his gf's sex life for a year now and am tired of doing so, and feel like he's in the wrong for expecting me to continue leaving for him when I didn't want to sign up for this living situation in the first place, and him getting upset when I try to communicate my desire for him to lock me out less. I do genuinely want to come home to my room to relax and not deal with social situations and it bums me out when my room's locked and then afterwards someone else's gf is in my room. I don't mind them using the room or R's gf, I just want them to have sex when they know I won't be coming home, and I had already given R 2 guaranteed times a week where I'd be out for 3+ hours. Instead, he just has sex in the room at random points in the day without giving me a heads up and hopes I won't come home during it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe, on the other hand, thinks I am in the wrong as he feels he deserves time in the room and that I am not appreciative of him trying to kick me out less and for less time, which I admit he does in comparison to the beginning of the whole situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also like to add that I am an introvert and tend to stay in the room a good amount when I'm not in class, which I feel bad about for R when he's trying to have sex but still don't know if it's my responsibility to leave so that he can have sex as I have been leaving for \\~ a year and am getting tired of it. When it was just him and I in the room we got along fine and I miss feeling like I have my own room and space. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being a bad roommate and being unreasonable?",

      "description": "This will probably be pretty long, I'll include a tl;dr below.\n\nMy highschool aged brother recently started dating a girl, maybe a week and a half ago, who is way too clingy. She made him change his lockscreen to a picture of her, give her his phone password (I'll come back to this) and said \"I love you\" in front of our parents, all within a week of dating. For reference, they've known each other less than a month.\n\nI'll straight up tell you I don't like this girl. I hardly know her, but she is taking over my brother and I can't stand it.\n\nSo once they began dating, which literally was just a \"Hey we're dating now\" type deal, she has shown that she is way too possessive. He got a snapchat in class from a (male) friend, and she wanted to see what it was. My brother basically told her not to worry about it, and she started trying to unlock his phone when he wasn't watching. I'm a little fuzzy on the details, because he has only told me so much. He caved and gave her his password, and now she likes to check up on him. I also know she has read through his texts to me, to his best friend, and I believe to others as well.\n\nHe went to watch a movie at one of her friends houses, and was there a little longer than a movie generally takes. I'm not dumb, but he swears they only made out. I don't care that they did, in fact that is one of the least weird parts of their relationship. When she dropped him off at home after, to go see a concert with me, she dropped the \"love you\" line. He of course said it back. He forgot his phone at her friends house however, and they most certainly went through it. I got a text the next morning, from her (on his phone) to tell him to pick it up.  I don't think he quite understands what he is doing. I think he is only thinking with one head if you catch my drift.\n\nIts probably not my place to say, but I think she is trying to isolate him from his friends. He barely does anything but text and call her. She also needs to know where he is and will call him all the time, before school, after school, even during sometimes. \n\nFor my part, I've advised him against it from the start, somewhat strongly. I think she's crazy, and way too possessive. I've told him so, but our parents don't want to do anything, but they also don't know the extent of it. They plan to have sex in the near future, and I am concerned af with where that will go. Teenagers gonna teenager, sure. But I don't think she is incapable of something truly evil, if you know what I mean, what with how she has latched onto him so far.\n\nTl;dr: My brother started dating a girl, who wants his phone password, wants his lockscreen to be a picture of her, and wants all of his attention all of the time. I want him to break it off, and I've told him so. AITA for trying to stop my brother from dating this girl?",

      "description": "So I am mixed race (1/2 indian, 1/2 white british) and I have a few issues growing up such as being called a half caste for most of my school life, having people give me and my parents looks when they took me out, most of my mothers side disowning her when she married my dad, but the worse has been not fitting in during school where there was a massive divide between coloured people and white people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway during my first year at uni I got put into halls like everyone else and on out first night we started drinking and introducing ourselves with our flat and the neighbors like where we are from and what we are studying, I said I am for xxxxx but they asked where I am really from (I am very tanned so its obvious I am not native) and said I am mixed indian and british. The next day we had to sign up to our local GP and on the ethnicity form she noticed I had selected mixed other and filled out indian/english and she commented how I am bascially white, this was the first time she told me that I am white.\n\nThroughout the year should would bring up that I am white and try to be indian just because I fasted for Diwali and went to celebrations at the temple cause I have done every year with my mum, I mostly ignored her but sometimes it dug deep and bought back memorys of when I would have done anything to be just white. Everytime she brought it up I would tell her that im not white and even showed her a picture of my mum. \n\nOn the last day of term 2 we went to a rock/metal/punk pub for a pub quiz and to get hammered, I love this place but everytime I go I cant help but notice everyone there is white, now where I study this is very rare and is easy to notice. One of my friends bought it up \"Did you guys notice everyone here is white except you criostoir\" to which she blurted out \"He is basically white he just pretends to be darker and I think its kinda racist how he tried to be somthing he is not\" and I just lost it, I couldnt take it anymore I firmly told her (louder then I usually talk and much more angrily),\n\n\"I am obviously not white, I dont pretend to be anything i'm not, I have most of my life not knowing if I am British or if I am indian, white or not and you no idea what has happened to me, I went through 7 years of my life being called the equivalent of the N word, half my family dont acknowledge my existance and most talk shit to me when we have to interact, I have been beaten up for saying I am white or I am brown and I have had enough of your bollocks, if you treat everyone you meet this way you will make an awful nurse and honestly being bi you should know better than to deny how someone feels.\"\n\nI had literaly thought about saying this for so long and never had the guts to do obviously the drinks had some effect on me. She got up and left shortly after with her friends and hasnt spoken to me since (1.5 years), I thought my argument was valid and I was well within my rights to say what I said but according to her friends I put her into a deep depression and gave her panic attacks. Now she has dropped out of uni (we are in 3rd year) and I cant help think if I had just ignored it for 3 more months it would all be okay.\n\nTLDR: Flatmate keeps saying I am basically white even though I am mixed race. Ignored it for 6 months, went to pub she said somthing extra hurtful and I lost it, apparently gave her depression and panic attacks which caused her to drop out of uni.",

So my friend and I took a nap during the play and I was woken up by one of my other friends. Apperently I was snoring, but not loud enough to bother others around me, at least that's what my friend said. We all move to get up and stretch before the next play starts. I stand up and suddenly the girl in front of me turns around and starts yelling at me for falling alseep. She doesnt yell at the other girl who fell asleep, just me. I was still out of it because I had just woken up and she asked me how I could be so rude and fall asleep. I told her the truth that the play was boring and she went off even more. I try walking away and she follows me, still continuing to make a scene and screams at me for my sleep schedule (even though we fell asleep at the same time because we had the same hotel room). She doesn't stop her tangent for the next 7 minutes, so I realize she isn't going to leave me alone and I take a seat keeping my mouth shut and trying insanely hard not to punch her. She only stopped after a senior told her to quit it because she could tell how angry I was getting. \nAm I the asshole for falling asleep? ",

      "description": "My partner has just gotten his first 'proper' job as an undergraduate software engineer at a large company and he is loving the work. Originally he was only supposed to be working 2-3 days a week as a casual but since it's been uni holidays he was put on the full 5 days a week. He is contracted for 7 hours a day which means if he works over time he doesn't get paid. There's been a few times he would stay back late to finish off work, and I understand working in his field that once his mind is in it it's best to just keep working. Hours are logged each week to make sure that he worked the minimum 35 hours (which is what is is payed for). \n\nNow for the problem... This week he had stayed back late two days. I had asked him in the middle of the week to take a half day on Friday (today) since we have people coming over and I thought it would be polite to have him here when they come over. As well as this, we barely see each other through the week so I thought it might be nice if he came home early and we could spend some time together. He said he would see how it goes. \n\nSkip to today and he has no plans on taking a half day. I'm getting angry because it was important to me that he be here for the guests and I'm a little hurt that he would rather work unpaid hours then be here with me. He is saying that this is how salary jobs are and I don't understand anything about how it works. That I need to stop getting upset at him working unpaid hours because he just gets paid per day, no matter how late he stays back. This breaks out into an argument where I'm in the wrong for saying he should only work the hours he is contracted for. \nHe ended up leaving a little earlier than normal and guilting me over text while on the train home, saying he had to rush his work. He says that he will work to how he wants and I need to keep out of it. \n\nAITA for being mad at him for working overtime and not being paid? We live together and share a bank account so I felt like his pay was my business, but should I just keep out of it and let him keep working these extra hours without complaining? ",

      "description": "Four years ago, a friend of mine graciously offered to help me financially since me and my family were struggling. It was a hefty amount of money (for me, at least) and I am still very greatful for it. I told him I'd pay it back gradually, since I don't have the means to pay it in full, but he insisted that I don't have to. As of now I've paid about 1/3 of the debt and I'm planning to complete it eventually. I'm sticking to a plan that ensures I get to pay him, but I also get to save some money for my emergency funds, which I also discussed with him and he was supportive of it. I've been financially independent from my mom so I have to pay for my own rent, food, insurance, etc. \n\nHowever, even though he still insists that I don't pay him back, I always feel like he's judging me everytime I talk to him about my expenses. I asked for his opinion on what laptop to get, as mine is already deteriorating, and he scoffed when I told him my budget, as if saying I should go lower. I'm also moving in to my own place soon, and I shared to him that the place came semi-furnished already, and he said \"//of course// you had to pay extra for that\" in a very malicious tone. He also tends to be a bit off whenever I go out of town or something. These aren't expenses that I haven't thought through. A decent laptop I need for work, and I still haven't gotten around to getting one 'cause I can't get myself to pay THAT much for one thing lol. It took me months to decide to get my own place because I'm wary of the expenses, but decided to go for it just recently cause even my therapist advised that I should. My trips are also very scarce and very thrifted.\n\nI just don't understand why he keeps saying that I don't have to pay him, but he keeps acting this way whenever I spend for myself. Did he just say it out of courtesy? Am I the asshole for not paying him immediately and spending money instead on myself? Admittedly, I've been taking a while since I only recently started building up my savings since I was stuck living paycheck-to-paycheck at a sucky job for 2 years. But I also don't think I spend on unnecessary expenses since I'm very conscious with my money. I can't help but feel judged, like he probably thinks I can't handle my own finances. Should I just hasten paying off my debt?",

A significant part of stacking the skids is that if there are bags being shipped, they arrive to the chutes in a timely manner so there's a decent base to build on.\n\n    And to give an idea of what this guy (I'll call him Ass) is like, he once got nose-to-nose with me because the I was using the only electric pallet jack in the charging area that wasn't uncomfortably slow, on a really bad day workload wise. Ass had put an unsigned note on it so he could replace the other good one he was on when he drained that battery, and me ignoring the note to do my job quick was disrespectful to him.\n\n     Ass decides at his whim that the SOP for doing the only thing he's responsible for (picking bagged product) isn't good enough and has recently started holding entire trucks worth of product until he's picked the truck. His direct supervisors know what he's doing but either don't care because \"his numbers are good\" or are intimidated by him. Even the higher-ups have an idea of how much of a dill-hole he is, but it's the same thing with them.\n     He also leaves damaged product in the location when part of the picking SOP is bringing damages to the specified location, next to where all of the bags are.\n\n     One of my responsibilities is getting items that weren't able to be picked initially out of the overhead storage and replenishing their locations as needed. He had zeroed out cat litter but conveniently left all of the damaged bags in the location.  \n\n       Now for my brand of benign justice.\n\n       Ass leaves his shoes at work, mind that they aren't steel toed because he doesn't want to anymore and work even provided fitted slip-ons with reinforced toes to accommodate him. He'll even take those off more often than not because, shocker, he doesn't want to anymore.   \n\n     After he left I put a decent sprinkling of spilled litter from the damages he left in each shoe hoping that he would be even remotely irritated and inconvenienced as he's made others feel over the last year.\n\nDoes it make me even more of an asshole for resorting to that before going to HR?\n\n     \n\n",

      "description": "\nFirst, some background; My boyfriend and I have been together for about 11 months. I have been trying to learn drums for about 8 months, and so far it’s been going well. I’ve gotten pretty decent, but I’m still really insecure about my ability and I don’t like playing to people. My boyfriend has been begging me to play to him for a good while, but I’ve only done it a handful of times. He is really lovely every time, but I just don’t feel nice when I play for him. I’m trying to work on it.\n\nAnyways, a few days ago it was his birthday, so (among other gifts) I sent him a video of me playing his favourite song (Television/So Far So Good by Rex Orange County)  \n\nHe was over the moon when I sent it. He loved it, and kept sending me texts telling me how incredible it was. We met up for dinner, I gave him his other gifts, and he spent a good part of the meal raving about the video. We went back to his place for a while, then I went back home and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, I had messages from friends telling me I was a great drummer, and asking why I hadn’t performed or played for them yet. Confused and panicked, I opened Facebook to see my boyfriend had posted the video, and tagged me in it. I was mortified and immediately panicked and texted him telling him to call me.\n\nHe called, and I instantly started sobbing. I begged him to delete the post. After a few minutes of him telling me the video was awesome and I needed to share my talent with our friends, he reluctantly agreed to take it down. I thanked him and hung up to calm down. I was slightly mad, but more panicked. I understood why he did it but it was still careless, I felt. \n\nAbout half an hour later, he sent me a text, saying that I was being ridiculous and that I’d never told him he couldn’t post it, so how was he meant to know? And besides, it was a gift to him so surely he could do what he wanted with it. He said he’d spoke to our mutual friend, who had agreed I was being ridiculous.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole??\n\nTL;DR: Am a drummer who is insecure, sent my bf a video of me drumming for his birthday, he posted it on Facebook, knowing my insecurity. I panicked and got a little mad, he thinks I’m being ridiculous. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I bought an item that needed a part repaired and my SO suggested we could do it on our own. He is a handy guy so I trusted we could get it done on our own to save money since it's an expensive item (to me) to begin with. I paid $130 for the part and attempted to replace the part myself. After not getting anywhere with it, he asked to take over and I politely asked that he promise not to damage it since it's expensive. It was not damaged at this point. He agreed he wouldn't damage it. Perfect! I figured if he can't, I might as well pay to have it professionally repaired because I didn't want any damages on it. After working on it for about an hour and at the end of the night I looked at the item and noticed some very noticeable damage. It's been a couple hours at this point, why hadn't he talked to me about it? I confronted him and I will admit I was frustrated. What frustrated me is that he avoided telling me the whole evening and he also tried to blame the damage on me when I clearly gave it to him without damage. We argued that night and I explained I wouldn't have been so frustrated if he communicated like an adult and approached me and said hey I couldn't avoid damage. I honestly would have understood it was unavoidable. Instead he tried to say I damaged it myself. He has a track record of being a compulsive liar and he knows this. Trying to work on it with him but this situation didn't help his case. ",

      "description": "Okay so hear me out. \n\nI work food service, and I'm the youngest girl on staff. Sometimes certain customers make me uncomfortable, and my male coworkers don't have a problem letting me hide in the back while they take certain orders. Mostly older gentlemen who flirt a little to hard and can't take a hint, or really creepy guys who ask me exactly when I leave (rarely, the two combined, which is not fun). However, this time I get no help at all. Here's why.\n\nSo we get two or three special needs groups that come in a couple times a week. They're all really nice, and arguably the most polite and respectful customers. I love them. But this one guy is really pushy about getting my attention. The moment he saw me walk in for my shift today, he immediately recognized me and started talking to me. That's fine. But he continued even after started to walk to the back. I chatted, then gently said bye so I could get to work. I clock in, and everything is fine as long as I'm out of sight range. He doesn't try to walk into the staff area, so I just prep. Eventually I have to work the front line, and even though I'm taking customers, he's still talking to me. I'm polite and kind about switching to my customers, but he still gets upset and almost angry. And no one feels the need to do anything about it. I've told him I'm busy in a gentle way. I've told him \"hang on please\". I've made it uber clear I'm working. And he refuses to acknowledge that. He can see that I'm busy, but just gets mad when I try to do my job. He also makes me physically uncomfortable, by leaning waaaaay over the counter to talk to me, and getting as close as he can with that barrier between us. I still don't have a problem with him though, I have a problem with my supervisor. \n\nAs the guy and his group leaves, I'm still in the back. I hear him saying goodbye, and also hear him say \"Make sure that SHE makes my sandwich next time\", referring to me. My supervisor tells him \"Of course I will!\" and waves him off. As said super walks to the back, I'm like \"Hey, I know he means well, but that guy makes it kinda hard for me to work. Can I please work in the back while he's here?\". And she just laughs at me and says \"He's just making up for lost time\" (because he's about twice to 2.5 times my age). And I'm kinda upset. \"No, really, please? I can't get work done because he's talking to me, and he even got mad when I had to do other customer's orders\". My super realizes I'm serious and straight up tells me no, even though there's plenty of work that I could do that doesn't require being at the front. Even though I'm the only person on staff he treats this way, I have to cater to it. It makes me uncomfortable, and it makes my job very hard. She lets me stay in the back for those previously mentioned customers without problems. Am I An Asshole if I don't want to interact with this guy? ",

      "description": "Before I begin, a little background. I received the tickets I will discuss from a roommate that i2 don't know very well. Further, these tickets came from her mother, who I have met maybe 4 times. \n\nShe first messaged me and my roommates a couple of weeks ago asking for our availability to see a show in town, because her mom was buying us all tickets for Christmas. To be honest, I never replied to her initial message because I didn't know how to express that I really did not want to see the show. I should have definitely said something, however once the tickets were bought but I  kind of resigned myself to going at that point, if just to be polite.\n\nFlash forward to this week, and it was perhaps the worst week of my professional life. I work at a school as a sort of diversity officer, so my weekends are typically time to recharge my batteries. This week I dealt with an ongoing incident of racism and a student being targeted by an administrator, and this next week I can look forward to even more meetings and difficult conversations about this. After an already busy weekend I really just do not want to dedicate the day to a show I don't want to see. I realize it is pretty rude to cancel on the day of, and I expressed as much, but said I would have to decline. \n\nUnderstandably she is upset, but just kept trying to shame me because her mom bought these for us, adding in things like \"This is really and we'll talk about it later.\"\n\nI can see where she's coming from, but I also feel like I'm being asked to please a woman I don't even really know. I think she has a right to be upset, but am I an asshole?  ",

I have a decade of experience, but unfortunately live in a city that is not exactly what you’d think of as a “tech hub.” Last year I quit a company I had been at for about 4 years and since  have been contracting &amp; bouncing around every 3-6 months. It’s not ideal but that’s the industry. \n\nI liked where I was/am currently for the most part apart from management. Team lead was/is an aggressive bully who yelled at me during meetings, stole my work, etc. Wasn’t surprised when my recruiting company told me they weren’t extending my contract. NORMALLY I have found these things out the day of and then have to panic &amp; hunt down a job. But this time I was told with 2 weeks remaining, giving me time to interview and land another gig.\n\nYesterday I was “sick” (contractors can’t work from home and have no vacation or sick time so I had no choice but to call in sick to go interview.) Today I let them know that this Friday, not next Tuesday will be my last day. New job wants me to start one day before my contract was supposed to end. But my manager today acted incredibly put out when I gave the news. Said they were going to have to scramble and had no idea that this was my (new) last day since they thought it was going to be next Tuesday. I don’t get it? If they didn’t want me what is the drama? And wouldn’t they think I would be getting another job?\n\nDid I miss something? AITA?",

      "description": "For an incredibly long time now, I've been a trans woman and feel much more comfortable in the state I've transitioned into. Almost everybody I know has no qualms with it and I haven't had any difficulty with transphobia or any mocking behaviour against me.\n\nHowever, one of my best friends is actually quite averesed to transgenderism as a concept. I will preface this by saying I have no issue with people not agreeing with LGBTQ+ values, and understand not everybody is going to have the same views, but it's mainly the things this person has been saying to me that make me feel uncomfortable, not the fact they have these opinions.\n\nBefore I came out as a trans woman, we used to have many heated talks about whether transgender people can actually become the gender they want to be, them having no idea they were actually talking to one of them. This alone made me sort of concerned to even tell them when I had to issues telling somebody else. On top of that, after I had told them, they often told me how it was taking all their willpower to keep talking to me, saying their initial reaction would be to \"cut off all contact with you and think of you as crazy\". I would also tell them how I actually felt not aligning with my born sex, and they often said that if they made the laws it would be \"tough\" and I'd have to live in my discomfort with my sex.\n\nThis made me very uncomfortable and downright not want to talk to them at first out of some strange awkwardness, although I still would. However, they've seemed to start changing recently, telling me I shouldn't feel uncomfortable talking about my gender-related thoughts around them. This is marred by them repeatedly returning to what initially bothered me, they still tell me the same things they always have about how they feel of my dysphoria, and I still haven't shaken off that ill-will. I have no doubt they would change if given enough time, but I just need to know...\n\nIs this a normal response from me or AITA?\n\n",

During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how “in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway...” (so cliche!). I thought her speech was really selfish. I think it’s super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how “strong” she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! Sorry if I sound selfish, but IMO there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. AITA?",

      "description": "My girlfriend (30F) and I (26M)  have been together for almost a year now, in the beginning of our relationship we’ve fought over the lack of time spent with one another. Believe it or not it was me that would always express the fact that I don’t see her much. \n\nWe never really had a honeymoon stage, from the start it was always her forming our time around her friends. A few times she’d call our day short to see her friends and one time even canceled on me an hour prior to see her friends.\n\nEventually after many arguments I stopped voicing myself and just stayed content with the few hours I’d see her. \n\nSo just last week she had plans to see her friends and I was sick but encouraged her to go see them; however we met up early that day (her idea) to grab some food before she left to her friends. In that midst we got into an argument over something so ridiculous but around 10 we dropped it and she stated it was too late to go so she stayed the night. \n\nNow flash forward, she tells me that her friends are mad at her and aren’t speaking to her because she didn’t go out with them and she states that since it’s my fault she’s beginning to be resentful towards me and tells me I should fix this. \n\nSo I start messaging her friends that same night, telling them I’m sorry and it’s my fault and I ask for us all to go out and grab food and squash this. \n\nToday my girlfriend states that her friends still haven’t spoken to her and she’s angry/ resentful towards me and can’t be happy. I then told her, maybe her friends need to mature up because them ignoring her for over a week shows just how much they value the friendship. \n\nMy girlfriend flipped out on me and left to her place and I feel like an asshole. So long story short, Am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend didn’t see her friends on girls night and she states it’s my fault that they’re not talking to her anymore. I tried to reach out to them but my girlfriend still isn’t happy. I finally snap and tell her that her friends aren’t being friends if that’s the case. \n\n(Sorry for any grammar errors, mobile user) ",

      "description": "First off, he’s not a bum in any way, he’s just inbetween jobs right now (laid off since early December. He’s in tech/startup), which is why I feel like he’s overreacting a bit. And I’m 1.5 gen? Chinese American (moved to the states when I was in 5th grade), and he’s white, also the first non Asian guy I’ve dated. \n\nWe’ve been together for a little over a year, I was the first one to say I love you. I met his family over the winter holidays since they’re in the same state. And it went really well, his folks are super sweet and your typical laidback Californians. My parents are on the other side, both geographic location and general attitudes. \n\nChinese New Year is coming up, he asked me if I’d introduce him to my parents, they’re visiting and staying with me for a week (bf and I still live separately). I jokingly said not until he has a job, cuz right now my uber Chinese parents would not like the idea of me dating a younger non Chinese jobless dude. Apparently I definitely shouldn’t have said that, cuz it set him off, and he accused me of being ashamed of him and that he wasn’t good enough.  \n\nHe thinks I worry about what people think too much, especially my parents, which I admit I had been growing up but I think I’m much better about it now. It’s just I really like this guy and I want my parents to like him too! And I just don’t think that him not having a job right now (and yes my mom would totally ask him), on top of being white and younger would help. My parents can be very black and white and they would just see him as jobless instead of “inbetween”. They’re getting older too, so I wanna do my best to not upset them or make them worry (especially my mom). My lil sis just graduated med school and is engaged to a guy she met in school who’s also got a shiny asian-proved degree (I forgot what it was, didn’t really bother to remember to make myself feel even worse). Whereas I changed my career to the creative fields in my mid 20s cuz I wanted to pursue my passion, and my parents are still coming around to that. \n\nI just hate that we’ve been arguing over something that’s not even really a legit problem. Cuz he’ll obviously get another job, he’s very smart and hard working. But he thinks it’s about the principle. And I think he’s a white boy warrior who doesn’t understand my cultural background and is trying to save me from being in this mental prison of caring too much. He did say that he’d lie and tell my parents that he has a job, which was nice of him, but I feel like he was just trying to make me feel better cuz we’d been arguing over the past week. I got upset over how this was even a thing we argued about in the first place. Especially when I was gonna introduce him to my parents regardless if he was gonna have a job by next week, and when asked to tell a simple white lie, he could’ve just said, oh yeah I don’t quite get it but I’d tell an innocent white lie for you. Apparently he also thinks that I’m ashamed to bring him around my asian friends, and I told him they’re all in their 30s now, married having kids or about to, we don’t get to hang out as much as you and your early 20s friends. But he didn’t buy that. I mean I do jokingly complain about not being as successful in all the areas in my life as my friends, but I thought he knew that I was mostly joking and being self deprecating! I fell in love with him so quickly in huge part because he got my sense of humor (which can be super crass and something all my exes just tolerated, but this guy loves)! This meeting my parents thing definitely opened up a can of worms which I didn’t even realize existed.\n\nNow I’m super stressed out over my parents’ visit. I don’t wanna upset them or my boyfriend. I know he will lie for me but I’m also gonna feel really bad for him now, because apparently this hurt him quite a bit. And I also wasn’t aware that he’d been feeling like I was ashamed of him for a while now. \n\nTl;dr My white boyfriend thinks I’m ashamed of him for not letting him meet my super traditional Chinese parents till he’s got a job, and he also thinks I’m ashamed to bring him around my asian friends. \n\nNote: I posted this in another sub as well, and people have mentioned that I’m a grown up, I should act like one. But I think part of being a grown up also means you should take in your aging parents feelings into consideration? And me and my boyfriend as younger folks could compromise a bit more? Maybe it’s just my asian upbringing... I guess that part of me hasn’t been very Americanized XD ",

      "description": "So I was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  We had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. I told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. \n\nThe table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each side of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. We sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. \n\nAnyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn’t mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. \n\nAt first I was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say ‘yes’ because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. But my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn’t been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. So I said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. I know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should I bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.\n\nThe waitress looked at me as if I had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: ‘I’m so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. I’m so sorry for the inconvenience’  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). \n\nAfter this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn’t top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).\n\nAfterwards my friend told me that I should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn’t have been so un-accommodating. But the way I see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. If they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned in the first place before we sat down.\n\nAm I the asshole for pushing back on the waitress’ request and refusing to share our table?\n\nTLDR\nWe had reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. Half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. I politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. This was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.",

      "description": "Hi guys, I've been battling some guilt for a while now and I'm mostly looking to know if what I did was wrong. \n\nSo I started working at my current job a couple of years ago, I was with my long term girlfriend at the time. I'd made friends with everyone in the office including one of the girls in the office I'll call her Sarah. We became quite good friends chatting about things, we worked late together a lot of the time and talked life and relationships, she had a boyfriend of 3 years. I'm 26 she's 22, so we'd just swap stories and had fun. She would complain to me about her problems with her boyfriend and I'd give advice on how to handle things. \n\nAbout a year into this job my gf and I split just before Christmas. I was feeling like shit and drinking very heavily showed up to work still plastered and we just talked all day (it was the holidays so we were basically alone in the office). I agreed to go out for a few drinks with her and her friends met her sister and friendship group even got one of her friend's numbers, let's call her Liz. \n\nWe met a few times for drinks just the two of us and I'd tell her stupid stories then we'd meet friends and go out. I met her boyfriend a few times in this period he was alright just a bit of an arse, he'd ignore her when they were out, chat to girls, nothing too bad and not overly flirty but it upset Sarah. \n\nThis is where it goes off the deep end a bit we started texting pretty much every day it was all harmless at first a lot of innocent questions, but eventually led to us talking a lot about sex, what we each liked etc. I felt uncomfortable and tried to guide the conversation towards more innocent topics, but she kept coming back to it, it spilled into work as well a few emails for the sfw stuff. \n\nShe then got a new job and the office all went out for a night out for her leaving do, I was going away the next day, so I agreed to a few drinks and then heading home. We met with Liz and a couple more of Sarah's mates on the night, I'd gone on a date with Liz and it hadn't gone brilliantly but we were still friendly and the spark was building up again, I was thinking of asking her out. Sarah saw this and basically spent the night draped over me, now I'd had a thing for her since I'd started working there and it was only a couple of months on from the break up so I felt really good getting some attention. We started talking and both admitted we had feelings for each other, but also acknowledged because of her bf we would leave it especially as I was going away. \n\nI went away and the texting continued, at which point she said she was going to leave her bf. I was talking to a friend on the second night, and she told me I was an arse for destabilising Sarah's relationship. I'd thought this for a while and sent her a message saying we should stop talking until she's sorted her head out, she said she wanted to carry on talking and so we did. I'm not proud of that. I got back and she came round and told me they broke up after I sent that text. We slept together that night, then on and off for a month after. I went away again and she broke things off and tried to get back with her bf, which didn't work out at all. I found out that she'd actually left him the day before i got back. \n\nI occasionally speak to Sarah now we've met once or twice and made plans to do other stuff, bit we're both quite busy and to be honest the whole thing has kind of knocked my perception of myself, so I don't really fancy speaking to her because it drudges up bad memories. \n\nAITA here?\n\nTldr; broke up a relationship even when I knew the girl had problems with her boyfriend ",

His family are planning on visiting his grandparents afterwards but I don't want to go with them. \n\nI'm travelling home to another country next weekend (about 14 hour return journey altogether). I'm an introvert with social anxiety and I know my limits on social interaction. I've got work, driving lessons and uni work to keep me busy from Monday to Friday. I leave Saturday 6th and will be away for a few days. When I get back it will be straight back to work etc.\n\nApart from feeling like I've a lot on my plate I also just don't want to go. I'm not close with my own family and we spend a lot of time with his although not necessarily his grandparents. I havnt seen them yet but I know his mum will question me and make me feel guilty so I want to know whether its fair if I don't go. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn't seem to plan on going if I don't. Its also his grandmums birthday Tuesday so he said if he doesn't see her Sunday he will have to visit her then and assumed I would go with. They do get me a gift for my birthday but they havnt ever made a point to spend any time with me for it so I don't think I should have to visit as its never just a couple of hours, we have never left before 10pm and it's about an hour and a half drive back.\n\nTLDR; No energy or desire to visit boyfriends grandparents on mothers day.

      "description": "For context let me start from the beginning. In my culture you give either the first born son or daughter to be raised by your parents ( i.e my mom was given).My mom for the first 5 years of life was raised in another country by my great grandmother and aunts. This all changed when my grandmother for some reason wanted my mother back. My mom would tell me stories of her childhood of how she was emotionally and physically abused by both her parents. My grandmother would pull my mother out of bed by her hair for forgetting to wash some trays and make her sit outside at night  to wash them. She would also hit my mother onthe head if my mother did something wrong. When my mom got married to my father they had issues such as my father drinking my mother was also dealing with a difficult pregnancy of my older brother. My mother left my father for a time then got back together. My grandmother berated my mother and took back the gifts she had given them from there wedding. She would also tell my mom she was stupid in taking back my father.\n\nMy grandmother also blatantly has 2 favorite children being my older uncle and younger aunt. My grandmother would give them both thousands of dollars if they asked for it with no promise to pay her back. If my mother asked her for help she would charge my mother double and harass her for every last cent. She also makes it a point to exclude my mom and dad and us me and my 2 brother out of family things. She would also make special visits to see my aunt going out for breakfast and tell my mother she was uninvited to attend. She would also tell my aunt that my mother kids are rude and so disrespectful to her. But when it comes to my cousins there saints in her eyes even though there all rude and stuck up. Its gotten to the point where my father tells my mom that her relationship with my grandmother is unhealthy. I also tell my mom that its a unhealthy relationship cause it causes her to think she a bad mom while in actuality she the best mom. ",

      "description": "Here's some backstory:\n\nMy fiance and I are best friends. I cannot imagine marrying anyone else and feel so excited for our journey together. We're only 3 months away from our wedding and it can't come soon enough.\n\nWe obviously fight, but have been on the same page and good at compromising with each other. This issue has come up recently, though, and we're both very stubborn with how we feel.\n\nSomething I've always dealt with is an awkward last name. It's unusual and hard to spell and that's just something everyone in my family has gotten used to. As a kid, I hated having an unusual last name, but have since come to embrace and really like it. That said, her name happens to start with the same letter as my last name and sounds awkward together. I have no problem that she wants to keep her name because I'd probably do the same in her situation. I also wouldn't name my kid something w/ this same letter because of the same reason so I get that.\n\nMy problem stems from the next step she's taken in saying that she wants her kids to have the same last name as her. She suggests we either hyphenate our names or  add an initial of her last name in front of mine for our kids. These aren't are initials, but for example, if my name was John Smith and her name was Sally Johnson, she'd want our kids names to be either '[First Name] [Middle Name] Johnson-Smith' or '[First Name] [Middle Name] J. Smith'. Admittedly, those options sound better than what our names would actually be.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unfair because I don't want t compromise. She's saying she wants one thing and I want another and she is offering a solution in the middle that should appease both of us. From my perspective, I've grown up knowing (believing I guess) that my kids would have my last name, the same as their grandpa, etc.\n\nNow, I imagine she's coming to this conclusion because we've had a solid history of compromising. In this scenario, however, I've been stubborn because I don't want to compromise at all. If the two options are a) my last name as is, or b) anything else, I'm going to choose a.\n\nI accept I may be the asshole here, but would love to hear the thoughts of the group and the discussion that may follow.\n\n",

      "description": " So, I'll try to be as detailed as possible. About four and a half years ago, I moved in with some friends who had gotten married and had a son. Things started off well, but as time goes on, things progressively become more difficult; financial troubles, stress from raising an infant, etc. There comes an eventual point in time where one of the friends has grown to utterly despise me, but they don't kick me out simply because I'm the only one with a steady job and who has a license. They instead decide to have me handle the majority of chores around the house and always take the opportunity to remind me of how little they think of me. The other friend, while not always agreeing with their SO, isn't in a position to do much else beyond join in and apologize to me later on.\n Eventually, the wife finds a great job and is able to get both her husband and I on board. However, after about two months or so, she has to take a leave from her job, eventually quitting, as she is dealing with the recent passing of her father. Her husband decides to quit with her and pursue his dream of being self employed, leaving me to, once again, be the only one working. \n I deal with instances like these for four years, and finally decide I've had enough; in October of last year, I reach out to my family and decide to leave. I wait until everyone has gone to sleep, quietly pack my things, and drive away in the middle of the night. I've been living with my family since then.\n I had decided to leave without telling anyone because anytime I debated the idea before, knowing how I was viewed in the house, I would always be convinced to stay to ensure the family, and especially their son, would have a roof over their heads. I'm innately inclined to help people I care about, and had grown very attached to the son in the four years I was there, and a part of me always feels as though I've abandoned him.\n\n Am I in the wrong for doing this?",

They’ve been divorced for 3 years. \nNow she got back together with him (through we’re still living apart) and bought a new house for the 4 of us, which is far from my school/job. I really don’t agree with him and the effects he does to my mother and family, the room always dies off and stays silent when he’s around. No one is allowed to talk except him and the people he talks to, he oppressed all of us to our own little world with him only being close to my mom and no one else. \nI’m currently 17 and my sister thought that it would be better that we rent out the current apartment we are in and just live here, near my school and job, and near her work. But I’m scared because my mom always repeated to me ‘I’m her life’ ‘she would kill herself if I wasn’t here’ ‘I’m the most important thing in her life’ ‘I’m doing this for you’. Recently we’ve been drifting apart because I’m trying to cope with the fact that they’re getting back together, I know I don’t like it but I respect that she can live her own life. I just don’t want to be part of this whole problem anymore, it been going on since I was 9, I’m so tired by now. \n\n",

We've been together for two years. He is very sweet and likes to do little gestures for me, like buy chocolate or ice cream and - the culprit in question - flowers.  \n\n\nI love receiving flowers from him. Who doesn't love flowers? However, I've noticed every time he buys me flowers, there's a discount sticker stuck on the plastic, and the flowers are lacking colour and are often droopy and starting to wilt. This bothers me a little because I picture him buying the flowers as an afterthought, or is more concerned with pinching a few pennies then thinking of me first. (For a bit of context, we're not struggling for money) It's possible that maybe he thinks I prefer the discount flowers as I always gush when he gives them to me.   \nI've tried to remedy this by always pointing out my favorite flowers when we're in the shops together. I've done this at least a dozen times and he seems completely oblivious to my hints. I'm afraid of outright telling him I prefer the fresh, pretty flowers because I'm aware of how petty it sounds.   \n\n\nAnyway, I know it's petty, but am I an asshole for wanting nicer flowers?",

      "description": "So around a year ago I started a YouTube and Twitch channel with my friends where we play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  \n\n\nWe started getting lucky and looked into doing some affiliate marketing, the usual \"use a coupon code\" type deal. Each month I got a PDF detailing how much we made. Sort of like an invoice. I'd share with them so they knew as well. For a while there were no issues. We didn't make a lot of money but eventually one day in an email they tell me that they wanted access to the back end. My issue with this is that I had some tax documents as well as my credit card information there. Pretty typical stuff but this is also my information so I'm concerned about people having access to some of my private information.  \n\n\nI explain why I can't just give them access, and I make a suggestion: we change the account and go with a more generic account with none of my private information but one they have access to. This way they can have access, and I don't have to worry about my private information being viewed. They tell me that I'm trying to hide things from them, which I admit that yes, but it's my own information.  \n\n\nBefore we can decide either way they decide to part ways. They started a new channel and address me not being there as being that I was 'witholding financial information'. Now people on social media are painting me as being in the wrong. So now I'm wondering if I could've done anything differently.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Me and my roommate (24 and 25 yrs old) live next to a married couple and their two very young kids (if I had to guess the older one is like 4-5 and the younger one is like 2-3?) and at least one of the kids cries all the fucking time. In the mornings before we go to work, during the day when we're at home, in the evenings when we get back from work. Just this loud ass whiny crying that goes on for like 5-10 minutes at a time. Honestly sounds like just a spoiled, soft kid whining about something rather than a newborn crying because it's hungry or something. Doesn't appear like the parents are trying to stifle it in any way. I'm only home in the mornings and afternoons after work and in those few hours I'm home I hear this kid crying like 3-4 times.\n\nRecently me and my roommate started yelling through the shared wall, just jawing and joking things like \"Hey kid how bout you shut up?\" We're mostly having fun with it and aren't that mad (although some mornings I do genuinely get pissed off when I get woken up at 7AM by a kid crying when I'm trying to get those last minutes of sleep in).\n\nI hardly see the people, like I said we're out of the house a lot. I've lived here for the better part of the year and genuinely only ran into them maybe 3 times. And we're not doing passive aggressive shit like leaving notes (I've seen this happening in other apartments). We'll just be sitting at home chilling and if we hear the crying we'll say shit like \"Come on kid again want me to come over?\" in a mockingly intense tone. Mostly us just having fun with a shitty situation.\n\nAre we assholes?",

      "description": "I went on a date the other day with a guy I met on Tinder. He was really nice and we had been texting each other for a few weeks after matching. We decided to meet up for lunch so we could eat and chat in a public place. I think this is where there started to be a bit of tension now that I think back on it because he wanted to pick me up for the date. That was nice of him but he was still a stranger to me. I had met him online and wasn't comfortable having him know where I live and having to rely on him for a ride. This was just incase the date went bad. Besides, we live an hour away from each other and I figured it would be easier for us to just meet in the middle.\n\nI was feeling a bit fancy so I ordered some shrimp for lunch. That and I love seafood. He had some kind of steak with potatoes. We chatted for a while and things were going pretty well until it was time to pay. He offered to pay the bill, which was a sweet gesture, but I declined. I had gotten the shrimp, which is a decently priced item. I had gone in fully intending to pay for my own food, but I hadn't previously mentioned this to him. We hadn't really discussed it before eating. I just kind of assumed we'd handle ourselves. We're both college kids so sometimes its rough picking up a big bill. I understood this and didn't want to force him to pay more than he had to. I really appreciated his offer and thought it was a kind gesture, but I wasn't comfortable having him pay so much for me. I mean, it was around $20, we didn't go anywhere too fancy, but it seemed like a lot to me anyway. That's $20 he can keep in his pocket.\n\nIt could have just ended there but he kept insisting he pay and it started to get a little awkward. He kept insisting and I kept declining. The waitress was getting a bit uneasy just standing there between us so I finally told her we needed a minute. I stuck by my decision and told him he didn't need to worry about picking up the check. I told him I really appreciated his offer to pay but I didn't want him to pay for my meal. I figured this was a win because he got brownie points for offering but didn't have to pay for me in the end. He conceded but I could tell the situation put a damper on the mood. He seemed genuinely upset and was acting a bit passive aggressive when he paid his bill. I haven't heard from him since the date.\n\nI was for sure that I was in the right at first but it's been bothering me. Should I have just let him pay for me instead of making a bit of a scene like that?",

      "description": "As a preface, my businesses black friday sale (it was on thursday) was a couple days ago, and I'm only here for a short time from a college break.\n\nTHE ISSUE: Yesterday during the post black friday sale me and a associate I know had an argument over work ethics. I was preoccupied with trying to clean up the returned products to make things cleaner for customers to come in and out/trying to assist customers as much as I could. Worker A was chit-chating with the other workers who have a problem with slacking off in the middle of the sale, and in the middle of an isle. Out of rising frustration, I called him out on it saying that they should be focusing on the sale instead of standing around blocking an isle, and to save the long chat for the break room. He snapped back at me claiming that returning the products is not a crucial part of the job, helping the customer is (he had to clarify that point later), he also got on my case that he had helped more people than I did, trying to use my academic leave as leverage, despite the fact that I had worked all summer before going to college.\n\nI took a short break, we apologized, and went on through the sale. Am I the asshole for calling him out on it?",

We’ve kept contact through out and his excuse has always been that he’s low on cash/trying to get a job whatever that’s fine. Now I don’t use any social media but every now and again my friends would show me snap chats that he posted hanging in expensive clubs or drinking. He’s also living with his parents there who are military. \n\nThe other day I’m chilling with my friends and one of them shows me a snap chat of him bragging about being drunk or whatever, so I asked them for their phone and sent him a snap chat asking “ where’s my money dawg” kinda in a joking way but not really. Probably shouldn’t have done that in front of our other friends but I mean cmon. Don’t flaunt how wealthy you are if you cannot pay back a debt. Dick move of me but I could really use that money right now and that was kinda the last straw ",

      "description": "Backstory- We've been buddies since 7th grade. About 9th grade there was a girl  I liked and wanted to ask out. I had a few conversations with her and we (sort of) clicked. At this point I found out that she and my buddy have been close friends for a while and each had a minor crush on the other.\n\nI didn't do anything after that. I thought I would be a gentleman and let him make his move before I did anything. I didn't talk to her much after that.\n\nEnd of 10th grade and he still hadn't made a move. We were set for a movie night three days ago with me, him, her and a few more friends (to celebrate the end of the school year).\n\nAfter the movie me and him went alone to Taco Bell for food (we're both foodies and fans of Taco Bell). As I was shifting schools I figureD that this was the last time I would see him for a while and decided to tell him to make a move.\n\nIt didn't go too well. He started explaining that they were only friends and nothing would happen. I pushed a little further but dropped it after exiting Taco Bell.\n\nIt must have rubbed him on the wrong side because he was in edge for the rest of the night, especially around me and especially especially around her. We didn't talk much for the rest of the night and soon I left for home.\n\nI thought I was doing him a favor but in retrospect I think I fucked up. What do you guys think?\n\nTl;dr- I told my friend to make a move on a longtime crush. Didn't go down too well with him. May have changed the dynamic between him and crush. ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago (way, way back in middle school), but the memory just came to mind. This was situated in the cafeteria lunch tables where classes all ate together. God, this brings back so many memories, but as our group of friends were eating food, one of them looked pissed and asked us if we could stop chewing with our mouths open. We did exactly that, and 10 seconds later, she tells me that it drives her crazy to hear noises from people eating, and that we were still doing it. My initial reaction was to apologize, but no one was chewing with their mouths open. We were just chewing. The sounds came from chewing. Chewing apples. I remember that it ticked me off that all 6 of us needed to watch every bite and concentrate on not making a sound for one person’s sake. I told her that she could eat somewhere else if it bothered her, which most of the people at the table agreed with. I just wonder if I was being an asshole for doing so, because I still agree with that, and I wonder if I should reconsider my actions. ",

      "description": "My fiancé (FH from here on out) and I have been together for nearly 4 years, have a 2yr old together (LO from here on out)and will be eloping on our 4th anniversary coming up in just a few months. \n\nFH was married for roughly 7 years to an awful gold digger of a woman, who has 2 kids from her previous marriage. The step kids have a dysfunctional relationship with their mother &amp; grandparents (who they live with), and a long distance relationship with their father &amp; stepmom who live in a different state. FH loved and helped raise these kids as his own during his marriage, until his ex racked up a huge amount of debt (20k+) and cheated on him with multiple guys. \n\nDespite having no custody agreement or rights, FH wanted to keep a relationship with his former stepkids. The stepkids didn’t seem interested. His ex was all game as she used the kids as leverage to get extra money, school supplies and the like out of him and she got every weekend to herself to party. \n\nAbout a year after the divorce I met and started dating FH. It was clear from the beginning that the kids were using FH. I made it my mission early on to make a good impression, be kind and to be a positive adult presence in their lives. It was painfully clear shortly after we started dating that they absolutely hated me. When we got engaged and found out I was pregnant it only got worse. They would blatantly ignore/insult FH and me, trash our apartment when they came to stay, refuse to eat anything we cooked, you name it really.... and then turn around and try to be nice to get money or gifts. There’s waaaay too much to unpack of their bad behavior over the years I’ve known them, so here’s some fo the greatest hits:\n\n-Lying to FH\n-Lying to me\n-Stealing household items from us\n-Stealing gifts I had given to FH\n-Stealing my belongings\n-Stealing a family heirloom\n-Complaining about the multiple birthday gifts, homemade cake, choice of favorite movie to watch, and favorite foods made for dinner of their birthdays because we “didn’t give them enough”\n-Intentionally damaging the carpeting/furniture in our apartment, costing us a $1,275.00 security deposit and our couch\n-Refusing to acknowledge LO exists immediately after he was born and after not speaking to us for 6 months, then asking us to give them our gaming console (xbox360) and 36in flat screen tv\n-Intentionality tearing up and spreading out shiny pieces of pop tart packaging for LO to find/choke on when LO first started crawling\n-Ignoring/refusing to acknowledge any attempts at contact for a year, and only responding when they want something\n\nthe long and short of it is, they honestly seem to hate LO &amp; I. FH they seem to view as an ATM- ignore it until you want money/stuff. \n\nFH has told me before that he views these kids (currently 18 &amp; 16 yrs old) as “his kids” but understands that he has no right to their lives or a part in it. As their behavior has gotten worse, he has scaled back more and more on contact. As is, they ignore him entirely on all fronts unless they think there is something to gain in it (ie expensive tech,money,etc). I told FH that I understand if he wants to keep contact for sentimentality’s sake, but I do not have any interest in this point in a relationship with them and don’t want them around LO period. I would prefer that FH cuts them off entirely, as every time he reaches out and they snub or use him it hurts him deeply. I hate seeing him crushed like that. However at the same time I feel like keeping an open dialogue at this point, is only leaving them room to hurt FH and by extension our little family. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n",

      "description": "I want to be clear, I've tried to call the police three times. They never come. I've pressed the emergency stop button on the train, the driver hid in his cab and the dude ran away. \n\nI've seen this guy yelling at women, running up at them screaming, trying to scare people, and jerking off in front of young girls. He's always obviously drunk, usually openly drinking a bottle of vodka, and a couple of times he's been spattered in blood.\n\nI'm asking because I know I feel strongly about this being unacceptable, and I'm totally fed up with the lack of police response. Next time I figure I'm just going to knock him around a bit and throw him off the train. Would this make me an asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend she has to get rid of her dog?",
      "description": "Throwaway because I'm just a lurker with no intention of becoming a regular poster; just wanted some third-party opinions on this particular issue. \n\nA little backstory to set context:\n\nAbout two years ago I started dating the woman I'm currently with. After casually dating for a couple months she ended up getting pregnant. We moved in together shortly after to save money in preparation for the baby. I already owned my home so we decided to move her and her dog into my house with my two dogs. \n\nHere's where the problem begins. She is a nurse working the night-shift. She felt guilty about crating her dog at night to train him properly and basically let him use the restroom wherever/whenever he wanted in her apartment. When she moved in I told her that I would be happy to train her dog as I did with my boys but that we had to start immediately as I did not want him ruining the house and I was acutely aware that we would have zero time/energy to devote to dog training once the baby was born. She agreed but immediately undermined any efforts I made to train him - she would let him out of the crate during his crate time, get upset at me for reprimanding him (spray bottle squirt, a stern NO, and/or a light tap on the nose), and eventually told me that she would just take care of training him. \n\nFast forward to present day. Her dog is not trained at all. He growls at me, has bitten me on two occasions, consistently pees/poops under our bed, peed on our son's playpen a month ago and finally tonight shat in his room at the foot of his crib, waking him up and driving me to post this at 2 AM. I am genuinely worried about our son's health and safety at this point. Her dog is only 10 pounds so his bites didn't do much damage to me but he could absolutely hurt a 7 month old child. On top of that, he's peeing/pooping in areas that our son plays and sleeps. \n\nI have told her for the last 6 months or so, on a fairly regular basis, that we need to find a new home for him as I'm now completely unable to train him even if she would let me and I still wanted to - between taking care of the baby, my two dogs, the chaos of her night-shift schedule, and me hunting for a new job/getting my Master's &amp; CPA I literally just don't have the ability to. When he woke the baby up tonight it was my final straw. I texted her that I would be bringing him to a no-kill shelter this weekend as she had not put any effort into finding him a new home on her own. She wrote back a few angry things and has now stopped talking to me. \n\nI absolutely love dogs and animals in general but I'm down to 5 hours of sleep on a good night. I didn't want it to come to this and attempted to get in front of the issue with her by training before the baby came but, as I said, she interceded. At this stage I'm worried that it's driving a wedge between she and I during a time that's already pretty stressful. \n\nAITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I noticed last week when I was staying over that it has large patches of blood stains on them. They were navy blue so it wasn't that obvious. I asked him what those stains were, if he nosebleed at night, he nodded. I didn't take an issue with it.\n\nThis week however, while lying on the bed with the sheets, I made a comment on how he should probably get new sheets because those are really large blood stains (1ft x 1ft). He then told me that it was his ex's period blood. I immediately became super grossed out by it and refused to sleep on another woman's, let alone his ex's, period blood stain.\n\nHe changed the sheets, but wanted to keep the sheets because they're perfectly good sheets but have stains. I demanded him to throw them away. We got into an argument. He says ITA because I didn't take an issue with the sheets when he said it was his blood. He's also saying I'm jealous of his ex and is making this all about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Girlfriend and I have been together for a few years. We used to live 5 hours apart and now we 2 (soon to be 5 minutes).\n\nI’m terrible with time management and I’ve been late to see her many times in the past. This usually ends in her being very upset with me.\n\nToday, she was driving to me (which doesn’t occur often) but I told her in advance that I had to give a buddy a ride out of town and wouldn’t be back until 230. The night before, she planned to be here at 3 to give me some leeway. She called me in the morning to tell me that she would be here at 330 because she was going to go to a kombucha bar with a male coworker. \n\nI told her not to worry about the time. I did however voice how it hurt that she was going to hang with another guy. I made sure to acknowledge that those feelings are mine to bear and that she has every right to have whoever she wants as a friend and it’s my job to trust and respect her.\n\nFast forward to me arriving home roughly 245. I called her and she missed the call, calling me back a couple minutes later. She told me she was going to be a significant amount later than normal and that the kombucha bar ending up turning into a longer event.\n\nNow, I wouldn’t be mad if she was running late. And I didn’t like that she was with another guy but I know that it’s unfair of me to let that feeing affect the relationship. BUT, I’m really really irritated that she was late *because* of this guy. She said she had to stay with him because he ordered so much kombucha and she couldn’t leave him alone. She felt stuck.\n\nBut I feel like she had to make a decision between leaving him alone or making me wait. She chose to stay with him. I feel like she prioritized him over me.\n\nWhat hurts the most though is the double standard. She’s been very upset with me for being late. She also would be furious if I hung out another girl. She acknowledges that she would be furious and understands it’s unfair?\n\nSo AITA for being so upset? ",

Part of that reasoning is that I knew she doesn't approve of guns, so it's not like I assumed she would be chill with it. However, I also figured that what I do is my own business, and if I always keep it locked up when it's at home (I do), and neither of us has children over ever, it would never affect her in any way. \n\nHowever, a mutual friend brought it up in casual conversation, and my roommate completely flipped out when she found out. She's told our friends that I am a gun nut and a psycho, and she's demanded either I get rid of the gun or I move out.  I think it's an overreaction, and now we aren't on speaking terms. Is this a line you should never cross without someone's consent, or is it an issue that's no one else's business?

She’s been told that she will not be able to have kids and not being able to have ivf etc. bc there would be nowhere on her uterus lining to place the egg. She’s obviously devastated and has told me before that surrogacy is her last chance and I’d be the only person she would ask. So she asked me to be a surrogate and so we went to a doctors appointment just to see if I qualify and see what the procedure would be like. The doctor told me that since I have the same condition, but less scarring being a surrogate would lessen MY chances of being able to fall pregnant or have ivf etc. I’m not ready to have kids yet but I know I want kids and am not really willing to lower my chances of being able to fall pregnant when ive already seen the struggle my sister has been through. The doctor said if I do go through with it then they will obviously place the egg on the best place in my uterus. This may sound extremely selfish but I want that ‘best spot’ for me and my future husbands child and am not quite ready to give it up yet. If I was done having children or knew I never wanted children it would be a completely different story I would say yes. But I’m choosing to be selfish and keep my chances of falling pregnant without risking it and my sister is calling me an asshole for this reason. So AITA ?",

      "description": "A coworker of mine fell last week while walking on the icy sidewalk and broke her elbow. Let's call her Sheila. Sheila had surgery on said elbow and was out for a few days. On the day she returned, I had flowers delivered for her, but sent to my office. This particular flower shop won't leave the flowers if the person is not there to accept them, and I was not 100% Sheila would be in her office at the time of delivery. Sheila comes to my office every day to visit so I knew she would see the flowers. When Sheila came to my office, I told her the flowers were for her. They are a smaller bouquet that is arranged in a coffee mug that she can use, as she loves coffee. Sheila looked at them sort of uninterested and says thank you, but she can't lift anything with her arm. Mind you, she has another working arm in which she can carry the flowers. She said \"I will just keep them here in your office for now\". Well...it has been over a week now, and they are still in my office. Aside from offering to carry them back to her office, which was waved off, we do not mention them when she comes to visit. I love flowers, and let's be honest, I am a little hurt. I get that not everyone loves flowers, but I can't help feeling bitter about the whole situation. I am tempted to be petty and bring them home with me since she does not seem interested. Would that be an asshole move?",

      "description": "So recently I(21) was on a class trip with my classmates(20-25) and a small group of us was sitting and chatting after dinner. The conversation started leading towards a classmate that was not present at the time. \n\nThis classmate is a bit... strange. I suspect he might be on the spectrum. He is not very good socially and has a very stiff and simple way of holding conversations. He also sometimes come off as rude. let’s call him Adam.\n\nHe is also very easy to manipulate. An example here is that another guy in our class showed him a picture of two turtles mating and told Adam that this was cool and funny. Adam then believed this to be true and changed his Facebook header and profile picture to turtles having sex. This guy kept edging him on making him go even further and he would start just showing random people these images. \n\nAnyway we were sitting on this table and the conversation shifted to him. Earlier in the day we had gone through a market and I had asked him to join us. I thought the trip was fine and nothing really strange happened. \nHowever when we were sitting at this table afterwards they got kind of annoyed with me and asked me why I did that when I knew they thought he was weird. I just kind of brushed it off but then they just started talking among themselves about how annoying Adam is and ways to avoid him on other upcoming events the class would partake in. Including like running away when he wasn’t looking. \n\nI thought that the conversation was childish and cruel so I kind of snapped at them to stop saying stuff like that. I said it was a class trip and not a holiday. I admit I might have come across as angry and loud. \n\nThey said that they only needed to vent a little bit because they were stressed about him and didn’t know how to interact with Adam. Also they said I should just leave if I don’t like it. So I ended up leaving. It’s been kind of tense between us after that.\n\nI understand the need to vent sometimes, but I thought what they said was unnecessary and just bullying. They disagree and told me I’m too sensitive.\nI kind of regret doing that now cause maybe they’re right. Maybe I’m just uptight. They have been excluding me as well for the past few days and I just kind of feel really bad about getting angry at them. AITA? \n",

      "description": "It’s Christmas night. A while back I gave my quadplex apartment neighbor’s brother, who was living with him at the time, my wifi password. They all moved out like two months ago but the guy still loafs around the neighborhood on his pedal bike driving around between his baby mama’s and brother’s new place - still in the same neighborhood.\n\nWell the guy periodically stops by my place asking to bum cigarettes or whatever (usually after 8 or 9PM). I started refusing him after the first time but he still keeps coming by. \n\nWell today, he knocks on my door begging, I refuse him (even though I know it’s Christmas) but I lend him my bike pump since he has a flat. Then he asks me to use my computer to fill out his unemployment and again I have to refuse him, but he says thanks and goes on his merry way.\n\nBut then an hour later my dogs start barking and I look outside and he’s just sitting on my steps on his phone. So ofc I go out there and I’m like what are you doing. And he’s just like, “Oh I’m just using your wifi dawg trying to get this unemployment out.” \n\nAt that point I’m pretty bugged and tell him he can’t hang out here like that and he’s just all “Sorry, I didn’t know I was bugging and walks off all sad.”\n\nSo I thought to come over here and ask you all if I was being an asshole and should beat myself up for turning out a former neighbor on Christmas.

      "description": "Hey guys! Occasional lurker, first time poster. Throwaway just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one bad habit my brother has always had is he tends to end up befriending girls that take advantage of his kindness. As an example: A few years ago he had it bad for a girl who stopped giving him the time of day as soon as he lost his job and couldn't buy her lunch or get her nails done anymore. Once he found another one she was showing up again, expecting to basically be taken on dates that weren't dates. It took her claiming he was harassing her to the boyfriend she was purposely hiding from him when he tried to get money she owed him back for him to realize what was going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I get protective when it comes to him sometimes. He doesn't know how to say no. It's definitely a problem for the men in my family in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, I was informed by his roommate that this seems to be starting again with a woman he used to worked with. He's known this woman (30ish F) for about two years. At one point, she was his manager at work, though he knew her before this and she helped him get the job. During this time, she started borrowing money from him for things like bills. She'd pay him back, but it would always take a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA preface on this woman's situation: She is currently married, but her husband's family doesn't like her, and he's in another state in his final semester of college. His mom has threatened to stop funding his college if he moves down to Florida to live with her, so he stays up there. So right now, she's raising 3 (3M, 8M, 9F) children on her own on one income. Two are from another relationship, one they have together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two weeks ago we were going to go out for lunch and spend the day together, and it had been a while since we saw each other. He informed me that he had an errand to run for her while we were out. She needed him to go to one court house an hour away and get her marriage certificate signed because someone had failed to do so and then take it to another courthouse an hour away from there. We ended up not being able to get lunch and spent the entire time together driving to run this errand. All total it took around 4 hours, so long that we immediately had to drop him off to babysit her children until she got home from work. It was here his roommate (his ex, who he makes awesome friends and roommates with apparently, and who I'm friends with) who was joining us informed me while he was in the courthouse that he's doing this \\*all the time\\*. He basically acts like her stand-in husband. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until yesterday, however, I realized how many 'favors' he seems to be doing. He watches her kids every time he has a day off, completely for free. He said this is because her babysitter quit and he insists that she's genuinely looking for someone and he's seen her doing so, but that she doesn't make much and so she can't afford most people's asking price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost recently he lent her $1000 from his tax return to pay her rent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother and I were both abused by our mother and developed a bit of a codependent relationship as a result. In the last few years, we've worked a lot on keeping out of each other's problems and it's improved our relationship a lot. When I tried to discuss this with him, he gets kind of stand-offish and I'm getting some vibes that he thinks I'm inserting myself into his business again. When his roommate tried to talk to him about it, he got angry and they fought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing that finally made me want to ask is that I've been roped into it now too-- I'm currently watching her 3 kids for 8 hours today, on my day off after working until midnight, completely for free as a favor to my brother. He's showing up right after I'm done to watch her youngest so she can take the other two to the movies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I right in feeling like my brother is being taken advantage of? Or am I the asshole and need to back off and let him help a friend out? It's not that I don't like this woman-- she's very nice! But I feel like my brother is being turned into a stand-in husband and a free babysitter. This has been going on for weeks. He hasn't had an actual day off in so long he couldn't tell me when the last time was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Before anyone suggests it, I'm 90% sure he's not sleeping with her. My brother has very strong morals in regards to sleeping with a married woman. Her husband knows what's going on.)",

      "description": "Somewhat long story here. \nIn August I moved into a new house and meet my neighbor, a girl who I will hit it off with. We hung out often and regularly, got drinks, took our dogs out together, went to shows etc. She actually made the first move, one when we were waiting TV together I put my arm around her, then she went upstairs and when she came back down, sat in my lap and kissed me, then looked at me and said \"what took you so long?\"\n\nAfter that we hung out a good bit, obviously. It's really hard for me to fall in love and with her it took me no time at all. I told her I wanted to be with her and she reminded that she had just gotten out of a long term relationship and hadn't been single in years and wanted to take some time before she committed to anyone, but she still wanted to see me and cared for me. I told her I was willing to wait for her if I got to be around her and she said she wanted exactly the same thing. \n\nA few weeks later she told me she had to move out of her place, she was on a probationary 3 month lease and the guy who opened the house decided he didn't want another roommateAnd kicked her out. So she started looking for other places, thinking about moving out of state. I never said it to her but I would've gone with her on a heartbeat. Then she found two potential living situations in town. We looked at one together and she seemed really confident about it but wanted to look at the other one. We were supposed to go together but I had to work unexpectedly and she ended up going alone. When she came home that night she told me what she had decided on the first place but she really wanted to be friends with the guy from the second cause he was cool and they got along, gave me a big kiss, they went to hang out with him and her roommate. \n\nThen I didn't hear from her for about a week. We were supposed to go on our first real date the following weekend but the entire week I barely got a text message and didn't see her at her house. On Sunday, I texted her to see if she still wanted to go out and got no response. Then I was in my back yard with my dog and saw her leave the house with this new guy. The following day, after I got home from work I got a text saying that she \"couldn't continue the romantic part of our relationship\" but that I'm \"one of her favorite people\" and she still wanted to hang out with me. She insisted she didn't stand me up for another guy even though I saw her leave with him and told her so. \n\nI was so stunned and already really drunk that, admittedly, I immediately reacted pretty emotionally. I told her it was unfair and that I wanted only her. I asked her what changed that made him worth her breaking her promise to herself but not me. She asked me to stop texting her for the day, until I had calmed down and I said okay and did. I didn't attempt to talk to her for five days to make sure I was calm as I could be, I know I have a habit of blowing up. \n\nSo I saw her in her back yard and I went outside. She said hey and I waited and played with her dog through the fence a minute before attempting to say anything to her. When I finally gathered myself up, I tried to say, \"you know this wouldn't have been such a big deal if you had just talked to me\" but she cut me off and said \"it wasn't a big deal deal.\" I responded \"maybe it wasn't too you but it obviously was to me.\" Mid sentence she grabbed all her stuff and went inside. When I went back into my house I got a text that said \"I'm sorry for any pain I caused u. I am going to leave it at that. Take care of yourself dude. I wish u the best.\" And then f she blocked me on Facebook, Instagram, blocked my phone, etc. \n\nObviously we haven't talked since then. I tried reaching out a few times knowing it wouldn't work. At some point I got into my old Instagram account and send her a message saying how much I missed her, that I genuinely love her and I hope at some point she decides to call me, but for my own sanity I had to close all kinds of conversation. Then I finished the deed and blocked the last lines of communication that had and deleted her number. \n\nAITA? What did I do wrong?",

      "description": "I was ordering him Christmas gifts and he brought up the christmas party at work last year and he mentioned a girl that I knew he liked and I saw her and she was pretty flirty with him and treated me like I was invisible. So I don’t really like this girl. My mind wandered to when he told me he used to picture having sex with every woman he encountered (yeah literally every woman) for some reason and it made me a bit gloomy as I connected the two. I went quiet but tried to brush it off and he pushed and pushed and pushed until I told him why I was upset even though I didn’t feel the need to bring it up. so he said “well yeah babe, when you have crushes that’s how you relieve yourself” so I kinda just pushed him off me and yelled “EW! GET OFF ME!” I really don’t normally react like this but that just made my blood boil. I think I might’ve overreacted but I don’t think he should’ve said that... I dunno. ",

      "description": "Starting with some context: my wife and I have been together for 11 years, married for 7. We love each other, and do everything together. We're very happy in all other aspects.\n\nThe area of trouble comes from family events (primarily mine, as she makes sure we're always on time for her family). No matter what I do, we're always 1 - 1 1/2 hours late for my family events. There are always numerous excuses, of which I'm understanding. But us being late has become a trope for us within my family.\n\nMy grandparents had their golden anniversary. We were almost 2 hours late, and arrived when they started serving dessert. Sadly, everybody figured it was typical. When it comes to my family, my wife always thinks we have way more time to spare than we do. For the latest incident, we wanted to work out together before going for supper at my parents. We're supposed to show up at 5. I told her \"Hey it's 2pm. We should work out now so we have time to get ready and get there at 5.\" She kept saying I was a hardass and we didn't have to get going until 3 (1hr to work out 1hr to get ready. Never mind the time in between.) Once again we're late.\n\nI've brought it up. I've argued about it. I've tried to fix it. So I don't know what to do with advice that says \"just bring it up and talk.\" \n\nSo, my Bedstemor passed away. Family mourning starts at 5. It was my final straw, and I told my wife it started at 4. The usual routine happened, and we showed up at 5. She was genuinely confused that nobody was calling us out. When we left, I told her what I did. She's been arguing with me for the past few days saying I'm the most distrustful asshole ever. But I know we would have showed up after the ceremony if I didn't do that.\n\nAITA? What should I do?",

My mum has moved out and my dad is away for work right now (home at weekends) so it's just my little sister and I at home right now. We've been trying to get back to normal now and have been speaking to my mum semi-regularly but she has been talking to my sister and I with a horrible attitude and saying nasty hypocritical things about my dad's side of the family (who haven't even done anything wrong). I've already brought this up to her but she continued doing it so a couple nights ago I texted her saying that, as for right now, I don't want to see her or talk to her. She has told my sister that I'm in the wrong about this and that she expects us to support her and be on her side. It just seems that my mum has some sort of god complex and does not accept or acknowledge that she may be in the wrong or that it's her own fault I don't want to to talk to her. So AITA for making this decision? I don't want it to be long term but I don't really know what to do now as she probably will not try to contact me as she's extremely petty, so any advice would be appreciated, thank you!",

      "title": "AITA For ignoring an email from an ex who is now dying of a disease that may have caused our issues?",
      "description": "3 years ago, I broke up with a girl I had been dating for 8 years. She became extremely controlling and would steal my mail and cancel cabs so I would never leave the house. If I DID make it out, something would always come up like a midnight emergency vet visit that would end up being nothing and costing me hundreds of dollars. She also conspired with our landlord against me and managed to take all of my savings and forced me to leave an amazing job so I could move back in with my mother.  \n\n\nI've now been with a new girl for 2 years who I love very much and had been nothing but supportive as I got back on my feet and we've now lived together for a year. Life hasn't been kind recently, however, and we have both recently experienced injuries, financial struggles, deaths and a very messy parental divorce.  \n\n\nThese events led up to a suicide attempt by my gf a few months ago and my own suicidal thoughts over the last few months, which we are both getting help for. As I was leaving the doctor's office after being told I'm not fit to work for 8 weeks until my own treatment has a chance to affect me, I checked my email and saw one from my ex since she's been blocked for some time.  \n\n\nShe's been diagnosed with MS and there's a critical lesion right at the base of her brain stem that may have been there for up to 10 years. She's also apologizing for being the way she was while we were together. I don't know much about MS, but I know mood changes and cognitive impairment are symptoms.  \n\n\nRegardless of whether or not her actions were directly caused by it or not, I feel like there's something I should do. At the same time, I'm really not in a healthy mind space and adding this situation could only possibly make things worse. Best case scenario, we make amends and I watch someone I cared for and loved for a long time slowly die. worst case, it's another one of her insanely manipulative tricks and I'd just be inviting more bullshit into my life. Despite that, ignoring such an extreme cry for help is very much not the kind of person I am and ignoring her REALLY makes me feel like an asshole",

It was not reported because she is best friends with T, and T did not want to get G in trouble.

I just find it frustrating when you do the right thing (wait in a line of traffic) and some d*ckhead cuts in line by zooming up a lane (they know won't take them where they need to be) just to stop before an intersection to merge at the front of the que (essentially buggering up two lanes of traffic).\n\nI will admit, part of it is me being territorial - why should someone who's spent less time on a road than me be entitled to merge in front of me? Clearly they're TA in this situation... right?",

Lets just say she’s not a really good person. Ever since then he’s been like a different person. They got married, had a kid, and now are having another one. I don’t talk to any of them at all, though they do try to talk to me occasionally. I just feel bad for never interacting with them especially on Christmas. He is a completely different person than the one I used to look up to, and I know it’s because of his wife because he’s basically her bitch. He does everything she says no matter what, doesn’t listen to reason, and whatever she says goes no matter how stupid it is. I have a deep hatred for her and I know i shouldn’t let it affect my relationship with my dad but she’s always around him.

      "description": "I’m a 26F and he’s a 28M and I’m 13 weeks pregnant. A bit of back story is I’m currently out of work on disability due to issues with pregnancy. I have Hyperemesis Gravidarum which is basically morning sickness to an extreme. I lost 7-10lbs my second trimester am on IV zofran and oral phenergan, I have midline IV inserted in my upper arm. I spend so much of time nauseous and dizzy it’s ridiculous. I am running myself ragged to weekly drs appts. I’m so tired. \n\nNow my bf likes to have sex a lot and this has become an issue since we literally have went from sex on a daily basis to every 2-3 days. Today has been 5 days and he asked me can we have sex if I was feeling up to it and I said maybe. I told him essentially I don’t feel like I’m having a bad or good day today and that I would be down to at least cuddle and watch tv at the least. I had already explained that I was tired and had gotten minimal sleep last night. I have my son every other week and I had him all day by myself today which is in and of itself exhausting because he’s 2 and busy af. \n\nMy bf has taken on a lot with the household and with helping take care of my son. He basically takes care of me and my kid right now but he even helps me shower because it’s hard for me to do on my own with the midline in. He works for the DOD and he’s 2 weeks away from being affected by this government shut down. I understand his frustrations and am always an ear to talk to plus this affects our household. He complains about needing to relax and how sex helps him with that. I tell him to go to the gym or get a hobby. \n\nBasically the things that he did and pissed me off was I had told him to ask me to have sex once and let it be that. He had a habit of asking several times or asking me how I felt with the sole intention of getting laid. Which he knows he’s an asshole for. Today he asked me if I was feeling up to it and I said not really. He then later on the evening while we were the kitchen came behind me and tried to pull my pants down. I slapped his hands off of me (not hard) and called him a dick. I’m literally fuming &amp; I just don’t understand what he doesn’t get. It seems so selfish to me to look at your very sick and pregnant gf and constantly try to have sex with them even when they’ve explicitly told you no. \n\nTLDR; Basically I’m wondering am I the asshole for not wanting to have sex with my bf even though he’s stressed or should I just bite the bullet and take one for the team even though I’m literally the furthest thing from horny.

      "description": "Mobile so sorry for the formatting. I’ll try make this as clear as possible but a lot happened. This takes place over maybe a year and a half.\n\nI (25F) met D(26F) off tinder. We chatted for awhile and after roughly 2 months she came over real late one night. Didn’t hook up but kept hanging out and slowly started hooking up and seeing each other. I had come out of a fairly serious relationship so we both agreed to take things slow. D would make a lot of jokes about me never being ready to be in a relationship because I was pretty brutally cheated on. At the time it seemed like she was feeling out the potential of eventually getting serious.\n\n6 months later, I do a cute present and ask her out and she says she’s not sure she ever wants to be in a relationship. We continue to see each other casually but things have changed and there’s ‘tension’ Another 3 months pass and she wants to just be friends 3 days after her birthday. I’m hurt and ask for space. Couple of weeks later we have tickets to a gig and we decided to go together as friends. D finds out I’ve been on a date and sends a bunch of love hearts to this new girl and that girl never speaks to me again. That night we also end up hooking up again.\n\n2 months later she isn’t sure she wants to keep seeing me and again I get over it and start seeing someone else eventually. She calls me late one night and wants to start seeing me again. Can you see the pattern yet? I’m an idiot and chose her. \n\nAt this point, maybe a month or two later, she makes it very clear we can both see other people casually. I meet T(27F). T is kind, loving and so fucking stunning. We have an instant attraction and so much chemistry for two people who couldn’t be more different. We kiss but because of D I’m not sure I want to pursue it.\n\nD decides she wants to just be friends, for real this time. I begin seeing T and happy. D and I are fighting so I kind of just get to the point where it isn’t fun anymore. We can’t hang out because D’s new girlfriend doesn’t trust her around me (so much for not wanting a girlfriend, they had been in contact the entire time D and I were seeing each other)\n\nI tell D it’s time to call it a day and I want to be no contact. Bail out and delete all her social media and all of her friends. I put all mine on private and happily date T. \n\nI know I probably got back into the dating pool too soon every time but we were never in a relationship and she cut things off every time.\nD has some mental health issues and I was always understanding or at least trying my best to accommodate whatever she needed.\n\nAm I the asshole for bailing out on this attempted friendship?",

      "description": "Little bit of backstory: I have major exams coming up known as the GCSEs. I have 8 weeks until my first exam and whilst I try hard in (most) of my classes I haven't been revising as much as I should have been and so for the past 2 weeks I've been roughly doing 80 hours a week of revision. It's a lot but I honestly don't mind so long as I'm left to do my thing.\n\n\nSo it starts with me just doing some physics, there's quite a lot to do so I probably sat there doing it for 3 or so hours, with a little bit of YouTube inbetween. I have a dog who obviously needs walking, and instead of asking one of my 3 sisters, one of which has the same exams as me and was sat around doing fuck all, I was asked. And this is a regular occurrence because my sister's \"cant\" for some reason. I'm annoyed but I agreed to do it once I've finished my work. I was asked at 2 and had finished at 6 so started getting ready to walk him.\n\n\nThis is where my mum goes on a rant about how \"it's too late now\" (barely started going dark) and that \"I always pretend my work is more important than everyone elses\". Bearing in mind that work was a Netflix marathon for one sister, less than an hour of homework for the other and 10 mins of carrying shopping in for the other. Im honestly just stressed about exams and am trying to get enough prep in yet it's hard when I'm being berated for doing things on my own timeframe.\n\nI guess my question is am I being the asshole over these expectations or am I reasonable to keep doing what I am doing?",

      "description": "So, my Grandmother's brother (so Grand-Uncle?) died in his 80's yesterday, and while I think it's sad that that happened, I very pressured to go to his funeral on Sunday and it's making me feel like a huge Asshole for not wanting to go.\n\nSo, for context, I've maybe seen this guy and his family a few times throughout my entire life (I am only 20), and it's not like they lived that far away from the rest of the family. They never went to any of my birthdays, or any of the family dinners during holidays (except for the occasional one or two at some nice restaurants)\n\nThey're very rich, and pretty much isolated themselves from most of the other family, however when he went to the hospital, everyone started acting like he was the crown fucking jewel of the family. My mother drove like an hour there and an hour back out of her way to the hospital like 3 or 4 consecutive days in a row, shipping relatives back and forth out of the goodness of her heart. Even though she never had that close relationship to them, she still did all of that because she felt she had too.\n\nI tried to explain to her that what she did was more than any person in her position should be expected to do, but she thinks that being \"in a family\" is one of the most important things. \n\nI just feel like funerals are meant for direct relatives (people who I actually know in life not \"technically\" direct relatives), people who I was close to, or people that are at the funeral to support them, and none of that applies to me imo\n\nAll I've ever known about him and his family is that they seclude themselves, are rich, and that they never really did much family stuff. The only reason I even consider going is because apparently the rest \"of the family\"(what are we the mob?) will be there and I should show my support for *them*\n\nAlso, for some further context, I'm trans, in the closet still, and super paranoid about going anywhere/doing a anything with people that knew me. Funerals are pretty much the worst thing for me to go to mentally.\n\nIt feels horrible trying to tell my mom how I feel and explaining to her why I don't want to go, but now I think she thinks I'm some kind of monster for not wanting to go. If this was something that took like 30 minutes, just in and out, I would probably do that, but I think everyone is expecting me to go and it's tearing me apart mentally.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go? \n\nPlease please ask any further questions if it will help, I'm just kind of word spewing on my phone right now so I'm not sure how clear I'm coming across.

I kind of feel bad because my friends thought I would go but I didn’t show up, but I enjoyed the walk better than trick or treating. So yeah, with all that said, AITA?",

      "description": "So, basically, there's been a lot of fake stuff flooding r/entitledparents lately. That's really the only background anyone needs to know.  \n\n\nSo, I go onto r/entitledparents, and there's a lot of good stuff as usual. However, I come across one, in particular, that mentions a police officer supporting the OC in the decision to send the EP to jail. I liked this story and supported their decision, however, because a police officer stated in a somewhat happy tone that it was the right decision to do so, I didn't fully believe it.  \n\n\nSo, maybe I shouldn't have, but I comment that although I enjoyed the story (which I genuinely did), I couldn't fully believe a supposedly responsible official like a cop would say something like that with friendly enthusiasm. Oh boy, did people get to it quickly. They commented that \"Police officers have feelings\" and that \"The Reddit detectives were here\". I'm paraphrasing this stuff, by the way. Now, I completely agreed with these things and made the point that it WAS completely plausible for the officer to say that, but that I just found it hard to believe. I said that, if I was in the wrong, the OC would know so, and that in that case, I give my sincerest apologies. People continued to reply and post more messages about how I wasn't aware that officers are people. So, to avoid any more conflict (and getting upset enough to reply that I was just stating an opinion and made it clear that although I had doubts the story wasn't true, I still believed that it was plausible) I deleted my reply to the post.  \n\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have posted my opinion in the first place and it could've come out as too forward and rude (I didn't intend it that way). I acknowledge that was on me, and I just didn't realize something so little could make people so upset. However, I don't think it required a negative response to something that I meant to be polite, at least after clarifying once seeing their responses.   \n\n\nSo, you guys out there, you've never disappointed me. AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend of around one year has been growing out his hair the entire time we’ve been together and I love his hair so much. He has long dark brown ringlets that frame his face beautifully and he’s been working for a long time to get them to the right length and basically in summary he’s just always cared a ton about his hair. Now out of the blue he’s decided he wants to shave it all off and won’t even compromise for a cut. I’m more worried about him than I am upset about it because hair grows back and that’s not a huge deal however the fact that he’s always cared so much about his hair and now he just wants to shave it all off without even considering just shortening it has made me worried it’s a little deeper than that. I’ve been trying to hold him off and compromising but I think I may have accidentally made him think that I won’t find him attractive anymore if he doesn’t have his hair (which isn’t true, but I understand how he may have gotten the idea because of how I’ve been trying to stop him from doing it). \n\nAITA for trying to hold him off just a little so he can think about it? Should I just let it go and let him do as he pleases or am I right to want him to think about it a little more?",

      "description": "TLDR 11 year old cousin comes down all the time even though not welcome. Family don't want to say anything for fear of causing arguments and rocking the boat. It's annoying me so much. \n\nAll our family live close and are close relationship wise to each other. \n\nMy daughter is 18 months. My partner works shifts so most evenings I spend at my parents house (my nan and 4 younger brothers also live there) so I'm not home alone. I bath and get my daughter ready for bed there and I take her straight to bed when we get home. I get on really well with them all and my mum tells me how much she loves having us both down.\n\nHere lies the problem, my second cousin who's only 10/11, let's call her A.  She's obsessed with my daughter and comes down ALL the time when I'm there. If her mum (my cousin, I'll call her B) drives past and sees my car she's straight in. The problem is she takes over with my daughter, disregards what I tell her and races to do things before I can. Nothing serious but it annoys me so much. Like changing her she'll 'help' out and I can't even look after my own daughter, or answering the phone, or helping herself to food. We went out to a restaurant today and I said don't take her out of the high chair as I knew she'd paddy and run wild and said as a compromise you can hold her five mins before we go. She didn't listen (with approval for her own mother, B) and so my daughter plays up, she gets bored of her and I'm the one dealing with a tantrum that could have been avoided.  I feel like a shitty person as she obviously loves her and loves playing with her so much but she just really irritates me. \n\nA's own mums allows this. Today again for example B dropped my mum back off at the house. A saw my car was already there. My mum said not tonight A. A said is that cause you've got lots to do? My mum replied yes I have. Then A said to B, oh I'm going see you later.  When my mum expressively said no.\n\nOver Christmas I've hosted my family at my house. B dropped A off soon as she realised they were at mines. She spent all day Christmas day (I didn't even get to escape at Christmas!!).\n\nTo top things off she's always evasdropping on conversations and reporting back to B.\n\nMy mum is too scared to say we don't want Bs kid as it'll cause arguments so she just accepts it. None of my brother's want A down all the time either. \n\nI'm so close to snapping but then I remember she's just a kid. But feel like her mum, B,  should say no to her and not send her down all the time.\n\nIATA for finding a ten year old stupidly annoying and wanting to say something but risk a family feud?!\n",

      "description": "AITA? \n\nJust over two weeks ago, I moved in with a friend (Barb) because I needed a place to crash for about a month. I've known Barb for about 8 months, and she offered me a place to stay with no hesitation. She's been a pretty good friend to me, but like the rest of us isn't without her faults - she's got a history of some very creative lies about situations that (in my opinion) are very obviously lies and don't even need to be made up. \n\nA few days ago, I was checking my bank accounts online and noticed a transaction ~$380 from an airline. I originally thought nothing of it, but began to have suspicions the more I thought of it - Barb has previously mentioned that this is her favorite airline and she only flies with them.\n\nThe same day, I left for work and noticed another large transaction ~$550 on my account from a fruit-based technology company. I don't have any products from this company, but Barb owns several. Throughout the day, I continue to monitor my account. Another transaction of ~$160 comes through, this time from \"PayPal [Barb's first name_last name]\". \n\nI immediately called my bank to report the transactions as fraudulent, and they also reported a ~$100 transaction to Sprint wireless (which is Barb's carrier; I have another mobile carrier). The agent on the line told me that all of the transactions were done online, between the previous night and that morning. \n\nFast-forward to today and I have been keeping silent while securing housing elsewhere, not sure if I should file a police report and risk retaliation or settle for having the bank return my funds, move out, and cut ties with Barb. She left town for the holidays this morning; and texted me asking if something was wrong because I've been acting distant the past few days.\n\nI responded that I knew she had taken my credit card (I naively leave my wallet on the kitchen table while sleeping) and made many transactions on it, that I was angry and feel betrayed, and that I will be moving out by the end of the week.\n\nHer many responses include that she's offended I would accuse her of stealing from me, that she never borrows money from anyone, has been independent for many years, etc. She's even offered to repay \"however much I think she stole from me.\" However, because of the circumstances and her history of not being truthful, I find it hard to believe her (although if I'm completely honest, I'd like this situation to have another explanation).\n\nSo - am I the asshole?",

I'm fairly modest, so I was embarrassed. She thought it was hilarious and didn't know why I was upset. \n\nI could try to make sure I'm not flashing when I'm in my room, but there aren't typically young people in my household, so I'm just not used to a bunch of gremlins romping around the house willynilly.

I could tell when we first met at a party that she wanted to hook up with me, unfortunately I didn't hook up with her then due to other things that happened that night (got beaten up) and since then I've been hella busy, but I have been texting her back and fourth and I know she's down to fuck. \n\nIf anything the waiting made her MORE desperate to get it done and dusted.\n\nSo I went out the other day on a night out and I know she was also going out to thar same club. **Important info - I took alcohol AND also drugs. Smoked a weird strand of weed.**\n\nSo I feel really weirdly buzzed and go out. I see her at the club and we start dancing, then making out. So I suggest going back to hers and she agrees. From this point on, I lost my memory. Maybe I was spiked again? (was picking up random drinks in the club).\n\nSo I wake up with no memory of what happened. I check my phone and see texts from her calling me \"Fucking asshole.\"\n\nShit. I get intense anxiety after that. So I wait a few hours to calm down and call her and ask what I did. She said \"You don't remember?\" and I say no. \n\nShe explains that once we got back to hers, we get naked and make out. As I reach for my condom, I throw it on the floor, get up and start dancing naked. Then I start spinning around and singing \"Pump Up the Jam\". She then promptly tells me to get the fuck out and I leave.\n\nI'm absolutely hysterical but also gobsmacked. How is this possible? What drugs did I take? It was just weed mixed with alcohol....unless it was laced weed or something.....AITA?",

Which, logically, requires the card to be used to redeem said coupon.\n\nSo, I ask her for her rewards card, and she says she doesn't have it. I say, \"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need your rewards card to use the coupon, that way if you dropped it in the parking lot, someone else can't use your coupon. She looks at me as if I'm the devil, and says, \"Really? For a donut? You're going to make me go home and get my card for a donut?\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, you could always pay for the donut, but I'll need the card to use your coupon.\" -Me.\n\n\"I ain't got no cash.\" -Her\n\n\"Well then I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing I can do.\" -Me\n\nAt this point, she's really looking like she wants to strangle me, and she pushes the donut across the counter. Then she says, \"You doing a *real* good job, here. You must be proud. Over a donut. For real.\" She then walks out before I finish my response.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm sympathetic to her. It sucks to have to go home because you forgot your way to pay for something. And for just one donut, it's probably both frustrating and embarrassing. But the donut shop sends a guy out every night to change the stock, and our store is held accountable if the inventory left is less than it should be according to sales reported. Further, I can't just pretend she gave me cash or my register will be short at the end of the night by that amount. The only thing I could do is issue an ICS coupon that we're only supposed to use when our equipment isn't working correctly. \n\nStill, she was so angry, and I can't shake the feeling I was somehow the asshole, here. Am I?",

      "description": "I(M24) am on vacation with my brother(M25) and while we are in the hotel room we have music in the background and just mess around being goofy. He takes up his phone and begins recording a Snapchat with his front camera and this is when the problem occurs:\n\nI throw the towel playfully up in the air so that we both get hidden from the camera (I thought it was going to contribute som fun into the Snapchat-video). I didn’t MLB-pitch it, I just lightly threw it in the air. The towel hits his hair and his phone which he then dropped to the ground. \n\nThe phone didn’t break, at least I couldn’t see any visible damage. He goes mad and starts yelling :\n\n-“what’s your problem, you’re breaking my phone!!”\n\nI respond “sorry, I didn’t mean to. I’ll pay for a new one if it is broken”\n\nAnd my brother yells “you don’t fucking understand, you’re breaking my fucking phone” and proceeds to bend the phone and throw it straight into the floor, this time visibly breaking both glass sides of the phone.\n\nI was barely in shock because I wouldn’t expect less from him, knowing him as a person/brother. I tell him to chill and that I am willing to pay for a new phone and that he does not need to get mad. \n\nHe then says that I can’t afford it with my poor mans salary and that he makes 12,5k a month while I only make 3,2k a month as a nurse. My brother is a drug dealer and criminal. And is bragging about it in while I went to university for three years. I find that very disrespectful, because I don’t think that you should try to put yourself above other people when you sell drugs/beat people for money.\n\nI tell him that he should see a psychologist to help him deal with his anger management, and he just tells me to stfu and leave. So I take my stuff and go to the beach. He then comes and I just ignore him, and then he asks “are you still mad? Stop being so childish, I got more money than you will ever have, don’t worry u got money.”\n\nBasically the rest of the trip goes on while be both ignore what happened and live on with our lives. I don’t know if I could have handled this in a better way, but feel like I’m the jerk for throwing the towel. The main reason I’m on this trip with him is because I’m trying to improve or relationship which sucks because IMO he always gets mad when the world doesn’t resolve around him. \n\nI feel like he’s hopeless and I should just leave him be and never have contact with him again. But you know, hEs My BrOtHeR aNd I lOvE hIm and all that.\n\nSo please enlighten me, AITA for throwing the towel and should just accept that I’m at fault for playing around? Are we both assholes?\n\n\n",

Like if I tell you that saying something like that hurts me, would a normal person continue to repeat it??  I think it’s because I honestly don’t think I want to be friends with him anymore.

It’s a recent diagnosis so she’s still quite contagious, and was confirmed by bloodwork a couple days ago. She has a terrible track record of “borrowing” peoples drinks, smokes, vapes, etc. and since mono is spread through saliva that’s a huge !! Red flag for me right there. There’s over 20 other people coming tonight and I didn’t think it was fair to put them at risk by having her here, not to add to the fact that she’s still extremely sick and not in any shape to be leaving the house. \n\nNow let’s address the ex. They dated for a few months and were on and off for a few more, however majority of the group is still friends with him and his friends. Their breakup was civil and they still talk, and I personally am still good friends with him, so I invited him. To me, it has nothing to do with her not being there. I was friends with her first and met him and his friends though her if that makes a difference. \n\nRegardless of all this, she’s super mad - upset that I didn’t invite her and upset that I invited her ex. All my friends are glad she isn’t coming since I don’t think anyone really enjoys being exposed to mono. I stand firm with my decision but can’t help but feel bad that she’s upset with me. \n\nSo, Am I The Asshole here? ",

      "title": "AITA For cutting a toxic friend out of my life?",
      "description": "Okay this is a long 2 part one so strap in and grab some food.\n\nBasically I have always been a pretty private person when it comes to my mental health (ptsd, depression, anxiety) but I am trying to get my life on track. I spent 2 days straight in bed and realized I didn’t want to live like this anymore so I made a post on social media to explain what I’m going through and how I am going to take steps to get better. I mentioned how I used to be a heavy runner and everything (used to do ultras) before I plummeted into my self hate fuckfest of feelings. And that I want to get back into it.\n\nBasically after I posted this my friend messaged me asking me all kinds of questions about me running and everything and basically called me a liar and saying I’m just making that post to gain pity and attention and clout. She kept going throughout the day saying I was full of shit. And that I have to own up to it sooner or later.\n\nI ignored it for the most part until it was making me really question if that’s how it appeared to everyone else that I’m trying to get pity. Which the only reason I posted it to begin with is to call myself out so I actually change like I want to and in case any of my follows had any issues they wanted to talk about.  Eventually I talked to my love interest at the time and she just urged me to shake it off. Told me to ignore her. That she couldn’t believe the friend would say that. So I was like “okay. Obviously it’s okay for me to be like fuck this person. I’m trying to better myself so gotta get the toxic out of there.”\n\nThen I soon realized. TIFU.\n\nThe friend lost it that I deleted her off everything made a post on social media saying how much of a liar piece of shit I am. And then immediately went to my interest. And started telling her every little thing I have ever said that could be considered unsightly (kinks that me and an ex took part in, I had gone to jail a few times, that I was a recovering addict 3 years strong on Friday 15th woohoo), that I had confessed my love for the friend while pursuing the interest (didn’t happen). My interest was heavily against the kink so I knew that from the start so I didn’t mention it. And with jail I hadn’t gotten around to telling her because I wanted it to be the right time to mention it. She knew about my sobriety and applauded it.\n\nBut basically the interest took her side and everything she said as truth without ever really talking to me about it we spent the morning arguing over it before eventually being blocked by the interest. The friend has never said anything positive to the interest about me and has caused issues, usually whenever I make the friend mad she lashes out on me at the interest. And they’ve only met once. I’ve known the interest for about a year? Am I wrong to think that it’s kinda fucked to take someone’s side you don’t know over someone you’ve known for a year and gotten hella close to in the last 3 months?\n\nso AITA?",

      "description": "First of all, I should precise that I am a straight teenage male.\n\n\nOn Instagram, there is an account, ruled by guys from my high school, in which anybody from the school can leave an anonymous message. It’s basically used by people who are seeking the account of their crush whose they don’t know the name. A few weeks ago, I noticed that everyone was tagging me in the comments of one of their publications. And it turns out it was because someone was searching for me!\n\nI was kinda flattered. I already know 2 girls who have a crush on me, and knowing this gave me a little bit more of self-confidence. The thing is, I already have a huge crush on someone in my class, and my relationship with her is kinda weird. I don’t know if she likes me back, since there is both signs that she could like me or not. But that’s not the subject.\n\nA few days ago, I received a message from an anonymous user on Instagram. He said hello, asked me how I was, what I was doing... and he quickly revealed that he had a crush on me and that he was the person who wrote the anonymous message on the account a few weeks back. He then asked me if I was in a relationship. At the time, I though it was a girl, so I told « her » that I was freshly single, and didn’t told anything about my crush.\n\nBut then, he said he was in the same class as one of my best friends... which is a class with only boys in it. So I quickly realized I was dealing with a homosexual guy that was too afraid to tell his crush who he was by fear of rejection. But I first pretended not to know. I asked him who he was, but he didn’t wanted to tell me.\n\nTwo days later, I hit me up again . He wanted to go with me to that gig I‘m going to in a few weeks, he send me kisses emojis and I started to feel embarrassed. So I told him I had a crush on an another girl. He was very upset to learn that and asked me why I didn’t tell him before.\n\nThe story could have ended here, but I made the mistake to tell him to name of my crush. He recognized who she was, and threatened to go talk to her best friend. Under the panic, I messaged my crush’s best friend and asked her if she received a message from the guy. She told me she didn’t and promise me to not tell everyone if he did.\n\nI then threatened the guy too. I told him that if he didn’t tell me who he was, I’ll block him. He confessed he was a boy, but still didn’t wanted to tell who he was. He then said that « nothing matters now anyway », and said goodbye.\n\nI didn’t blocked him though. He still watches my Instagram Stories. AITA?",

      "description": "I know the title sounds weird and quite vague, but let me explain:\n\nI have this friend. Let's call her Ponytail. We became friends in late year 7, (which for you non-Brits is the first year of high school here in the UK, equivalent to 6th grade), and we used to always walk around at lunch and break together, just the two of us. We're really close. In fact, she says that I'm her closest friend.\n\nBut about two months ago, (it will be exactly that on the 28th this month!), I got my first boyfriend. So I started hanging out with him and his friends, who I am also friends with, as well as Ponytail. For the first few days, she didn't want to come along because she felt like she was third-wheeling and didn't want to intrude, despite the fact that she wouldn't really be \"third-wheeling\" and more so \"sixth/seventh-wheeling\" because there's me, him, this other couple, this other guy, and sometimes my bf's ex as well as her, so it's not that awkward in my opinion, although it's understandable she feels that way. But anyway, she quickly started coming along with me.\n\nI try to include her in our group conversations, but since she's quite shy, she doesn't really join in for that long normally. And I wouldn't say I dislike her other friends, but I honestly find them kind of... annoying. I mean, I guess they're alright, they're nice I suppose, but they're just not the sort of people I like to be friends with. And even Ponytail herself has told me that she feels they don't listen to her; she says it feels like they're in their own little bubble and she's not included in it. But it isn't that she doesn't get along with my friends and my bf, she says she likes them, but she just doesn't really talk to them enough to know them properly.\n\nRecently, I was hanging out with my bf and our friends, when this girl who I'm kind of friends with came up to my and told me that Ponytail was crying. Obviously, I went over to her to see what was wrong, as she was with us only a few moments ago. I asked her what was wrong, and she was really upset that I haven't been hanging out with her as much recently, and she said I'd been spending \"too much time\" with my bf recently. She also said she felt like I was ignoring her, and that \"if I don't want to be her friend and don't like her anymore, then I should just tell her\" I felt so bad. I hadn't realised she felt like this. So I tried to comfort her, and we carried on with our day.\n\nThe only classes we share are Maths and Form, where we sit next to each other. I spend the whole of lunch with her on Wednesdays and Fridays because my bf has Orchestra and Choir on those days, (he is a very talented musician), so I still spend a lot of time with her. But I just hate her feeling left out when I am with other people, but idk how to include her in our conversations, because like I said earlier, she just isn't a social person, at all.\n\nSo, am I the asshole in this situation? I appreciate your honesty!",

The problem is that she never turns it off when she watches the movie and has a habit to press the sync button so that when I go to play Xbox, the controller is no longer synced and almost out of battery(which I buy myself BTW) . \n\nSo I decided to start hiding it from her in my room and putting her controller on the table for her to use.

      "description": "I work with about six other people at might job. It's a retail job, and my superior has been working there for 10 years while I have worked there for about 3. \n\nWhen I first started working there I was greeted with an implied ultimatum: I had to choose between loyalty to the owner of the store or loyalty to my coworkers, including my immediate supervisor. They would talk shit about the owner, make fun of her behind her back, call her insane etc. Now, the owner has been very nice to me since I started working for her and I have gone out of my way to help her with things outside of work like helping her move etc. She's a.... colorful \"no bullshit\" type person and can exaggerate things from time to time, but other than that we've had a great working relationship that has remained professional. \n\nOne day the owner tripped and fell flat on her face in the back of the store. It could have been pretty bad, because she's older and not very mobile. After this happened, my supervisor was going around showing everyone the camera footage of the owner falling down and laughing at her. She was legitimately excited by the whole ordeal, taking pleasure in showing people. They showed me and I kind of chuckled at it, but later that night I was thinking about it and realized how insulting that was to the owner and felt pretty bad about it. So I called the owner and told her that my supervisor was going around showing people this, and admitted that at first I laughed but felt pretty ashamed realizing how rude it was and wanted to admit to her what was going on. She was furious and thanked me for telling her what was going on. She then immediately stripped the supervisor of her camera privileges. Now somehow, I don't really know how, my supervisor found out that I was the one who ratted her out and she treats me like utter shit now. Rolling her eyes at me when I request things for work, or when I greet her when she comes in she flat out ignores me. She throws it in my face sometimes saying things like \"I could do such and such if I had access to the cameras but oh well guess I can't.\" I refuse to get into to it with her. \n\nI intially thought about confronting her directly about it but then I figured, why? When it comes down to it the owner is paying me to work at her store and is entitled to know when she is being utterly disrespected by her employees. My supervisor has this problem that when she is confronted by people she immediately has a panic attack and flips out, then her massive boyfriend gets involved. I decided \"fuck that\" and went straight to the victim. AITA reddit?",

      "description": "Me and my friends spent sometime organizing a game of diplomacy (a board game) online that we'd play in real time. The game is going to last for 5 hours if we play through the whole thing, so I tell my parents that I won't be able to do anything that night (It was a night that my mom was hoping do something but I said I do anything that night because I had the game I was planning for a month.)\n\nWhile playing the game, everybody still on the board makes a pact against one player, lets call him mac, because he was trying to put everybody into conflict with each other with lies (The game is all about diplomacy and lying so this is expected.) We agreed that after he's defeated we'd end the game. This is especially satisfying for me who's been the butt end of a running joke in my group of friends about a mistake I did in the game that lead to similar situation, and if the game was to end early I could do something with my family.\n\nAs he's on his last legs in the game, one player who's tired of the game and somewhat thinks the game is done decides to leave. We could probably still beat mac, but it will take longer not only because the person who left won't be supporting us anymore, but also because we'll have to \"wait\" for him to put in his turns for the turn to go through meaning we'd have to wait the entire turn timer.\n\nAt this time, it seems pretty certain still that that person would lose, but mac believed there was a small chance that he could survive until the game time ran out and draw. At this time one player's already left, and both me and another player just want the game to end as fast as possible. \n\nI suggest that we just end the game and say that Mac lost, but Mac refuses to count it as a loss until he's truly been defeated. I find this to be unsportsmanlike, especially because it's a casual game, that he's forcing everyone to play out the game until he's truly lost by the rules, because he believes there's a possibility that he could still draw Some people do takes mac's side.\n\nI feel like mac's forcing my hand to either concede the game or use up my time, granted I did say that I was going to play the game before.\n\n I say that mac's unsportsmanlike behavior makes me think less of him because of all the context of his actions. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "A little background. I'm a far from rich guy who has two cars. One is a 20 year old pickup (my baby) and a 21 year old luxury car. I bought the car because it was hella cheap, still in pretty good shape, known for reliability, and mostly because my wife was finally getting a job for the first time in 9 months and I didn't want anything to stop her. \n\nI was coming home from work with my roommate (Lets call him J) and I turned into my neighborhood and saw her (my wife will be B) sitting at the bus stop with our dog. I hadn't had the best of days at work but I tried to be cheery so I stopped to say hi to my wife. I rolled down the window and asked her what she was doing, B explained that she was gonna watch her friends kids until she got home from work. She also said that the dog had knocked over a drink in the car. (One of my biggest pet peeves of all time.)\n\nI smiled it off and B then told me \"Its fine I'll just get home and wipe everything down with Clorox Wipes.\" I stopped her there and said \"No you're not, that shit will ruin leather, use the cleaner I have in the garage it'll work better.\" B got kinda serious and said \"Why does it matter, this car is a piece of shit anyway,\" and my roommate J looked at me with a questioning expression and I told my wife \"Yeah, just tear the car up more, it's not like you take care of the damn thing anyways. \n\nWe all went home and linked up. B decided that I was being an ass and being too serious about the cars, and I fired back with the fact that she never helps lift a finger in the slightest to take care of them, yet I paid, and still pay for the cars so why destroy them needlessly. We are already broke so what's wrong with keeping the shit we have nice? Who cares if it's old.\n\nSo to finish up, I'm mad at my wife because she pretty much refuses to take care of our cars. The cars are the most expensive thing we have, and I pay for all the maintenance, gas, and insurance. My wife thinks I'm being an asshole, by \"taking my day out on her.\" It seems like we have had this conversation before about her tearing up my truck when she would drive it. So am I actually being an asshole some kind of way? Or should I keep pursuing that she's not respecting what little shit I have to give her. Thanks in advance. ",

      "description": "TL;DR: sister's husband recently purchased a (now) nine week old border collie puppy.  They live in a rural area with several large predators (coyotes, wolves, predatory birds) capable of killing or carrying off a young puppy.  They also live somewhere with high winds and low temperatures during the winter.  WIBTA for reporting them for animal neglect?\n\nMore info:  My sister and her husband have only been married a few months.  My sister had an adult dog going into the relationship.  This dog was taken care of pretty well, kept inside, walked / run with daily, etc.  Since moving in with her husband, he's taken over none of the care for the dog, which my sister is fine with; it's \"her\" dog.  Apparently they decided that he needed a dog for him – so they bought a border collie puppy about a week ago.  The puppy is now nine weeks old.  The housing they're in right now doesn't allow animals to be kept inside.  My sister works full time (often 50+ hrs a week, since she's on a dairy), her husband works part-time right now.  While they're away from home, the puppy is left outside for hours (6+) at a time.  This winter has been warmer than usual, but it's still usually 20 - 40 F at their home, often with a windchill of at least 10F lower than the actual temperature.  The puppy doesn't have her adult coat yet, and as far as I know they don't have any shelter available for either dog.  They also live in an area with a sizable coyote population, a lot of large predatory birds (redtails, some bald eagles, various others I've seen but don't know the species), and recently they've had sightings of wolves moving back into the area (with several people reporting barn cats found dead, or other pets gone missing).\n\nMy state's laws require \"adequate protection, including appropriate shelter, against extreme weather conditions; and other essential care.\"  I don't think that either dog has adequate protection or essential care, since neither dog has shelter and they're leaving a nine week old puppy outside to fend for itself in a very rural area.\n\nI HAVE tried talking to my sister and her husband about this, trying to be as calm and inoffensive as possible, but any mention of how they treat their animals makes them incredibly defensive.  My sister has taken a hands-off approach with this puppy, since it's \"his\" dog.  This is the first time he's had a puppy, and he doesn't seem to understand or be willing to put forward the proper amount of care necessary to take care of it properly.  (He's also not training it at all, but I don't think that's really as much of an issue as the fact that it's being left outside in cold weather, with a very real possibility of being eaten by predators.)\n\nWIBTA for at least having their county animal control do a welfare check on their animals?",

He had the correct title for the boat so we signed the Bill of Sale and the title. Woot - I own a boat-ish.\n\nThen it comes time for the trailer. Well come to find out the trailer title isn't for a boat trailer, it's for a travel trailer. ugh. So now I try to get out of the deal and tell him I'm not paying for the boat until I have the trailer. He insisted that I just say the trailer is homemade and register it that way (in order to do this I would have to have receipts from materials and it would need to LOOK homemade). We agreed that he could keep the original paperwork for the boat, but that I wasn't going to pay him anything until I had the correct title in my hand.\n\nWell since the trailer had a current license plate, we got the info from it and went to the DMV and looked up the \"owner\" of the trailer. They were nice enough to get a duplicate and transfer the title over to me. Wow how lucky am I - WRONG.\n\nNOW - After speaking with the owner of the trailer, I don't think this is the same trailer that sits under the boat I am buying. The owner of the trailer said that if was used for a small aluminum boat and this boat is a rather large 21' Center Console Mako. The VIN number indicates that the trailer is only rated for 1500lbs and that it is only 14' long.\n\nThe guy that is holding the boat (since I now legally own it) says there is no VIN on the trailer. I think someone swiped a license plate from a another trailer and put it on this one to make it appear legal.\n\nQUESTION: If there is truly no VIN on the trailer, AITA if I tell him I can't buy the boat and trailer since I am suspicious that the trailer is the one he claims it to be? Who bears the burden of proof? I would think he does - right?\n\nFurthermore, if there is a VIN but it doesn't match the title, AITA for taking the plate that is now registered in my name off \"his\" boat trailer?\n\nI'm thinking I should just put the boat trailer back in his name and run away! OR lowball him like crazy &amp; buy a new trailer.\n\nTLDR; Buying a boat/trailer that has no title on the trailer, but the license plate on the trailer doesnt match the trailer description.",

      "description": "A couple months ago, I was having a SUPER rough day. We have three kids under five, they'd been at home for weeks, I was stressed out. So I went to a salon and bought this conditioner that I remembered being used on me once there, I remembered thinking it smelled really good. It was pretty expensive, and was not a normal purchase for me. Usually I'd get some stuff from the grocery store or something, so it was kind of like a special treat I guess.\n\nWhen I used it, my husband commented that he hated the smell. Like really hated it. One day he came home and said he could smell it throughout the whole house. He said it was repulsive to him, made him want to throw up and asked that I get rid of it. \n\nI said I didn't want to get rid of it, it was expensive, made my hair feel nice, and I liked the smell. I only wash my hair like every other or every third day. So he would t have to smell it often.\n\nWe compromised. He bought me some conditioner he thought smelled good. I don't like it, but I use it when he's at home. And I use the stuff I like if I know he's going to be gone or  something. It's more or less in the past now, but I've always wondered if IWTA.",

      "description": "So, basically what the title suggests, but there's more. \n\nMy boyfriend (Joseph) and I live together. His baby mama (Karen) has a fiance (Adam) and another child. \n\nJoseph and Karen have a child together, Savannah. Savannah is 10, wonderful child, and she and I are very close. She knows that me and her father will get married one day, and is excited for it. Joseph lives with me. Savannah, during the school week, stays with Joseph's parents, because it's a small town school with smaller class sizes. This next school year, she will live with us full time and go to school in our slightly bigger city. Joseph has full custody of her, whereas Karen only has visitation. She deserted Savannah and Joseph when they were married, for Adam. \n\nThis week is spring break for Savannah. I knew it was coming up, but didn't know if she would stay with Karen and Adam, or with me and Joseph, or just stay with her grandparents in tiny town. \n\nThis past weekend, we couldn't get ahold of Karen OR Adam. I wanted to make sure Karen knew it was spring break and that Savannah wanted to spend the break week with her and Adam, and the weekend with us. She doesn't reply until Monday.\n\nShe then says she only wants communication about Savannah to be between her and Joseph. Now, this would be fine if it weren't for Karen saying she wants ALL of us to communicate, because Savannah is parented by all of us.\n\nThen she backpedals and says she feels attacked (???) and wants communication to be all of us, but also only Joseph and Karen. \n\nAITA for being offended right now? Karen is saying communication has gone so well these past few months and she wants to keep it that way. Spoiler, I'm the one who usually keeps Joseph from going off on her regarding Savannah, and sometimes the one who messages her from Joseph's account. I dont think she knows this.",

      "description": "I’m a wheelchair user, I work in a 20 story office building. We have maybe 15-20 lifts around the building, the small lift lobbies have 2 steps up to the office area, they aren’t busy as they are out of the way. I work on the 12th floor and our canteen is on the 8th floor. I use the main lift lobby which have 8 lifts. So I recently went for lunch on the 8th floor but sometime during that the 6 newer lifts malfunctioned meaning there’s only  2 in the main lobby working. I expected to wait a bit longer , but full lifts kept stopping completely full for 10 minutes, I then tried to pretend to squeeze in the packed lifts. 15 minutes go by I’m getting a bit pissed, the next list stops, people look at there feet avoiding me,  I asked if anybody could get out because I’ve been waiting a long time and there’s lots of stairwells and the outer lift lobbies are probably less busy, nobody does anything. I move forward stopping the door from closing and tell everyone the lift is not going anywhere and they are horrible people for being lucky enough to walk and ignoring me. The lift empties out and I get to my floor.\n\nAITA , maybe people in the lift had non visible disabilities and I was a bitch ",

      "description": "I (18F) and my best friend who we’ll call Cami (20F) have known each other for over 10 years now, and we even live together. We both got jobs in fast food around 16; my best friend at Dairy Queen and me at McDonald’s. Cami has been looking to get into Walmart, Sam’s Club or Publix for about a year now, but unfortunately hasn’t been getting any call backs from them.\n\nAbout a week ago, I applied to Publix and got an interview the next day, and I have my two weeks at McDonald’s in. I was scared to tell Cami because I felt bad that I had gotten in so fast when she had been trying to get in for a year.\n\nWhen I did muster the courage to let her know, her response was basically “Welp, now I’ll have a recommendation from an employee to boost my application!”\n\nNow I love Cami and my relationship with her is priceless, but I’ll be the first to say that I let her walk all over me during arguments. Our arguments are rare, but when they happen, she’s very headstrong. I’m the one who always apologizes even when I’m in the right, and after I apologize she’s kinda like “OK” and doesn’t talk about it again and refuses to apologize. It’s been like this for all of the 10 years I’ve known her, and it’s not only me that she does this to.\n\nThe last argument that we had was about 6 months ago. She wanted a second job and asked for me to put a word in to my McDonald’s manager. I did, and she got hired. She asked for my manager’s number under the pretense that she was checking her schedule, but she quit without telling me because she changed her mind about having two jobs. She didn’t bother to tell me and I figured it out when she wasn’t there for what was supposed to be her first week.\n\nLuckily for me McDonald’s isn’t strict at all, so no one really cared, but in a professional setting, something like that can discredit me as a person and discredit the value of my recommendations. It shows that I blindly recommended someone who wasn’t serious about the job. As usual, Cami didn’t apologize and didn’t see a problem in what she did. I snapped and instead of playing peace maker like usual, I told her that she can expect that I’ll never recommend her anywhere else ever again if I didn’t get an apology for this one.\n\nI didn’t get an apology, and now I’m refusing to put a recommendation for her in at Publix for that exact reason. \n\nTo me it seems clear that I’m not in the wrong; I warned her that this would happen and she didn’t take me seriously. But now my family (who have basically accepted her as a daughter/sister) are saying that it’s stupid for me to put her entire career on the line because of a “trivial argument.” But it wasn’t simply that argument, it was 10 years of attitude problems. I love her and I don’t want to ruin her life, but I also can’t pretend like that behavior is okay. My family says I’m being a petty bitch, and I’m quite upset that they’ve taken her side in the side in the situation.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n",

I don’t go to bars often and this is the first one I’ve been to since my 21st birthday. \n\nAnyway an hour into the night I went to the bathroom and was surprised to see a bathroom attendant there. Again, I don’t really go to bars or clubs so I don’t know if this is a typical thing to see. She had a bunch of stuff on the bathroom counter like perfume, spray deodorant, wipes etc. She also had a tip jar. I instantly felt bad because I didn’t have any cash on me. So I waited in line and only used the soap and paper towels that the bar already provided, said thank you to her and walked out. I did use the bathroom two more times that night.\n\nOn the third time I was about to leave and she started yelling (like actually yelling) at me saying how ungrateful and privileged I was for not tipping her. I told her that I’m sorry but I didn’t have any cash. She kept yelling and told me to find another bathroom and not to come back. \n\nI understand that she probably gets paid below minimum wage and relies on tips, but I thought her reaction was a bit uncalled for.

I was going to get back on methadone after the stress of Christmas and tell them when the time was right but they caught me and now are demanding i do rehab and saying that this is proof that I didn't make progress because I relapsed when I came off it. Methadone gave the most stability i had and i think going to rehab now is a waste of money and a big step back for me after ive reestablished a career.

      "description": "This is a doozy, bare with me.\n\nWhen I was 16, my first girlfriend, also 16, became pregnant. Her parents literally uprooted their whole lives to move away due to it. We found out one day, I was barred from seeing or contacting her or her family by threats of police involvement the next day. I was a dumb 16 year old: I was scared of my parents, scared of her parents getting police involved, so it was a \"secret\". \n\nMy parents still don't know because I don't even know what I would tell them. It was literally a month later they were gone. No trace at all. To give an idea of my girlfriend's thoughts, she was scared but didn't hate me or anything. It really boiled down to her ultra-conservative parents. This was before Facebook and before teens had cellphones, etc, there wasn't really a place I could follow her, at least not for a couple of years.\n\nI'm 33 now. I'm married, I have a daughter who's 3. I still think about my ex-girlfriend. I never forgot. I wasn't able to find her on Facebook until a couple of years ago. She also has a daughter, my daughter, a 16 year old. She looks so strikingly like me, it's unreal. She looks more like me than my 3 year old.\n\nIf there's anything I want more in life, is to reconnect. I always wanted this. I would have dreams, very frequently, about meeting my older child, even before I saw photos. I would give my house, all my money, everything but family to make my family bigger.\n\nBut my then-girlfriend is married now to someone else. They have an established life. Hell, I have an established life. It becomes an internal struggle between wanting to reconnect more than life itself versus potentially putting their lives into catastrophe. I can't just inject myself into their lives, it would have a negative net sum I'm sure. Plus I don't know how my wife would react, I haven't even told her. I assumed they had a termination and that was that, so it never came up. I should have in retrospect.\n\nWIBTA if I reached out to connect with my then-girlfriend? What if I reached out to my daughter?",

      "description": "A girl I dated a few years ago and I have remained good friends since our breakup. I've still had romantic feelings for her since then and the past 2 years she's been dating this guy that nobody seems to understand them as a couple. I've never cared for the guy despite my best efforts. I want to support her more than anything and if she's happy that's great.\n\nI've known the past few months things between them have been pretty rocks with multiple times of them almost breaking up. They have an apartment together and their lease runs up this summer, so staying together for the time being makes sense on a lot of levels.\n\nLast weekend I get a call from her at 1030pm asking if I can come over because she might need some help. 20 minutes I show up and knock on the door, she comes out with her dog on a leash and wearing a hat. She is clearly upset and after we start a walk she says that he hit her.\n\nI ask if it was open handed or a fist (not that it matters) and she doesn't know, she just knows her cheekbone hurts. Apparently they were is a super heavy argument, which has become the norm lately, and she shoved him. His response, from his perspective, was he tried hitting her hat off her head. But then she tells me this isn't the first time he's hit her but the second time.  After about a 45 minute walk she goes back to the apartment.  \n\nSince then I don't know much about their interactions hut I've understood she has been looking around for a new place. She's been staying in the spare bedroom and he's been in the master.\n\nI had an opportunity to see him tonight at a social event and in private I approached him, stating if he touched her again he's gonna wind up in a hospital. He asks if she told me what happens and I say \"yes she told me. Get home safely\" and then walk away, to which he responds FU.\n\n2 hours later I check my phone and have 3 missed calls from her and a text saying \"wtf\"\n\nI haven't been able to talk to her since then, but AITA for stepping in? I just want to protect my friend, romantic feelings aside. How could she interpret this to make me out to be the bad guy?",

The week of Thanksgiving our Manager &amp; Assistant manager sent an email asking if we all wanted to participate in Secret Santa this year with a $25 minimum.  The 6 of us all agreed that we did not want to buy gifts for the 3 people who never show up to work, are outwardly hostile and when they are at work just seem annoyed with us.  Most of the 6 declined their offer saying they didn't have the money to participate and it ended with a pithy email about how \"sad\" they are that this \"great idea isn't going to happen\".  Should we have added them to our own Secret Santa?  Are we all assholes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, when I declined Secret Santa I suggested that instead of us all buying gifts for each other that we didn't need, we could get a name of a child from the Township and be their Secret Santa.

She called me this morning and asked me if I would take her to the store later because she didn’t want to drive in the weather. I said sure I’ll be there around 3-4, she said perfect. \n\nAt almost exactly 3:00 I was free, so I texted her saying I would head over to her house. My mom is horrible at checking her phone so I honestly didn’t expect a response. While I’m driving over I call her (hands free calling don’t worry!), because she’s sometimes better at answering her phone, she does not answer. Should probably note my moms house is ~10min from mine. I get to her house at ~3:15, she’s not home. I figure she took the dog for a walk, get inside, the dog is home. \n\nSo now I’m annoyed and I call her multiple times. She finally answers at ~3:30. She says she had a dentist appointment and decided just to go grocery shopping after. I say to her “I’m frustrated because I feel like you’ve disrespected my time.” She screams something like “yeah I’m just an awful bitch” and hangs up on me. \n\nShe makes me feel like I’m such an asshole for being upset with her, but I feel like I have the right to be upset that she wasted my time!

      "description": "Hear me out. I know that mental illness isn't the person's fault, and I know that it's not something that easy to fix. But I need to know if I'm an asshole for acting the way I do because of it. I (19 F) am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and PTSD. For the past month, I've been having breakdown after breakdown, followed by periods of emotional numbness and sometimes hostility, but an overall general feeling of hopelessness and self-hatred. During these times, my spouse (24 M) has been by my side through the whole thing. There for me when I need him and so on. However, when I get depressed, I feel like I'm making him feel like I don't appreciate what he does for me. Whenever I get like this, I always feel like I'm making him feel not good enough to make me happy or like he's not a good husband, which is far from the truth. No matter how many time he tells me that I'm wrong and that he loves me and he's alright, I can't help but feel like he's only telling me that to make me feel better, and that he actually feels how I think he does. The tiny logical part of my brain says that it's the depression, but everything else is telling me that I'm just a burden on him and that he deserves so much better than a whiny girl with mental issues. He has such big dreams and potential, but every time he comes up with some convoluted idea, I shoot him down. He says this is me bringing him back to Earth and that he needs someone like that, but again, I feel like that's just him saying that to make me feel better. \n\nI genuinely am not sure how to process these emotions, and I'm probably posting on the wrong subreddit... but I need an unbiased 3rd party to give me genuine and unfiltered advice on this.

In all honesty I had no idea the entrees were this expensive.

Everybody was drinking and we declined but eventually ended up ordering entrees. In retrospect staying at this restaurant was a bad idea anyway because of the money situation.  Wine was ordered and everybody got absolutely hammered.\n\nWhen the check comes Alice -who offered to pay - says that the other three people should split the check with her evenly. In effect my roommates ended up shouldering a massive bill and my friend and I’s dinner/tab. \n\nToday we made amends and I am going to cover the portion of their bill they each shouldered. I am not asking Alice for money as I am not entitled to it. \n\nMy question is if I am the asshole for reserving a dinner I cannot afford (unknowingly) and putting everyone in an uncomfortable position?\n\nTLDR: set up a nice dinner I cannot afford and my roommates ended up paying for me.\n\n",

      "description": "So a little background: \n\nMy mom and I have a very fickle relationship. She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?",

      "description": "So this happened recently. I was pulling out of a parking lot onto a busy one way street and next thing I know a biker coming from the wrong direction of traffic with no lights on (a rule for night riding in my town) is in-front of my car as soon as i go. Now mind you that it barely bumped his bike and the extent of the damage was him tipping over. We pulled over i gave him my phone number and said if he took it to a bike shop and found any damage that I would gladly pay for it. He mentions that is fine with him and he says he has to go to his halfway house because he is past curfew from his second job. I genuinely felt bad about all of this even if he is technically at fault, I mean all i had to do was look right just in case... but I get home and he calls again and says, “we can call it even if you bring me $100 to the halfway house for the bike”. I replied that no I wasn’t going to to that. What if the bike cost $30 to fix? What if it cost $300 to fix? Mostly, I saw you ride off on it so I’m not sure what these damages are he is speaking of. He says it’s either the $100 or he’ll make a police report. I told him i’m sorry but I guess we’ll have to go that route. I told him again a final time if he brings me a bill for his bike or brings me to the bike shop I will pay for the bike, but i’m not going to allow you to black mail me with the police. I’m usually not one to feel guilt but this one kind of bothers me. He was in a half way house so i assume his life hasn’t been to easy in the last year, and it’s christmas time so i don’t want to make this a financial burden for him.",

      "title": "AITA for telling off my roommate for not feeding the cats?",
      "description": "For some context, I live in a flatshare with two other people and two cats (officially mine, the adoption was unanimously decided though and we all take care of them together). Now my roommate is usually the last one to leave the house in the morning so she offered to take on morning feedings. (The other roommate is absent in this story, so not relevant.)\n\nThis morning, I saw her leave the house before me (without saying a word) and, noticing she hadn't fed the cats, fed them myself and texted her afterwards. Here's the translated conversation (I tried to keep the tone as accurate as possible):\n\n&gt;Me: Did you feed the cats this morning?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roommate: No, I had to leave before 8\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\**our feeding times are usually 8am and 8pm, though she often fed them earlier too - which is a no-brainer of course, if no one's gonna be home after 8 I don't expect them to strictly adhere to those times*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Ok next time can you let me know if you're gonna be out earlier? I fed them before leaving, but since you usually feed them in the mornings I rely on that and don't want to have to worry about them going without food after I'm out of the house  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Okay. How about you tell me when you're home until 8? Because I don't always have the time, or I'm in a hurry. Maybe we can make a plan for that?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I always have to leave before 8 when I'm working, and you feed them often enough before 8? I understand that you can be in a hurry sometimes but you explicitely said you always give them breakfast and they shouldn't have to suffer from this shit. Until now I always left before you... so it's not the first time they haven't gotten food from you? That just really doesn't fly. Then you should tell me I can't rely on you feeding them and it's no problem, I'll just do it myself from now on  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Calm down?! I don't get why you're coming at me like this, I always take care of them and today I just didn't have the time for it, that stuff happens and it's not my fault  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Bro this is about the cats not ending up without food just because you can't communicate, simple as that. If you say you always feed them in the mornings, and I see you feed them in the mornings (even before 8) I assume you do that and I don't go and feed them a 2nd time. We saw each other last evening and this morning so you had enough opportunity to tell me I need to feed them, but just leaving without a word is pretty shitty. I'm honestly a bit shocked you're being this unreasonable, my goal is not to chew you out but that my cats don't go without food...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Are you being serious? It's ok, you already are chewing me out. As if I'm the only person in the house who can take care of them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: You said you do breakfast. When people say something like this and usually do it, you can expect others to rely on it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Yes but sometimes I can't plan things like these!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Then fucking let me know!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Sorry for fucking forgetting once, that's why I'm texting you now! It's not like it was intentional?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: You're texting me? You replied only after I asked you and was already out of the house. So if I had left before you, the cats wouldn't have had any food the entire day? You're really not seeing the problem here? And again, this is not about you being in a hurry and not being able to plan these situations, it's about not communicating these things  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: You were up already!!! As if you can't hear when the cats are being fed  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Yeah. I'm repeating my question:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: &gt;So if I had left before you, the cats wouldn't have had any food the entire day?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: What the fuck is wrong with you? What is this disrespectful bullshit?? They got food EVERY DAY, even in the mornings AND EVENINGS. And now this. I'm not doing anything anymore. It's your problem, then you don't have to worry any more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Yeah, like I already told you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Yup. You give an inch, but they take a mile - constantly. You're welcome btw.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: You're not the victim here, so save the bullshit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM: Ungrateful is all I'm gonna say :)\n\nTL;DR: Roommate who usually feeds the cats in the morning left without doing so and without saying a word. I let her know that doesn't fly and she has to let me know so they don't go without food because I assumed she already fed them, shitstorm ensues.\n\nI'll have to add she has a habit of not cleaning up after herself (and a ton of other annoyances that just make her seem really inconsiderate) and always playing the victim when you point these things out to her. While this may not justify me being the asshole in this story, it might give some explanation as to why I reacted so aggressively from the get go.\n\nSo, *am* I the asshole?",

      "description": "Recently my relationship with my girlfriend has hit a bump, she explains to me that sometimes her Ex will every now and again pop up in her head and remind her of him, eventually it got to the point where she was wondering if her brain was trying to tell her to get back with him. Me, questioning on her on a few things, I ask her if the Ex in question were to ask her if she wanted to go back out with him, she responded \"today would be a maybe, but a few days ago it would've been a yes\". We talked and decided to break up to give her time to think about this as she has quite a lot going on in her life right now, as it would let her make the decision unbiasedly, to which i agreed and was more than happy to support her on, I wish nothing more than for her to be happy, I just don't want to be screwed over in the process. (We also both agreed to not do anything with anyone while we were split)\n\nCut to Three days later after the split,  after some back and forth texting I ask:  (It goes me then Girlfriend)\n\nHow's the thinking coming along?\n\nThinking?\n\nY'know about the split\n\noooooh, Haven't really thought much\n\nLmao, probably should. Not being harsh but should probably devote some time to think about it\n\nAhh whatevs i'll get round to it\n\nLmao alrighty\n\nYe that's cool w you yeah?\n\nWell the \"Whatevs\" kinda sounds harsh but i understand that you don't mean it in that way, but also if its like 3 weeks later i might be a little upset that's all\n\nNo need to rush something I don't have a time limit on\n\nNo i understand it's just, it sounds disheartening to hear for example, 3 weeks after i ask, the same answer y'know?\n\nNot really\n\nits like if you asked me a serious question desperately wanted the answer, asked me if i've been thinking about the answer and i said \"i'll get around to it\" then 3 weeks pass and i say \"I'll get around to it\".\n\nWhatever man, you don't have a very good attitude towards this whole thing.\n\nHow so? i'm not asking you for an answer just if you've been thinking about it\n\nI'm not against you. i just know that it's gonna take time a lot of mental strain on me so i want to be in a place where i'm ready to let that happen. So it'll take as long as it needs and you should be atleast patient and understand enough to get that? i'm legit just asking for time to figure shit out. It's not a yes or no question that i can easily find answer to. you make it seem like i'm prolonging this to hurt you. I'm not.\n\nNo no i'm not thinking you're prolonging it to hurt me, i just wanted to know if you thought about it at all. its not me wanting to wrench an answer out of you. I've reread what i wrote and i see how it came across like that, but that wasn't my intention.\n\nFeels like it\n\nThen i apologise i didn't intend to\n\nYeah I know. It's cool. Imma go sleep\n\nI'm gonna take a guess that you don't want to talk too much after that, but also have a nice sleep.\n\nI'll Try.\n\nI'll take that as a yes, G'night",

      "description": "So this is something that has been bothering me a bit. I kinda feel guilty for some reason even though I think I did the right thing. Some context. I(16 M) am a high school student and both of the people involved are my close friends. They used to be in an intense relationship.. Like everyone in our school would ship em' and all that kinda shit.I used to admire their relationship and how close they were. But one day I had found out through another friend that the guy had been calling other girls over to his house to \"play board games\" when he was homealone.At first I didn't believe it and then he showed me screenshots of him calling people over.I didn't know whether I should talk to him or tell her cuz both of em are close friends to me. So the situation is that the other friend that is the girl is not what do you say \"popular\" among the other girls and the only super close friend she had was this guy. I had to stop and think what I needed to do. I ended up telling her. There was bunch of shit that went down. People cried. Some people went emo for a month or 2. I tried the best I can to help her get through it. And my other friend .. well I didn't talk to him for a bit and then he came around again. Now fast forward 6 months. They are really close again. Like weirdly close. I mean I'm happy they patched shit up but why tf did I waste my time helping out my friend get through her shit for.\nHe still hides shit from her and she doesn't know it(not that he should tell her everything that s going on in his life but shit like I don't talk to any other girl other than you and a whole bunch of shit like that when in reality he talks to me about other girls that he trying for) Why tf did I cry with her when It happened. Aita for feeling like they shouldn't be as close as they are now.\n",

Rating girls on a scale of one to ten (out loud, in front of them), treating his girlfriend like shit at family events (she dumped him after he asked for her dad's blessing in marriage 3 times and the dad said no, and then Shit-Twin was very vocal about how unfair that was), anger issues - like, real bad. He's really negative, we have nothing in common, and I hate being around him. \n\nI have made it very clear to my parents that I don't want him at my wedding, nor do I particularly want him in my life. My mother in particular is APPALLED at the suggestion that I would invite literally every other person in my family, and not him. It wouldn't be quite as awful, but his twin sister is cool and so I want to invite her and her wife, and apparently that would be too cruel to Shit-Twin, as well as Shit-Twin's mother, who is chronically embarrassed that her kid has grown up to be such a garbage human. \n\nWith so many people at the wedding, it's entirely possible I wouldn't even realize he was there. And he probably wouldn't talk to me anyway (or maybe even show up) because we really do hate each other. At least, that's what my mom and her siblings think. The general consensus among the rest of my family is that I'm singling him out in order to embarrass him, although I mostly just don't want to deal with that headache.\n\nAITA? ",

This Sonic is extremely close to my house, it’s less than a three minute walk and I live in town homes so I basically consider it part of my neighborhood. \n\nThere was this new manager there that no one liked, she was rude and condescending to all the other employees. Another manager claimed she saw her smoking meth in her car in the parking lot. The girl already had previous trouble with heroin and lost custody of one her her kids because of it. \n\nOne morning she came to work high on something, she was completely gray and vomiting everywhere and she could barely stand up. She slept through her whole shift and we notified the GM and he didn’t care. He didn’t think it was a big deal that she was high on hard drugs at work and doing them in the parking lot. \n\nOn Saturday she was supposed to open but never showed up, the GM was unconcerned and so I notified the store supervisor about her drug use and she came in and fired the meth head on the spot. \n\nThe GM was very upset with me, and so was the assistant manager. I told them I was thinking of all the 15 and 16 year olds that work at sonic and I didn’t want them to exposed to that kind of drug use. Sonic is also really close to my house and I live in a good neighborhood and I really didn’t want a meth user near it honestly. There’s lots of young kids and couples in my neighborhood. \n\nThey told me the meth head got evicted from her house and lost custody of her other kid and they feel like I’m kicking her when she’s down. They were so upset that they suspended me from work for a week (it’s okay though because I was already quitting). I didn’t know she got evicted or lost custody before I reported her and now I feel kind of bad. I still feel like she shouldn’t have been working high though. Who’s the asshole?",

      "description": "AITA for not wanting to stay in bed all night with my boyfriend? This didn't use to be an issue when we both worked seconds, however, he switched to first- waking up at 4:30, when I used to ideally go to bed. I have always been a night owl, sleeping at night always leaves me feeling tired no matter how much I sleep, AND lethargic ALL day until night time. I got up early everyday for 3 months. I have tried to exhaust myself with 2 hours of sleep so I can fall asleep with him. But no matter how tired I am, once darkness hits I just feel very \"up\" all of a sudden. I have tried for months now, but it just isn't working.\n\nHe tells me that if he feels me not beside him, it causes him to have nightmares of me cheating on him, which he wakes up mad at me for. Side note: No, I've never even so much as gave him reason to think I'd cheat. He freaks out on me if I have to get up for the bathroom, or if I get up for water. I can't even go to the bathroom now for more than 15 minutes with out him pounding on the door harassing me angrily about \"Really?! Why is it impossible for you to just stay in bed!!\". (I am **extremely** quiet as I hate dealing with this bs and he is still snoring after I've gotten up). I HATE just laying in bed bored for 6 hours, but he has a fit when I tell him I want to be able to stay up. He tells me I'm not trying hard enough to get on the same sleep schedule and am just being selfish. I think this is a ridiculous thing to get screamed at for, and genuinely feel suffocated that I can't do anything at night without reprimand. So, AITA?\n\nFinal side note: I have asked my doctor about my sleep patterns. He told me that it is probably a genetic factor, as I can fall asleep and feel rested within reason- my sleep rhythm just doesn't work on the same schedule as others.",

      "title": "AITA for meeting with my ex to rehash his issues with our relationship and \"help\" him without telling my husband?",
      "description": "Probably need some background here so here goes:\n\nI am 27f, for about 2 years in college I dated a guy and it was such a toxic relationship that it's pretty much left and indelible scar. We fought all the time, we broke up and got back together easily 50 times and he did some truly terrifying things to me while we would fight (for example screaming at me while driving and then taking his hands off the wheel saying he didn't care if we crashed). I wanted to be equitable and say we were both responsible but he probably has some narcissism, definitely had substance abuse problems and he started most of the fights. I finally broke up with him for good and I'm thinking the last time I saw him was easily six years ago. \n\nI met my husband 4 years ago. To me, he's the dream guy. He's handsome, he's an ER physician, he's athletic, he's so sweet and thoughtful, he makes me belly laugh nearly ever day and we are on the same page when it comes to just about everything. It was love at first sight when he was in med school and I was starting work and we have basically been inseparable ever since. I would never cheat on him or anything like that ever. I love our life together and don't ever want to risk anything. \n\n\nMy husband had to work all weekend and it's really important to note that occasionally he'll work with something at the ER that he has a hard time letting go of and I know I need to give him some space when he gets home and there is for sure some not good times to drop news on him. The specifics of the patient he treated are horrifying (it was a little girl, really that's all I want to say) and he's going to the hospital today about seeking some sort of counseling, i'm very proud of him but this is not the time to drop my drama on him. That's very important going forward with the rest of the story. \n\n\nSo Friday night I got a call from a number I didn't recognize figured it was a robocall so I didn't answer. Voicemail was from my college ex-boyfriend. It basically said he knew this was out of the blue but he's been in addiction recovery and he's trying to make amends with all the people he hurt and if there was any way he'd love to meet with me to see if I could help him figure why things were so bad with us and how he could move on. I didn't respond on Friday night but Saturday my mom and sister cancelled their plans with me and really out of boredom and a morbid fascination with what my ex was up to, I called him back.\n\n\nWe met at a mall and he looked awful, like years of hard and fast living had really taken it's toll. We had a nice conversation for maybe 15 minutes and then he just started picking at me like we were dating again. He started accusing me of being distant and not appreciating small gestures he would do for me (like leaving meth roses on my car then expecting that would make me want to outdo porn stars in gratuitousness of sex acts). I must have regressed into my old self because instead of getting up and walking away I got defensive and we had an obnoxious fight right in the middle of the mall. Finally I had enough and told him flat out \"Brent, THIS, THIS is why you have problems. You asked for my help and you wound up screaming at me for things that happened 7 years ago! GET HELP!\" and I walked away. He followed me saying something like \"I've always loved you, please don't walk away, I need help. I think we can make it work.\" The last thing I said to him that I was married and wanted him to leave me alone. He kept following me so I went into a store and told the very, very (like literally awesome amazing I'd love to give a shout out and get them business but not sure if it's ok) women that I was being followed so the let me in their back room while they called security. I waited and apparently that scared him off because I didn't see him again. While I was waiting I just blocked his number because I was sure a barrage of texts and calls was coming. After maybe 30 minutes two security guys walked me to my car and I was so freaked out I went and got my husband lunch, and spent the rest of the day hanging out in the ER break room and then followed him home when he left so we arrived together. \n\n\nI just told him that I missed him and since my mom and sister cancelled I was lonely and wasn't sure else where to go. He was very happy to have me around even thought we didn't get to see each other much. \n\n\nPart of me feels really bad for not telling my husband what happened but I know that after his work weekend my drama needs to come in a distant second to his mental health. There were many things in this where I am the asshole and I guess I certainly feel like it for letting my boredom guide me into a making a bad choice to having a screaming match in the mall to not telling my husband what happened. \n\n\nWith all that, am I the asshole for any and all the above?\n",

He responded that he won't do it anymore. And that was a like because the next day my dog was barking outside, which he does not do normally so I checked and would you look at that his drone was just 2 meters above my dog, so I went and grabbed it, and returned it the owner telling him again to stop flying it close to my dog and warned him that I might break it if he continues, and well he continued for a few days now. I had a bad day once because of a argument and when I saw his drone over my dog again I grabbed it before he can move it and smashed it to the ground.

      "description": "throwaway account for safety.\n\nSo, my girlfriend and i are, i guess you could say, slightly starting to plan our wedding. we know for certain that we want to be married. but we're waiting until our lives are more settled to make it official (we both have new jobs and are currently house hunting, other stuff, etc.) and one of the topics that came up is who we would want as the bridesmaids and groomsmen, and she said maybe i should consider her brother. \n\ni flat out refused because he's terrible. he was spoiled and sheltered his entire life and is just a weirdo and wildly inappropriate in any social setting. at every single family event ive been to with him there, hes embarrassed himself and his family. at a fancy dinner once for my girlfriends graduation, he purposely spilled pasta sauce all over his shirt and laughed about it. at a quiet family get together, he took off his shirt and started rubbing his nipples and moaning, at another family event, he told his ten year old cousin what porn is and how to find it and then defended himself by saying he was joking. i culd go on for hours with these stories. as far as i know, he doesnt have any mental disabilities or anything like that, i work with developmentally disabled people as my career and this guy is just a piece of shit who wants attention.\n\n i told my girlfriend that i dont want that because hes embarrassing and i have close friends and family that i would want as my groomsmen instead. she was alright with that. but then i started thinking about him at my wedding and i realized that i really honestly just dont want him there. i talked to my best friend about this and he said it probably would be rude to just flat out not let him come, but if he started to act out, to kick him out. and that seemed like a fair compromise. i told this to my girlfriend and she had a shocked look on her face but when i was honest and explained myself, she (probably reluctantly) agreed. shes very non-confrontational though so im not sure if shes really okay with it. another thing i worry about is their mom. she treats the brother like hes a perfect angel and is the definition of entitled parent. so she might cause a scene if i throw him out. and i wont kick him out for making a bad joke or something. i mean something really bad like the nipple thing or something on that level. so would i be the asshole if i did that? thank you for your opinions",

      "description": " Alright, I just wanna preface this with something: I love both of my parents beyond what words can express. They have worked themselves to the bone to give me a future I can look forward to and to keep my comfortable and happy, and for that, they have my eternal respect.  \nBut that doesn't mean they're always right, or that they're perfect people.  \nIt's dad's behavior with my mother that scares me.  My mother has more health issues than you could put in an olympic pool. Anemia, cardiac arrhythmia, vertigo, to name a couple off the top of my head.  \nThe vertigo, I suspect, and my mother claims, was caused by my father. I don't know the science behind it, but apparently it's caused by some kind of crystals being knocked loose in the inner ear due to force. Force that my mother claims was my dad hitting her hard enough to knock her head into a closet. Honestly? I buy it. My father is, god bless his soul, not the most gentle of people, as much as I love him, and that's just something I can't deny. I'm certain that, at the very least, he has been physically abusive towards her, and often says horrible things about her in my presence.  \nMy mother is just beyond stressed out, and I do my best, but I am an unfortunately somewhat messy person. To my shame, I tend to add onto her load a lot, since she does all the house work due to culture mandating that the woman takes care of the house. I know my father does all of this, but, as much as I love him, I'm just too god damn terrified of him to stand up to him. I've tried intervening in fights before, but I just get yelled over. I should mention at this point that I'm a high school student, and still a minor, if it weren't obvious. My mom often brings up my dad's ire, since she needs exorbitant amounts of money. It's obviously not her fault, as they're for medication, groceries, and essentials like gasoline. She does her best, and God knows I love her to death for it. But that said, sometimes I just snap. Being the way she is, she's very demanding to take care of, and I do my best, but with the stress of school (I'm in the International Baccalaureate which involves a lot of work both inside of school and out), sometimes I just get so stressed out I snap. Nothing major, but I do occasionally say some rather mean or passive aggressive things to her, or storm off. I hardly say a word to my father, because, frankly, I am terrified of him. Again, he's never been truly abusive towards me in general, he just frankly terrifies me because of his temper, and, really, his size. I'm not at all a weak or small person, I rival him in size, and you could argue I'm quite a bit bigger, but there's this psychological switch in me that just turns on feelings of intense fear whenever I'm faced with confronting him. Much as I love my parents, sometimes I just want to get up and go, go far away, and leave them to their troubles.  \nAm I the asshole for feeling this way and not doing something? ",

      "description": "So, this happened a couple years ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began dating this guy. Things were magical at the beginning, but slowly things turned sour. Whenever he argued he'd threaten to kill himself if I left, told me I was a horrible partner, etc... There were about 5 instances where he physically harmed me but I stayed (not my best decision I will admit, but i've learned). Well he proposed to me after about 3 1/2 years and I said yes. He gives me a ring that he tells me is from the antique store (also tells me the price, $10). He also let me have a jacket of his (from our high school), a wig (we both cosplay, he got it on ebay for $20 if i'm right), and another sweater that was from some company his father used to work for (I think). Well after one night of him driving to me and my families home, drunk and banging on the door a bit to demand to see me (we had an argument because he cheated), I decided that I was done with this. I told him that we were done and I thought that was that. Well after a couple of weeks I start getting text messages from him. They're civil, just asking for the ring back and the wig. I had thrown the ring away before this and I had no intention of being near him ever again. I don't reply. A few more days pass, he texts me again. Still civil. He never gets out of line, just a little desperate  like \"Please, I seriously need the ring.\" I end up blocking his number and forgetting about him. \n\nHonestly, I feel he shouldn't get it back. He hurt me and he's an asshole, and I don't think $30-$40 worth of stuff he got at secondhand stores and ebay isn't worth the emotional/physical harm he put me though. Am I the asshole for not giving any of the stuff back? ",

For about a bit more than a week she added my bestfriend on facebook without laying anything (because I had told her about him) and they started talking, and then they both told me they really got along, I felt it pretty weird but I said it was cool. Anyway, now and then they both keep laying things about the other and I keep finding it really really weird, something like, if I don't have my space. I don't have many friends (and I like it that way), he's basically the only person I talk too and, I really don't know if it is okay that I feel this way, I would tell them what I feel but I'll feel pretty selfish then.  \n\n\n On one side, they both are free to do what they want, and also like two months ago his ex (they're still friends) added me and he told me he found it weird but he didn't care that much, his ex and I talked by message, but about irrelevant stuff and no more than five times (now she hates me and we don't know why, don't care though). And on the other side, she's like slowly interfiering in my group of friends and adds everyone she know's is my friend, somewhy, and it bugs me; again, I don't know if it's okay for me to feel that way. And really stupid yet real and strong insecurities pop up now and then, so I know there's shit I gotta get together. What do you think?  \n\n\nTL;DR: My (new) gf and my bestfriend are becoming really good friends, it bugs me a lot and I don't know if it's wrong, I feel selfish, AITA?  \n\n\nPs.

      "description": "My boyfriend (19m) and I (19f) are in a long distance relationship, and see each other for a weekend about twice a month - sometimes more, sometimes less. My boyfriends best friend (19m) - whom we met through - also lives in Melbourne. This is the weekend that we’re spending together, the first in over two weeks, and he will also be in Melbourne the following week due to a break in his university schedule. \n\nWe spent the entirety of Friday Night and Saturday with our friend. I offered at length to leave my boyfriend at his best friends house and I would pick him up later that night because we had planned to have a date night. He said no, and that he wanted to come home (because he thought staying there would upset me), and we left in the evening to come home. We were with the best friend for 24 hours. \n\nI assumed that we would then spend Sunday, being our last day together, alone because we had seen best friend both Friday, and Saturday, and had only truely been alone last night. However this morning, my boyfriend messaged best friend and asked what he was doing, and the best friend asked him if he wanted to stay the night - just he two of them. I reacted to this quite badly, and was truthfully genuinely upset because I felt like I hadn’t spent enough “alone” time with my boyfriend. His best friend, on the other hand, hasn’t seen him alone this week so obviously has a valid point in wanting to see him. My issue to this is that my boyfriend would leave on the Monday, and I would only have spent Saturday night alone with him. \n\nAdditionally, I have felt recently like this friend is in the middle of our relationship. My boyfriend disagrees, and says that this is a personal perception, and objectively there isn’t any reason why I should feel like he’s a third wheel. \n\nI wouldn’t have a problem with them organising a day/night to meet up and stay the night, my issue is that it was out of nowhere and not at all what I expected due to our distance and the length of time between seeing each other. \n\nMy boyfriend eventually decided to stay here because of my reaction, and the best friend thinks I’m dramatically overreacting and is trying to convince my boyfriend of this. Obviously this is upsetting but I guess in some regard valid. \n\n\nSo reddit - am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My grandad took me under his wing since I couldn't find a job, and said that he wanted to find what I was interested in.\n\nHe offered me a camera to take photos, and I was really interested so he changed ideas to instead make 3d models.\n\nHe encouraged me to take photos, then edit them, and I was really proud of how some of them came out. He also asked me to get a PC that could handle CAD design.\nI built a computer, it cost about £2300\nMy aunt came round at some point, saw the PC and instantly said \"That's powerful.\" She also said, at some point \"That's mine.\" I took it as a joke.\nSome time after this, my grandad got cancer.\n\nHe went on chemo, but passed away about 6 months later. In this time, my grandad moved in with my aunt, who also moved his computer \"so it wouldn't get stolen.\" On that computer I had photos I had taken, and edited.\n\nWell, I was sad. I started eating more, going over my limit, and started gaining weight. I went to my granddad one day in the hospital and he asked if I was still doing photography and I said not really, just haven't felt motivated to do it. He was disappointed, so I made an effort to go to a park near me and take some shots, but I wasn't really feeling it. He asked about my weight and I told him the truth. He told me I was a failure.\n\nMy granddad passed away, and I had a gut feeling that my aunt was going to take that computer. I was right, I called her up to talk and ask how she was and we talked. I had no intention to even ask about the computer, but she brought it up, and referred to it as her computer. During said call, she mention that my granddad had written a note that read Granddad:\"Do you really want my new computer.\" Aunt: \"Yes\" Granddad: \"OK\"\n\nShe also said that she would 'let' me keep the camera he gave me.\n\nI didn't believe this for a second, but also didn't want to say so because I wasn't totally sure. I never saw this note. She sent me a letter basically saying that she was sorry that I was upset, but to have some decency about what she was going through.I brought up something on the letter, about how she seemed to accept the computer without even a thought of me, and she backtracked and said \"Well of course I asked about you.\" she then went into a very condescending voice \"I'm sorry &lt;name&gt;, but your granddad was very disappointed in you when he passed.\"\nNow, I understand that I am not directly kin of my granddad and that I shouldn't have by law gotten the computer, but it felt like a slap in the face, because I was sad that my granddad was dying, and I felt betrayed, since a lot of my photos were taken when she took that machine, plus he made it clear to both my aunt and me that it was mine, before the cancer happened.\n\nAnd we are basically up to the current time-frame. I want an outside opinion because I might just be playing the victim card but to me it feels like I've been betrayed.\n",

I am one of the stronger flute players and usually take lead parts or solos. Lately, I’ve been struggling with maintaining my high grades so I could get the best possible chance to be accepted into university. I’ve been really stressed about it.\n\nI gave my band conductor a couple months notice that I am not going on the trip. I’m sacrificing too many days away from school and I feel like I will be overwhelmed from the stress. I also don’t want my parents to pay about $600 on a trip that I might not even enjoy.\n\nAfter explaining myself to my band mates, I’ve just been told to suck it up. They said that I shouldn’t have signed up for it then. Also, they really guilt me for not going.\n\nI’m stressed and unsure what to do. I need to hand in the check by Friday.

      "description": "Preface to this, I love my wife she’s a great mom. The best. However with a 6month old and just starting work she is either on drugs or extremely sleep deprived. \n\n\nIn the last day or two she has been acting so different (yelling at me over things that would never cause an issue much less make her yell) , constantly forgetting things (she lost her vape, phone, car keys and cigarettes multiple times times in an hour ) and she’s fallen asleep in the most random awkward positions ( on the toilet, middle of the floor, etc). Seeing her so exhausted made me call out of work so I could watch the kid and she could get a full nights rest. This is an extremely crucial time at my job and they need me, and I just asked for a raise which our family desperately needs. So to me it’s a big deal that I’m doing this ( I know she didn’t ask but I feel family is more important then a job). \n\nWhen I brought up that she was acting different and that she looked really out of it and I took off tomarrow so she could get some sleep, she really got upset and started yell shouting and hitting me. After fighting and yelling at me in front of our kid (something I NEVER do, and constantly ask her not too) she refused that she was tired. I backed off and let her feed him before he passed out for the night. I went into the next room so if our son woke up I could come before she awoke. \n\nWhen I left she was feeding him on the couch. After about 10 minutes I herd our kid screaming bloody murder. When I run into the room she’s asleep on the couch and our baby is on the floor. After tending to child I awoke her and very calmly told her that because of whatever is affecting her is now endangering our baby. \n\nShe then preceded to bring up every mistake I’ve ever made in our marriage. She refuses to go to sleep ( even though she has passed out on the toilet 2x in the last hour and on the floor).\n\nI love her but whatever is affecting her is now endangering our child. She had a pizza in the oven at the same time the child rolled out of her lap and onto the floor. Both of this issues are unacceptable to me. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I’m a teenage girl, that wanted to go to a birthday party of my cousin, same age. \nShe wanted me to help her out with her party preperations and usually because her house is close to my dad’s work. He can easily give me a ride or pick me up from there.\nSo I really wanted to ride along with my dad, because I had to lend a big helium tank for my cousin which means i had to bring it. \n\nMy dad however (who always was fine with bringing me) made a big deal out of it. He had to wake up “earlier” to bring me, because he already wakes up late. (My dad btw works as a private individual and owns the half of the place) \nso I just said he could wake up just a bit earlier, because it would just take 3 mins for him to bring me to her and go to work. My dad then said I was being egoistic and never was considerate of him. \n\nMy mom later joined the conversation and asked him how can he be a dad if he doesn’t even want to bring his child. \nMy dad kept saying we force him to do too much and didn’t chose this life and always jokes about leaving. Well that hurts you know. But my mom kept saying it was him that wanted a child. \nHis argument: he was young and the first child (my sister) he wanted himself, however the second child (me) wasn’t his choice. It felt as a stupid argument, because once you’re a dad you will always be a dad. Having multiple children doesn’t change the fact that you have responsibilities. \n\nSo after a while he then said: “okay, I’ll be leaving tomorrow at... “ but I was still infuriated by the fact he made a big deal out of it and said kinda ashole-y: “You know, I don’t want to sit in a car with such a person that doesn’t want to do the small things for his daughter” \nand walked away. So now I’m just going to take the public transport with a big helium tank.\n\nI feel like I was kinda rude to my dad. But I also think my dad needs to know that he should be more responsible of his children, because all my life I remember him as a passive parent, smoking and gambling all the time. And because of that I’m beginning to dislike my father. But I don’t want a bad relationship with him. \n\nTl;dl: Wanted to go to a birthday party close to my dad’s work. \nHad to bring a big tank that’s half my size. Father doesn’t want to bring me because he has to get up “earlier”. \nSaid: “why not wake up earlier”. \nProceeded calling me egoistic and later told me he didn’t want to have this life as dad. Then he invited me to ride after feeling forced. \nI answered that I didn’t want to sit in the car with that kind of a person that doesn’t love his daughter enough.\n\n",

      "description": "So, my sister pulled a prank on me as kind of a retaliation for a prank i pulled on her. I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?",

      "description": "So about 5 months ago, I started this AU for a fandom which led to a lot of self-inserts and fanfics that added other writers into the story. I've been really into it and it seems so have a few of the other writers. \n\nLast night I got an anon called Concerned who said \"dude I like your work but hasn't the self-insert stuff gone on long enough? it's been five months. I'm worried Ao3 might end up like Wattpad if we're not careful lol.\"\n\nI responded with something like \"it's an AU, what did you expect? or did you mean stuff like this?\" cuz it was a song-based thing where I create song parodies and put characters and writers in it. They responded with something. I don't remember, but it kinda shook me cuz I've been really into it and so have some of the others. \n\nI decided to delete the comment and disable anon commenting. A few minutes later, I got an anon comment on another fanfic of mine from someone named Nope that said \"how much longer is this fic? I was enjoying it but is seems so open-ended. Is there an official climax to this and how much longer till we get there because it's starting to feel repetitive. I really like your work but, I want to know where you're going with this and if I should stick around?\"\n\nBy this point, I had asked one or two of the other writers on this and one of them said it sounded like the same person from a month ago (I don't remember this, but I'll take her word for it). And Nope also sounded like Concerned. So I commented something along the lines of \"You have no obligation to stick around. These are MY stories, not yours.\"\n\nBut then I decided that if I kept the comment, it might escalate, so I decided to delete that comment and disable anon commenting right after that. \n\nLike I said, I talked to a few of them to see if it HAS gone too far; one of them said maybe to tag those stories in the future so they can filter it out if they don't wanna see it. They've also said that it's up to me.\n\nI know that it's likely not my fault, but I still feel kinda bad. So am I the asshole for telling the anon off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "It was my girlfriends birthday party today, which consisted of me, my girlfriend and 6 other friends. We decided to eat at a ramen restaurant, which is relatively cheap, around $6-$15 dollar meals. *(This will be important later)*\n\nDuring the planning phase, we decided to make two group chats, one that included my girlfriend and one without. So we could discuss gifts/plans etc. One friend brought up the idea of a small gift, the consensus was  a gift that everyone would have to pitch in $3-4 dollars for.\n\nNow, one of the friends in our group is notoriously cheap. She is in a complicated financial situation, she does have a full time job but doesn’t pay rent or bills since her boyfriend does all of that, so basically she just saves and spends on the “necessities.”\n\n*Here’s a segment of the convo from the chat:* \n\nFriend 1: So is $3-4 alright with everyone for a gift?\n\nCheap friend: No that’s too expensive for me, you guys can still buy it though.\n\nFriend 2: Its literally only $3 per person if we all split.\n\nCheap friend: Fine I’ll pay for a bit of it, but I’m not gonna chip in for anything else.\n\nMe: I can pay for your share no worries (cheap friend.)\n\nFriend 1: Okay I’m gonna go to the store to look for it.\n\nCheap friend: Make sure it’s CHEAP.\n\nFriend 1: Ok.\n\nWe all thought this was kinda rude because she does have some money to spare, and my girlfriend does a lot for her. Such as driving her to work for free, picking up groceries sometimes. She feels like she wasn’t gonna expect any gifts but the fact that she wouldn’t even throw in $3 upset her.\n\nI picked up the tab for myself and my girlfriend and two giant desserts for everyone to share. I told everyone to eat up. Our cheap friend picked up a fork then put it down and announced “I won’t be eating any because I don’t wanna pay.” We all were silent but it’s kinda annoying that she’s focused so much on the cost of everything.\n\nI feel bad that I told my girlfriend a secret conversation but I feel like since it was kinda crappy I should tell her anyway rather than wait for another friend to tell her way later on.\n\nAm I the asshole here Reddit?",

This didn't exactly calm me, but made my concerns stronger because of the frequency they talk to each other. \nThis week he was sick because of a heart issue and she wanted him to tell her how his test results are as soon as possible because \"she is curious what it could be\". \nHer reasons for being so faithful in this guy's honesty is on the one hand because he told her he just had gotten out of a bad relationship and doesn't want another girlfriend at the moment and an additional reason is that she doesn't have many friends and wanted to make some new in her new job. \nWhen we argumented she said that when I am allowed to have female friends why isn't she allowed to have some guys as friends. I then told her that she knows all of my friends and all of them are in a relationship, I on the other hand have never met her colleague. \nAt the end some facts: \nWe are together for 4 years \nWe moved in together a half year ago\n\nSo I want to know: AITA for wanting her to not have contact with this guy outside of work?",

She has been jobless for over a year now and Im baffled as to why she cant train it or take care of it.\n\nI dont think she is fit to have this dog and I think the dog would have a better life in another home, I just can't bare watching nobody care for it anymore and waking up and coming home to warm piss and shit.\n\n  \nWIBTA if I told her she should get rid of it or at least take it with her to her BF's?",

While at school we would hang out all the time and we always knew what was going on in each others lives, and both told each other we would always be close friends. \n\nHowever after graduating we both moved away and now live on opposite sides of the country. At first we maintained video chatting and texting to keep up with each other, but after a while they would always say they were busy when I asked to talk. I totally understand being busy from time to time and I don’t need to be their number one priority, but they would never reach out to say they were free so I was alway me asking to talk and getting turned down. (It has been at least 2 months since we last Skyped)\n\nI then messaged them saying that if they didn’t want to talk anymore to let me know so I would stop bothering them, and they said that they still wanted to keep talking but just had be busy but should have more time now. After a few weeks though nothing has changed, I ask to Skype they say they are busy but might be free later and then I hear nothing. They also never reach out to talk, it’s always me instigating\n\nAlso most times I text them I either get no response or an answer days later saying that they are sorry but didn’t see my text. The only time they send me anything is when they are drunk saying that they miss me but don’t answer my responses. \n\nI really don’t want to give up on this friendship but I’m living in a new place and know nobody so it takes effort to keep in touch with all my old friends and I don’t want to put a ton of time into someone who doesn’t seem to care especially after I already asked them about it. \n\nWIBTA for giving up on reaching out to a friend who doesn’t seem to want to put in the effort on their end?\n\nI apologize if some of this is poorly worded, I am writing it after having a few drinks",

I've been ignoring these calls for over a year because the last time i donated blood I fainted and felt like I had very little energy for the next few days, but apparently I'm type AB- which the caller told me is .05% of all blood types and its plasma is in urgent demand.   \n\nI'm torn because on the one hand the caller made it sound like people die because first respondents don't have enough of this plasma but on the other hand I'm working part time while attending school full time.  I'm not particularly healthy to begin with, (benzo addiction but that's a whole different story) and I'm afraid If I donate again I'll have another bad reaction which could seriously mess up my work and education.  \n\nI just accidentally answered a call from them and after learning how in demand my plasma is, agreed they could call me back later today to see if I could arrange a ride to one of their facilities.  I also don't currently own a car so I would need to find a ride there and back.  Currently I'm thinking of explaining I can't get a ride and go on to ignoring their calls but the thought that I could literally save a life is haunting me AITA?\n\n  ",

      "description": "This happened a long while ago but I’ve never been able to work out if it was me being out of order or not, so would love some opinions.\n\nAt the time myself and two friends (A and P) were living in a shared house. About 2-3 months after we all moved in P began a LDR with a uni student (H) who lived about 2 hours drive away; P didn’t have a car so A or myself would often drive them up to see H on the weekends. About a month into the relationship, H announced that they were dropping out of university and moving to our town. P asked if it was okay if they stayed with us temporarily while they looked for a job here and both A and I said that was fine. Over the next 3 months H was offered a couple of different jobs in the area but kept turning them down for various reasons; pay wasn’t good enough, job was boring, job involved travelling by bus or train to one of the surrounding towns, etc. Eventually they stopped applying for jobs altogether and started living off of money given to them by P or sent to them by their parents. They never contributed any of this money towards rent/bills, and P had started working extra hours at their job so they had enough money to support both of them. This meant that P was out of the house for 12-14 hours 5/6 days per week; during this time, H would stay in the house watching TV or listening to music alone.\n\nWhen it got to the point that they had been staying with us for about 6 months, I initiated a conversation with P about it, basically saying “so what’s happening with H, are they looking for a place to live or work?” P kept brushing it off saying that “yeah, they are, it’s just taking a bit of time” and avoiding the conversation. Around this same time, P started complaining a lot about mess around the house; nothing major, just dishes being left in the sink occasionally, communal floors not being hoovered regularly, etc - I got the impression that it was actually H that was complaining about this since P was never a particularly tidy person and both A and I were generally quite neat, and none of us had ever had any problems with each other’s cleanliness before. A’s response to this was to just stay out of the house even more, basically only coming home to shower and sleep between work, staying with family and friends every weekend, etc. I didn’t have that option as my own family/SO all lived much further away and I worked more random hours, so I just started keeping to my room more often, making a point of never leaving anything out in communal areas, etc.\n\nAfter another few months, I was starting to get really pissed off about it. Our electric/heating bills had gone up a lot (probably because there was a 4th person staying in the house literally 24/7) and the general vibe in the house was getting really uncomfortable. H never really spoke to any of us, P was constantly stressed about money and was spending all their time either working, hanging out with H, or complaining at A and me that the house was messy - even though at this point H was the only one spending any substantial time in the house. Additionally, things were getting awkward with our landlord because he had been very firm that any extra people moving in had to be cleared with him, but H was always in the house whenever he came by to check things.\n\nI ended up losing my temper when P tried to talk about the mess, and basically said “you asked us if H could stay temporarily while they found a job, they’ve been here for 9 months now and still haven’t done that, when are they gonna go?” I did say that I wouldn’t mind it as much if they contributed to rent/bills but I didn’t want to push that too much as I knew it would just end up being P who had to pay that, and even though it was because of them that H was here I knew they would really mess themselves up financially trying to pay two people’s share. That conversation basically ended the friendship between P and me; they were furious that I was apparently being unsupportive of their relationship, and I was furious that they had effectively moved in their partner permanently without actually discussing it with us or our landlord. It also made things tense between A and I; they made a big deal of staying out of this argument and there ended up being a bit of resentment from me that they didn’t back me up (I know that they were also frustrated with the H situation) and resentment from them that my outburst had made the living situation even more uncomfortable than it already was.\n\nThe impression I got was that H was a waste of space and was somewhat using P; they could have gotten a job like they’d originally planned, but since P was so eager to provide for them they just didn’t bother, and they didn’t really care about the fact that two other human beings were also stuck paying for their share of electricity/heating. I think I might have been an asshole causing a fight about it but by that point I was so sick of feeling like I was walking on eggshells in my own house, especially when I was being made to feel that way by someone who was staying rent-free over a period of time that none of us agreed to, and putting us in danger of getting in trouble with our landlord because of it.",

      "description": "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",

We take the game super seriously and the matches can get pretty intense. Sometimes we do some annoying strategies to get an advantage. Whenever someone does this it usually ends in an argument. Today I did a pretty annoying strategy. I played as Yoshi and put my opponets in a egg and sent them off the stage. They have to button mash to get out and most of the time ends in death. I did this twice in the match and got berated and yelled at by my friends. I told them I just saw the opportunity and took it. They said that it was ruining their fun and I should stop. I took their advice and stopped. What annoys me is that they do similar annoying tactics and defend themselves by saying they were memeing. I think they're being hypocritical. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I (21/F) met this guy on tinder recently and we hit it off. He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.",

I felt like I was in the right and I still do, but I had nobody in the car and asking friends or family will just get my sympathy and not a real answer. A few days ago I was driving on the highway at about 65-70 MPH in the far left lane. In about a half mile I had to exit, so I signal to move to the right so I can prepare for that. There's someone directly in front of me with an open space to my right and ahead of that space, another car. There's also a car slightly further back from that space. I've been signalling for a few seconds and the space is still clear. The car in front of my soon-to-be position is not braking and has nobody in front of him for a good while, so I feel safe getting behind him since I would only be there for a few moments before moving right again to my exit lane. I begin the turn, and as I start to leave my lane - blinker still on - someone I will refer to as \"the guy\" who was behind that space starts driving forward into the spot I would soon occupy and had been signalling to enter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep moving into this spot because I'm not about to pull back into my lane, get boxed in, and miss my exit. I was signalling, I had plenty of room to maneuver into that space, and not only did he practically stand on the horn when I did this, he continued to drive forward almost to BLOCK me from getting into that spot. Technically, I believe he DID have right of way, but for what purpose? He'd just be tailgating the guy in front of him and blocking me from leaving. I'd have to slow down significantly to get behind him and start moving over, which slows down everyone else in my lane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of it, he moved to the right, letting me in, and sped off. So, am I the asshole here? The only thing I may have done wrong in my mind is not having enough space between myself and the car in front of me when I moved over, but I preferred that over not giving the person behind me space: I knew the guy in front of me had nobody in front of him and wouldn't have much of a reason to stomp the brakes, I was paying close attention, and I didn't even plan on being in that lane for more than a couple seconds before moving right again. Also: what's your opinion on people who pass on the right, blocking others from getting to exits? I've always thought that if you want to pass someone, do it on the left so that they're not being blocked from moving over towards the most common side of the road for exits.",

      "description": " TLDR at the end.\n\nSo, I'm moving across the country in September and, because I'm really excited about going there/hate where I live now, I've decided to go to that location this summer for a month, as a vacation. I want to become acquainted with the city and just have a good time before living there for real with actual responsibilities. \n\n Okay, so, when I was first deciding to go there in the summer, I invited my best friend to come with me. At the time, I thought \"Why not? We will definitely have fun and we can spend some time together and make memories before I go in September, as I likely won't see her again until Christmas.\" \n\n She agreed to come along, not for the whole month, but for about two to three weeks in the middle. She's expressed excitement to come (admittedly, I've talked it up a whole heck of a lot). She will be staying here in our city indefinitely as she likes it here, but she's down to come just as a fun vacation.\n\n The thing is, I feel differently now. It's not that I don't like her anymore or want to go with someone else. It's that I want to go *alone.* I started on meds to treat my mental health issues a couple of months ago, and now I'm much more socially relaxed and have a more stable sense of self. I'll admit that a small part of my reasoning for inviting her was to ease my fear of being completely by myself over there and having to socialize on my own. But, now that that fear is gone, I don't just want to do exactly that, it's actually the most exciting aspect of the trip: exploring this new place on my ones and meeting new people, discovering myself, relearning how to make friends, challenging myself to be social, managing myself while being on my own, etc... If anything, her presence will be a hindrance on those very things. \n\n For a bit more information: She will be going on a trip with another friend for a full month to another country, about a month or two before our trip, so it's not like she won't have a vacation at all if she doesn't come with me. Also, we have not bought tickets/airbnb yet, so there's still time to back out without any (monetary) repercussions. We've been best friends for almost 8 years, she's like a sister to me. She's seen me through a lot of shit and, while we're fundamentally pretty different (I'm more of an artsy, dreamer, neurotic type), she's seriously the best friend I could ask for and I don't want to be a selfish asshole to her. Also, we're both 19 and will be 20 in the summer, if that's pertinent. \n\nTL;DR - I invited my best friend to come along with me on a summer vacation. I feel differently now and would rather go alone. There's time to tell her and have her back out, but it feels like an asshole thing to do after hyping this trip up so much.\n\n I'm not even really on the fence. I'd still have fun if she came, but I know that I want to go by myself. I feel like a shit friend and an idiot. I really shot myself in the foot when i invited her in the first place. WIBTA if I uninvited her?",

      "description": "Hey there, first time poster here! Sorry in case the formatting is bad, I'm on mobile rn.\n\nNow this requires a bit of background context:\n\nI used to have a lot of contact with my grandparents. We don't live far away from each other so my two little brothers and I used to go to them every day after school (I don't anymore, they still do and I don't mind) so we ate lunch there. My mother always pays them every month so we're basically not leeching out my grandpa's money and effort.\n\n\nNow to the actual incident (which was about 4 to 6 months ago):\n\nDue to a lot of stupid complications I had to drop out of my apprenticeship and thus have to look for a new one. I had the idea to look for some small jobs to gain first work experiences (my apprenticeship was entirely in a school setting, thus I didn't have much if any work experience) and with that there had to be a lot of paperwork done because Germany. I did as well as I could without much hesitation. \n\nSo one day I was heading to town to try and gather some documents, but didn't get because appearantly I was at the wrong department or something about that. Anyway, I decided to try again the next day and headed to my grandparents' home. I told them about what happened and out of nowhere, my grandmother starts yelling at me about how idiotic what I'm doing is, for, well, not making a phone call instead. \n\nAs you maybe can tell already, I just had no words. I started debating it by how it's just my way of doing things and how it wouldn't have made that much of a difference and in the end I could just have been speaking to a wall and expect the same outcome of it. So I just decided \"no.\" and went tf outta there and haven't come back since.\n\nTo provide a little extra info I'll give some reasons why and why not I could be TA:\n\nReasons why I could be TA:\n-I never was the best student or most productive person, I always come off as lazy to them (which I am, but not to an extent where I'd flat out deny common sense). I managed to turn up my motivation but it was too late for them to notice.\n(There are multiple follow-up reasons, but I won't list them unless needed)\n\nReasons why I could be NTA:\n-I appreciate the support they attempted to provide to me, but their approach to it was rather harming than helping me. It could have worked if I wasn't me.\n-Due to that, especially my grandpa has become more and more condescending to me, which ain't really helpful either. (I sit at the PC a lot of the time, so all they see is me hitting some buttons on the keyboard and mouse, while in fact there is way more to me than that. Therefore I'm looked at as a disappointment by now, I guess [I have slight, but clearly noticable traits of Asperger's which is a form of autism so I didn't have much of a social life either])\n-Not making a phone call, really? I mean, COME ON! I'M WASTING MY TIME, NOT YOURS (rather a rant than a reason but count it if you wanna)\n\nSo, AITA? You be the judge",

      "description": "To first five some background, my gf who was also my finance at the time broke up with me right before Christmas.  We've lived together for the past 5 years and are still living together since it's only been about 3 weeks since the breakup. About a week after she broke up with me she posted on Facebook that she was single and had a number of guys comment and reach out to her. She met up with one of those guys who was an old friend and has started seeing him and they've already slept together. I don't really have feelings of jealousy at this point. I understand the relationship is over and we weren't right for each other. In other words, I'm not hoping for a reconciliation or that she will take me back. I just want to move on. What has been bothering me is that we still live together and she is currently unable to move out because she doesn't have any money and she really doesn't have anywhere else to go. I pay the rent and the apartment is in my name. She helps out with the bills. Ok, that's fine, I'm not some monster whose going to tell her to pack up and leave the next day in the middle of Winter. I've given her some time to get her financial situation straightened out and move out. But I'm human, even though I said I'm not jealous, it still bothers me that she posted this on FB and started sleeping with this guy while we are still living together, and she is unable to support herself. I still have to be in the same house as her while she is texting him or while she's getting ready to go see him. I do have to say, she's been really sweet to me through all this and we are on pretty good terms. She'll even try to come over and cuddle me at night. Sometimes I'm ok with this, other times I tell her to go away, because I don't want her touching me, because it just messes with my head. But the thing is, I'm just walking around all agitated and little things that she does have been bothering me even more lately. This morning, I told her how I felt, and I wasn't very nice about it. I basically said that I felt disrespected that she started sleeping with another guy a week after breaking up with me, knowing that she is still living in MY HOUSE, and is unable to leave for the moment. She started crying about how I was making things harder for her and that's she's been sweet to me, which is true, and that I'm being an asshole for reminding her that it's my house and that I don't want her there anymore. Jeez, reading this back, I feel like it should be in reddit/r/niceguys or something. But then part of me is thinking I'm being an asshole for being an asshole to her about this since I did give her time to move out and I have reminded her more than once that I don't want her in my house any longer. I just feel like my life is on hold. She can just go to this new guy's house and sleep with him, but I have to wait until she moves out to start my life. ",

      "description": " Married for 2 years. My wife has struggled with anorexia in her past and only started getting better after I started cooking for her (when we were still friends). Over the time progress was made, she was back to a healthy weight, started cooking for herself again, and developed healthy eating habits. While she got over her anorexia however I started eating more and more, I wouldn't say it's an eating disorder more unhealthy eating habits. Anyways what prompted me to do something was that I learned that I'm technically obese now (!!!! I used to be so fit wtf happened) so I signed up for a gym and restricted my diet... to literally nothing. I read up on water fasting and decided on going 5 days with no calorie intake, and the weekends off where I'd eat keto. I've done this before I met her so I'm not going in inexperienced. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I brought this up with a friend and he said it would trigger my wife's anorexia and make her relapse into her old habits. I think it's worth mentioning that she occasionally (once every month or two) refuses to eat anything and I have to coax her and tell her she's beautiful etc. I'm worried that if she sees me going on hunger strike she'll feel compelled to do the same and as I lose weight she'll have more reason to relapse. I do think I'm going to go through with it because I do want to lose weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n (As a side note in case you're wondering why I'm going nuclear and jumping into such a restrictive diet, I've tried normal diets before and I can't really stop myself.

At the 4th week, if there are no objections we allow them to make their own original character and join anew. This is so we can vet new people because unfortunately, you tend to run into a lot of weirdos in the nerd community.\n\nAbout halfway through the encounter, Steve starts getting bored. He fidgets a lot, squirms in his seat, starts toying with stuff on my desk, etc. \n\nHe gets up, wanders behind me (a big no-no in DnD), takes my guitar down and starts playing it. I turn to him, a bit confused and ask, \"Yo, what are you doing? Put that up and go sit down. What the hell man?\"\n\nHe puts the guitar away and sheepishly makes it make to his seat. The rest of the night was uneventful, so I texted him this morning. \n\n\"I should mention something before it becomes a problem. I don't mind folks standing up and stretching their legs when it's not their turn. I'd rather you stay focused and strategize, but I understand if you need to move around. But, please don't come into view of my screen, and especially don't start touching my stuff or playing my guitar. I'm not sure what gave you the idea that was ok, but it was definitely not. The guitar is a gift from my wife and it isn't for others to play.\n\nI'm not upset with you, I understand most people who own a guitar expect that people will try to play it. I wish you'd asked first, but it's not like you broke it or anything, so I'm just saying this as a caution. But during a combat encounter, playing the guitar is just... an odd choice for your time, I think.\"\n\nSTEVE \"you should probably detune it if it isn't for playing. Takes pressure off the truss rod and keeps it from bending the fret board\"\n\nAt this point, I've gone from annoyed but willing to talk it out, to somewhat miffed. Like what the fuck dude? Someone tells you to not touch their stuff and you say \"well don't make it inviting if you don't want someone touching it?\"\n\nMe \"It's fine the way it is. I play it. Not you.\"\n\nSTEVE \"You're belaboring the point. I understood last night.\" \n\nME \"And yet. You haven't apologized\"\n\nI showed this to Lisa and Robert, both of whom I trust completely with these sorts of things. Where Lisa at first was like \"Maybe he's just lonely and has a hard time in social situations? Remember that Kurtzgezat video on loneliness? He mentioned he doesn't have any friends,\" Robert said, \"You should have just let it go, dude.\"\n\nThe rest of the conversation with Steve were along the lines of how me asking him to apologize is \"demanding he prostrate himself\" to me, or that telling him to stay out from behind the DM screen is me accusing him of cheating.\n\nSo now I feel like an asshole. I don't think it's unfair of me to set clear boundaries for guests in my house, and certainly don't think simply talking about that is \"belaboring the point.\" ",

      "description": "Some background, so I'm Filipino and live in the US and I travel to the Philippines pretty frequently, I usually go 2-3x a year. It's kind of tradition that when someone comes home to the Philippines we bring back presents for our family in the Philippines and also bring back presents when I go back to the US. When I first started to going to the Philippines, I was pretty open with allowing family members to give me a package to take with me to the Philippines since the airline allowance allows me to bring two 50lbs boxes. I usually stuff this full with presents. Every time I've gone back to the Philippines I have a certain uncle that pretty much has taken advantage of this since he always has something to give me to give to someone else in the Philippines and when I go back to the US he would also have a package for him. On my last trip I was given a package for him that included a very expensive ring because he was planning to propose to his GF with it and a Rolex watch. I was very uncomfortable with taking these items home because of the large value of them items and I was worried since the responsibility falls on me if something were to happen. I kept refusing that I didn't want to take it but my aunts ( his sisters ) kept saying it was fine for me to take. So I felt pressured to do so and I did it. I am now going on another trip back to the Philippines and this time I was told he has a package for me that will include a ring and a watch. This was the only thing I was told. What bothers me is that he does not ask me directly that he will be giving me these items, he only informs my dad (his brother) that he is giving me these items. Also, when I am packing my stuff home to go back to the US, I will find out from my aunt that they have items for him and this should be added to my luggage. Mind you on my last trip they told me literally hours before my flight back to the US that I was bringing some things back for him and so I told my aunts since they wanted to add his stuff in it, it is now their responsibility to repack my stuff and seal the boxes. In his defense, he does pick me up from the airport and take me home since the airport is 2 hrs away. I like my uncles and he's a very nice guy but at this point I would rather take the train and the bus home from the airport which extends the trip from the airport to 4hrs. My experience with him is making want to refuse all my family member from asking me to take stuff for them.\n\nTL;DR-At the start I was open with everyone asking me to take packages with me to the Philippines but my uncle has taken advantage of this and I'm now refusing his request. \n\nPS I've been a long time lurker on Reddit and this is my very first post. Hopefully I did it correctly ! ",

      "description": "Hi all, long time lurker. First time posting :) \n\nI want to know if AITA for getting upset with my partner for sleeping in every weekend, while I get up to care for our daughter. \n\nWe both work full time on different schedules. I usually leave for work 6.30AM before the household wakes up. My partner gets our daughter ready for childcare every morning and drops her off before heading to work. \n\nGenerally I will finish work before him, he’s a PT so his schedule varies. We alternate days collecting her and bringing her home. On a slow day for him he will still sleep in until about 8.30-9AM during the week. \n\nEvery weekend it is expected that I will get up with our daughter and play with her downstairs. While he gets to sleep in until 10-11AM. \n\nHis reasoning is ‘I get up with her every morning and get her ready’. So he’s entitled to sleep in every weekend. \n\nI’m upset because this means I never get a sleep in. I’m up at 5.30AM weekdays and 7AM at the latest on weekends. \n\nAITA for making creating an argument over this? Yes he does a lot for her during the week, but I also work full time and would appreciate a sleep in too. It seems unfair. Or am I being unappreciative of his ‘early rises’ during the week. \n\nI say ‘early rises’ because his idea of getting up with her in the mornings. Is feeding her breakfast and putting on a movie while he goes back to sleep.\n\n",

      "description": "Ok, so I took a motorcycle rider's course a few weeks ago so that I could get my license. In this class was a girl I thought was beautiful and I took my chances to talk to her. Much to my surprise and happiness, she liked me! As of a few days ago we are officially dating and I couldn't be happier. Then it became the source of an argument...\n                 \n                  \nMy friend (Let's call him Shawn) for the past month had been obsessing over this girl he had in a mini-semester class at community but never said anything more about her besides \"She has dark hair\", \"She's super cool\", and \"I like her a lot\". So I knew nothing about this girl who he had been going on and on about. By his description she could have been just about anybody!\n                \n                   \nWell, I went to hang out with Shawn and my dudes last night and was excited to tell the guys the news that I found a girlfriend. I showed them her picture and they all told me congrats and how I found me a pretty one. But Shawn got quiet for a bit then upset and started saying how I stole the girl he was interested in, that I must have sought her out by his description, and that he couldn't believe I'd do that to him.\n                    \n                 \nI could really only say \"wow, what are the chances\" and that I was sympathetic and likely wouldn't have pursued her if i knew she was the one he was interested in. He followed this up by saying we needed to break it off because it wasn't right. To which I honestly laughed and told him he was crazy and there was no chance of me doing that.\n                  \n               \nI found a small bit of humor in the chances of this happening and gave a small chuckle and, well, this set him off into a verbal rage and him calling me an asshole (which made me think of you guys here lol). After a bit, and a comment about how he was going to message her, I cut him off and told him he was crossing a line by now actively becoming a threat to my new relationship. I apologized at the unfortunate absurdity of the situation we were in but if he was going to be this way that I wouldn't have a choice but to put distance between us. He didn't back down so I told my group I was leaving so Shawn could get his head straight.\n                  \n                  \nAm I really an asshole for not breaking up with my new girlfriend? Or was I an asshole with how I handled that? \n                       \nOr am I just now an asshole for my clickbait title? Lol",

      "description": "I created a throwaway for this, but it’s been something that’s been bugging me for a while. \n\nA few months ago I moved into a new apartment, and since day one there is a small child who lives a few floors below me who screams non stop. All day. All night. There hasn’t been a single day where this child does not scream. To me it’s not your typical toddler temper tantrum or something playful, it’s a horrendous screaming and crying that sometimes lasts for an hour. \n\nMany people in my apartment building have complained, myself included. Police have been called, city council has been called, even social services(all from other people not me). Nothing has come out of this. When the parents were approached they refused to admit anything was wrong and won’t take steps to improve the situation. The neighbour who lives directly above them is struggling the most with this and the other night he lost his shit and was yelling through the walls, slamming doors and banging on the floor. I’m also nervous he’ll act out and do something stupid to this family if things go unresolved. \n\nThere’s a rumour that the child has developmental issues and that’s why it screams, but I can’t help feel something worse is happening. As it stands, people are working with the landlord to try and get this family evicted from the apartment since there have been so many complaints about the noise. Part of me feels horrible inside for kicking out a family that might be struggling, but I feel even more horrible for standing by listening to this child scream all day and night and not doing anything when it might be getting neglected or abused. \n\nMy biggest dilemma is causing more problems for this family than they already BUT ONLY IF they’re not neglecting the child. I’m sure it’s hard enough handling a child that screams all day, getting evicted and having child services on your ass would be even worse. \n\nSo would I be the asshole for calling child services? It’s been ripping me apart and Im mostly concerned about the welfare of the child as I’m sure spending all day screaming and crying would be miserable. ",

My best friend is planning to attend.\n\nIn the past she has embarrassed me before on three occasions wearing a black skirt and knee socks combo that in my opinion is too short for how she carries herself; you can see her bum if she bends over the wrong way etc. I hate to feel like a slut shamer or to be policing what women wear but it is personally not something I would ever wear as I feel it is too revealing (ironic as I work a side job that involves nudity/little to no clothing). \n\nWould I be a dick if I ask her what she's planning on wearing? Obviously it'll likely be black which is why I'm worried this too-short-skirt (again, imo) might make an appearance. It would make me feel anxious because I know for sure my mom and sister would be judging her for it (they are a lot more conservative than I am) and I'm worried I'd be focusing on that and getting anxious about it rather than being present at my dad's ceremony.\n\ntl;dr: WIBTA if I ask my friend what she plans on wearing to my dad's inurnment because I'm afraid she might wear a skirt I consider too short?",

To be clear, I never ask or asked for anything. He knew I did not come from money or had much of it. When i finished my degree ( he had been working since 16, we are now 23), he found a house in his country and asked me to move in with him. Fron the beggining I told him I could not afford a house, I could not afford most things to live with him. So he wanted to pay for everything,(  I still bought groceries and everything I could with my budget ). When I told him I did not have money he said :\" I do not want you to worry about money, I am here, what is mine is yours, you do not have to worry at all\" since he alone could afford it (I do though want a job and pay for as much or more than he has). So I moved countries to his hometown ( it was a good thing since this country had good opportunities in my area of studies ). Now its been 4 months, I have been looking for a job and for 1 month I was working as a sales assistant. The job was horrible and after a month I couls not do it anymore, I had his support, he incentivated me to quit it since he could see it was not good for me.  All the time I was not working he would come home and we would argue. This are some of the things he would say : \" I go to work for you,I get the money so you can sit at home all day\". If something broke and he came home and tried to fix it he would shout at me : \" I go to work to get koney to pay for your shit and you are at home breaking stuff so I can fix it?\". Getting a job in my area is extremely hard, and I am trying ( I have another job interview this week). Is he right? Should I try harder or so somehing different? Or is it just stress and he need understanding? Or should he not be saying this things.",

I tried to say that this study was making big claims and without reading it and seeing how the researchers addressed external factors and formed their focus groups the whole thing sounded, well, bullshitty.\n\nWhat followed were the weirdly most intense 15 of arguing in my time at this work place. My coworkers were really upset that I was trying to “discredit the scientists” and stated that this study could have big implications to the scientific world and that I didn’t known that it was bullshit! So I shouldn’t say that!\n\nAt that point I decided to shut up because what I genuinely thought was an innocuous discussion on an article about small dicks had gotten really heated and one of coworkers looked really red in the face SO MY QUESTION IS: Am I the asshole for saying this study was bullshit?\n\nI know from a life of being me that I can sound quite brash at times but I’ve been really trying to hold that back for the past year and I thought?

      "description": "So, I am currently in need of a car but do not have enough money to afford one. My mum has offered to buy a car for me under the condition that I pay her back the money over however long it takes me to get the money. \n\n\nNow, I don't want to have to owe her a ton of money, and as such I have been trying to find a cheap car that I can pay off in a reasonable amount of time. My boyfriend has been helping me to find a good car for the past couple of months and recently came across one he deemed to be safe, reliable, and reasonably priced ($3500). The only issue was that the car was about a 4 hour drive away, so going to inspect it would require a day trip. However, my boyfriend and his father offered to travel to inspect the car with me, so it wouldn't have been an issue.\n\n\nI showed my mum the car and she very much did not like it. She thought it would be a lemon because of how cheap it was. I told her that my boyfriend and his father offered to go look at the car with me, and she told me that even if they did and determined that it was not a lemon, she would not let me buy the car. Instead, she wanted me to wait a few months for an older relative of mine to sell their car to me, which would be at least $7000. \n\nI do not want to have to pay that much for a car, and I told her this, but she claims that since she is the one paying for the car it should be her decision. I disagree with this; since I am the one who will have to pay her back for the car eventually, and I will be the one who has to drive it, I should therefore be the one who decides what car I want to get.

      "title": "AITA for moving out of my in-laws' without my husband?",
      "description": "Obligatory background information and sorry for the chaos- my husband and I have been staying with his parents for about 6 months while we finish up building our home. We plan on selling it once it's done anyway because our plans in life have changed. I can literally not stand it there anymore, not because my in-laws are hugely awful but they really aren't people people. Also living in this house, albeit in a separate apartment with a separate entrance are my brother and sister-in-law. Everything started a few months ago, when my brother-in-law busted into where we live, I was alone, and berating me for living in his house, then leaving. This lead me to tell my husband, who tole his mom, who talked to his brother, who yelled at her...and nothing was resolved, and honestly, I didn't really need it to be. This happened a couple of more times, also some arguments between my husband and mother-in-law about trivial stuff, but these things make kind of a heavy environment to be in. Add to it the fact that my father-in-law cooks massive amounts of food that neither I nor my husband want to eat, and gets upset when we don't eat it, and will literally force stuff onto our plates when given the chance. He also gets upset when we do our own grocery shopping or go out to eat. This forces conflicts between my husband and father-in-law that I'm again, kind of stuck in the middle of, because I complain to my husband about the force feeding, he takes it personally and acts out to his father. \nFIL is also super frugal so we have to do things like sit in the dark, not flush the toilet each time and shower at the gym so we save water and electricity. This is super annoying.\nThis final straw though came yesterday, when after a conflict involving some sand leftover in the entryway that wasn't cleaned up (because I wasn't aware of it, I had the flu and no reason to leave the house), FIL called me down and told me to explain how the sand got there if it wasn't there when he left for work, I said it was probably from my husband's shoes and just cleaned it up but told my husband after. My husband goes on a rant to his father about all the stuff I listed above and then my mother-in-law inserts herself and calls me down to apologize or whatever and I'm like dying from flu muscle pain and not wanting to move. So I don't and she's just yelling away about how she's sorry about nothing and it's not like I cared. So today I went down to my FIL to apologize for being sick and not talking and for my husband. He starts telling me how normal people wipe their shoes and yadda yadda and how he'll never ask me about a meal again and basically just very poignontly telling me the things that bother me shouldn't and that he takes it personally. And I was like yup, that's a no for me dog, so I packed up some of my stuff and drove to an empty apartment we keep about an 1,5h away. Without my husband. He is super upset and we don't really know what to do now because he works near the in-laws' so he can't really move here with me...the whole point of us living their in the first place.\n\ntl;dr- moved out of my in-laws' without my husband because of tons of conflict in their household that spilled over. He is upset. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for contacting old customers in hopes to bring them to my new place of employment?",
      "description": "So, to be clear the old employer I worked for did not make me sign a Non-disclosure or non compete.\n\n5-6 years ago I started working for a ma and Pa welding supplies shop with only background in automotive/concrete pumps.I was to fix the welding equipment.\n\nThe company needed to have a certified tech to maintain their \"premium\" distributor status which means the get great discounts. I was sent to the first of two certification classes within 2 weeks of starting, I passed the first test after cramming, got back &amp; spent the next 3 months being trained by the guy who was currently in retirement. I go to the second class, pass &amp; get fully certified &amp; begin my career.\n\nThe owner retired the year I was hired, in hopes of leaving his company for his son whom was currently the store manager.That left his son, the top employee &amp; the accountant all tied for heirarchy &amp; they all wanted things differently. I steer clear of any political BS because it didn't matter to me. I was there to learn a dying trade &amp; learn it well.\n\nHere is where the biggest pile of shit hit the fan. That poor poor fan..\n\nThe owners son, who was 6 months away from inheriting the company was found to have been stealing from the company for YEARS, like tens of thousands of dollars... He was subsequently fired and his dad became even more checked out &amp; left the accountant to be the general manager. Well fast forward a few years, I made a dying repair shop into a bustling repair business,with 40-60 machines in at all times in que, sent out Excel spreadsheet reports on the current status, expanded the repair shop from being a warranty center for 1 brand to all 3 major brands.\n\nI had out grown that shop, and that they wanted to keep me at a certain level of capability that met their needs without taking into consideration that I have 40 years left in the industry.\n\nQuickly management got worse and worse so I left this last October for a bigger company that called me at my place of work in the hopes of hiring me. The straw that broke the camel's back was the GM shutting down certain options we gave customers for repair against my will, after that I went to places I knew I could walk on to and said I was on the market. That was when this bigger company hit me up out of the blue by pure coincidence.\n\nTo wrap this up that bigger company is taking great care of me, letting me train on the high end equipment I dreamed of working on and like I said, this tradeskill is a dying trade. I'm now using my abilities and natural prowess with this type of work to give previous customers an alternative outlet for repair on welding equipment, both normal and specialty (CNC, automated sub arc, high end plasmas etc) but with the understanding that if they choose to utilize my skills I want them to bring over gas and hardgoods business, essentially taking customers from my old employer but making it 100% up to the customer.... And it's working...\n\nAITA/did that smaller company Fuck up their best last hope??",

      "title": "WIBTA if I Told My Roommate to Stop Using My Body Wash?",
      "description": "Lemme give you all some context:\n\nI was fired during the holidays from I job I worked at for just shy of 2 years for a horseshit reason and I've been looking for a job since then, but haven't had any success. Because of this, I rely on my mom and dad, as well as my older brother for cash when I'm desperate, and even then I don't get money very often. I don't keep spending money on cigarettes, beer, weed, or other drugs I love, or anything for fun at the moment because I need to spend it on essentials like deodorant, laundry detergent, and laundry itself, since my university is cheap as fuck and can't just offer laundry.\n\nOne of the essentials I need to buy is body wash. I LOVE Irish Spring; it smells so good and I feel good when I smell like it. I simply cannot stop getting a whiff of myself after I shower with my precious Irish Spring with the charcoal flakes. I would die for Irish Spring.\n\nApparently my roommate likes it too, since he's been using it without asking me. Now what really pisses me off is he knows I'm living penny to penny right now, but he told me himself how he just made $500 for making a small commercial for some rinky dink girls hockey league or whatever, but the point is he has a decent amount of money and spends it on Chipotle at least once a week, but can't be bothered to buy his own body wash and keeps using mine. He even got a little mad once when I drank a 6 pack of (my) beer in one night and destroyed the Whole Foods chips and guac I had previously offered him (this was mine, given to me by my dad who knows I love this stuff) when he said the dining hall food made him \"almost throw up\" and declined at the time (he's just spoiled af and refuses to eat shit food like normal college kids do, even though his parents are paying for his meal plan.)\n\nRecently he got a little mad at me because I had a can of Sprite from a 12 pack he bought after I had previously asked if he minded if I grabbed one earlier. I had two out of a 12 pack, and this prompted him to tell me to ask before taking his stuff, even though I've said he can help himself to a beer whenever he wants whenever I have any, and has done so before, which I'm fine with. I admit, even if the dining halls were closed and I couldn't get a soda anywhere without paying for it, I should have asked him first, but how fucking hypocritical is it to tell someone to ask first if you are currently using something of theirs more than once a day, every day, without asking if it's cool, and with it being totally unnecessary since you have more than enough money to buy your own?\n\nMy question is, WIBTA if I told him he needs to buy his own body wash or buy the next bottle of what I want if he's gonna keep using mine?",

      "description": "My husband is a great guy. People love him, he is a supportive husband, good dad, all around fantastic person. he also has an autoimmune disorder that leaves him wracked with pain multiple times a day. He was diagnosed several years ago, and it seems to be getting worse and worse. He no longer can work full time. He does some consulting where he'll go in the office maybe 2-3 hours a day, but that is physically all he can handle. He also can't help as much around the house anymore, so I am working more hours and doing most everything for the kids and house. On these points, I am fine. I know that he is physically unable to do much more than he already is and overextending himself just makes things worse for him for days to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point where I wonder if IATA is that he really feels alone in his pain and wants to share how he is feeling. So in a normal 8 hour workday I will probably get 2-3 calls and another 5 texts where he says things like, \"having such a rough day, I feel awful. So much pain!\". I try to be sympathetic, but I don't know what I can do. I am swamped with everything life is throwing at me, that I don't have time to drop everything and chat with him each time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets frustrated when I send back generic, \"I'm really sorry babe\" texts and says that I don't take his condition seriously. I feel I do take it seriously, I do care about him. I know that he lives with this constantly, but there is nothing I can do in the immediate to make it better and feel like a total asshole asking him to please quit texting me that he feels so bad.

      "description": "A guy messaged me randomly and he seemed really nice. (we were in a discord server together) He asked if I was single and I told him no, I am happily taken. I also brought up I had ASD as I like to warn people. He didn't mind and things went on, we had quite a bit in common and he was just a nice person. \nBut then, he started messaging me things like:\nHim: I want a cuddle. \nMe: Awhh, do you have any pets to cuddle? \nHim: I meant from you!\n\nAnd okay, he could just be being friendly.\n\nBut then, three days after we met, it happened. \n\nHim: Hey OP, I realised I haven't seen your face! \n(My profile picture is my face, so I was a little confused but I sent it anyway.) \nMe: My profile picture is literally my face, but here you go. ^-^ \nHim: Looking rather cute may I say, I would cuddle and kiss 10/10. \n(I now panic, not knowing how to reply.)\nMe: I don't want you to get mad or upset but you're making me slightly uncomfortable. But it was nice of you..\nHim: Yeah I know that. That's the point of it. I wanted to see how you would react. \nMe: You just wanted to see how I would react? \nHim: Yep. \nMe: That's a little mean, I told you I'd been diagnosed with ASD and you put me in an uncomfortable situation. \nHim: Some people tens to leave right after that. I know you did, and I forgot. I apologise for that. \nMe: Even if I didn't have it, it's still kind of mean. I told you I have a boyfriend and I have ASD.\nHim: Okay you don't need to keep bringing up.the ASD. And?? It's a boyfriend. If I was being serious about that it was a compliment. Damn, jeez man.\nMe: Okay, this obviously isn't going to work. You're not being very nice. \nHim: Because you keep bringing up the fact you have ASD. \nMe: I brought it up twice.\nHim: Yes, I know you have. I forgot you had it, but I apologised for it and I don't do it again. 3 times. (I brought it up when we met and twice in this conversation) Wow. Just because of one little mistake you lose someone like that, actually stupid. Sort your sh** out, next time don't bring it up so many times. F**ktard. \nMe: Do you not understand what it is? I have difficulties with social communication. Maybe I repeated it and brought it up again because I have it and don't understand? Goodbye. \n\nI blocked him after this as he upset me quite a bit, but I'm fully open to the fact I might have messed up. But I still don't think I brought it up too many times and I did say the compliment was nice. \n\n(Sorry if this wasn't great, it's my first time and I didn't know how to post screenshots.) \n\nTLDR: Guy gets mad at me because I told him I had ASD after he made me uncomfortable, then swears at me.

      "description": "So a little context, I am renting a room from a place I found on craigslist. The landlord currently lives there and there is one other room aside from mine that he is trying to rent out. I was aware of this going in, but I voiced my strong preference against rooming with couples, anyone under 25, anyone older than 40, or women (can't stand their hair everywhere!). He seemed to take this into consideration and ran potential tenants by me as they reached out to him. But none of them really fit my preferences and it ends up taking an extra month. I realize he is losing money or whatever but I have to live with the person too! \n\nSo anyway he starts to get irritated with me, saying that I am being too picky about roommates, and acting entitled about the property, blah blah blah. So he ends up telling me I am no longer a fit for the property and that I need to find a new place immediately. Wtf. I remind him I have a right to 30 days notice, which he obliges to but tbh I am really upset about the whole situation now.\n\nAnd here's where the current situation comes in:\nHe eventually stopped asking me for my opinion and found a guy to move in, but I don't like him at all. He left a dish in the sink and used the bathroom at like 630 in the morning. Then around 10:30 am he is like blasting rap music from his phone speaker while he was on his way out to work or whatever. I was already awake doing laundry but I found it extremely irritating and disrespectful. I don't have the new guys information but I do want to do something about this since I have to live here another 3 weeks so I figure I'll just call in a noise complaint about the property since I'm leaving anyway.\n\nWIBTA for calling a noise complaint in to the police?",

      "title": "AITA for losing my patience with some kids in the park?",
      "description": "So, this happened a couple of days ago but I'm still haunted by it. I took my kids to the park (7yo girl and 3yo boy) with some friends around the same age. Weather is nice so the park is quite crowded with kids and parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm talking with another adult, I see two boys (brothers, around 4-6) using sticks as guns and messing with my daughter. I decide to observe and see my daughter walking backwards trying to keep the distance with the boys (who keep getting closer pointing her with the sticks), while my girl is very timidly saying \"stop\". Since it doesn't look like she can control the situation I decide to get closer and say \"that is enough\" while I let my daughter \"escape\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeems that the boys forgot about her so they come with their mom, which is sitting in a bench next to the adult I was chatting with (let's call him F) when this started. The boys keep saying that they're the police and that everybody else are thieves, pointing with the sticks and so on, whatever. F decides to take part into the role-play and says that he's the sheriff and try to convince them to play less aggressively. Doesn't work and before F realises the boys are poking him with the sticks and even jumping on top of him. The mom manages to snatch them away for a few seconds as I'm starting to see that this is not going to end well (the mom just smiled and said \"oh, boys... you know\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly I see both boys are doing the same to my 3yo, I walk calmly giving some time for my son to react but before I can separate them as I did with my daughter, one of the boys pokes my son in the temple. I honestly lost my shit, grabbed the stick and violently threw it away, which obviously caused the kid to start crying. Next thing I know is the mom yelling at me like crazy about what the hell am I doing and that they're just kids and I'm an adult. Still in adrenaline-rush mode I yell back that it was dangerous, they could've hurt my son's eye, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen is when things go surreal. The mom starts to say that I hit her kid and that she was calling the cops. I was shocked and could barely say that I grabbed the stick and that's it. Luckily for me other parents (most of them I didn't know) jumped and started to say that it was false and that in fact those kids had been all evening harassing their own kids. The mom doesn't reason and keeps yelling and insulting me. This goes for a good 10-15min and then she starts saying that my daughter started everything  by bossing her two kids (the mom was imitating some sort of club-bouncer posse). We feel that she's delusional and that there's no way to reason so we took our kids away and went for ice cream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad for reacting in such a childish way, and honestly I was shaking for quite a while. I feel like most of the other parents in the playground were also upset with these kids but were nice enough not to cross the line. AITA?",

      "description": "So to keep it short and sweet I’m an Uber driver on Friday and Saturday nights to take care of drunks (because that’s when the highest volume of customers are).\n\nI had a call at 3am to drive 7 minutes to some guy who gave me the wrong address, then changed the address to the wrong address again.\n\nI have strict rules to message customers when they have a minute of wait time left. So I messaged this guy. Numerous times. I even tried calling him.\n\nHe asked where I was and I told him exactly where I was, but he wasn’t there. He then typed random letters and sent them to me and I asked him to repeat himself. He replied with “Sort it out”.\n\nAt this stage I had been waiting over 5 minutes for him so I replied with “sort out your own ride. Don’t waste my time” and canceled on him and charged him. I started driving and saw him a couple of streets over but decided to keep on driving.\n\nWhen he re-ordered an Uber he got me and I declined so I wouldn’t have to deal with him. I’m a 5 star Uber with over 450 trips and I don’t want to tarnish what appears to be a perfect record because some guy wants vengeance against me.\n\nAm I an asshole for charging him, driving past him and then declining him after his behaviour?",

I (21M) often feel like she doesn't see her fault in situations (I'm literally such a pushover and I haven't talked to her about it) \nBut her mother was in a car accident. She was pretty beat up and a lot of people were around in the room she was in. She was very rude to basically everyone for a multitude of things. \n-talking, either to her mom or each other (family not nurses)\n-making jokes\n-anytime her mom, who was injured, talked/asked thing\n\nThe main thing is that her tone of voice was just harsh. It came off as very bossy. Her father made the comment of \"you need to stop acting like you're in charge around here.\" Which agreed with but didn't say anything (*again, I am literally too scared to say anything, not even sure why. I'm worried about making her upset*)\nI know I need to work on and practice actually being a man and sticking up for myself and putting in my thought to this relationship.\n\nDo I excuse her behavior because I'm aware her emotions were through the roof given the situation? If not, how should I approach this?\n\nI am sorry if this doesn't fully belong in this sub.\n\nAnd lastly, this is a throwaway. H, if you see this, sorry for not being a man and confronting you.

      "description": "There is a charity organization that sets up outside of my neighborhood grocery store, and they are there pretty often. It’s usually young people working this little booth they have set up with their logo and a few pamphlets. So I live in Southern California, where people tend to be friendly, but I’m from Baltimore and I don’t like to be bothered. So a few weeks ago I was running into the store before work, and as I come out, the guy at the charity booth gives me a big smile and says “I like your hoodie! Is that a college or what?”  (It was my work uniform) I keep walking past and reply “Sorry dude, no thank you!”  After that he yelled to me “I was only asking about your hoodie!”\nNow today a very similar interaction occurred while I was coming out of the grocery store. Again I was walking out and the guy at the booth asked about my hoodie. It was a different guy, and a different hoodie, but it went about the same. He asked me “Are you in the Navy or is your partner?” (probably because my hoodie said Navy)  Again I replied with “No thank you”, and again he yelled back “I was just asking!”  \nBy his tone I could tell he was getting defensive, but, shouldn’t they be used to that? And your not just asking about my clothing to make polite conversation, you’re looking for a way in to ask for money! Considering this is a charity and these people are only trying to do some good, am I the asshole for feeling harassed  at the grocery store? ",

It's usually around lunch time the day after he's stayed the night. He gets very upset and says that it feels terrible to be 'kicked out' of somewhere he feels safe. I understand where he's coming from, but my room is also my safe space and sometimes I really need it to myself.\n\nThe reason I ask him to go is because my panic attacks are not pretty (shaking, hyperventilating, throwing up) and I don't want him to see me like that, plus it makes me even more anxious knowing that I'm being so vulnerable and upset in front of someone else. I've tried to explain this to him and he says he understands, but still makes it a problem and says he's sorry for getting in my way and being annoying.\n\nI know it's a safe and comfortable place for both of us, and I want him to feel like that.

      "description": "This is my first post here, and hopefully my last. Most people know me as an honest and nice person, because I really try to be in most cases, sadly my teachers know that. I have never in my life \"ratted\" someone out but this was something I thought was justified by me.   \nFor context purposes, there was an exam recently in which some students cheated. Another students found out they did and told on them to the school board directly. We've all been waiting on something to happen to these students, but nothing yet. The entire school knows about what happened, teachers and students included.  \nSo today I was just minding my own business when a teacher came up to me and told me to go into an empty classroom with them. I sat down and was instantly bombarded with questions as to who did what and how and so on. The teacher reassured me that they didn't care about who, and that the teacher knew already but wanted to hear it from someone from their class (this teacher is my homeroom teacher). 30 minutes into the questioning the teacher says that they are more upset with the person who told on them, because what they did was wrong. The teacher then asked if I heard any names flying around who have been accused of cheating one last time when I budged and two names slipped out. The people that I mentioned found out because I felt so bad about I had to tell someone, and they absolutely despise me now. I wrote an apology and everything, stated that I really did mess up, but I thought it isn't as bad as it seems due to the teacher pressuring me incredibly and the entire school already knowing most of the people who did infact cheat.   \n\n\nTL;DR: I was pressured into telling my teacher who already knew about who cheated on an exam who it was just to reassure themselves. The teacher said they would keep it to themselves and I think they will. My whole class hates me, AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory, my girlfriend has been talking to this guy let’s call him Rick. Now I’m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I’m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn’t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she’s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment “wow you look really good, what’s with the get up?” She would answer something along the lines of “It’s just a fun thing I like to do now.”\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I’m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can’t fit a magnum so that’s how I knew it wasn’t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that “she didn’t cheat, she was getting raped,” I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn’t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you’re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it’s non consensual. Her only explanation was that “it could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can’t leave.” I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn’t care for her especially since she revealed something SO “DAMAGING” to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it’ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn’t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Let me preface this post by saying i know getting upset over food is ridiculous and i probably am the asshole here.\n\nSo me and my boyfriend are 20 years old and have been together for about 2 years. And over those two years he has probably gained somewhere between 20-30 pounds. Hes 6'3 and if you knew him you'd mostly just notice a little bit of weight gain on his face and stomach. Im 5'0 and 105 pounds, and have never had issues with weight gain but i have had a rough relationship with food in high school that i wont get into.\n\nAnyways, I don't mind his weight gain at all and i still find him extremely attractive and love him very much. However, the problem is he constantly complains about his weight gain and says its \"relationship weight\". And that makes me feel bad.\n\nI've tried to get him to go workout with me at nights, but i get off work around 4 and he gets off around 7, so by the time he comes home he doesn't have much desire or time to go. He also eats out everyday for lunch at work. I made an effort to make his lunches (considerably healthier) and after a week or two he tells me not to worry about it and hes tired of what i make for him. I feel extremely annoyed when he complains about his weight because i feel like he makes no efforts to change his unhealthy habits and lose the weight but has been frequently mentioning it for around 6 months.\n\nThe last straw that made me decide to make this post was after an incident that happened this weekend. We went and got some dinner and i got a full meal, and he just got a small yogurt and a drink because he wanted to make an effort to eat better/lose weight.\n\nAfter we got home he asked for a bite of my food. No problem. (I knew my food was probably tempting and felt bad i was eating it in his face.) After his first bite, he continued to eat and finished about 70% of MY food. I probably had 4 or 5 bites of my entire meal. He finished his yogurt, my sandwich, fries, and his large drink. I then said something along the lines of \"Are you done eating my food?\" and he got this sad look on his face and told me he was sorry and i should have said something while we were eating. I told him he just defeated the whole purpose of ordering light and id go get myself food. So that's what i did. \n\nHis mom came to visit as i was eating my new food and my boyfriend mentioned something to her about me being grumpy and mad at him to which she began to pry and ask why i was upset. I just told her i was just tired. When she left i let my boyfriend have it telling him im \"over his complaining and if he wanted to lose weight he would stop being a baby and do something about it.\" and 'If you complain about your weight again i will break up with you\"\n\nWe havent talked since it happened and i feel like i may have been immature. I know weight is a sensitive subject with any person and I dont know if i should be more supportive in his weight loss or if i have a right to be annoyed with him.\n\nI know this sounds so immature, but AITA?",

I’ve been living with my mom ever since, seeing my dad every other weekend, if that. \n\nIt was fine when I was younger, but now my mom is starting to get a lot more sensitive about everything I say and say that I hate her. Once or twice I’ve asked where my brother and I will be for the weekend since plans change, and she’s blown up for it, yelling about how I’m disrespectful and need to grow up. She also freaks out when my social anxiety affects my life. \n\nI’ve been able to deal with it for a while, but now it’s been coming to the point where I’m drained of energy after talking to her and try to interact with her as little as possible. \n\nI’ve brought up living with my dad a couple of times, but I’ve always been talked out of it. It would make the schedule difficult, as my brother wants to stay with our mom and not leave. She wouldn’t be able to take me to family events -Christmas, thanksgiving, those sorts of deals- as easily, and the commute from here to my dad’s house is a lot of driving. \n\n\nTL;DR: I don’t enjoy my current situation with my mom and would rather live with my father, but that would spark a lot of issues with time management and schedules.

      "description": "Three months ago I moved to a Caribbean island for an amazing job opportunity and so far I really like it.\nAs soon as I announced this opportunity to friends, some of them stated that they would love to visit me when I’m there. Fun!\nThe first friend is here now and on day three I am thinking about canceling other friends who want to make the trip...\n\nI thought I had made it very clear before she booked her trip that I would not be available 24/7 when she is here. I have to work and I don’t want to use all my vacation days to entertain her so she has to entertain herself for three days (out of ten) while I’m working. I have time for her in the evening to get dinner and/or a drink and she can go to the beach during the day (as she stated she wants to spend every minute there).\n\nSome issues have already surfaced where the conclusion is that she doesn’t understand that I’m not on a vacation (and need to get some chores done) and she stating to me that I have to understand her frustration because she IS on a vacation and wants to enjoy every second of her very short trip (her words). I’m doing the best I can but every thing that I do that is not part of her vacation (like sweeping) is somehow me taking time and enjoyment away from her vacay... but she told me she wants to leave at a certain time so why can’t I use the time before that to do some laundry? She wakes up before me so she has to wait for me to finish some things but I make sure I’m done before the time she mentioned she wants to leave.\n\nWhat’s also is not helping is that she used to work (for four months) on the same island before me, however in a completely different field and 7(!) years ago. Every experience I share with her, she dismisses because ‘no that is not how things go here at all’. All this has made me very defensive for the last couple of days, making me a party pooper that has to chill (...) I just feel that she has taking over my life here and I have to listen to her expert advice about the island (like when driving she tells me I’m not taking the right road, it was better if I took the other way).\n\nAITA for being defensive about her “expert” remarks of how to do things here and taking time away in the morning of her vacation?",

      "description": "So backstory: we visit SO's family twice a year for family get togethers, sometimes more if life leads us that way. We live roughly ten hours away and the location of SO's family is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and we stay in an old and dilapidated barn. Recently one of SO's grandparents have died and this year instead of a family camping trip they want us to come out for a yard sale - which we would be helping to run in the summer.\n\nA couple problems are: SO's parent wants us to camp out on the lawn as there are too many of us to all fit in the barn. The shower situation is grim - there is only one bathroom usually split between 8+ people. We usually go at Christmas and SO's sibling and I wait it out till we get back home because of how bad the water smells. I've been to Iceland so I understand the sulfur smell but it's just at another level here. We often aren't fed properly (I realize we are both adults but its a delicate situation of not wanting to offend anyone that the food out there is terrible and also that we have no access to our own food). SO's siblings have a lot of dietary issues so they usually get the main focus on eating and we are left with junk food and pasta day after day. \n\nSo basically, we're supposed to come out and camp in a yard for 5 days, in the summer, with no real shower option, and bad food. Im talking constipation for days kinda deal. \n\nIf SO really wanted to go I would suck it up and do it, but it is only SO's parent that has **told us** we're coming. SO and I talked it over and we are both on the same page about not wanting to go. SO's family is large enough that there will be enough people to help, and we know that some other cousins who live closer than we do are not going to go because of the distance. Again its a 10 hour drive for us and we don't have access to a car so we have to travel down to SO's parents house (4 hours away) and then travel with them to the grandparents house. \n\nAt the same time we have been planning a trip and one of the best times for us to go is the same week/weekend as this trip. So would we be the assholes if we scheduled the trip during this time as our excuse? We are definitely not going and we don't have a reason for it yet, but would scheduling a trip be the asshole way to get out of it?\n\nSO's parent has stated that it's really important for her kids to help out and I know it is very stressful for said parent and that they will most likely be mad at us either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it’s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they’ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that’s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding.

She replied that I should let her know when I do. This annoyed me and I ended up muting her number. Apparently, she sent me quite a few texts since then and since I don't open my SMS app much, so I missed them. I opened it today and the last text was something like 'knowing you can help people, how can you put yourself out of reach?' I feel guilty because I ghosted her only because it seemed she was going to ask about grades and academics all the time. I probably would have helped if she'd asked, rather than ask for my grades from the start. Am I the asshole for ghosting her? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "On mobile sorry for any formatting errors.\n\nSo we still live together and have been fairly cool for the two months after I broke up with her. (Long story surrounding that, I can go into it needed but I don't think it's relevant.) I broke up with her because I wasn't comfortable being the secondary relationship to someone who will be in prison for another 23 years.\n\nDuring the year we were together they had phone sex a handful of times that I was home, and it always bothered me. So right before I broke up with her they agreed to not have phone sex while I'm home and things were ok. Because the breakup was situational we still care about each other and for a little while still had sex, up until a few weeks ago when she wanted to stop that.\n\nApparently for the past two months they haven't actually been able to have phone sex due to the prison he was in. He moved prisons last week and now has some more privacy to... Do stuff. Awkward considering I'm now unemployed about the same time he moved and am now home all the time for at least a few weeks.\n\nSo in combination with me not being gone, she had just finished ghosting him because the move made him irrational and she wasn't wanting to deal with it (guess who handled him during that time) and them not having done anything for a couple months they were antsy.\n\nMe and the ex had spent most of the day together, and had gone home to drink a few beers and get high. Which... Gets her rather horny. So he calls and she goes to the other room. I don't think anything of it, cause he prefers privacy when calling and that's ok, and just pause the movie we were watching.\n\nThen out they were getting it on even though they agreed not to when I was home, she claims she was trying to be quiet and to be fair I didn't hear anything until the dryer turned off, then I could hear her vibrater throughout the apartment.\n\nSo I go to get door, knock a few times before she even acknowledges me, then when she gives me a passive aggressive 'I'm on the phone' I just reply 'we talked about this'.\n\nShe does stop after that but the damage is already done, my mood is shot and we argued for a couple hours. To which we just gave up and went to sleep. But I wanted to sleep in my own bed which I guess is her bed until the lease is up but we still share every now and then.\n\nSo as we're cuddling I hold her close because physical comfort is nice even though I'm not feeling well. Then I guess she was still horny because she mentioned that the way I was holding her made her aroused. So I go for some angry sex after verifying she was actually ok with it. (Drunk and high the both of us... So I guess not even real consent at the time, but when we woke up she said it was ok)\n\nThis morning had a speaker phone conversation with her and prison guy which was... Explosive. Basically amounting to I was an asshole for interrupting and doubly so for having sex with her after. And he's also mad at her for having sex with me.\n\nTL;DR: interrupted my ex GF having phone sex with her prison fiance that's existed before me, ended up having sex with her myself after a couple hours of arguing.",

In this time I have already missed two of my cousins wedding. Luckily both of them were almost around my exams so I had a genuine reason to avoid them. It's not that I hate weddings and all, its just that I find it too tiring ( as I would have to travel back to home and would also have to miss college for almost 4-5 days ) and a bit expensive. \nNow another one my cousin is having her wedding in a few months and at around that time I will be going back to my hostel after having some holidays and will be going to my hostel almost before 7-10 days of wedding. Now I wouldn't miss like a week of college and genuinely I don't even want to attend it. Also it would be too much of hassle to go back for the wedding. But I can't think of a genuine reason. \nAlso my parents don't have a problem if I attend my cousin wedding or not. \nSo AITA here? ",

(we’re both only in our freshman years of high school, this information will be useful later in the story so remember this).\n\nSo I’ve recently found out the girl i was dating was sending nude photographs of herself to other men. I forgave her for this as this was in the past before we were dating, but what was even more disturbing was the fact that I later found out these men were fully grown adult males. I did not like this but at the time i wanted out relationship to work so I moved on. Things were going pretty smoothly until she came to me high off her ass. She told me she had taken a   Black Pill and has started to hallucinate, I was pissed not only did she take some fucked up drug that she didn’t even know the side effects to but now she’s basically forcing me to babysit her until she’s picked up, this was strike one for me and later decided that two strikes were enough after learning she had oral sex with one of my friends. \n\nBut even after all of this I still feel like a piece of shit for not sticking by her side during her time of need. And being that final push someone needs to end their life is something i don’t want to live with. \n\nLong story short: two high school freshman go out i found out she sends nudes to full grown men and she fucked my friend, I leave her despite knowing about her other suicide attempts and now i feel like a piece of shit \n\n",

      "description": "basically, i have an Auditory Processing Disorder that (sometimes) makes it difficult for me to process spoken word. I can hear perfectly fine and I understand that words are being said, but sometimes I am unable to understand spoken word as anything more than a jumble of noises. I’m totally fine 80% of the time, but some days are definitely worse than others and accents, background noise, and volume level can make it harder for me. It often takes a lot of concentration to understand every word being said to me. \n\nAnyway: \n\nI usually turn on captions when I’m watching stuff. Some people in my family HATE the captions and will go as far as to complain about it while turning them off. They really seem genuinely bothered by the captions: “It ruins comedy for me if I read the punch line first.” “It distracts me from the show and I can’t enjoy it.” I know that tons of people seem to be similarly annoyed by captions or feel that it ruins their experience, but sometimes I just *cannot* understand what the hell is going on if I don’t have captions on, so it really sucks for me when they’re off. \n\n\n~~~\n\n\nSo, AITA for wanting captions on when I’m watching stuff with other people even though everyone else seems to hate them/feel it ruins their experience?

      "description": "Sorry for formatting on mobile \n\nSo recently with Valentines day my girlfriend decided to get me a preserved rose (for those who don't know this is a rose that doesn't die and doesn't need watered). While I was out this morning my mum decided to spray the rose with some water, despite having been told that it's preserved and doesn't need water.\n\nI come home with my girlfriend to find my rose sitting there looking like it's wilting. I am hugely upset by this and I want her to pay for the rose as its quite pricey.\n\nThis is where some context comes in.\n\nAbout two months ago both her and my grandmother went halves on a new car for me and I am paying her back $200 with every paycheck I get (which is about a 5th of my paycheck, with the rest going into bills and savings).\nToday happened to be one of her pay days (from me as she is unemployed and not actively looking for work) and I took out the cost of the rose from what I owe her for the fortnight. She immediately got angry and demanded the rest of the money. Its emotionally affected both me and my partner and is continuing to do so. ",

      "description": "I was born and raised in Kansas, and my girlfriend and her family immigrated here from Central America about 18 years ago.  We've been together for a few years now.\n\nRecently, we've started the talks of children. Everything was fine, until she told me she wanted our children to learn English and Spanish 'at the same time' and how 'we will speak Spanish at home'(Even though she knows I don't speak Spanish and have no ambition to learn anymore than I already do) \n\nI put a stop to all that and told her since we live in America, where English is mainly spoken, they will learn English first and when they're older if they want to start learning Spanish they can. I also told her I would not learn Spanish just so I could communicate with my family when I'm in my own home.  she got very upset. She said I was being \"disrespectful to her culture\" and I was being a \"basic Trump supporter\" \n\nI'm thinking logically here. We live in the Bible Belt, where everyone speaks English, it will just be easier for our children to speak the language everyone else is speaking first. Her family all knows English, so I don't see why she's worried about this so much.  ",

But tonight I took a small bite and realized something was wrong. I just did not like them and my stomach hurt. I felt bad, and my mom suggested I tell the waiter. I’ve never sent back food before.. I motioned the waiter who suddenly called 5 other waiters and then the manager! It was blowing up in my face. The last waiter told me certain ways to respond to the manager in that when he asks “ do you want another one” I need to say no. \n The manager finally rushed out and started asking me a lot of questions “ so you don’t like them? Why exactly do you not like them!”, and I responded “I’m really sorry, I’ve had these tacos before just tonight idk something is different”. I felt totally on the spot and awful. He rushed out and shook his head angrily (keep in mind literally everyone was watching this unravel.) \nI at least made the effort to leave a great tip and even carved into the coconut  “ Sorry! I love it here!” Overall though AITA? ( I feel like I put out a bratty image)",

      "description": "My mom recently stress fractured her foot. She needs to surgery to correct it and then she will be non-weight bearing for eight weeks. I'm currently a stay-at-home mom to my 15 month old, however I am going to start school again in the fall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately after she suspected she'd broken it she called and asked if I could come down and help her out, primarily by driving her to and from work since it is her clutch foot that is injured. She was very frustrated since this is the second time she has fractured her foot, the first time being a couple years ago. The first time she broke her foot I did go down to help her out, however due to school and work I was only with her for three weeks before going home again. I agreed that myself and my daughter would come down to help out. There is no way my daughter would be able to stay home with her dad since he is always on call for shift work. The problem is that I only thought I would be down for 3-4 weeks. After a phone conversation tonight I learned she expected me to stay for the full eight week recovery time, and then extending the stay until late July, since I already have plans to be down there from late June to late July due to my best friend's wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have some issues with this. For one, I don't want to take my daughter away from her dad for so long, and I know her dad doesn't want to be away from her for so long either. Everything happens so quickly at this age and we both feel like he would miss a lot. The second reason being that we have prior commitments for the month of May. We'll be moving into a new place and I want to be here for that. My daughter will turn 18 months in May and with that comes a doctors appointment and more vaccinations, both of which have been scheduled already. Another admittedly more selfish reason against this is that for the duration of my stay my daughter and I will be sleeping on an air mattress in a room that is primarily used for storage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expressed my concerns to my mom tonight and she was not happy. She made a point to say \"I can't rely on anyone,\" and that she would be completely screwed if I don't come down for at least the eight weeks, which I feel was an attempt to guilt trip. She has a boyfriend and a lot of friends where she is (one even lives in her building) that can help her out as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I don't stay for eight weeks?",

      "description": "Now i should clarify that the family member in question is 7 months old called Jordan.\n\nI recently turned 19 and I've never wanted a large birthday party or anything so i decided that i'd like for my family to go for a Sunday lunch meal in a local pub near where I live. I'd invited my brother and his fiance, my sister and her boyfriend as well as my mother. However my brother was unable to attend due to work and my sisters boyfriend wasn't able to either due to money issues (Important later). So in total its me (m), my mother, my sister and my brothers fiance whom brought my nephew of 7 months.\n\nOnce arriving at the pub it was quite clear what my mother and sister had on their mind as since being asked what i wanted to drink hadn't been spoken to since, they wanted to see my nephew Jordan. Fast forward to being seated. Everyone has arrived and sat at the table and soon im noticing a triangle of conversation with me firmly on the outside, from everything from the baby is cute (to which i agree but which arent?), to the baby had plenty of sleep last night or maybe lack of. I should clarify that my sister and mother see this baby often 2 times a week sometime even more. I spent a majority of my time eating my food largely in silence and when conversation would turn to something other than baby related i was able to join in but it would soon be turned back towards the baby and i would be put out once again. \n\nAfter eating food and leaving i was already feeling a bad sad (somewhat aware that im feeling sorry for myself) we head back to my brothers house and more of the same. I would also like to add that i was given a birthday card on my way out which sort of felt like an after thought.\n\nSo am i being an asshole for being mad at my family and should i confront them? Or should i stop being an entitled dick?",

The first thing we planned to do was go out for lunch and in the morning, he called me and told me that  someone wanted to buy his Apple Watch he was selling on FB marketplace. He asked if it would be ok if we could stop at the Target 5 minutes away from my house before lunch and I said yes. \n\nWhen it was almost time to meet up, the guy texted my bf and told him he was on his way (the guy lived in 30 min away from our city) and my boyfriend wanted to go there early so the guy didn’t have to wait. As I was getting ready to leave, my mom asked me if my bf could come in so we can sing happy birthday before I leave since they had other plans later that day so that time was the only time we could do my birthday cake. I figured if we were only gonna sing, he could come in for a minute since the guy wasn’t even at the Target yet. \n\nWhen my bf got to my house, I called him and told him to come inside so they could sing happy birthday to me and he got really mad at me and said that we didn’t have time. We ended up arguing for 20 minutes over the phone and he ended up missing my birthday cake because he chose to go meet that guy alone. \n\nAfter he sold his Apple Watch, he called me and was upset and told me that he got a bad rating for being late and that it was my fault. I argued the fact that it would’ve only taken 30 seconds to sing happy birthday to me and my mom didn’t expect us to eat the cake right away. He called me unsympathetic and said I needed to admit I was wrong when I feel like I wasn’t. He kept telling me to put myself in his shoes and honestly if I was him I would’ve just came in but he still kept telling me I was wrong. He told me that I didn’t have any right to just “change plans” on him like that and if we made plans then we should stick to them. It made me so upset because I didn’t feel like it would be a huge issue since the guy wasn’t even there her. I ended up crying over the phone and he apologized for sounding mean but he still thinks I’m wrong. So AITA?\n\nAfter thinking about it, I now feel like I may have been wrong and I didn’t want to tell anyone I knew about this so I’m hoping someone from reddit would be able to share their opinion \n\nTl;dr: boyfriend missed my birthday cake because he wouldn’t come in for 30 seconds to sing happy birthday to me and chose to go sell his Apple Watch instead \n\n",

      "description": "So there are four people in this house. I'll refer to other three as A,B,C.\n\nA is rarely home and has no preference.\n\nB likes it warm all the time. \n\nC likes it cold at night, warm in mornings\n\nD(myself) likes it cold all the time.\n\nThe central heater is frequently turned to 70 degrees. It says 70 but it actually goes up to like 72 so that it doesn't have to run constantly. \n\nIt's too hot for me, period. I turn it down to 68 whenever I see or hear it running. Every time. Over 68 prevents me from sleeping when B turns it on at night, and when C turns it on in the morning while preparing for their day (often at 5am) it wakes me up. \n\nOur house is small. There is no shared area beyond hallway, kitchen and one bathroom shared between myself and B. The main vent is very loud. The house is also poorly insulated, so there's no way to stop my room from warming up whenever they turn on the heater - except to chuck open my window like halfway. Closing my personal vent doesn't help. \n\nThe rub is that we are allowed to use personal space heaters. My philosophy, and the philosophy I wish they would embrace, is that personal liberty is fine until it interferes with someone else's personal liberty. I feel bad being so sensitive to the freaking whirlwind dervish of this heater blaring. But I need my sleep and my perspective is that there is no legitimate reason to interfere with my sleep just because B or C wants to be warm while taking a poop at night or making coffee in the morning. \n\nThey have no right to use central heating, thereby subjecting *everyone* to their whims, when we can just use personal space heaters in our rooms and suffer the cold in the bathroom and kitchen. And let's be clear - this is northern California. \"Cold\" is 62 degrees F. We have no living room, no one stays in the kitchen longer than a few minutes. C, the main culprit in warming the house in the morning, even has their own private bathroom that they can keep warm with space heaters.\n\nAm I the asshole and acting like a draconian tyrant by shutting down their usage of central heating since it f*cks with my life in a major way?",

      "description": "Please read before you judge me. I help people and I normally wouldn't do that, but this is a different case.\n\nIt all started innocently on one of my post that I made on subreddit lonely. It said that I seek friends and anyone that will talk about themselves. They just have to reply and sometimes write me first. And so she wrote me...\n\nI told her to talk about herself and so she told me some basic stuff and then that her boyfriend verbally insults her and hurts her. Of course I told her to leave him alone. It would be before to be alone than abused right?\n\nAnd so we continued. I'll skip some stuff because it would take a lot. I'll put the most important stuff. If any questions I can answer them. \n\n1. I gave her friends. I mean I made few post asking for anyone to help her. She said she was lovely and my father is my father I spent most of my free time with her. When I left her alone because I had to she wrote me she was too lonely so she pulled her hair. I gave her friends, didn't helped\n\n2. I tried to find her a boyfriend. I used my other app to find her a boyfriend. She said she missed love. After I gently tried to explain to her that it won't work between us and I can't love her she told me she won't be loved anymore because I rejected her. I cried and shivered and was up until 3 am to keep her alive. I read \"I'll go commit suicide\" and passed out. When I woke up and asked her if she is alive she replied \"Ugh\". I thought I killed a person.\n\n3. After all she called me a fake friend. My Internet sister helped me open my eyes. I tried to help this girl, gave my heart into it. My father yelled at me. I shivered, cried and stuff like that but I stayed with her, hoped everything will be okay. I helped twice so why not again? No..\n\nI hate myself and don't mind hurting myself mentally but this was too much. I couldn't stay with her anymore. To not be bad on her I talked about my problems with her and she replied almost immediately. So yeah.. I don't know if I'm the asshole\n\n(from her words, her family treated her bad and cared more about her other sister, her boyfriend had cancer and probably committed suicide, the closest psychologist took only 18+ people and she didn't wanted to call any social support.)

      "description": "White people problem ahead, proceed with caution. \n\nSorry for any mistakes, I hope it's understandable, because english is not my main language.\n\nI'm 19 and he's 27yo. We're both at the same public university (and course). I'm entering my second year and he's on his last. Our course lasts 4 years and he's on his 7th (I don't blame him, I think he had his reasons). We live together in an apartment 4 hours away from our parents and sister (22), our parents pay all our bills. \n\nMy parents live in the city, they bought a old house in the woods 6 years ago and after 6 years of construction they turned it into our \"summer\" house, with swimming pool, a small soccer field, a few small crops, chickens and some settlements for guests. I'm from South America, so it's always summer to us, that means that we go there almost every weekend we're in the city.\n\nRecently my parents came with the idea of moving to this house, we all liked it, but the main building of that place got only 2 bedrooms, it's been more than 10 years since me and my siblings shared bedrooms, our parents know that it would be awkward to us to start sharing again and decided to \"give us a second floor\" as a gift (the guest settlements I mentioned before are all kinda far from the main building and they didn't want us living there).\n\nI know this is getting long, so here is the deal. I was the last one to know they we're going to build a second floor, when I got the news from them, I got told that I was the only one staying on the first floor because my siblings had already chosen theirs rooms. I got a little bit sad because the last time we moved the same thing happened (me ending up with the smallest and worse bedroom) but I didn't care much because I've always thought to myself that as the youngest sibling I have no rights over these things. But hey, at least I'll have my own bathroom and no need for stairs.\n\nNow that the second floor walls are up, my siblings noticed that my old bedroom is kinda bigger than theirs. My sister already said that she's staying on the first floor with me in the other bedroom that was going to be empty (it's little smaller than mine), her room on the second floor is going to be our study room.\n\nMy brother didn't like that me as the younger brother \"who's starting university life away from home\" is going to get the bigger room. Now he think I should stay on his smaller bedroom on the second floor. The problem is that he only said these things to our mother, not to me. He asked her to convince me. He already spoke to her twice and mom said to him that it's up to me to decide. \n\nToday after he talked with our mother about this again (this was the second time), he came home mad (silent mad, didn't say hi or anything to me). Just went to my bedroom (I was at the kitchen) and took his laptop from my table and took to his bedroom (he's not using it lately so he's letting me use it because my desktop stopped working), It was on and I was using it, but didn't said a thing because it is not mine (I didn't know why he was mad at that time). Later in the night he went to our close mutual friends' house (they were at our pool house yesterday and it was such a cool day because we didn't hang with them in months) without telling me or my sister, he just told our mother (who told us hours after he left). Now he's going to sleep there. He knew that I would've accepted to go there if he invited me, but he didn't invite and he probably said to our friends that I didn't want to go. \n\nNow I'm feeling bad. I love my brother, our bond is so strong and he is my best friend. I am thinking about giving my bedroom to him because of this but at the same time I always wanted a good large bedroom to decorate and such (his actual big bedroom is a mess because he doesn't care about it). I didn't like his atittude today and I didn't like that he and my sister didn't give a f**k about me when picking the bedrooms from the construction blueprint (they even made fun of me because I'm staying on the old bedroom). I also thought about him living in the bedroom while I'm at the Uni (I'll probably stay there for more 3 or 4 years). Anyway, AITA? \n\nWell, I didn't think this boring WPP would get that long, sorry! ",

      "description": "Obvious throwaway account. Also, this will be very long.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for over 4 years. She has a clinical anxiety condition that has prevented her from leading a normal life. As a result, she needed to depend on her mom and sister.\n\nGrowing up, my gf didn't realize she had anxiety and this obviously led to a lot of misunderstanding and tension within her family when she would have an episode. Her mom and sister would constantly tell her that she needs to stop being lazy, we all have to do stuff we don't like, you're a burden on us (this one was mostly her sister for reasons I'll get to later), and the like.\n\nHer mom remarried when she was 16 and her and her stepdad didn't get along, to say the least. He's a homophobe (she's bisexual), beat his son growing up, spoiled his daughter to the point of her becoming a very entitled individual, and puts down my gf's mom constantly. If he's ever confronted he gets extremely defensive.\n\nThis lead to a huge blow up between he and my gf, resulting in her mom making the 3 of them go to councling. Long story short, they told stepdad he'll need to make some compromises if he wants their relationship to work and he didn't really like that and has done nothing to improve himself or their relationship so my gf left to go live with her dad and sister because she knew she was causing a lot of tension in their marriage and didn't want to cause her mom more heartache.\n\nHer sister then mostly took care of her. She fed her and let her stay with them, even into adulthood. All the while, her sister and dad would tell her how much of a burden she was and that she needed to be an adult now and so on. I entered the picture when she was 22.\n\nWe've been together 4 1/2 years now and we're living together and plan on getting married soon. She now understands growing up that her issue wasn't that she was lazy or unwilling, but that she had anxiety. She has been diagnosed by a professional and is taking medication. However, she still has 0 self esteem and a lot of her episodes tend to be about feeling like she's worthless and just a drain on me and society.\n\nI didn't want to come between her and her family but I can't stand seeing her suffer like this. We still see her mom and sister regularly, and they still say those things sometimes. Recently I've been telling her that she was conditioned to feel the way she does because that's what her family would tell her. I've also told her that since her family has made no effort to try and understand her or her condition and apologize for their behavior in the past that they don't love her and never have. \n\nThe reason I think that is that during my gf and stepdad's huge blow up he called her a loser and worthless trash. My gf's mom did confront him about this and force him to apologize. Well, I say apologize loosely because the phone call was him basically saying \"Well we both said some things and said things we didn't mean and I think we both learned.\" and left it at that. Apparently that was good enough for my gf's mom because she dropped it thereafter and if my gf ever brings it up (typically during an episode) my gf's mom's response is usually \"can't you just get over it, that was years ago.\". Not to mention she had slapped my gf a couple times growing up, as did her grandmother, and they'd both say things like \"Oh, you made me do this since you couldn't help making me so angry.\". My gf's mom has apologized for the hitting but not for not holding the grandmother accountable or blaming my gf for her actions. We can't confront the grandmother directly now because she has alzheimer's and is pretty far gone.\n\nAs for her sister, she also slapped my gf a couple of times for basically the same reasons and has never apologized, even when confronted. If my gf ever tries to talk to her sister about her anxiety she shrugs it off because she doesn't really believe in mental illness and has low key told my gf she should stop taking her meds on a number of occasions.\n\nShe seems to be accepting what I'm saying, as the last time she blew up at her mom she mentioned the conditioning but kind of glossed over it to get back to her main issue at the time.\n\nI would never tell her she can't see her family and I would never actively try to stop her but I don't think being around them is healthy for her mental state. I've also never expressed my thoughts to her family per my gf's request.\n\nI feel like what I'm doing is for my gf's benefit but at the same time I feel like I'm doing what they did, trying to condition her to feel and think a certain way. \n\ntl;dr My gf's mom and sister treated her poorly in the past and not much has improved and I say that they don't love her because of their lack of trying to understand her and her condition or make amends for past mistakes\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\n\n",

I was sitting in their gaming chairs in their room, a basketball sized rubber ball in my lap and holding a cup of sparkling red grape juice, which I was drinking while they did the stuff I told them to do (read: I wasn't just holding it.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 8 year old brother decided it would be funny to kick the ball in my lap, at that same moment I was raising the cup to take a drink from it. When he kicked the ball, it flew up and hit the cup, making me spill sparkling grape juice all over myself and getting it on the carpet. I was sticky and pissed because, not only was i soaked, they'd gotten grape juice all over their cream colored carpet and it was going to stain if we didn't clean it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stormed downstairs (not before yelling \"This is why I can't have fun with you,\" they always seem to take things just too far) to tell my mom and changed into dry clothes before going into my brothers room, where they had moved the chairs so my mom could use the carpet cleaner, and said, \"This is why you don't kick people when they're holding drinks, especially not grape juice. That stuff stains, (brother name).\" I'll admit, I kinda yelled it. I get explosively/violently angry and I was *angry*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually he apologized after I showered to get un-sticky, but when they went to bed my mom pulled me aside and told me off for what I'd said to him and for getting mad at him, she thinks it's just over the grape juice but I'm more angry over the fact that he actually kicked me and thought it was going to end well. She told me that it was my fault for getting grape juice everywhere and that I shouldn't have been holding the cup, even though I was actively drinking from it while playing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing of mine was stained, I was wearing black, and none of the carpet was stained either. I was just angry. AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account and on mobile. Apologies. Not going specific in case they browse reddit? But happy to answer any questions. \n\nBasically I have a friend who is throwing a birthday party for herself. Rather than invite people to a bar she is having everyone pitch in to get a private room at a bar with pool and giant Jenga and pay for an open bar - that only lasts 3 hours and has restrictions on drinks (like no shots and only miller and bud for beer)  Originally she said 30$ a person, now she is coming back and say 40$ a person. I had texted her the other day asking if DD’s still had to pay the same fee and that if I did drink it’d be one drink as I am still breastfeeding and don’t want to pump and dump. She said she wasn’t sure and would get back to me today. Well it’s the end of the day and no word, there was a post on the page for her event (where she invited over 100 people) and it said the new total, so I asked “does that include tax and gratuity”\nAnswer with: “Yes”\nI had checked the website the day before and it said they will only serve one drink per person at a time and no shots are served. So I wanted to clarify and I asked “but no shots and only one drink at a time?” I asked this because it had never been mentioned once on the event page and I have a right to know what I’m getting if I’m going to spend that kind of money. I was met with a barrage of “40$ is great for an open bar, thanks so much *friends name*”\nAnd then finally someone telling me “you don’t have to get the deal” (which should be mentioned on the event - don’t ya think?)  and “you can just get an Uber, you don’t have to DD it’s not that serious” \nTo which I replied “well I’m breastfeeding my baby. So” \nThen my friend deleted all my comments and sent me text messages telling me to calm down, that her party isn’t about me, that I was complaining and being rude and that I should’ve texted her and asked my questions. \nI think people have the right to know exactly what their money will get them - especially if it’s 40$ for 3 hours only.. and no shots! But my friend never mentioned specifics on the event- just wants everyone to bring 40$ cash and give it to her and then they can all “have a great time” \nI’m happy to share screen shots if needed in the morning and any more info needed but that’s the basics. So AMITA for questioning what my money gets me ?? \n\n\nEdit: people seem to be getting side tracked in the comments. I didn’t ask if I should go or not- this isn’t a discussion on my attendance. I was curious if asking for more details about what’s included in the 40$ fee publicly made me an asshole.",

      "description": "Found this sub on accident figure its good place for this story.\n\nTLDR: Best mates not GF spammed group chat. I called her out on her behaviour and left, she spams me in dms i block her. She spams\nMe on my mates number so i block his number too.\n\nSo me and my mate have been friends for nearly 10 years. We traveled half way across the world together and are planning a trip to vegas to celebrate both of us turning 21 (though it is mainly for him).\n\nA few months ago he signed up to tinder and met this girl. And on the third day of meeting she told him she would fuck him if not for her period. My friend being a virgin was very keen on that and the following sunday popped his cherry. That when shit turned bad.\n\nHis GF used sex over him every time to get her way. And it was painfully obvious. Even after confronting my mate and telling him he’s whipped and being used he outright denied it. \n\nFlashford a bit and they both decide they jumped into sex a bit too quick and are now not going out but regressed to “dating”.\n\nThat leads to last night. After having a night out my mate (along with his now-not-gf-but-just-dating-friend) pick us up and take us to get mcflurries cause the not-gf wanted them. Whatever fine. The not-GF also wanted to go out of the city for a drive. I did not want that and neither did the other person in the car but my mate still went and took us to the middle of butt-fuck nowhere for 15 minutes before driving back to drop us off. (Context it was 12am i just wanted to go home and sleep).\n\nAnyway just now in our groupchat his not GF started spamming the group asking if we wanted to go nandos. When no one replied a barrage of “?” Hit the group chat. I called her out on her childish behaviour and as she started spamming different punctuation i left the group. She then started texting me so i block her too.\n\nSHE THEN STARTS SPAMMING ME ON MY BEST MATES NUMBER.\n\nLike WTF how petty are you? So i muted him at first but then after she sent a text saying she’ll continue unless i unblock her og number i just blocked my best mate too.\n\nDunno how she’s going to spin this story on me but was I the asshole for blocking my best mate of 10 years cause of his not gf but gf being a bitch?”",

      "description": "Let me start of by saying sorry for just overall bad writing. I tend to leave words out of sentences so I’m sorry about that\n\nA little backstory about this situation, my mother-in-law has been trying to get this surgery to help her with weight loss. She tried to get where she lives in Puerto Rico but was denied because the doctors felt that she could loss the weight on her own. \n\nThis part has noting to with the situation at the moment but I feel it will come to play if we do officially tell her no. So my wife and I fell onto some hard times, my wife and decided to move to Puerto Rico to live with her family so we wouldn’t be in the streets. We first stay at her fathers house who after 3 months kicked us out for God’s knows what reason so we had to go stay with her mother. \n\nEverything was fine at first, my wife had to be the translator because she didn’t speak English and the only Spanish I know are body parts and curse words. I would try to help around the house but she was very picky on how stuff was to be done. I would often see her complain to my wife on how I did something wrong and she or my wife had to fix it. Since I couldn’t directly talk to her my wife and I just decided when she’s in the house she’d do most of the chores and when she left for work I would then help. Since we started to that everything got done but it seemed like I wasn’t helping at all and my wife would try to tell her I did but she thought she was just covering for me. Fast forward a few months things had gotten so bad she told my wife maybe it was best to take my moms offer to go back to the Illinois to stay with her until I can get a place. So I said yes to my mom and left. \n\nIt was the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever done and just the thought of look on my wife’s face is bringing tears to my eyes now. I’m not a super emotional person but being away form her for a month had me crying before bed every night. My wife didn’t take it well either, she became very depressed. Her mother was not supportive at all and failed to understand why she was so hurt. Yeah we were apart only for a month but at the time we didn’t know how long it would take before we could afford for her to get plane ticket. \n\nDuring that month there was two instances where her mother tried to get her to talk to other guys. The first time she was at a grocery store some guy had made a comment about my wife I guess stating her was interested in her. Her mother then offered to give her number to him. She was pissed, declined and said she was married. The next time happened at a Chinese restaurant they had been going to forever. When they were paying for the the food her mother asked “ are you interested in her and if want her number you should go ask her yourself. \n\n Fast forward a bit. This is when her ex boyfriend comes into this situation I’ve nicknamed name drake because based on a conversation my wife had with him sounded exactly like the lyrics from Marvin’s room by drake\n\n\nWe are doing better now living on our own. Her mother then tells her that she contacted her ex boyfriend and she had told him that she missed him being her son in law. she rather have him be with my wife because she could understand him, that he comes from a good family and that he’d help her more and she wouldn’t be struggling by herself. I have to add she judges are whole relationship from those few months we stayed with her and the fact my wife doesn’t feel that she needs to tell her everything about our lives. So she doesn’t know everything I’ve done and am doing. This guy that is so great had cheated on her with a long time friend and after he told her he was offended that she didn’t want him hanging out with her anymore. \n\nSo basically I don’t want My Mother in law to live with us while she tries to get weight loss surgery and then would have to continue to stay while she recovered. The reasoning is because she is very difficult and I don’t want someone who doesn’t respect my marriage to be staying with me that I would basically have to provide everything for because she wouldn’t be able to work and is terrible at saving money so she wouldn’t have any when she came\n\nAITA because I technically would owe her because of what she has done for us ",

      "description": "I have a younger sister who essentially has never had to work for anything in her life. She’s going to an extremely expensive university and does not have a job because my mom sends her money. All she does with her life is go to her classes (which are all music classes since she is a vocal performance major, not the it really matters) and hang out with her friends. \n\nI on the other hand have not been as lucky. I have a multitude of mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder while also having crohn’s disease. I attend a community college while also working full time to keep myself afloat. I never really have time to relax as my entire life is split between school and work. \n\nAnyways, today my sister, who is back at my mom and I’s house for the holidays, made a comment about how much it sucks that I’m going to a community college instead of being able to enjoy the college experience. She said this in a very condescending way and I snapped. I yelled at her about how she’s extremely entitled and has always had everything handed to her on a silver platter and that not everyone is as lucky as her. I told her that she needed to get over her superiority complex and to enjoy her time now before the real world gives her an extremely harsh awakening. \n\nMy mother yelled at me for my response and while I’m not one to snap at people, but I don’t really feel guilty for what I said. I guess I was just wondering if i was justified or if me snapping at her was me just being an asshole. \n\nI apologize for any formatting as I’m on mobile! ",

      "description": "Apologies in advance for the length, but I think it's important to have some backstory with this... (Also for formatting, I'm on mobile).\n\n\nSo, as long as I've known him, my husband has been a heavy drinker. I always saw it that as long as it doesn't impact his health or our relationship, I can deal with it because I love him dearly.\n\n\nA few years ago, not long after we got married, I found him trying to flirt/ dirty talk with a old coworker through Facebook when he was heavily intoxicated. We got into a massive arguement, and he offered to stop drinking to prove it was a one time thing, and he wouldn't do it again. I agreed, and he stopped drinking for a while, but over a year/ few months the alcohol slowly started creeping back in until he was back to his old drinking habits.\n\n\nThen, a few months ago, I found he had been speaking to other women online (including saying he was single and getting nudes from them) when he was heavily intoxicated (he drank a bottle of vodka at home in the middle of the day when he was off work).\n\n\nI lost it, I got a hotel room for the night, and was planning to leave him, and then he went to hospital that night because he tried to kill himself. He admitted he had been battling severe mental illness (Borderline/ Schizophrenia) and had been using alcohol to control his issues because he was scared of getting any real treatment. \n\n\nI agreed to give him a chance, but he had to stop drinking, and he had to seek proper therapy. It's been a few months now, and he's on medication and has started seeing a Psych to get a proper/ more recent diagnosis. He hasn't started drinking again, BUT, he clearly wants to - this is where the AITA question comes up..... \n\n\nAt least once a week (sometimes daily) he makes a comment about how \"I could do this if I could drink\", or \"this would be so much easier if I could have a drink\", and it's starting to drive me to resent him. I know it must be frustrating to not be able to have a beer with his friends, but it just feels like he is constantly finding reasons to bring the topic up. I've called his bluff before and told hi m to go drink if that's what he really wants, but he told me 'that's not what he wants, and he's just saying what's on his mind'.\n\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for getting pissed off at my husband for repeatedly bringing up the fact he can't drink?\n\n\nTL;DR: my husband and I nearly broke up due to his infidelity when drinking, he told me he would stop drinking to prove he was getting better and would be faithful. Now he regularly makes comments about how he can't drink, which makes me fee guilty and frustrated, and causes me to lash out - AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a 21 year old female living with her parents. My relationship with my mother isn't good due to our vastly different personalities, she is very loud and stuff while I'm in the quiet side like my dad. My mom likes to announce every single thing she does while I just do it without making a big fuss about it, be it greeting other people, doing chores around the house, etc. Worth to mention that her whole family is like this and I'm also not on good terms with them because of these reasons but also worse stuff.\n\nYesterday we went to my nanny's house. She's pretty sick atm so I proposed to go and I brought some fruits and money for her medical needs. She lives with her daughter and her kids so when we got there I went and greeted all of them, just a simple \"Hey [redacted] *hugs*\" I did this with every person in the house, cause basic manners and I'm pretty close with the family.\n\n When we got to my nanny's room, my mother announced why we were there while simultaneously asking everyone if I had say hi to then \" *Did Frisk greet you? She never greets anyone, don't know what I did wrong while rising her* \" Repeat this for almost 7 people looking extremely uncomfortable.\n\nAt the end of the visit, my parents were already outside nanny's room while I gave her the money inside an envelope, as discreet as possible cause I know she hates getting money  \"that she didn't work for\". When I got out my parents were outside the house and my mother screamed *DID YOU GIVE HER THE MONEY?* I think that every single person in the block heard it and I was so embarrassed and upset because she made such a trashy action in a pretty sensible moment. She also did the *Did Frisk say goodbye to you?* for every single person in the house, again. \n\nIt's not the first time she does this, but it was so upsetting this time because I feel she ruined a quiet and special visit with someone I truly care about.\n\nWhen we got home I told her that I felt terrible because she was always treating me like a child and also making a big fuss over every single thing I did or didn't do and she just said \" Well, you're always silent with everything you do and I have to make sure you're behaving correctly.\" ??? What? Then I told her that just because I wasn't loud as her and her whole family doesn't mean I'm not doing what I'm supposed to, that there's no need for me to be loud about things and that I've always been quiet, that I just couldn't understand why she was so obsessed with me being like her family, that it wasn't gonna happen and that I was glad I have no ties to such a terrible family (I am adopted) Then she said a lot of stuff surrounding my \"hate\" towards her family and that if I'm against her family, I'm also against her.\n\nShe hasn't talked to me since last night and I feel that I did nothing wrong, but my dad told me that it was disrespectful of me talking to my mother like that. So that's my question, AITA?\n\nTL;DR My mother treats me like a child and expects me to act like her and her family, situation escalates to me telling her that's not gonna happen. Hurt feelings ensues.",

      "description": "This is a throwaway obviously...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add some background I have been with a guy, from here on out we will call him G, for 6+ years now. During the 6 years I have caught him cheating through facebook, sexting and sending nudes while requesting them. Now stupid me stayed with him and kept falling for the whole \"It will never happen again.\" About 4 cheats ago, he swore to me that he would cut his hair off if he ever cheated again. He LOVES his hair, it is about elbow length and I never had an issue with it. In fact I like guys with longer hair and have dated many who have had longer hair then me, so the hair itself is not the issue here. Well you guessed it, he continued to cheat, the last time proving that he went out and had a gf for 8 months that he would visit when he was suppose to be at work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took a very long time and a lot of trust talks to get back to normal with us. I now have full access to his stuff and I will admit, I do trust him again in this sense. You may say that's stupid and I would agree with you, but I do. Now the issue is at hand we have talked about marriage, he even purchased rings for us, but for the last 3 days we have been in a nonstop fight because of his hair. He never cut if off when it was discovered once again he cheated. I told him unless he cut his hair I would not agree to marry him because it is the last symbol to me of a broken promise of faithfulness and breaking his word. Mind you I told him he could grow it back if he wanted but he needed to complete his act. He refuses. Not only does he refuse to do this but he calls me vein and ridiculous that I won't marry him over his hair and that he simply cannot do it. I have literally told him that not only would I not marry him but it has gotten to the point that the fact he would rather not marry me and keep his hair shows me he could careless about me in general and that I would leave him over his fact. I mean honestly, it is hair, who keeps it over the person they want to spend their life with, but G made it clear he will never cut his hair even if I move out and leave him officially. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nG's friends all think I am an asshole over this, that how dare I force someone to cut their hair but again, it symbolizes that not only did he cheat on me but also cheated and broke his word that he would do it if he cheated again. How can I enter a marriage with someone who has permanent proof that he won't keep his word? How can I marry someone who is ok with me leaving him if it means he never has to cut his hair?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA here?",

      "description": "This is really long but I wanted to put as much info as possible:\n\nUniversity has been very busy for me, but I try to make time for my friends when the schedule fits. Sometimes I have to postpone a hangout to a later hour or reschedule for a different date, but majority of my friends understand as we have work, school, studying, etc. I've also been helping my best friend move out of my house into his own place as soon as possible. \n\nOne of my friends I've known since freshman year of high school asked to hang out on a Saturday. I said sure, and I was excited because I haven't seen her in a while. I can say that we're quite close, because I would walk past her house, text her if she's home, and if she was she'd open the door a minute later and invite me inside. Anyway, on the Saturday we were supposed to hang out, she says she can't. That's fine with me, I needed to study that night. \n\nThe next morning I'm at work and my best friend tells me that his house was ready for him to finally move into and so around lunch time, I message her if we can move it to a later hour. The response I got wasn't what I expected. She was upset and said \"nevermind, i'm going to do some homework.\" I realized that she was upset, and so I thought I'll give her some space and not text back.\n\nThe next day she messages me and says \"you really hurt my feelings after not hanging out with me yesterday.\" I told her that I did text her if we can move it to a later hour of the day and that I would have hung out with her all night. This led to her saying that she really wanted to hang out and she said she \"guessed that i didn't feel the same way.\" I was shocked and I told her to not jump to conclusions because that's not how I felt. She then emphasizes the time we were supposed to hang out, and said I pushed our plans out of the way, and then out of nowhere asks me if i don't like being friends with her anymore. I told her that's not why, and that i already told her my reason of pushing it to a later hour and that there was no hidden or underlying meaning in my words.\n\nShe asks me \"Why do i feel sad then?\" I tell her I don't know why and only she knows. She then tells me she feels like I'm unreliable and that I was more reliable. ??? I asked her in what ways can i improve and why was it upsetting that I postponed our hangout even though moving his things would only take 2 hours. She said she felt so alone and that no one wants to talk to her. I said that's not true, you have your online friends that you've even visited out of state and you skype with them every week. I also said that if she wanted to start making friends, why doesn't she try joining clubs at our university like I did because that's how I made more friends. She responded with how she doesn't want to make acquaintances, she wants friends (but acquaintances are a possible start to a friendship???) and that a friend is someone to count on and she was disappointed in me. \n\nI told her I was upset and I didn't want to say anything irrational and wanted to step out of the conversation. She just replied with ok. It's been a week and she finally messages me and says she's still upset but wants me to apologize because i'm \"not just a friend, but family.\"\n\nI feel like there is nothing to apologize for. I communicated with her clearly with why I was postponing our hangout. I find it hypocritical she was upset at me when we didn't even hang out on the original day we were supposed to. \n",

      "description": "Alright, let me try to repair some of the damage the title already did to my case. I'm a captain of my high school soccer team, and during the offseason, I'm responsible for running practices for the people who are interested in staying in shape and getting to know the team. The practices have been going well for months, until this one kid shows up.\n\nLet's call him Stu. Stu is a sophomore, and all of a sudden he wants to join the team. The first practice that he's there, he really just stands there and laughs, runs into people, kicks balls across the road, and tries to steal our training equipment by shoving it into his bag while giggling to himself. In other words, it's clear to me and everyone else that he's extremely high. Now, I have nothing against people smoking weed, but it's a little irritating for all of us when we're trying to run a practice for competitive varsity hopefuls, and he can't be bothered to put in an effort. I politely tell him this at the end of the first practice, and ask him to come back sober next time if he'd like to keep working with us. \n\nThe following weekend, he's back, and things seem fine for a while. He's able to run some drills for a bit, and it turns out he might be good enough to be second string goalie for our JV team. But after around forty minutes, he goes back into zoink mode and he seems even worse than last weekend. One of my teammates tells me that this time he ate a bunch of edibles before practice so that he could mess with me and the other captain, who helped convince me to talk to him the previous time. I get the brilliant idea to make the team run a hard-ass conditioning drill, just to see how strong his stomach is. Sure enough, we're only four laps in before he's puking over by the water fountains. \n\nI feel bad, but he didn't get hurt, succeeded in entertaining his teammates, and has now stopped coming to practices altogether. \n\nTLDR: A teammate showed up to a few of my self-organized practices high, and was very disruptive. I had the team run laps, knowing that his edibles might make him sick. Needless to say, I was correct. \n\nReddit, am I the asshole? ",

Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.",

      "description": "Im female and im pretty sure im straight. When I met the guy in question I didnt know he was trans until he told me but by then I already liked him. We're not dating right now or anything but he's my best friend and I only see him as a guy. I accidentally told my dad today and he went off at me even for the idea. He called me a lesbian and said that it would never work out and that I won't be happy. He said that I always find weird and disabled people to be friends with and that I need to grow up. He said if I eventually dated this guy he'd never meet him or want him in the house or anything. He called me selfish and said I was an embarrassment. I'm Christian and sometimes I already worry about dating this guy in the future because I get so confused about things. I don't think I'm a lesbian because ive never liked girls like that but I feel really confused and guilty right now. I feel alone and there's no one I can ask about this matter. I don't hate anyone from the LGBT community and I disagree with the Christians that do, but I have anxiety and it constantly tells me that I'm bad and going to Hell so I get really confused about this situation. I'm really depressed and scared right now. I don't want to lose a relationship with either my best friend or my parents\n\nAITA and is my dad just looking out for me? Would it be selfish of me to date this guy in the future?\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I'm kinda new to Reddit",

      "description": "Hi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend, we'll call him Jason, is a very kind person with a good sense of humor. He and I like to play video games together, along with our big group of friends who play games too, so we all have a big group chat to talk about our games. However, whenever somebody has a different opinion than him about things (like the video games for instance) he has to argue with them because he always thinks he knows everything or that he's always right. Our other friends noticed this too and don't like the attitude much either. Jason and I have had many disagreements and this sense of entitlement always comes back, and I guess this last one was the final straw for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat started this disagreement was pretty darn stupid, so that's why I didn't bother with it much. Well, what happened was that my phone broke, so I figured maybe I'd ask if he wanted to come with me to get a new phone then we could grab lunch after. So I texted him on my Mac (there's a messaging app there) and this was our conversation. For the record, like many people, I use and purchase Apple products, while he uses Android products, which is fine, I really couldn't care less what he preferred, it's just a phone. But that wasn't the case for him. I didn't want to upload a billion screenshots so I'll type it word for word on here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJason: I'm wondering. Why do u even use apple products, apple is shit. Just get an android \n\nMe: Meh. I like Apple products because I guess it's just easier for me, I suck with technology, lol\n\nJason: But why do u wanna waste all your money on stuff that doesn't even work even though it's easy to use\n\nMe: My personal preference is iPhones/Apple products, it's what I've always used so I just stick with it \n\nJason: Why do so many people complain about their iPhones breaking all the time then? With my android, u never have to worry about that stuff, there's a reason why there's less people complaining about their android than their iphone\n\nMe: Well, you can believe what you want, I know there's no use in arguing with you\n\nJason: What do u mean there's no reason arguing with me, just come up with a valid point. I already have Kevin (our other friend) saying stuff like that, and that's already fucking irritating. Stop making me look like an idiot\n\nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way. Allow me to explain, I feel that whenever we do not share the same opinion about things, no matter what it is, that you give off the impression that your opinion is always the right one and that there's no validity to my opinion. It's hard to discuss something when you're so entitled to your own opinion that mine is just falling on deaf ears.\n\nMe: And honestly, I always brush it off/don't even bother, because I already know the outcome. That's just how I feel. \n\nMe: Maybe you think of the situation differently, I'm just speaking from my perspective and how I feel about it.\n\nJason: So u are saying that u feel that I think I know what I'm talking about when we are discussing something. I'm giving my point of view, it's not that I'm psychotic, I can negotiate too\n\nJason: And again maybe u think of it differently or I'm forgetting something, but either way I know how to discuss, and I like to post my arguments first. I do read what you write, just putting this out there\n\nMe: Fair enough. Perhaps that's your intentions, but your execution gives off way different vibes. And I'm not the only one who thinks that\n\nJason: I'll just be more quiet then about things, problem solved. No other analyzing, just what I said\n\nMe: I was not saying your opinion doesn't matter, or that you should be quiet. I'm saying you should consider how you word your thinking. I like to hear what you think about things, don't get me wrong. It's about your execution of how you express that opinion is what gives off the condescending attitude. And I'm not trying to scold you or tell you how to act, you asked for what I meant so I'm giving you my answer\n\nJason: No i meant what I said. I'll just be more quiet, that's why I told u not to overanalyze it\n\nMe: That's not going to solve the issue at hand, but to each their own. Our friends and myself appreciate you talking to us, and again, I never said that you had to be quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think he understood my point. I didn't tell him he had to keep quiet or that his opinion didn't matter. My point was that the *execution* in which he chooses to *express* his opinion is the problem, not the opinion itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for addressing my friend's over inflated sense of entitlement? I brought it up in that moment not because of the dumb iPhone crap, but because the whole \"my opinion is the only right one\" has been bothering me and others for awhile now, and he probably didn't even realize it because nobody calls him out for it. And if I am the asshole, in what ways should I have worded my thinking differently?",

      "description": "Some buddies and one of their families and I went on a spring break trip recently and one of my other friends did not get invited and was kind of bummed out. It was not a \"you cannot go\" reason because it came down to space as we were driving about eight hours. Friend A (whom invited us and parents were driving), Friend B and Friend C and I all got to talking about what to do next spring break and we're thinking about a cruise. I asked if we should invite anyone else and Friend A immediately knew who I was asking in reference to. A said, \"I'd be fine with it but you guys are together a lot, would you be willing to?\" and I realized it was true. With some friends at college, we (myself and friend D who wasn't invited) were together a lot including school and the gym. He really doesn't go out on his own and refuses to hang out with others unless I'm going or I invite him. Looking back now I sometimes invited him to get him out because he wouldn't otherwise, but I don't want to force my other friends to have to put up with him on a vacation just because I'm afraid of his reaction if I weren't to invite him. I also wouldn't know how to tell him. Yes, he is friends with the other group, but not as close as I am to them. We also are all ok with keeping the group as small as possible to keep things simple as more people complicates things. So WIBTA for not inviting my friend to a trip with my other buddies?",

      "description": "To understand where I'm coming from here, I'm gonna need to tell you a bit about myself, so here goes:  \nI'm a  girl under 20  with rather low self esteem, REALLY socially awkward and tend to get emotional very quickly.  Great combination, I know. \n\nThis usually leads me into relationships that aren't exactly what you'd call healthy; my last one especially. I met the guy in a video game and his very chill demeanor was seemingly perfect for me, since my past relationship with what was basically a typical ragekiddo had not been ideal (massive surprise there). \n\nAfter weeks of trying to be as obvious as possible, I finally decided to just tell him and ... oh dear. Almost a panic attack. He then told me about how he had depression, which has never been treated (even though he told his family about it, they just kinda brushed it off). I did really like the guy though, so I thought I'd be able to handle it. Big Mistake. I tried my hardest; read up on how to support a partner with depression and such. Told him to go to get a diagnosis, that he wasn't alone, etc. Unfortunately, that didn't stop his feelings for me from numbing after less than a month. He basically told me that he just \"saw me as a friend\" and that he'd more or less been using me for nudes for some time. Needless to say, I was crushed. I was trying so hard to be there for him, but it all amounted to nothing in the end. Combine that with my wonderful sense of self-worth, and you've got yourself a girl that's basically crying for 3 days straight and telling herself that even if she tries her best, she'll never be good enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs luck would have it, he did this RIGHT BEFORE two events were taking place - the first one being going out to a restaurant with family friends; the second one the following day: grandma's birthday brunch. Neither went too well.   \n\n\nThe first night, I just ended up asking my dad to drive me home early; right after our friends arrived (they were late since they had locked themselves out of their flat). Seen as my mood was honestly terrible, he obliged. I really didn't want to ruin it for everybody by constantly being on the verge of crying.  \n\n\nThe brunch was a lot worse, since they couldn't really justify letting me off early for some reason. After a question by a relative of mine got me thinking my horribly failed relationship attempt, my eyes started watering again (entirely not their fault, the question wasn't even about relationships and nobody apart from me knew what was going on). \n\nMy mother then just told me that \"if I couldn't hold it in, I should just leave\". Fine by me; I didn't want everyone else to be sad too. So I went to a room upstairs and tried to do some maths while tears were still clouding my vision. After about 20 minutes, my mother decided that she finally wanted to know what was going on. After telling her what had happened, all she could muster was \"oh. well, that's difficult\" and a hug. The hug was comforting, at least. However, she quickly switched from that to telling me how selfish I was, that I wasn't the center of the world and that I \"didn't care about all those people downstairs that wanted to know how I was doing\". (If you're as confused as I am about how she jumped to that conclusion, we're in the same boat.)  I just told her that I did in fact care about them, but that I really wasn't feeling well at that time. She left me alone after that, until it was time to go home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe later told me that I needed to learn to just \"put on a fake smile and deal with it\" and how I had, at least partially, ruined both of those events for everyone else.  \n\n\nI mean, I do feel bad, since neither the family friends nor my relatives were the ones that hurt me. I can also accept that it was me that ruined the mood.  \nHowever, am I really being that selfish here?  \nAs I've said before, I've always had problems controlling my emotions well. And the way my Ex transitioned from loving and caring to \"you're nothing more than a friend\" within the span of a few days hit me REALLY hard. Not going was also not an option, since my parents basically forced me to come along.   \nI just... I don't know. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years, and this past year he gave me my birthday present 2 months late and did not get me a Christmas present. I am not materialistic, I would be happy if he made me a nice dinner (we both love to cook) or we just went out on a nice date of something I like to do like dancing or watching some classic cinema. Money is not an issue for him, he makes a decent salary (much more than me).  This Christmas I asked for a couple of passes to a yoga studio we both go to all the time, both because I love it and he has a membership there through work and it would be nice to take some classes together.\n\nThe thing is, I really like giving gifts that make people genuinely happy. I'm the type of person who, if I spot a nice shirt at a thrift store that's his size and style, I will buy it for him. Over the course of our relationship I have made him many things, and given him what I think are thoughtful, useful gifts or food (we both love to cook and eat). I realize that gift giving is not everyone's strength, that they might not have the time to find something that would make another person happy, or put in the effort or have the skill to make things. To compensate for this, I usually give him a few suggestions well in advance of something so he doesn't have to to go looking too hard\n\nOn the other hand it's not like he's NEVER given me anything, it just feels like he doesn't realize how much a small effort would mean to me. AITA for feeling let down about this? Sometimes I just feel like my effort isn't reciprocated but also I worry I'm being petty and holding little things against him.",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my suicidal friend?",
      "description": "So a bit of context, my close friend lives a pretty stressful life. He's a single dad to a 5 year old boy, doesn't have any family support, works full time at a shitty fastfood chain and studies part-time to try and better his situation. I know he struggles with anxiety at times and can get overwhelmed, which in the past I've come over with some wine or beer and have lended an ear and a shoulder. Recently his son was diagnosed with autism and I suspected that he was feeling stressed out dealing with this by himself. His partner passed away in an accident when their son was 2 and he hasn't bothered with dating or relationships since.\nWe've been close friends since high school, I was there when his son was born, and he met and approved of my boyfriend when we started dating 6 years ago. We've helped each other move, plan parties, studied together, I've babysat for him, he's literally like my brother.\n\n\nLast week he set set up a group chat, explaining that he has been having daily panic attacks and seeing his therapist weekly. The last time he saw his therapist, he opened up that he has been feeling suicidal for 2 years and has actually started planning \"a way out\" since he found out his son is autistic. He already feels inadequate as a father and feels he's failed/failing his son. That his son would be better off without him.\nHis therapist suggested seeing him at least twice a week and to set up a support system that he can message when he begins having those thoughts.\nSo he added me, another close friend of his (who I'm not close to), and 2 others who he's close to but don't live in the same city.\nHe explained everything I mentioned above and said that he would only use this chat when he feels he can't go on anymore. \n\n\nNow I'm empathetic but this year has been awful for me also, I don't feel like I can take on his struggles as well. I'm finishing my phd, there's been 5 deaths this year which have hit my boyfriend and I particularly hard, one suicide of a mutual friend, my dog died, I'm not working and there's the financial stress that goes with that and my partner has just started a new 6 figure job but is high stress and I've been dealing with that. I also suffer from anxiety which has been hard to manage this year because of all these stresses which I feel is important to mention here.\n\n\nSo I sent him a message separately, saying that I was sorry that he's going through this difficult time but because there are 3 other people he can rely on and that I'm not in a great place myself, if he could remove me from the group chat because just hearing that I could lose him stresses me out which with everything else going on is terrible for my anxiety. \nHe apologised saying that it wasn't his intention to do that to me and that he'll remove me.\n\n\nYesterday I received a message from his other close friend (same city, but not my close friend) calling me selfish. \nI asked what he was talking about. Our mutual friend had a bad day yesterday and wanted someone to talk to, and messaged this other guy. He was in a meeting and physically couldn't be with him but said he'd be over as soon as he could and to message me until he was there. That's when our suicidal friend told him that I couldn't be there because of my anxiety and what I told him.\n\n\nHe explained to this to his other friend that he was hurt and that he didn't he didn't want to \"burden\" me with this as I can't support him and that he didn't know if we'd ever be as close as we were.\nI feel pretty upset by this, because I still want to be his close friend but I just can't support him right now. I didn't mean to hurt him and sent him a message explaining that but he hasn't replied yet. So what do you think? Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I dated this guy for a couple years. Near the beginning of our relationship, he had some financial struggles. I wasn’t hurting for money (and he knew that but never asked) so I let him know that he can ask to borrow money from me if needed. He declined at first but ultimately ended up borrowing some money from me (a couple thousand). I understand and accept that I shouldn’t have lent such a large amount of money, but I loved him and knew it wasn’t in his character to just take the money and run. We had agreed to have him pay me back within a couple months (monthly payments). He was working part-time but wasn’t making much more than minimum wage.\n\nWeeks later, he told me that he wouldn’t be able to pay me back per our payment plan and asked if we could push it back. I told him to take his time and that I didn’t expect him to pay it back any time soon. I wanted him to focus on school and work—I didn’t want him to stress about owing me money. I saw our relationship continuing far into the future so it didn’t bother me. We never rly spoke about the borrowed money again throughout the rest of our relationship. He maybe brought it up a total of 3 or 4 times saying that he felt bad he couldn’t pay me back right away.\n\nA year later, he took a break from school and began working full time. I know he had made enough to pay me back but I knew he wasn’t planning on working when he went back to school so the money he was making during his gap year was to sustain him for the duration of his schooling once he returned. A year later, he went back to school and our relationship was rocky. It had now been about two years since I’ve lent him the money. I broke up with him because he wasn’t putting effort into our relationship. We ended on good terms but kinda awkward. We talked a lot at the beginning of our breakup but now we don't talk and he never brought up the money. About two months after we broke up, I asked him if he could pay me back. At the time I asked him, we were still talking every now and then. When I brought it up, he apologized, said he forgot and asked if I wanted the money in full now. Knowing his situation, I said that I didn't expect him to pay it all back now. He said he could maybe start paying me back in the summer but to let him know if I need some of it or all of it now. I told him I understood his current financial situation and didn't expect to take money away from him right now when he doesn't have an income. He said thanks for understanding, and we haven't really talked since then.\n\nIt's been a while since we last talked and it doesn't seem he's making an effort to maintain our friendship. The last message I sent him (unrelated to this) was left on read and it doesn't look like we'll be talking or hanging out any time soon. Since we aren't really friends now, WIBTA if I asked him to begin payments now? I'm not in dire need of the money but the extra money peace of mind would be nice.",

      "description": "Alright so first if I feel myself like I didn’t do anything wrong but from my friend’s attitude I’m starting to wonder if maybe I actually did??\n\nAnyways Im (19/F) at my last uni year and so far I’d never managed to make any real friends at my school (I tend to be more friendly w my sports buddies) but this year I met a girl (22) who was really nice and had the same interests as me. We started hanging out, watching movies together, talking etc...\n\nSo one day we go out with our classmates to a pub and I don’t drink much but she gets completely drunk. Since she lives really far away and there’s no bus at that time of night, I offer her to come to my place and sleep it off. She does come and I do my best to be a decent host, making her a bacon and egg midnight snack and getting her room ready.\n\nThree weeks after that we go out again, this time to another student’s place and then to a club and, this time, we planned for me to come back to her place. Since that night she has been avoiding me so I must have fucked up in some way, I just can’t figure out how. Here’s what I did :\n\n- I hit on a guy and left her w one of her friends for about one hour but we met again at the club and I left the guy behind, she didn’t seem bothered by that since she was w other people we knew.\n\n- I got really (REALLY) drunk during the night and ended up being sick on the way home. I’m not an annoying drunk, I’m the \"super honest and affectionate\" kind but I was really fucking plastered and she wasn’t.\n\n- I can’t remember maybe 20-30mn of that night so I might have done something then? I just know that I added the guy I mentioned before on Facebook but idk what else I did. She hasn’t mentioned anything when I asked.\n\nAnyways she hasn’t been talking to me since then unless I try to contact her and usually her answers are pretty dismissive when, before that night, we were really friendly. Was I an asshole for getting drunk like that? Since she did the same when she came to my place I assumed this would be fine but, obviously, I did something wrong. She never mentioned not wanting me to drink before coming to her place either.\n\nIt’s been about ten days since that night and I still have no idea of what I did that caused this.",

We were starting to think you were a bad girlfriend.\" \n\n\nI told her why I was busy- my grandfather has ALS and him and my grandmother recently had a slip and fall incident, which my grandmother is now getting surgery for. My grandfather is unable to care for himself so I'm spending pretty much all of my free time caring for him and it's been really tolling on my family and I. \n\n\nMy s/o didn't say anything to her about anything I was going through prior to this conversation. Basically, his mom would ask \"Hey, what's up with  your girlfriend? we haven't seen her in a while\" and he'd just not tell them anything, which gave them the impression that I was blowing him off. \n\nAfter this, him and I had a conversation about our relationship, he admitted to me that he vents to his mom about me and that she doesn't think that we should be together. She told him to break up with me. \n\nToday is his birthday and he wants me to come over, not for a party or celebration or anything, but just to hang out. If it were a birthday party, then I'd be willing to put it aside, I suppose. He said she's not going to be home, but, I'm not comfortable because I don't feel welcomed in her home. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR; Boyfriend's Mom has a bad opinion of me, to where she's openly said she doesn't support our relationship. BF lives with his mom and I don't feel comfortable coming over. ",

A model that lives half-way around the world. \n\nThe dude's totally over the moon for this lady, obviously, but when he revealed this information I (OK, maybe not so politely) expressed my opinion that, in all probability, she views him as a particularly attached client and will take the shirt off his back before they ever meet up in person.  \n\nFor his side of things, they do text a shit ton via kik, and exchange sincere-sounding words of affection and everything. But the financial component makes me think this is patronage, not a real relationship, and he's gotten things confused. Obviously he has not taken this well. And I have entertained the idea that I may be just the world's biggest asshole for saying so, love conquers all, etc. But I am in fact worried about the guy. AITA?",

I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she’s not attractive if she doesn’t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I’m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It’s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I’m being honest, that’s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we’ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n",

She asks if I can take her and pick her up and I said I can drop you off but I'll be pretty buzzed by the time you leave so you'll have to get a ride back from someone else.  She says okay and the night goes on and I drop her off.  She then texts me around midnight and says \"so you're just gonna make me walk home\".  Keep in mind it's less than a 10 minute walk for her in a very safe part of town.  So I said yeah I literally told you I wasn't going to be able to drive and pick you up, 'm not getting a DUI.

I started thinking about how difficult her life was as someone who is in a wheelchair, so we began the conversation about various things that we had experienced with her and how she bullied me. Zoe brought up how she would wear warm up pants to practice but couldn’t really warm up her legs. i laughed, pretty hard. Anna started getting upset but i just assumed it was about something that had occurred the period before hand. I asked her what was wrong and if she was OK and she said yeah. about five minutes later after Zoe and I have been joking around about Jamie and how she would roll over peoples feet, anna yells at us saying how we’re being assholes and that she has hearing problems and she’s self-conscious about it.\nwe get silent and stop talking about it but she begins to cry.

      "description": "I started college last fall and found out that my parents are not willing to help me at all, nor did they put any money aside at all for me or my brother. My family did struggle financially up until about 5 years ago. My parents now, combined, make over $150,000 a year. This completely destroys any chance of me getting any financial aid from the government. I do have one scholarship and I'm looking into getting as many as I can to help limit the loans. When discussing it with my parents, they said that they feel it's ridiculous that parents are expected to help put their kids through school and that it should be entirely my responsibility. Despite that, they feel that since I live with them, they require me to be in school part time, and work full time (or vice versa), which, too a certain extent, i agree is fair. My parents also stated that they, \"Shouldn't have to dip into their retirement funds to put me through college\". It should be noted they just spent thousands of dollars to remodel the garage and are planning on spending hundreds more on it in the next coming weeks. So my question is, AITA for feeling it's unfair for them to not help pay at all, leaving me to go into thousands of dollars of debt when I feel it isn't necessary? ",

      "description": "Backstory: Me (22F) and my boyfriend (M25) have been dating around a year. We live around 100+ miles from his family. We go and visit his family as often as we can, but it is still sometimes several weeks before we can go see them. When we do get together, we have a great time and everyone gets along. The only person I have any problems with his is mom, as she’s constantly comparing me to his last girlfriend. The ex is studying to be a doctor, 4.0 GPA, captain of her sports team, and a very religious person. I’m currently taking a break from school, due to monetary issues, but I do have my own goals and dreams to take care of, I’m just a little off schedule. Of course whenever my bf’s mom does this, he stands up for me, but it still is a constant part of my relationship with his mother.\n\nAnyways, my boyfriend’s birthday is today. We had planned to spend his birthday with his family this Sunday, and spend a few days up in their city, but his mom wanted to plan a surprise party and show up to our apartment on his birthday. \n\nI made sure my bf had the day off, and I tried my best to get the day off, but I still have to work until 3pm. I tried to work out several plans with his mom, to make sure he was out of the house until 3. However, instead of waiting for me, his family has decided to throw his party without me there, including his birthday lunch and everything. \n\nI feel a little snubbed, because his mom already doesn’t like me, because I just can’t compare to his last girlfriend. The fact that she did not try to meet me half way and just cut me out entirely really upsets me. And I just feel like I’m purposely being not included, and his mom would have gone out of her way to make sure she was there. Of course I’m not going to let this get in the way of giving my boyfriend the best birthday ever, but am I being the A-hole and overreacting?",

      "description": "I was a shy 17 year old girl going to College in Texas. I was dealing with a lot of anxiety problems back then, and couldn’t talk. Speaking to people almost hurt. If I was spoken to, I only responded in short 1-3 word replies. Being around people gave me a lot of anxiety. \n\nI made a friend with a guy in my political science class. Let’s call him Dave. Our usual seats were next to each other. He was very friendly, but noticed I didn’t talk very much. Even so, he persisted in trying to make friends. He encouraged me to communicate via notes. We became good friends, and I learned to be a little more comfortable around Dave and people in general. I’d often walk to his apartment to study together and play games. Occasionally I’d spend the night at his apartment if it got too late. I thought our relationship was purely a friendship. Dave asked me if I wanted to date around the time I turned 18 and I declined. We were still good friends. He eventually started dating this sweet Filipina girl.\n\nDave would gush about her often, and show me his girlfriend’s awesome drawings. I was really happy for them! I was eager to meet his girlfriend, and asked to meet her because she sounded really cool. I probably only saw her once or twice though. Around 2016 they got engaged. I was very happy for them and wished them happiness!\n\nOne day during Winter I went over to Dave’s apartment to hang out and play Super Smash Bros. I had so much fun I didn’t notice the time fly by. Nighttime came and Dave offered me to spend the night because it was dark and very cold outside. I accepted. \n\nDave’s fiancée was out of town at the time. He asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. I said no. \n\nI was really innocent at that age, and I truly believed that if we had a heartfelt talk I would be able to help him sort out his priorities and help him realize why that’s a bad idea. I wanted to be a good friend. I asked Dave if he really loved this girl, and if he was willing to spend the rest of his life with her. He said yes. I asked him why would he try to cheat if he really felt that way. He said something like, “I want to live a little before I settle down.” I told him that if he wanted to “live a little” before settling down, then he shouldn’t have gotten engaged. I told him that he should really reflect on our conversation, and really think about what’s important to him. I went to sleep. \n\nAfter that, we kinda drifted apart. I moved away to a different state.\n\nI never told his fiancée what happened. \nI recently saw a Facebook post that they got married early last year. Looking back on it, I feel kinda bad. Maybe I should have told her back then. If he asked someone else, he might’ve actually cheated on the poor girl. Maybe he even asked someone else after I said no. \n\nOr maybe he actually took my words to heart. I sure hope so...\n\nI feel like if I say anything about it now, then I’m DEFINITELY the asshole.",

      "description": "Generally, anyone with a mental disability that impairs their social functions annoys me a lot. \n\nStory time: There’s this one kid in a club for an engineering challenge thing, and while I was sharing my idea with my group, he just walks over and sits on the chair about 2 inches from me and starts talking about some idea that was  still on the monitor (we were drawing out basic schematics on ms paint). We were in the verge of throwing out the idea that was originally on there, but he was suggesting an alternative to it that simply wouldn’t work. He later explained that he was kicked out of his other group because “they had too many people”(I bet it was for other reasons). Now he is on our team (sort of forced our hand because we were the only other group of 3 and all other were group of 4). We explained to him why it wouldn’t work, but we could tell he wasn’t getting it. He is making this challenge infinitely harder because now we have to explain why all his ideas won’t work and why our ideas do work(in short, the goal is to build a plane out of x materials in x weeks and have it fly the farthest. We are on a time constraint and don’t have the time to have to stop and explain everything over and over again). I’m seriously considering quitting the club because of this, as it’s taken most of the fun out of it. He also keeps doing weird things like pushing a rubber ball into our backs and saying he’s giving us a back massage (most of these issues involve him getting into our personal space). Am I the asshole for feeling this way?",

      "description": "First Poster here-\n\nLONG READ\n\nSo I live together in a big house with five other people (so 6 people in total). Each of us has his/her separate bedroom and we have an extra spare bedroom if friends come over.   \nSo this has been going on for great for year and a half now. This week however my roommates were on ski-holiday and celebrating new years eve in France together. I couldn't go because had to work the 31st Dec and the 2nd January but no hard feelings and i wished them the best.  \n\n\nSo this new year eve i get home with my girlfriend at 3 am because we celebrated with her friends and I see that the front door is open which was weird because i always lock it extra when I leave. I rushed in the house to see if anything was missing but everything was in place. Already then I thought something was off and I was mad at myself because I thought I didn't close the door well and you things could've gone wrong. but again nothing was missing. So we go to sleep because it was already late and we got woke up at 5 am because I hear rumble in the hallway. I got up because in my sleep I thought it were my roommates that because of some reason came home early from their ski-trip (which was weird because it was new year eve). So I open my bedroom door and I see 3 guys I have never seen before in my life  going up the stairs. I thought they were burglars  so I went after them and yelled at them that they better get the hell out of my house, which to me is a normal reaction when 3 strangers are in you house in the middle of the night.   \nOne guy turns around and says\" I'm X, I'm the brother of Roommate. Didn't he tell you we were staying here tonight\"  \nI already heard about X before but never seen him before and sure as hell didn't know that he and his friends were staying over tonight.   \nX has a weird name in real life so I knew he couldn't have made it up so this was really the roommates' brother. I'm like no WTF i didn't know? Why didn't roommate tell me?  \n\n\nSo i go to my room and calm down my girlfriend because she got her phone out to call the cops ( which is also a normal reaction and is in hindsight even a better reaction than mine)  \nI call my roommate in the middle of night because I'm pissed off and why he didn't tell me because it never has been an issue to have sleepovers before. He's like sleepdrunk and is just going I'm sorry i forgot to tell you. So next morning I hardly slept after it because I've been so scared that night and so full of adrenaline. So i get up,still upset about it all start doing regular wake-up stuff breakfast,coffee,etc So at noon the 3 guys were still sleeping and i woke them up because I wanted them to go home because I've had it with the whole situation so I told them: Look guys it's better if you start packing and go home because you scared me to death last night, it's not your fault  but I'm really don't want any visitors in my house at the moment.\" So guys get up, grab their stuff and leave. It was then that i noticed that they had so much stuff with like air-mattresses etc so Then it came to me that they must've come in last night (because roommate gave them a key) when I was already gone and left the front door open.   \n\n\nSo last night roommate comes back home from ski-trip and wants to talk to me about the whole situation. So basically he tells me that I've shouldn't have reacted that way to strangers in the house in the night. He says I've just should've gone up to them and asked who they were and what they were doing here.  \nHe says I shouldn't have called in the night either because he felt bad the rest of the day and that I shouldn't have told his brother to go home the next morning because he's an insecure snowflake and got scared.  \nSo I tell him that I don't have any issue with his brother at all and his brother is welcome but that next time i would like to know beforehand (like we always do). I'm not telling him that he has to ask permission to let his brother sleep here I'm just telling him that I would like to know next time so I don't think we have burglars in our house.  \nThen he says he didn't think I would be sleeping home that night so he didn't want to bother me with it which to me is also wrong because I think I have the right to know when someone is in our house. It has never been an issue before to let someone sleep here. The guys even would have gotten eggs and bacon the next morning if I wouldn't have been this upset.\n\nHe doesn't seem to get that I was really frightened that night and reacted out of impulse (fight or flight) and that the whole situation came out of him not telling that his brother would be sleeping over\n\nTLDR: roommate let's people sleepover without me knowing and it frightened me because i thought I had burglars in the house and now he is mad because of my reaction",

      "description": "AITA for getting offended by my [26F] SO’s [26M] refusal to let me snowblow our driveway?\n\n\nMy SO and I just purchased a home and are spending our first winter in it. We were graciously gifted a John Deere TRS 32 snowblower by his father. The other day while driving home from grocery shopping we were talking about how my father said our snowblower was too big for our 4 car single garage driveway. My SO said how my father was just jealous since my Dad’s snowblower was so much smaller, which honestly it is and he probably is jealous. I replied that ours needed to be so heavy duty with chains on the wheels since our driveway is on a hill. To give you and idea, I have to use the e-brake when I park so as to not slide down or have a jolt when I switch transmission and when it’s icy it’s dangerous getting the mail. \n\nMy SO then said that without a doubt no female can safely handle that thing. Quickly he corrected himself almost in the same breath that some women could probably do it, but not me. He then said the test of usage depends on whether or not he can overtake my bicep muscles with just his three fingers. For reference I’m about 5’3 and weigh 125lbs, can carry about 40-50lbs for a few minutes and then have to take a break. \n\nNow I’ve been the most DIY and fixer-upper of our home and previous apartment. I used to mow my dads half acre lawn using a rider mower and also snowblow during the winter all myself since 18. I’m a highly capable individual, or so I think. I believe that I could use the snowblower even with my current strength (which is not currently passing the usage test) just by using common sense and the mechanics of the blower (ie. use the proper speeds to navigate and turn the machine as well as the reverse to slow down). He is telling me that there is no way I’d be able to stop the machine from rolling down into the street if I were to snowblow by myself. He’s concerned about the momentum and condition of the driveway preventing me to stop it from moving. With all the functions in mind, he still thinks I could not stop an uncontrolled slide down the driveway since I lack the muscle strength.  \n\nSo I called him sexist and was offended that he had so little faith in me to properly handle this machinery given my previous experience. I feel like he was being an asshole for using my gender and then lack of physical strength as the reason I can’t help clear our driveway. He thinks I’m being an asshole for being illogically upset at his resistance to me using it due to failing his strength test, and insists it’s not because I’m female, but because I don’t have the required muscle strength in his opinion.\n\nSo, AITA for being offended? \n\n\n",

      "description": "For a bit of context, we are twenty years old female fraternal twins. We are really close, though we argue a lot, partly because \"she doesn't know how to express her feelings so she becomes agressive, that's how she is\" (according to my mother).\n\nI'm going on a trip to Australia for five months in a few weeks. My sister is really angry at me and keeps telling me that I am abandoning her (well both my parents also keep telling me that they're going to be really sad without me). She keeps attacking me and I am tired of it. Today, she yelled at me and called me disgusting and selfish. The reason ? I booked a flight  when she won't be able to come and see me off at the airport. I feel really guilty about that: I knew it would be difficult for her to come, but the flights were less expensive and as my father paid for the plane tickets, I wasn't going to make him pay more than necessary. Furthermore, I couldn't choose the day: I'm invited on the 25th of January, so I have to leave on the 24th. \n\nNow I'm split between two feelings. On the first hand I feel really guilty for being that selfish and for making her suffer. I care for her a lot (although she says I don't) and it just makes me grieve  to see that I harmed her so much because I decided to put myself first. Then on the other hand I'm really angry at her for insulting me and using her sadness as an excuse for this behavior. I also feel like I have my own life and that sometimes, I should also be allowed to do what is easier/better for me...\n\nSo, according to you, Am I the asshole for leaving my twin to go on a six month trip and for putting my own selfish desires first ? \n\n(If you think my text isn't really clear, feel free to ask questions)",

      "title": "AITA for getting irritated when my boyfriend wants attention while I’m busy?",
      "description": "Let’s start with that I (17F) love my boyfriend (17M) very much. We’ve been together for 1.5 years. We’re planning to get our own apartment and everything. He currently lives with me and my family so that’s definitely important for my questions. \n\nI bought him a TV and PS4 so he wouldn’t be bored sitting on the phone all day in my room or just us doing the same things over and over. (it’s a little harder to spend time with each other outside of my room because neither of us have a car and we also don’t want to spend money on too many things since we’re saving for an apartment.) I’ve bought him a lot of games and he’s bought some himself, even though we share money. He has a headset to talk to his friends online and also talks to them on FaceTime pretty often. I don’t mind any of this because I love my alone time and can find something satisfying to do without his full attention. But, if he wants to watch a movie or YouTube videos or something with me then I’m up for it, usually.\n\nThat’s where part of the problem comes in. He’s very affectionate and sensitive when it comes to us, especially since this is the first real and actually good relationship each of us has had. For example, one game he plays a lot is naruto vs boruto shinobi striker. Each match is like 4-7 minutes long I believe. I don’t have a problem with him playing his game and I let him know if I want some attention but I’ll always understand if he’s occupied right at that moment. Trust that I don’t just sit in bed bored waiting for him to talk to me. I do schoolwork, watch movies, scroll through Instagram, etc. \n\nProbably every other match and sometimes after every match, he’ll get up and interrupt what I’m doing. Sometimes he plays different games but he’ll still do the same thing. By interrupt I mean if I’m watching a movie on my laptop he’ll move it out of the way without pausing it and get on top of me and expect cuddles, kisses, or whatever. Or if I’m on the phone with a friend (not often) he’ll try to convince me to spend time with him even though he wasn’t asking to do anything when I was just watching tv or on instagram. And it’s like when I tell him hold on or wait he’ll get kind of upset and say something like “okay I’m just gonna go back and play my game”. It just pisses me off because I’m doing something and he’ll come and interrupt and when I try to pause whatever I’m doing then he makes me feel bad because I don’t want to give him my attention right away when it’s completely unexpected. \n\nStuff like this also happens when we’re laying in bed together. Like if we’ll be watching a movie together or just on social media enjoying each other’s company and he’ll just decide that we’re not doing it anymore and it’s time to just lay down, cuddle, and do nothing. I know sometimes he gets stressed and overwhelmed so that’s why he wants a lot of attention so he can take his mind off of it but I can’t help but getting irritated when I’m interrupted. It irritates me more when I tell him I can’t do what he wants to do at the time and he gets upset and makes me feel guilty. \n\nHe doesn’t appreciate alone time as much as I do and I understand that. We definitely are compatible but this is just something that bothers me everyday. I’m happy when I can get like 30-45 mins without being interrupted. \n\nNot to mention that when he gets off the games it’s only for 30 seconds to a minute. This bothers me because usually I have my bed made and my room clean but when he gets off the game he’ll come and get under the covers and then leave a minute later and I have to fix the bed again. I tell him how much it annoys me because he’s going to get up anyways and he gets irritated because he “can’t get in his own bed” \n\nI wouldn’t mind being interrupted as much if it meant he was going to spend time with me for longer than 2 minutes at the most. \n\nBonus: sometimes I’ll be napping and he’ll wake me up to make him something to eat. It pisses me off so much to be woken up because he’s fucking hungry ugh. Don’t get me wrong tho, it isn’t the typical “make me a sandwich” situation. It’s more like it’s tense and awkward for him being here so if he cooks by himself then a lot of blame and shit talking will be thrown at us. If you want to know more about that then just read my first post about our situation living here. \n\nAnyways, AITA for this? This isn’t a shitpost. This has been ongoing since he got his PS4 and I honestly can’t tell if I’m being a huge bitch for not giving him attention when he comes to me for only a few minutes at a time. ",

      "description": "‘Twas’ NYE of 2018, around 5-6pm and a good 7-8 of my close friends were in our marquee at a festival inside our campsite area. Tunes are pumping and the drinks are flowing, a great time. When out of nowhere wonders up this stranger to us and insists we sing a song with her, I begrudgingly agree given it’s within the spirit of New Years so I start to produce Kanye Wests Gold Digger and a few of us join in with this off-key slapper. One would think she’d leave now but no. \n\nShe Moseyed on over and awkwardly asked if she could have a drink and chill for a bit with us, the group let’s her request hang in the air like the steaming pile of shit it was. Until one of the more polite girls in our group collapsed and said yeah of course...20 minutes pass and I’m trying to enjoy my New Years pre drinks with my best friends and this loner has thrown off the whole vibe. At some point she asked if everyone was okay if she stayed a bit longer to which I said something like “ we’re actually in the middle of a kinda intimate thing so...” she called me rude and carried on eating my packet of crisps. \n\nSeething in my seat I ask her when she was planning on leaving and she calls me an asshole and continues to chomp down on my crisps. A good friend suggests I take a pee with him as he can see I need to cool off a bit, another joins us on our bush wee and we all agree we gots to get rid of this bitch. \n\nWe storm back into the campsite and my pal politely ask her if we can walk her back to her friends in case she was lost, she insisted she was fine her with her new friends. She then asked who wants to sing another song, I thought that was a terrific idea as I produce a melodic “ get the fuck out of my campsite, get the fuck outta here”. Muffled laughter ensues and she sits there eating my crisps taking it on the chin and doesn’t leave, she stands up and starts ranting at me about respect and how much of an asshole I am, I snap and quite bluntly tell her to get her filthy hands off my crisps and get the fuck outta here\n\nShe walked off in tears and a few of my lady friends told me I was overly aggressive and a bit of an A- hole even though nobody wanted her there\n\nThankyou to anyone who has read this far, please deliver your gracious verdict ",

Sometimes, Hispanic customers will come in and I default to English. They reply back in Spanish and i will reply in English, usually one word or two word responses (thank you!, have a nice night!, etc.).\n\nI do know very little Spanish, which is usually Hola or Como te puedo ayudar, but it quickly dissolved into my barely being able to conversation, so I feel more comfortable speaking out in my native tongue. \n\nThey aren’t ever angry at me and usually do leave with a smile and good attitude, but I feel like I might be kind of an asshole because I didn’t learn as much Spanish as I could have and choose to not embarrass myself.

      "description": "Obligatory apology for mobile formatting\n\nSo a couple days ago r/blackpeopletwitter made a statement that [“BPT is now for black folks only.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPTmeta/comments/b82dks/announcements_blackpeopletwitter_is_now_for_black/). Many people, as did i, thought this was an april fools joke. However, as of today what i thought was a joke had continued and the sub has gone private. The mods stated that “If your white, you may be afforded access if you appropriately apologize for your whiteness. White will be admitted on a case-by-case basis.  “If you’re white, you may be afforded access if you appropriately apologize for your whiteness. Whites will be admitted on a case-by-case basis.” \n\nNow to a white high schooler, this was incredibly racist towards me and i felt attacked. Just kidding! I was disappointed and kind of worried but i wasn’t attacked. I enjoy seeing posts from there and i’ve learned more about racism and social injustice and the like from there. Now, as the sub was a nice source of entertainment and enlightenment, I was disappointed. And as a white kid from the south surrounded by people who say racism isn’t real now and white privilege doesn’t exist, i was worried that ignorant people like myself would lose a valuable resource and window into another culture. \n\nSo, i sent the mod who made the original post a message to “apologize for my whiteness.”\n\n[Pictures of my message](https://imgur.com/a/G0MEuvm)\n\nNot only did i not get a response, i was blocked by the moderator and banned from BPT. \n\nSo i’m really worried now that i was racist or ignorant or something like that in my message. I truly do want to be my best self and be as loving to people of all color and types as i can, and now i fear that i’m not nearly as accepting as i hoped i was. so AITA?",

      "description": "Hi, I’m not a frequent poster but I’ve been really questioning this situation for awhile.\n\nOver the Summer I worked at a camp, and I lent one of my coworkers my car last minute because his ride to an event he had the weekend off for flaked last minute. I was friends with the guy and trusted him, so I told him to just bring it back with a full tank of gas and it was cool. When he got back with my car, he told me that it was acting strange on the highway and took it to a local repair shop, where a technician did a full alternator replacement. He did not contact me about any of this until he got back, which I didn’t think much of at the time because we had little access to our phones during the day. \n\nHe wants me to pay the majority of the $350 the replacement costs, but I have some issues with this. First of all, the car, even though it has a lot of mileage on it, had never had any issues with the alrernator before. He also didn’t make any effort to contact me, despite the fact that he could have reached the camp even without me having my phone on person. Also, a little while after the alternator was replaced, i had to have the serpentine belt worked on, which i’m suspicious may have been damaged when the repairs were done. Most worrisome to me, I’m not even sure if the alternator replacement was necessary. All my coworker said was that the car was “actig weird” on the highway and that he thought it needed to go to a mechanic. \n\nTLDR i lent a coworker my car and he had repairs done on it that i did not consent to and may not be necessary.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for the majority of this?\n",

      "description": "Here's a little backstory: I am currently visiting my home country Uzbekistan from the US, Having the opportunity to even go to the US from my country is considered a big deal here.,. I haven't seen my little cousin in around 4-5years. He is 14 years old and once he found out I had an instagram he immediately made one.  If im completely honest with you, He is SUPER annoying and is constantly making dirty jokes which aren't even funny. He has this annoying habit of bringing up the fact that I came from the US and sarcastically saying that im cooler and richer than he is for that fact. (I'm not even rich!)  Ever since I came from the US he would constantly make jokes about how rich I am (which im not), and jokingly ask for 50$, this pisses me off (because he literally makes these jokes everyday), and when he notices that he says something like \"Alright sorry, you're cool you're from America, and we're not.\" This further pisses me off.  Now to the instagram part, when he made one he obviously requested to follow me, I thought about it for a minute but eventually just accepted it and followed him back.  Next day when I see his profile I noticed he followed all my followers, I was kind of annoyed ( BUT THIS WASNT THE TIPPING POINT.) I was already having thoughts about blocking him but what made me super pissed was that he constantly kept showing me pictures of some of my girl friends and would say some annoying dumb shit like \"Is this your girlfriend??\" I'd say \"No\" to which he'd reply to \" Don't lie.\" (he did this with multiple girls throughout the day) That was the last straw, so later on I blocked him, and when he found out he got kind of upset and hasnt talked to me in a while, I feel like what I did was kind of harsh but I honestly dont want to unblock him, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA- Am I the Asshole for Emailing My Teacher Asking About Last-Minute Grade Adjustments?",
      "description": "Ok, first some background for the teachers out there who might think this sounds ridiculous. \nThis professor (let’s call her B) is a known NIGHTMARE. I have been in her class for only a semester (with another to come) and I’ve been through hell and back trying to stay on her good side. Here are a list of incidents (just in my class alone, I’ve heard horror stories from other periods but I’ll only include mine for credibility’s sake):\nA student asked a clarifying question about a mistake the the teacher made in defining the variable type “Integer.” Said student was pulled out of class for 20 minutes (by B) and screamed at emphatically for disrupting the class and “confusing other students” who didn’t have as much experience with programming. Despite the fact that everyone in the class had been in programming classes for at least a year, she refused to acknowledge the fact that she was teaching students something that was blatantly wrong, instead choosing to make an example of the student and send him (crying) to the counselors office. Not only was this hugely disruptive to the class, but it was disgusting to see a kid who has never intentionally disrespected anyone in his life be reprimanded as if he was a multiple-offense derelict set on ruining our learning environment. \nAnother offense, happened today. A girl came back from lunch a minute (one single minute) late. Teacher let her back in the classroom and gruffly told her to go to her seat. The girl, let’s call her C, said “I’m sorry I’m late. I was in the bathroom, and I didn’t know when lunch ended until the bell had already rung.” \nThis is completely understandable. We were on a different schedule today because of inclement weather, and no one really knew the times. For such a minor transgression, any other teacher would have let it go. Not B, of course. The girl was already visibly upset, as B had been known to blow up on late students in the past. B proceeded to launch into a rant about how inappropriate it was for the girl to try and justify her actions, and C burst into tears. B finished her rant by informing C that she was going to be marked late, unexcused. C continued to cry until B yelled at her to get out of the classroom, which she did, running out sobbing as the other students watched in horror.\nFor the sake of length, I’ll refrain from telling the other litany of stories I have. But as I tell my piece, keep in mind that upon reporting her to admin I was informed that there are countless other reports being sent in about her.\n\nSo, cue me. I love learning, I tend to be an attentive student, generally interested in my classes, and always trying to stay on the right side of my teachers. I’m not disruptive, disrespectful, and I mind the rules of all my teachers, regardless of whether I like them or not. I knew B was going to turn out as a ball-buster from the first day I was in class with her, so I made it my mission to stay above the fray and keep on her good side. \nI get A’s on all my assignments. I bring her gifts (thoughtful ones, in her case I most recently bought her a fuzzy blanket in her favorite color, red), and generally defend her to the other students when I hear them murdering about her temperament. I respect her. Never in my life would I do or say something to cross her, because it would sabotage all the work I’ve done to maintain a good relationship with her. \nNow, the end of the quarter is today (Tuesday) and grades are due this Friday. It was supposed to end last Wednesday, but due to inclement weather it was extended. I was resolving some grade discrepancies with teachers, clarifying my quarter grades with some teachers who hadn’t updated their portal in a while. I was checking my grade in B’s class when I noticed that despite getting a 100 on my final for the semester, my grade had gone down to a 76. Now, I have never brought home a C in my LIFE. My parents are ultra strict, and I fear serious, SERIOUS consequence when I make bad grades. Bad test grades are grounds for severe punishments, but a C for the quarter, immortalized on my transcript forever? Death sentence. Turns out, I had missed several assignments early in the quarter, which she had just put in. I felt blindsided. They were easy to miss, but the worst part was: I had done the work, just not submitted it. I emailed her as respectfully as possible with the work attached. The following exchange is our email correspondence, verbatim.\n\nMe: I know how late these are, and I completely understand if you choose not to accept them. I'm sorry these are so late, some of them I did but never turned in and others I did and didn't scan to turn them in. I know that I've been incredibly irresponsible this quarter when it came to turning in work, and I don't believe any excuse can justify it. My parents are ultra-strict, and I'm only emailing you in the last hope that I can have at least a B this quarter. I don't expect you to adjust my NOVA grade, but it is incredibly important to me that I don't bring home a C this quarter. I'd be happy to talk to you about it in class tomorrow. \nB: I am sorry but grades went in already.\n***Okay, pause. This sent off serious alarm bells in my head. If grades are closed already, then all my other grade discrepancies are too late to be resolved. Cue panic mode. I knew the quarter had been extended, but were teachers still closing their grading books at the usual date? No, they weren’t. This was her convoluted way of telling me “no, I’m not going to help you, it’s too late.” I misunderstood. Cue the message that sets her off, which again, had no intention of disrespect.\nMe: How is that possible? I was under the impression that the quarter was extended until today.\nB fires back minutes later, addressing me by my last name.\nB: _______, I will be speaking with you today. I do not appreciate your tone. Expect to hear from your administrator as well.\nWow, that escalated quickly. I had no idea why she was so angry. Immediately I retracted my statement. \nMe: I apologize, I truly did not mean any disrespect.\nB: You are panicking for something you did to yourself - please do not take it out on me. \nThis confused me even more. How was I supposed to realize, when she hadn’t updated grades in months, that those assignments were ever missing? I take responsibility for not doing the assignments and understand her not wanting to grade them after so long, but I had never before been spoken to by a teacher this way. Take it out on her? I was confused, and upset. I was stressed about facing academic consequences, but now I also had to worry about receiving one of her 20 minute solo scream-sessions in class. I couldn’t handle that. I continued to retract my statement. \nMe: I completely understand. I apologize for bringing it up.\nB: It was not you bringing it up - it was your reaction when I told you no.\n\nBut that’s just it, she hadn’t told me no. She could’ve stated it that way and I would’ve understood, but she didn’t. I was upset at being reprimanded for a misunderstanding that seemed unavoidable. I had done so much to keep a good track record with her. I had hoped that our good relationship would help her understand the extreme stress and academic pressure I was feeling at home, but I also understood that I wasn’t entitled to it. I’ve considered emailing her again and apologizing further, but talking to her now feels like a minefield. AITA?\n\nTo clarify, this is a high school course. It is dual-enrolled through my local community college, and the students who choose to take such courses typically care about their learning and are dedicated to academic success. We’re not derelicts, as she so often treats us. We’re not college students, or adults who should know better. We’re kids. I’m a kid, and I care about respecting authority and maintaining academic integrity and success. I feel truly devastated by this, as I have never been talked to by a teacher this way. I’m genuinely curious to know what you guys think on this, because I’m open to the idea that I’m in the wrong. I’m trying to see it from her side, what do you guys think? AITA?\n",

      "description": "So basically, I'm taking a political philosophy class right now where we're reading Machiavelli, Rousseau, Locke, Hobbes, and Hume. It's been pretty interesting, but my professor has been a massive stickler with me about this one point.\n\nI come from a very poor background, and I'm very lucky to be at this school but most of the people here are wealthy and I don't know if he's had to deal with something like this. All of the books together cost $150, but I already owned different versions of them with different page numbers and references. \n\nTo be honest, I probably could have afforded them but it would have been a task to budget $150 for something I already owned. Our class is super discussion-based, and I get the right version from the library for class so I'm not confusing everyone with page numbers. But the loan period is only two hours, so I can't really use them effectively for papers so I cite my versions. \n\nI've explained to him that I couldn't afford the books, but he keeps insisting that I should buy them so we're all on the same page. I totally get where he's coming from, but I just got a job after graduating and will need to put a deposit down on an apartment, so I don't want to drop any additional cash on books right now. \n\nAITA in this situation? I'm doing well in the class, but he's kind of a rigid guy and thinks I'm slacking off when I actually am just trying to save my limited money.\n",

      "description": "To preface this: I haven't seriously thought about this that much, and I know I probably would be the asshole, I just want some outside input. I'm also using an alt account as to not out anyone in this post.\n\nI (M, 16, bi) have kept consistent contact with my friend (F, 17, lesbian, we'll call her Anna) since middle school, even though we went to different high schools. We have similar interests, senses of humour, etc. I have to admit I kind of did \"like\" (thats a word middle schoolers use right) her a little back in middle school, and she has said that her mom tried to encourage her to ask me out in 8th Grade, but that's all just stupid middle school stuff. There were a few other things, like when I and a couple of other friends had to help her get out of harassment from what I can only call the middle-school version of an r/niceguys guy, and the joke that \"shipped\" me with her, but once again, stupid middle school stuff.\n\nFast forward to now. I talk to her pretty much daily through text. She has an actual girlfriend (We'll call her Sarah, she doesn't really factor into the story other than her existence though) now as opposed to an \"I have a girlfriend go away\" kind of thing which she had for a while. Sarah seems nice and tbh they're cute together, but I digress. Anna is out to a lot of people she knows, but not to her or my parents yet. I remain single (I mean I'm on Reddit, what did you expect) and not out (coming out as bi isnt that difficult comparatively but still) to my family mostly because of my brother's seemingly constant homophobic comments even though he has full knowledge that Anna, the closest person I have to a \"best friend\", is gay.\n\nNow my parents have been asking the normal \"have you found yourself a girlfriend\" questions, but have also been kinda weird about her, things like assuming I have a thing with her or I'm attracted to her, or even trying to set us up. It's been getting really annoying, especially the setup efforts. I had the idea of just telling my parents that she's gay and has a girlfriend to get them to stop, but I feel like that would be unfair to her, and even if I told my parents not to tell anyone, it has been proven I can't trust that when my parents promise that.\n\nTL;DR WIBTA if I told my parents my lesbian friend was lesbian because they keep trying to set me up with her?",

      "description": "My girlfriend just moved into my home. This is the first time I have ever been in a live in situation with a woman, but we both felt that after dating for eight months it would be a nice next step.\n\nThere have been several bumps. For one, I am used to living alone. I realize however that some things would change, but I just haven't fully changed my living habits yet.\n\nOne of these habits is that I enjoy watching pornography on my laptop. Not just that, this is not exactly \"normal\" pornography. I have been diagnosed with APD (antisocial personality disorder), and display the characteristics of a sociopath. I medicate with several antipsychotics and antidepressants. My girlfriend knows about this and accepts it.\n\nHowever, I find sexual gratification from extreme scenarios. My therapist is aware of this and discourages me from engaging in violent fantasy, but I do it anyway. Without going in to too many details, I routinely look up fantasy rape porn, and snuff films to masturbate too. \n\nRecently my now live in girlfriend was using my laptop without permission, and discovered a rape fantasy in my bookmarks. She confronted me about this, and I was enraged that she went through my computer without permission.\n\nShe knows that I enjoy BDSM from our own sexual encounters, and she herself is highly into the \"kink\" scene, as well as having her own rape fantasies. However, her fantasies are much different than mine, and she doesn't truly understand that. I also don't think she truly grasps what im going through with APD as I don't like to discuss it with her.\n\nShe herself very playfully brought up me participating in a rape fantasy with her where I pretend to be a home invader, which was the subject of my rape fantasy video. I react very negatively about this. The desire is there on my part, but there would be a mix of reality and fiction that worries me given my disorder. \n\nThe BDSM we engaged in was still under the pretense of consent (ie instead of her being my \"victim\" she was a willing sextoy who I dominated). \n\nShe is very weirded out by reaction, and finds it disturbing that I can't separate reality from fiction. Which I CAN, thats why I realize fusing the two would be very extreme. She is now angry because I am not communicating, when we both agreed we could talk about anything.\n\nI feel very conflicted about the entire situation, I feel angry, lustful, and now I feel like I shouldn't have dismissed her so quickly. I also feel angry that she even presented me with the temptation.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is a weird question I know that, but I have talked to a couple of people and we're all conflicted. To render a much longer story short, about 10 years ago when I was getting back into the work force after having kids I was briefly an admin assistant at a college. Part of my job was reconciling expenses for my superiors. Most of it was mundane, except my direct boss kept failing to give me receipts or gave me receipts that were really just scribbles on a piece of paper for art. When I asked questions he would always insist that Kenya or Thailand or wherever he had been didn't have receipts.\n\nIt was a line he said often, and it seemed likely my predecessor had just accepted it. But I traveled extensively and knew that couldn't possibly be true. I was knew and had no proof of wrongdoing so I would send those expenses (always substantial and often cash withdrawals )on to the next level with a note that no receipt existed as per internal protocol. Over time I also noticed that the art or whatever he purchased was not on display in our offices, but it was a big campus so I assumed it was possible it was in one of the other buildings. Still I asked a lot of questions as the months went by and each trip's expenses looked the same odd way. \n\nHe fired me during my probationary period in a way that led to the institution retracting his termination letter and giving me substantial severance in addition to my unemployment. (He put in writing that I was failing to read his mind so you know, not a thing that wanted me to take to an employment lawyer) It was frustrating and seemed catastrophic at the time because my husband had just been laid off but ultimately I got a better job with great benefits elsewhere. \n\nAfter I left, my replacement also noticed the bizarreness of his expenses. She went a step further and actually set up a meeting with a superior and took the risk of directly pointing out the pattern of money leaving for goods that didn't seem to exist within the institution. They called me in to ask me some questions and I was able to validate that he was indeed claiming receipts didn't exist in various countries. Eventually because of our combined paper trail a forensic accountant got involved. The rumored amount embezzled was 85K, there was no question he had been embezzling but he made a deal to repay it and left the institution eventually. He went on to work elsewhere in another state which I only know because I used to see him at conferences for our shared field. He stayed in academia though at a much less prestigious university. I'm on the industry side, and frankly we pay better so I was always privately amused when I would run into him. Until now I never said a thing to anyone on the industry side. \n\nI do not know what happened at his last institution, but he has been applying on the industry side, and I'm on the review panel at my job. On paper his credentials are great, but we have corporate cards and we travel. Part of me says he's probably learned his lesson, and part of me remembers just how arrogant and blatantly he was stealing when we worked together. WIBTA if I gave HR a heads up? ",

I normally just play Minecraft alone or with my boyfriend. So, when a couple of my friends invited me to play, I prewarned them that I wouldn't be very much help, but came on with them anyway.\n\nStraight off the bat, they were way further along on this server than me (no surprise, since I was new and they had been playing for a while) so I left to a nearby small island that had a few farm animals on it. I had found a couple white sheep and a lot of flowers, which I turned into dye and I coloured my sheep.\n\nI was about to grow some wheat to breed my sheep and make an orange sheep, when one of my friends attacked my sheep in order to get them into a pen. I was quite upset about this and asked him to please not hurt my sheep again. He proceeded to knock me into said pen, which I am aware was just a playful thing.\n\nHe them picked up my sheep with a leash, flew them into the air,and dropped them, killing them both. I was so in shock that I left the server and ended my call with him.\n\nWhat I want to know is, am I the asshole here?\n\n(upvote this so cuestar can see this and read it out loud.

      "description": "For context, my sister lives with me. It's a situation I can't do anything about because my parents own the house and rent it out to me. There is no formal lease, or rental agreement, so I'm kind of stuck with her. Since she moved in last summer, she just mopes around the house, like a dark cloud. Her fiance broke up with her right at the beginning of last year. She has not dated anyone since and says she's done with dating. She is extremely bitter and negative at all times. She stalks her ex's social media profiles and apparently his new girlfriend is pregnant. My sister is extremely salty about this since she found out... last month. She's been on a tear about it for a month. I know she had a miscarriage and all when they were together, but come on. Finally I told her flat out she needed to move the fuck on and get over it. She has been avoiding me since. So AITA?",

      "description": "Me and my boyfriend have known each other for 6-ish years, and have been together in a long-distance relationship for about 6 months. The problem is that recently he's started to put a lot less effort in, never texting me first, never replying to my texts with more than a couple of words, etc. I've obviously been extremely worried, trying to ask if there was anything I could do, or say, or if he just wanted to be left alone for a while, and happily went with whatever he told me. I've tried directing him towards getting some kind of help, but he's so far refused to. This has been going on for weeks. \n\nWhen I finally told him that this was making me feel kind of unwanted while I saw him interacting perfectly normally with his other girlfriend ~~(we all know about each other- this was not an initial issue whatsoever!)~~ on social media, he finally decided to tell me that she had just gotten a diagnosis of something and that he's just having an emotional time right now. He immediately says that he 'likes dramatically withdrawing into a depression spiral', and suggests that I give him some time, which I'm perfectly happy to do. He can have all the time he needs, no problem! \n\nHowever, I also told him that it had been really frustrating to not fully know what was going on and watching him refuse any and all kinds of help. It felt like I was meant to sit there knowing nothing and expecting nothing from him while watching them live out their life from instagram, to which he replied that the world doesn't revolve around me. We haven't spoken since.\n\nReading it back, it looks like we're both kind of mean. Maybe AITA?",

      "description": "Context: I had a post before on this sub where I explained that my father has yelled at me for everything and has blamed me for everything ever since I could remember. I wondered if cutting ties with him after high school would be an a-hole move. In the comments, people suggested that I talk with my father heavily about our relationship. This is what happened. Also, sorry for bad format, I'm on mobile. \n\nI decided to sit down with my dad and explained to him how I felt about everything. The yelling, the consistent blaming for his wrongs, and him making light of my serious relationship. We talked for a solid two minutes before he scoffed and said that I was overreacting. I got angry, but kept my cool and continued. After ten minutes, he laughed and told me to stop acting like a baby. This tipped me over the edge and I stood up, telling him to shut his mouth for once. I yelled everything at him, all the specific times I could remember of him mentally abusing me. I told him that he couldn't get it through his thick skull that I was hurt by him. He went around the table and grabbed my arm, he raised his hand and treated to hit me. I told him to do it, and see what happens. Instead, he shoved me back and as I was walking away, trying to diffuse the situation he muttered that I was a mistake. I turned and pushed him, causing him to stumble and he grabbed me, tossed me across the room, not airborne of course, and told me to get out of his house. I felt like I was the one who escalated the situation. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "Hi everyone! FTP, etc.\n\nI (F18) recently started dating my boyfriend (M19) about 2 months ago. Before we were \"official\" we were talking for a few weeks, because I met him when we were both in high school. I also met one of my best friends (F18) when I was in 10th grade and she was in 9th (she is currently a senior in HS and I just started college).\n\nMy now-boyfriend started talking to me after I had got out of my last relationship, which I had been in all through high school. It had been a few months since the break up and I felt like I was finally ready to move on and find someone else, so when he asked me if I wanted to hang out and catch up I agreed.\n\nWe got along really well and had lots in common, and I quickly got feelings for him. He said he had had a crush on me since 11th grade, which I knew to be true because he had attempted to ask me out once my junior year and again my senior year (I had turned him down both times due to the fact I was still in a relationship already, but he wasn't pushy about and was respectful both times I turned him down).\n\nBefore we were official, all my friends knew I was seeing someone, at first didn't specify who because I figured most of them didn't know who he was. After I said his first name, my one friend asked if his last name was his last name and I confirmed it was. Then, my friend got upset and stopped talking to me when I asked what the problem was. I was genuinely concerned because she had a few interactions with him that I was vaguely aware of but I didn't know exactly what had happened between them.\n\nWhen I finally got it out of her, she told me that while we were all still in HS, he was flirting with her after she had went through a breakup and it made her feel like he was trying to hook up with her and take advantage of her during a rough time. She also claims that he was flirting with both me and her at the same time, though I have no way of confirming nor denying that. She says this happened around the time he first asked me out (me and him would have been in 11th grade and her in 10th).\n\nI was unsure of what to do and I told her that I really liked him and didn't want to stop talking to him, but I would if I was being a bad friend for seeing him. She told me that it was okay and that she wanted me to be happy, but her words &amp; actions say otherwise. I never talk about my boyfriend with her because every time I do she gets mad and I can tell she doesn't really like us being together. Occasionally, she'll say something along the lines of \"How's your boyfriend?\" and roll her eyes or something when I answer. I don't really understand the big deal, he was just flirting and it's not like they hooked up or dated, if he was actually her ex boyfriend or something, I probably wouldn't be with him, but this was years ago and I have confirmation that he apologized to her.\n\nSo, AITA for continuing to stay with him even though she isn't cool with it?",

      "description": "AITA for expecting my brother to help pay for some of the costs? \n\n(On mobile so sorry for any typos!)\n\nThis incident happened several years ago and my brother and I are good and have a great relationship shop. but this remains a sore spot when it comes up and it dawned on me to use this forum to get an outside perspective.  \n\nI was visiting from out of town and borrowed my brothers car to go to the dentist. On my way home I get pulled over for having expired registration and during the process I figure out my brothers insurance is expired. To add to this, his registration and insurance were not expired - he just never put the tags on and never put the registration card or his updated insurance card in his car. Nonetheless since I was the one driving I got the ticket for expired registration and no insurance. Mind you this required me to show up in court which meant I needed to buy a plane ticket a few months later to return to fight the ticket. \n\nThe asshole-ness comes into question because I thought my brother should help me pay for some of what I needed to pay since I think it was ultimately his fault that I got the ticket. He thinks that since I was the one borrowing the car that I needed to determine if everything was legit before driving it. What really bugs me is that he didn’t offer to pay anything and was pretty much like “you should have known better”. Even if he offered to pay like $100 I would have been okay with it. I may be naive but I always assume that if there are any potential problems with a car I’m borrowing that the person would give me a heads up. At least that’s how I operate. \n\nIn the end I had to pay for a $700 plane ticket (Its a 5 hour flight for me so couldnt save my driving). The judge was cool enough to reduce the tickets to $25. But I was still out $700 that I dont think I should have had to pay all by myself. \n\nAlso to add, for the most part my brother is extremely nice and accommodating. It’s very easy to take advantage of him if you are a family member (which my other brothers and parents do often). He’s also willing to take the blame just to deescalate arguments. He’s also responsible so it never crossed my mind that I would need to consider there being issues borrowing his car. But that is partly why this is so frustrating. He takes zero accountability for this so I know he genuinely believes he’s right and is not just being stubborn. \n\nSo want do you think?",

All of a sudden he emergency brakes and pulls over on this bend on the double yellow lines. And apparently he's done because all lights go off and so does his engine. I am enraged by this point, being 5 minutes late I only had 5 more minutes to collect my son before he's sent to reception for collection. So I go past this fucking idiot and park about 7 feet away, off the double yellow and I proceed to run out the car. Audi idiot is smirking at me. Me! Mr I -Can't-Drive-Like-A-Civilised -Human is smirking at me as if to say, I know I'm a total twat, what are you going to do? \nToo many times do people get to park like absolute shit heads and get away with it. Well, not today...\n\"Fucking prick.\" I muttered, jogging past him.\n\"What did you say?\" He seems utterly astonished.\nI stopped dead in my tracks, turned to look at him and stated, \"I called you a fucking prick.\"\nAnd on I jogged.\nSince then this guy has been getting his kid, his 10 or 11 year old kid to glare at me and they often exchange things and laugh when they know I'm looking.\nI want to punch him, but what I want more is to know that I'm NTA, please reddit, I am at your mercy! \n",

Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent.

      "description": "I know the answer to this may seem obvious to some of you, but my heart keeps telling me I made a mistake. My girlfriend (19F) and I (21M) had been together about 8 months when I decided to end things. We have had several conversations about what we want out of life, including where we might like to live, having children, where to get married should it come to that, etc. We had a lot of disagreements on these things that I believe a couple should more or less be on the same page about. \n\nFor example, I don’t like putting a time frame on things, when I’m ready for kids, I’ll have kids. Her response to this was “I’m having a baby by 25 with or without you.” In terms of location, my job will most likely take me to California right out of college, she said she would “Never live there, we would have to be in a bordering state and commute.” When talking about a wedding, she wants to have it at Disney World and is willing to take out loans to make it happen, while I believe that to be ridiculous. \n\nThere are other small relationship quirks like certain attitudes or behaviors I disagreed with, but I was willing to work past those and work on it together. However when it comes to these very big life decisions, I just can’t see an ending where both of us are happy, so I broke things off. \n\nPart of my reasoning comes from a previous relationship, where she and I moved together even though she didn’t want to because she said she was willing to make that sacrifice for me... she wanted to see other people less than a year later. \n\nDuring our conversation about separating, she said she was only joking, and that she would be willing to do anything just to be with me. I told her that she shouldn’t have to sacrifice children to be with somebody, and that I would in no way ask her to give that up.\n\nShe tried telling me that she will have no on without me, as she poured everything into our relationship and lost all of her friends because of this. I saw this as a guilt trip, and it reaffirmed my stance that in the long run this just was not meant to be. And in my opinion, I would rather rip the band aid off now than have to cut through the stitches two years from now. \n\nSo people of Reddit, am I the asshole for ending things?",

      "description": "I'm not trying to be r/iamverysmart but, I've always been above average with academics, namely math and science. my older sister always disliked that and came up with excuses about why I was ahead of her when I'm a year younger.\n\nWhen I was in year 10 we tried more difficult math as I wasn't learning and she wanted to get ahead. I moved up two year levels from year 9 to year 11 (level one) and she moved up one year 10 to 11 in math 2 years ago, ahead of her, then she stopped competing over math, and at the end of last year dropped back a year to do calculus, as originally she'd gone into statistics (I was in calculus so we didn't worry about class over lap). All was good until this year I joked about visiting her physics class to confuse the teacher. She didn't know it was a joke, she wasn't listening fully, got really serious and said \"**Don't.**\" after I told her it was a joke she relaxed a bit and I laughed it off. She said it some more times over the next couple days about not doing physics, at that point I had no intention on doing it.\n\nRight now I'm in 13 calculus (level three) I'm ahead of the year 13's and working on my own thing, my year 12 calculus teacher came up one day said I should move into year 12 physics (level two), I dismissed it because of my sister but wanted to do it. The next day I had my second science lesson, the first one was boring. I found out it would be recap for at least half a term and probably more, I just felt constrained. I thought about moving up to level two physics and possibly level two chemistry. That evening on the way home I casually mentioned moving up in science, my mum was immediately hooked and started sorting out the details with me. Up until this point I hadn't seriously thought about moving up, just some maybes in my mind. My mum sorted out the class changes and I got moved up into the subjects (my mum is a teacher) and it turned out there's only one physics class and one chemistry class so I'm in two of her classes. I attended one physics lesson when my sister was sick and that's all I've had.\n\nToday I went with her to her job interview to calm her a bit she was thankful. When we got home, because I thought she would take it better when she was happy with me, I just out right told her. I didn't want to just show up one day in her class. Now she's furious with me and I don't know what to do. I don't want to make her sad, but I didn't do this to piss her off, so I'm kind of annoyed she got upset. Am I the Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My one year older sister really didn't want me to move into her science classes and told me repeatedly not to after I joked about it, but my classes weren't teaching me anything and I felt restrained with learning, so I did. I ended up with her in two classes, she's now furious and I don't know if I'm in the wrong.",

If we're having a gathering it's always me who is travelling to their place. I don't really mind. We only meet a few times a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I bought my dream house with my husband. My sister asked to host my nephew's 3rd birthday party at my house. She wants to use the big backyard, grill and pool at my home. There are roughly 50 people who are invited. I said no and she called me selfish and an asshole. Her kids have never been to my house and I prefer it that way. Her kids are not very well behaved except for the oldest three and my house is not child-poof. The pool seems like a huge liability. I don't want children drowning on my property. It just seems like a recipe for disaster. She brought up the fact that she hosted Christmas at her house for the past 10+ years at her house, but I don't think it's fair to compare this to that. We meet at her house instead of our parents because she has 14 kids to herd around so it's really more out of convenience to her. Every year for the past 10+ years I buy dessert enough to feed 25 people so I've done my part with the food arrangements. That's 8 apple pies or 3 cakes worth of dessert. My parents also stay over to help prepare and cook and we all contribute to the washing and cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken in 2 months because of this. She firmly believes AITA.

      "description": "Throwaway account, because I'm about to expose an ugly, vindictive side of myself. This isn't who I am, but it is who I'm being today apparently. \n\nShort version of a long story: we all live together. My friend rejected me and within two weeks was sneaking into our other friend's room (right next door to mine) at night. She knew how I felt. They had no immediate plans to tell me, and it only came out when they made some bad drunken decisions.\n\nThey're clearly remorseful and did not intend for this to happen. When they say they didn't tell me out of fear of what it would do to our friendship, I believe them. He's even gone as far as to check on me when we all left for Christmas with our families.\n\nThe WIBTA part: I'm only intermittently angry about it anymore, even though it's only been a week. I know (or I tell myself that I know) that a relationship with him wouldn't have worked out long term anyway. I don't like that they're doing it, and I don't like that they were going behind my back, but I understand why it reached this point.\n\nJust so we're clear, I'm hurt, but not to the point that I couldn't act normal and work on rebuilding the friendship as soon as we're all back together in the new year. \n\nThe problem is that I don't want to. It feels like it isn't fair. Why should they say 'sorry about that', and then get each other and me too? Why am I always the second choice? Why does trusting people always end so badly for me? Why aren't I ever good enough?\n\n\nI'm so sick and tired of trying so hard and giving myself to people and being walked all over like I'm too dumb to fight back, and having to walk away to maintain any shred of dignity. I feel like a pet. Stroke her head, give her a treat, and go right back to keeping her around for the banter and the bloody homework help.\n\nI don't want to let them get away with it this time. These aren't the same friends that let me down before, and this isn't the same situation, but goddamn it I'm so sick of it and I want some sort of punishment. I want to look him in the face and say 'you can't have everything you want'. I want to tell her that I 'misplaced my trust'. And I want it to hurt. \n\nThere's a lot besides this going on. My health, my family, my degree. And maybe that's why I'm so eager to overreact. \nI'm being spiteful. I am 100% being spiteful. There's nothing damaged here that can't be fixed. I just want to delay fixing it while I get to hold the power for a while. I'm tired and I'm stressy and I don't know when my life got so bloody messy, and I never get to be in control.

      "description": "I'm one of a team of brand specialists at a technology vendor. My teammates represent different vendors, and as a result are effectively my competitors. As a team we are pretty tight knit and we pride ourselves on our close professional relationships built around transparency.\n\nIn times past, we uncovered many situations where sales reps were plying us against each other in an effort to see who could jump the highest (not unlike watching two dogs fight over a bone). One way I keep my teammates in the know is to BCC them on a reply to a rep who I suspect of using underhanded tactics to get a sale. It's been fairly successful in keeping things on the level, and we haven't faced any pushback.\n\nJump to today when I BCC a teammate of mine on an email to a rep who I suspect of being shady. My teammate was sick at home and not reading properly, and responds to the email I had BCC-ed him on. The sales rep goes off on me by saying that looping people in via BCC is \"sneaky and lame\". I don't think I did anything wrong except maybe not giving him the benefit of the doubt. I told him I how he operates is up to him, and how I do so is up to me and me alone. I continued that if he has an issue, he is more than welcome to take it up with me personally or with my management team. He declined the offer.\n\nAITA for sticking to my guns on this one?",

Now, I didn't really want to do this, ass she was a truly rude, irritating, and all around bad person, but I decided I would respond to her texts and not be rude to her (despise her being very rude to me on a regular basis) because I felt bad about the fact that she had pretty much no friends to support her after the breakup. \n\nOne day, she started texting me, and this is basically how it went. \n\nHer: Hey\n\nMe: Hey, what's up\n\nHer: Nothing really, just hanging out at my house\n\nMe: Cool, me too\n\nHer: Yeah I'm just doing some stuff with my makeup, but you probably don't care about that *proceeds to send a very long message about the stuff she's doing with her makeup*\n\nMe: Yeah you're right I didn't really care about that lol\n\nThen she basically texted me calling me a selfish asshole and that she never wanted to be friends in the first place and only said that because she felt bad for me (side not, I actually found out later from one of her \"friends\" who actually hates her more than I do that she only wanted to stay friends so that if she couldn't find a \"better\" guy than me she could just come back. Lovely girl.). After that we didn't talk at all, and I don't think we have exchanged more than a few words since that day.\n\nAnyway, AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a 19 year old white kid who attends university in NY state. I got into Kpop (Korean pop, just in case you don't know) in December 2017. I adore the groups I've gotten into. I try very hard not to objectify or fetishize the men and women of the groups I like. Liking Kpop has gotten me more interested in Korean culture – I've started learning the language and I'm thinking of studying abroad in Seoul soon.\n\nOne of the groups I really love is coming to New Jersey soon. When I talked to my parents, they said they thought it would be best if I went with a friend or at least a concert buddy. The problem is, I don't have many friends, especially any that like Kpop.\n\nThere used to be a Facebook page for my class, but it somehow got deleted. So, I posted in my school's meme page instead. Now, it does say that the page should be memes only, but others have posted off topic posts (snow day announcements, lost items, etc) in the past. I also post fairly often (once or twice a month) with on-brand content so I figured I could post something.\n\nI can't give you exact wording, but I linked to an ad for the concert with the caption being something like \"I know this is off topic but if you or anyone you know would like to see some Korean boys dance around for a few hours, let me know!\" And I left it alone.\n\nI came back a few hours later and couldn't find the post. I thought it was lost in the shuffle, but then I saw this (word for word, minus the school name) posted by a mod (a Filipina student.)\n\n\"official psa: this is a meme group. therefore, please only post memes related to the ~school name~ experience here. aka keep your racial fetishization koreaboo shit (and also all racial discrimination) out of here thx - mgmt\"\n\nI don't know this person - never met them. What I'm wondering I guess is AITA for liking Kpop when I'm white, or if there was something in my post that could be viewed as \"racial fetishization koreaboo shit.\" Thanks y'all. \n\nTL;DR: I'm white, I like kpop. Posted about a kpop concert on a school meme page. Mod who I've never met deletes the post and calls me a koreaboo. ",

I also learned that this would cost me $50,000-$60,000. I didn't think I could afford this (it would be more than the first four years combined) so I decided to transfer to a cheaper school to complete my certification, but I'm still taking 3 classes at my first school for prerequisites. \n\nAlso, I was promoted to head RA at the end of last year, but since living on campus would cost me $15,000 I believed it was best to quit that job, move home with my dad, and work full time at my other job.  \n\nThe issue comes with my relationship, because I'm now living and working 30 minutes away, I don't get to see my girlfriend a lot. I still go down every day and we will often spend a few hours together most week days, and saturday but all semester she has often brought up how I ditched her or abandoned her or \"chose money over our relationship\" and I do understand that not seeing each other as much as we used to is hard and frustrating but I also don't feel like I made an unreasonable or ridiculous decision in moving home. \n\nShe also gets upset whenever I have free time that I have to use doing things like cleaning up my room (everything is just strewn everywhere and there are piles of my stuff from when I moved) or spending time with my dad, when I could be spending it with her, although I do kinda understand as there is not much time for her and I to be together and that's all she really wants. But she often attacks me and says that I'm an asshole for the choice that I made.",

      "description": "So, as the title suggests, I spend a lot of time with this individual. As such, I understand that we are, at some point, bound to have a spat. Still, when it happened today, I was left pretty floored by it.\n\nWe work at a shoe store. Sometimes when looking for shoes in the stock room we take the display from the floor; “singles,” part of the job is to put them back. She left a shoe there, I picked it up and (very obviously jokingly) said “forgetting something?” We joke around with each other, “razzing” one and other like this constantly, it’s always in good nature. So imagine my surprise when she turned around and spat something along the lines of “don’t even give me attitude for that, ____, because you’re the worst one for it.” And stormed off. A. I am most certainly not the worst one for it, and she should be the last one saying I am. B. What the fuck?\n\nSo I’m generally pretty timid, especially with her, but that left my jaw hanging to the floor. So I picked up the single, followed her out, slapped it on the shelf, said “FYI, I was joking” and walked away. She then followed me back and said “don’t take that attitude with me” in the bitchiest voice; she is a shift lead and I am an associate but I thought it was so fucked to flex on me like that as we should be friends before anything else.\n\nAfter that we ignored each other for a bit, until I asked her if she was mad at me and she said “no not at all,” but continued to ignore me. I later bought her a cookie on my lunch break and things were pretty normal for the rest of the shift.\n\nI have some other issues with the living situation which I’ve never bought up because I didn’t really mind them, they’re just unfair, but depending on how the talk goes when she gets home after her shift I may just unload it all in one big surprise package.",

      "description": "Last night my sister and I went to McDonald's. We hadn't eaten all day and no one wanted to make dinner at home\n\nWe got our burger meals and some other stuff and proceeded to wait in the corner we always do.\n\nIt was about 6 p.m on a Friday, which I'm not sure about where other people live, it can get pretty packed in fast food joints. The place did have a lot of people but wasn't entirely as full as I've seen before in other locations. There was also 2 long tables in the back completely full of people who had ordered their food to be delivered to them at the table. I'm gonna estimate it was about 10 people at each table\n\nWe waited about 12 minutes and my sister spoke up and said \"if we get to 20 minutes I'm going to say something\" and I was kind of thrown off, she's never done anything like that and was embarrassed by the THOUGHT of her doing it, but didn't actually think she would.\n\nI told her \"well, there's lots of people who got their food delivered to the table, plus there's lots of people standing and waiting, we did order a lot, and you have to take into consideration that there might be training employees\"\n\nShe didn't care and just repeated that she was gonna ask for the manager. I myself was getting a bit upset only because I have social anxiety and hate being in small crowded places for longer than necessary. I would never say anything to a manager though.\n\nWe got our food around 17 minutes in. When we got home I told our step mom about how my sister was about to talk to the manager, and my sister got upset again. I brought up \"maybe it was an unexpected rush\" as this specific McDonald's doesn't usually get that busy often. She decided to practically yell \"they should know when the rushes are! They should be more prepared!\" I couldn't handle having the conversation with her so I just took my food and went to my bedroom.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be near one of those \"can I speak to the manager\" people?",

      "description": "This is something that has bothered me and made me think I might be crazy but I’ve always had trouble missing people. As a child when my parents would go on vacation and leave me with my sibling (they are older and took care of me during those times)  I wouldn’t really miss them or feel the need to call or message them. Same for my siblings , when my sister left the house I didn’t miss her. \nAnd now I’m in a serious relationship for 2 years and she’s in college but we do get to see eachother everyday but when she goes home on break it feels as if she never really left you know and I don’t necessarily miss her. I’m just wondering if this is normal or asshole behavior ",

      "description": "So I spent the day with this girl who I’ve seen a couple times. It’s a girl I’ve known from school years ago, but we have reconnected in recent months. \n\nI spent the weekend at her place a few weeks ago and we had a great time. \n\nThis weekend past we had arranged for her to come to mine and spend the night. We went out in the day and I showed her around the town I live in as she’d never been there (we both live away from where we grew up). We got food and then went back to my place. Adult activities occurred (side note, not the first time we’ve slept together). \n\nWe were then watching tv and I just was not feeling it. I didn’t really want her to spend the night anymore and I kinda just wanted her to leave. \n\nAnyway, my mumsy called me. I told the girl that I had to take the call, and went downstairs and just chatted to my mum for about 5 minutes. \n\nAs I was sat downstairs a plan formed in my head. It was 9pm. \nI went back upstairs in a bit of a fluster and I told the girl, “hey, I’m really sorry for this but I need to leave. You’re welcome to stay here and leave in the morning if you want to but I need to go.”\n\nShe was super understanding and said “oh my god that’s totally fine, these things happen, I hope everything is okay” etc. \n\nWe left the house at the same time, I got into my car and drove off as she was sorting out her satnav. I drove around for about 15 minutes then returned home and just chilled by myself and then went to bed. \n\nAITA? I didn’t want her to stay the night and I knew I wouldn’t be good company, so I made a decision that would mean I wouldn’t come across as rude or not that into her. \n\nWe have spoken since and everything is fine.

      "description": "I (M29) quit my job about 4 years ago to come and live with my partner (M38) but “havent been able” to find a job here - rural area with only blue collar work I’m not qualified for, but kinda refuse to work my ass off as a bartender or similar for a very low payment in this area while i could earn much more for bartending in the capital city where i came from, and maaaybe I also find it defeating to work on such a level after going through a lot for education (bachelor IT). \nMy partner knows this but has a job that pays well enough so he can provide for both of us. That’s why he suggested I move here in the first place. I don’t spend much and don’t treat him as a suggar daddy i guess. He gets necessities, food (which i cook) and pays the bills and gives me some cash monthly to cover potential expenses and for my personal needs (around 70€). I consider myself very low maintenance. \nWe’re together for 7 years now and we were doing great until a few weeks ago when this happened:\nI went to visit my parents and after arriving to the bus station I decided to save some cash by not calling a cab (expensive here). During hopping on and off public transport i saw this poor woman digging through trash cans, searching for plastic bottles (which are refundable here for some small amounts of money). It was freezing and the wind was blowing like crazy and she was obviously shaking. I usually don’t give money to beggars because there are a lot of scammers here disguised as them. This lady wasn’t begging but minding her business and trying to find as many bottles in the freezing cold to earn some cents. \nSo yeah, i felt bad for her and decided to give her 20€ to go buy whatever she needs (probably food because she’s obviously desperate) and go home to warm herself up and take a few days off from bottle collecting (cold week forecast). She burst into tears, wasn’t sure if she wanted to accept it but did so in the end. She was very thankful and very humble. It was quite wholesome and i felt really good about it.\nWhen i told my bf about it he was furious because “that was money he earned, and it was meant for me, and he would rather have me spent it on a cab instead of durdling around with public transportation for hours in the cold”. He was concerned for my health but he was much more angered by the fact that i gave money away to a stranger which he earned for me. \nMy argument was that if the money was for me, shouldn’t i be spending it how i want? He agreed but still thought giving it out to unknown people is unreasonable. Money was never an issue in our relationship till now and i fear this might change how we handle things from now on. \nIn order to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future I’d really like to hear some other opinions.\n\nTldr: i don’t have a job, my partner provides for me and i gave out cash i didn’t earn to a stranger in the streets.

      "description": "So this is how me (40M) and my wife's (46F) Valentine's romantic dinner without the kids was ruined. Talking about how to get our somewhat overweight kid more healthy, she said every meal has to include lots of salad. I pointed out that typically I cook vegetarian anyway - for example last night's meal was whole-meal pasta with (lots of) vegetables cooked in a tomato sauce - and that I don't think such meals typically need salad. At this point I could tell by her standard signals that she had suddenly got fairly upset. She started talking about how she has a right to salad at every meal. It's relevant at this point that I do about 2/3 of the cooking and my cooking is more work - she is more likely to do instant food, I chop more vegetables. She does sometimes add, say, a raw carrot to what I have provided, but by no means always. I said that when I cook, I feel like I'm providing a complete meal, and so I would feel put out if she was to add salad to it when I didn't as cook deem it necessary. I said this isn't a strange way to feel as someone who has cooked a meal for their family.\n\nIn repeated circles of argument, I have pointed out that I have never and will never stop her eating salad, but I can't help that I feel like meals I provide should be regarded as sufficient, so I can't help feeling slightly put out if she acts like they are not, by adding salad at the last minute when I cooked something I didn't intend to include salad with.\n\nIt's relevant that in her culture (Swedish) it is more normal to have a salad with absolutely everything, and not in mine (British). I pointed out that I understand her food-related desires and therefore will never try to stop her adding salad to what I cook, but I also pointed out I feel like she is making no attempt to understand how I feel.\n\nHer repeated response was \"You have dropped a bomb-shell. I need salad with every meal but now I know every time I make salad when you cook you'll be feeling bad about it, this is terrible\". And she remained really angry and has now gone to bed angry.\n\nI feel like she has over-reacted, that she got quickly angry rather than calmly allowing us to explore each other's valid but conflicting feelings. But perhaps I'm in fact the ass-hole (or as we Brits say arsehole)?\n",

      "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nBefore I begin my story, just want to let everyone know this is a throwaway account (username checks out) just because a lot of my irl friends have easy access to my main account. \n\nAlright, so throughout my childhood I have been regarded as the kid with strict parents. Things such as not being able to watch sponge bob until  I was 14, having a flip phone until I was 13, and having a bed time of 8:30 until I was a sophomore in highschool (16). My grades were stellar in elementary school, and somewhat faltered in middle school, but nothing worse then a C. Freshman year was rocky due to my parents divorce, and eventually I picked up my game and have a GPA of around 4.45 and high SAT scores. \n\nEver since my mom has gotten divorced, she has more and more often become on edge and in general uptight. I hang out with friends almost every weekend, and my schedule is constantly packed with my energetic dog, soccer, gymnastics, school, etc and I really don’t have much relaxing time to myself. \n\nOne way I was raised was to speak my feelings, and often times I do however this is one case I don’t know whether or not I should.\n\nThe main point of this post is my problem. My mom has been lonely ever since her divorce and basically requires me to talk to her. Rules have been put into effect such as no phones when in the car with her, no phone when in the same room as her, even if she walks into the room I was already in; I am expected to drop everything to talk to her.\n\nI feel as if I shouldn’t have to fill that job in her life, my schedule is busy enough and it isn’t like I don’t spend time with her. We have a good relationship and I talk to her easily for about 45 minutes a day (doesn’t sound like a lot but it is).  \n\nAm I the asshole for not spending more time with her even though my schedule rarely allows for more then an hour of personal time a night (not counting YouTube at night)?\n",

      "title": "AITA for ending my friendship with a friend of almost 8 years and promising myself to never help him again?",
      "description": "So, this has actually happened a while ago.\n\nI had a friend, let's call him Charlie, for the sake of the story, and we got to know each other way back in high school and instantly got along. I have been with him when he was going through a lot of bad things, when people kept leaving him, he had his heart broken, started doing drugs, became an alcoholic addict (this will be important in the story), and more. And each time I truly, honestly wanted to help him and I was trying to, to the best of my abilities and knowledge, expecting only that he'd do the same to me in return.\n\nNow, his life finally got a lot better. He stopped drinking in an addicted manner, stopped with the drugs, found a girlfriend, found a temporary job abroad and moved there for almost a year. During the time when he was there, our contact started to vanish, more and more, but I did what I could to make sure it's still there (he rarely wrote to me on his own).\n\nNow, not so late ago, he was back to our country and made a \"goodbye party\", because he was moving abroad permanently. At some point into the party, everyone was having a good time, and Charlie suddenly got up and announced that he wanted to say something. According to his own words, he had 2 extremely close friends that helped him to get through all of the bad stuff he had in life, through his problems and that were supporting him whenever needed. As the first one, he pointed at his close friend that he has known since he was a small kid, and that was totally okay with me, that's natural, they have known each other for at least several years. However, when it came to the second person... I naturally assumed that it'd be me. But it didn't happen. Instead, he pointed at the guy that, as far as I'm aware, never had any good contact with Charlie, and that actually was contributing to his addictions, especially the alcoholic one. After some more time passed, during which Charlie was praising them and I was sitting there, just thinking how come that it's the second guy  standing there instead of me, I finally asked Charlie to go somewhere else and talk.\n\nI simply confronted him. Told him that I see it as unfair and that it made me feel extremely unappreciated by him and asked why it was him instead of me. I think that what he said will stick with me for the rest of my life. He said that during all those times when I thought I was helping him to goy through whatever trouble he had in life, I actually wasn't, because he, according to his own words, didn't want to be comforted and assured that things are going to be okay, he didn't want ideas on how to solve his problems, he wanted to be punched in the face and ordered to get his shit together, which, according to Charlie, the second \"friend\" provided to him. I was shocked, and barely could say anything, but I didn't have to. Charlie simply concluded this short conversation that he'll call me the next day, so we can meet and talk about it in detail, but for now he's going to enjoy his goodbye party. Of course, as you can expect, he never called and never gave any sign of life.\n\nSince then, I haven't contracted him in any way and I'm not planning to. He's dead to me. If he's going to get into some shit again, I'll tell him to fuck off, no matter what that is or how bad that is. That's a promise I made to myself. \n\nAm I the asshole for that? Am I the one in the wrong? ",

      "title": "AITA for dropping my friend who has become a militant vegan?",
      "description": "**TL;DR** One of my (21F) best friends (21F) from high school has always been passionate about animal welfare, was a normal vegan for a while, but over the last several months has become an insanely militant vegan. Whenever we hang out, the events centre around her veganism. Her social media is nothing but preachy vegan stuff and photos of animal gore. Sick of it and not really interested in being friends anymore.\n\n**Full background:**\n\nJunior year of high school, M and I had basically the same class schedule. We ended up becoming best friends. She's such a lovely, cool person and I've always regarded her as being one of the nicest people I know. She was always the friend who would say \"It's not nice to talk about people\" if my other friends and I were gossiping about someone. She's always been passionate about animals, has an \"ADOPT DON'T SHOP\" sticker on her car (which I agree with!) and would only buy meat from small farmers who treated their animals with compassion. She's also into a sustainable, no-waste lifestyle. Overall I have the same values and I admire her. Beyond these passions, she was always super fun too -- we could go out dancing at the bars, to concerts, talk about boys and all that silly stuff.\n\nWe're now seniors at the same university. Her major is sustainability. I really respect this and I'm so happy she's following her passions. Near the beginning of uni she became full-on vegan. Cool! I admire the vegan lifestyle and am interested in trying it out sometime, but now I'm not interested in changing my whole lifestyle. I love meat and dairy etc. and don't have the discipline for it at this point in time. But I still like vegan food. So a lot of the time when M and I would hang out, she'd take me to her favourite vegan restaurants. I enjoyed this at first -- this was a new experience for me and I liked broadening my palate. We'd also go to nature trails a lot, which isn't really my thing, but she loves that stuff. I would enjoy it but it wasn't super exciting. The main thing is we'd always have good conversations and I enjoy her company.\n\nIn March or April we went to a vegan food festival in my town. I really enjoyed it and we had a good time, except for one thing. I do not like PETA. I think they're a nutty extremist group who only hinders their cause instead of spreading it. There was a PETA booth at the festival, and M stayed for a while and got info from them. I didn't really say anything but I basically ignored the PETA people. M said I should go with her to a PETA protest that was coming up. I said no and we sort of argued about whether or not PETA is a good organisation. A few weeks later a local brewery was having an event where they were showing the new Planet Earth series. I don't like beer but I went with her anyway. I was bored and realised we were yet again doing what only she wanted. I think that's the last time I hung out with her.\n\nOver the next few months I invited M to several things. I invited her to the movies, the farmers market and some other random stuff I was up to. She never came to anything I wanted to do. In August, another of our best friends turned 21. It was a really big, fun night! But M didn't come. She didn't even give a reason. I thought this was unbelievably shitty. A month or so later I invited her to a restaurant that I've been to with her once before. She couldn't come, but made sure to tell me \"they have really good seitan dishes! I promise you can't tell the difference, you should order that.\" She can't come with me to the restaurant but she's still pushing me to order fucking vegan food. I ordered chicken pho. A couple weeks later I invited her to yet another thing -- it involved nature and she totally would've liked it -- but yet again she couldn't come... That was the last time I talked to her.\n\nSince around the start of summer, M's social media has gone full-blown militant vegan, along with her sister. She joined an Anonymous for the Voiceless chapter and she's actually one of the leaders of it. They stage protests around town which I find a bit crazy. Every day she posts stuff online about how people need to become vegan, all the terrible stuff the meat and dairy industries do, how people need to become zero-waste like her, etc. It's her passion and her social media, so whatever, not that big a deal even though I think it's over the top and kind of annoying. What I really hate is that she regularly posts pictures and videos of animal gore. I agree with her that this stuff is really important and these industries need serious regulation and overhaul in order to treat animals more humanely, but I don't want to see these images. It's disgusting and upsetting to me, along with all our other friends and my mother who is connected to her social media too. She literally posts this crap all day long. I find it a bit pathetic that she obviously spends so much time researching and planning what to post on social media, especially because she always used to be the \"live in the moment and put your phone away\" kind of person. She clearly dedicates hours every day to social media activism. I guess that's what she was doing when she missed out on our best friend's 21st birthday.\n\nOverall, I don't want to be M's friend anymore. She's become a judgy asshole who constantly posts animal gore on social media and won't stop shoving veganism down everyone's throats. I admire that she's following her passions, but I judge her for being such a dick about it. She's a really awesome person and I miss her like crazy but I just can't handle the bombardment. \n\n**AITA for not wanting to be her friend anymore because of her dedication to veganism?** My other friends think we should try to ask her to tone down her posts but I don't want to do that. I just want to forget about her honestly. I muted her on Instagram and unfollowed her on Facebook. I'm hoping one day she'll sort of come back down to earth and chill out with all that shit, but I kind of don't think I want to bother waiting around for that. I won't text her or invite her to anything. **I don't know what I'll do if she finally texts me again or invites me to something... What should I do if she does?**",

      "title": "AITA for telling someone \"No\" at the gym to use a machine they were 15 minutes late to get on?",
      "description": "Some context about the YMCA I go to, they have a signup page when you walk into the cardio room. You sign up in 30 minute blocks for a machine. If it's 5 minutes past when you signed up, then you're considered a \"No Show\" and anyone can use the machine for the remaining time. I've been back home living with my parents for a few months and gone to the gym almost every day to lose weight and get in shape.  Sometimes people are signed up at 12:00, it's 12:10, I hope on the machine and no issues, sometimes people aren't signed up. I've had people signed up to machines next to me, never showed up, it happens all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get to the gym and changed, go into the cardio room and Eliptical #5, is taken and signed up for. Eliptical #6 is signed up for, but no one is on it. They signed up 1:30-2:00, it's 1:45. I sign up for 2, no big issue always done it this way. There are 3 people in the room, all on machines, it's not very busy. I go 45 minutes, so I'll be done by 2:30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm putting stuff on the machine a guy walks up and says to me \"I signed up for 1:30, this is my machine, I am taking it\". I look at the clock and mention it's 1:45, it's my understanding if it's 1:35 and no one is on the machine anyone can hop on it. \"No, I signed up for 1:30, this is my machine, I am taking it\". I tell him \"no\". Which, he does not like. He calls me a \"Fucking asshole\" and it's his machine. I said he was the one being an asshole. He said he was \"On the bike warming up\" and I again tell him \"Its 1:45\". He eventually walks off basically pissed off I said no to his \"I am taking this machine\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI start my workout and he comes back and says he checked by the sign in and says he doesn't see the \"5 minute rule\" posted anywhere. I told him that was my understanding and all I got was repeated \"well where is it posted!\" responses. The guy who was on #5 at one point mentions he can have his machine he is almost done. I stopped responding to the guy being a dick and he goes to another machine. After a minute I get off the machine, walk by him and mentioned something similar to \"I'm going to the front to make sure, if I am wrong I'm sorry the machine is yours\". He said to not worry about it, but I walk past him to the front. I explained the situation and they said there is a 5 minute rule, and they're calling \"charlie\" to go talk to him. The front desk apologizes and mentions it happens from time to time. The sign was taken down cause they're doing a new sign up thing soon I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go back to the room and start my workout and hear staff talking to him. He's very short \"I understand\", \"ok\", \"didn't know ok\". He wasn't in a mood to talk to staff who was explaining the rule to him. He even told staff I was an \"asshole\" and they told him no need for that type of language. So he just confirmed what I told them anyways about what he said to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've told my parents, ex-gf, and a friend. My ex-gf said I was in the wrong and to give him the machine. My parents think I should \"be the bigger man and apologize for the misunderstanding\" and my friend said I was in the right. I do not see a reason I am in the wrong. If he would've literally said anything else to me, than the first sentence being a complete dick I would've let him have the machine for the last 15 minutes. He could've said \"I am running late, was warming up on the bike, I only need the elliptical for 10 minutes\" - fine, he can use it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore anyone even says \"let him have it and use another machine\", it's the principle and I have been pushed around my entire life letting people walk over me. #5 and #6 elliptical also have TVs, the rest do not. He straight out the gate was rude and a complete asshole, and I calmly explained the situation to him. Almost anything else in a nicer tone I would've been like \"sure no problem I will hop on at 2 after you\". I wasn't having the asshole attitude straight out the gate from him, on top of being called a fucking asshole for saying no. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't feel like I am the asshole, not sure if it's more of a Change My View post than if I am the asshole because the establishment agreed with me and the rules they set in place. I didn't make the rules, I explained them to him. I don't see a reason for me to ever apologize to him. I would've given him the machine if he was nicer even though I didn't have to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Gym has a sign up, 5 minutes late anyone can take your machine. Guy signed up 1:30-2:00, didn't say anything till I was getting on the machine at 1:45. Was a dick out the gate saying it's his machine he's taking it, and I told him no. I was called a \"fucking asshole\" before going to the front to make sure I wasn't wrong about the rules. He called me an 'asshole' to staff when they explained it to him. ex-gf says I should've given the machine up, parents think I need to be the bigger man and \"apologize for the misunderstanding, friend I told said I was fine the guy is an asshole and didn't like being not given his way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "On mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues. Also using a throwaway.\n\nSo back in college, I met this guy (M) in one of my classes. He wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed and struggled with a lot of the assignments.\n\nNow, I would regularly help out a few struggling classmates with their assignments. One day, M found our study group and asked for help on the particular assignment we were currently working on in our group.\n\nI told him that I would be happy to help, but M didn’t have the assignment on him at the time, so he asked if he could email me the assignment and if I could help him later that night since the assignment was due the next day. I said that was fine, but I had work later so he would have to wait until later that night. \n\nI got home from work and found an email from M in my inbox. He sent me what he had so far and it was clear that he put in little to no effort. Everything was either completely wrong or incomplete. I took roughly an hour to reply to him with a very thoughtful, well-written, constructive email with feedback on what he can do to improve his work. He later replied and instead of saying “Thanks for your help” or asking a follow up question, I got the letter “K”. A “K” in return for the time I took out of my evening to analyze his shitty work and explain to him what the professor had already explained in class. I was pissed, and I didn’t help him after that.\n\nA few weeks later after the class I had with M ended, I was working on an assignment in one of the common areas on campus and M found me. He came and sat down next to me and started bragging about how he had made $400 working 40 hours at his internship. I wasn’t having it, so I made up some excuse, got up and left.\n\nI didn’t see him much after that, but I heard from a lot of friends that he would regularly manipulate people to do his assignments for him and brag about how much money he was making to everyone and anyone.  \n\nFast forward to present day, all of my friends graduated college and we are all working jobs that we enjoy. One day out of the blue, I got an invitation from M to connect on LinkedIn. At first, I was just going to decline it, but my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to see what he was up to, so I accepted. I saw his profile and it didn’t appear that he was able to hold onto any job for longer than a few months, which wasn’t surprising since the guy would just have other people do his assignments for him. I told my friends who knew him and we all had a good laugh about it since it seemed like this manipulator got what he deserved. \n\nA few days later, he messaged me on LinkedIn asking me if I was enjoying my current job. I just ignored it and went on living life.\n\nA few weeks after that, he messaged me again asking the same question. Again, I ignored it and moved on.\n\nThen a few days ago, he messaged me once more asking if I ever consider employment opportunities outside and in addition to my current job. For the hell of it, I replied saying that I do and I asked him what he had in mind. The TL;DR of the conversation we had over a week is that he was working with a wealthy couple who set him up with the opportunity to help other individuals start their own business selling products and services. He bragged about how this opportunity was going to allow him to retire in two years and by joining this MLM (pyramid scheme) I could potentially retire early as well. The whole time he was really defensive about all of the details (he wouldn’t tell me specifically who he was working with, what products he was selling, etc.) \n\nTurns out, he was messaging my friends as well about he same “opportunity”. We all began replying to him and asking for more details just to waste his time. The way we see it, the more time he spends talking with us, the less time he has to actually manipulate someone who is unsuspecting. \n\nIn his last message, he was asking if we could meet up for a “pre-interview” and I was going to finally just block him and move on with my life. However, I was telling one of the interns at work (who goes to the same school M and I went to) about this and he told me that M regularly makes trips out to campus to prey on unsuspecting students and try to get them to join his pyramid scheme. His latest victim has apparently been a special needs student and this just made me hate M more.\n\nI am thinking about scheduling a meeting with him out in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere just to waste more of his time and then just no-show and block him once and for all.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for wasting his time and WIBTA if I schedule the pre-interview?\n",

      "description": "Brief background info: I am a lesbian and have only recently come out to my immediate family (\\~about 3 months ago, and it was by accident\\~). The whole ordeal went 'okay' besides with my mom. She ended up disappearing for a few days, and by the time I left home to go back to university, we had only seen each other once before the beginning of the semester. She is very much still in denial, and rather than talk to me about it and hear my side of the story, she has not talked to me in person at all. She has only sent very hateful texts and a package to my apartment (which included a four page letter and bible). Basically she just keeps threatening the fact that she will never meet a future partner \"if I choose this lifestyle\" and has threatened not allowing me to meet my future nieces and nephews from my other siblings. \n\n\\~This has all-around been an emotionally painful experience, and I am still worried for my future relationship with my mom\\~\n\nSo now flash forward to today: I have been dating a girl at my school for a little over a month. Things have moved super fast and I have already met her mom and dad. She has been out since high school and all of her family is super supportive of her. From the very beginning of our relationship, she has been updated about the status of my mom and I's conflict. And since coming out is so recent for me, I told her I wasn't comfortable posting about our relationship on social media because I'm still not out to a few key family members and I also do not want to stir up more conflict between my mom and I. \n\nShe said that she understood and wanted to be there for me throughout this ordeal. \n\nHowever, subtly throughout our relationship she's been holding that against me and hated that she was a secret to my family. (even though all of my siblings and other family members I am super close with know about her. it's really just my parents who don't). She also said she wanted to be in a relationship where she could be super involved with the family, which I can't promise for the time being based on my mom's current threats. \n\nAs of right now, I am still somewhat on my parents' dime as I finish my last year at university, and I told her that I do not want to risk losing my education (my mom threatened to pull me from school) and that I'd rather wait until graduation to come out fully and tell my parents about our relationship. (my rational: we've only been together a month anyways)\n\n We have different ideas on how to approach this: I would prefer to wait to tell my parents because the relationship is fairly new and I don't want to risk my education. She thinks I should approach it head on and confront my mom. \n\nI completely understand that she does not want to be a secret to my parents for the time being--like the situation just sucks, ya know? Especially since she has been out of the closet for so long. \n\nEvery time we talk about it, I always feel like we walk away from the conversation with an understanding of the situation and we both agree that it's just not worth breaking up over--at least for the time being. However, whenever we get in a disagreement about an unrelated topic, she will bring up my family situation and make me feel guilty about it. Then she will threaten whether or not I am worth the wait. (Which I am confused because even if I did surprise my parents by bringing her home, it would NOT be a pretty scene anyways?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I confronted her on this and said that I need to be with someone more understanding of my situation, she flipped her opinion around again and said that she was willing to stay with me and help me through this. I just didn't believe her based on previous behavior, so I broke up with her... Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this happened a couple months ago, but honestly I’m still kind of appalled by it and I don’t really know what to think. So I’ve been living in an apartment with two roommates, and upon move in we all agreed to spend $30 each at the grocery store every time we go shopping. Both me and my first roommate, “Renee”, are on very strict budgets, so we can’t afford to spend more than that. \n\nFast forward into sometime in the middle of last semester, things are going pretty great, our budget is going just as planned, and my second roommate, “Sarah”, shows up with her mom both carrying a bunch of groceries. She didn’t tell us she was going grocery shopping, and after her unpacking I saw that a lot of it was specialty items that Sarah must’ve picked out for herself. Most of them were organic items and looked very expensive. Renee and I didn’t really think anything of it, we just assumed they were for Sarah and we didn’t eat them, except for some shareable items such as milk, butter, and bagels in which Sarah told us we could have part of. A couple weeks go by, Sarah’s mom buys her groceries again, and this time Renee and I don’t eat any of them as most of it was individual stuff for Sarah.\n\nSo fast forward about two months later, while we all were home from break, Sarah charges both Renee and I $65 EACH on Venmo, without any context or contacting us about it first. We both text Sarah in the group chat asking if this was mistake, and Sarah replies with, “No, this is for all the times my mom bought groceries and you didn’t pay her.”\n \nKeep in mind Sarah never told Renee and I that she was getting groceries, she just showed up at our apartment with them. She never asked us if we wanted anything, she just picked out things for herself, which in turn Renee and I didn’t each much of because we assumed they were for her only. We had agreed on a budget, and these extra grocery trips were clearly not a part of the original agreement. Also, Sarah charged us for these things literally months after they occurred, which kind of says to me that her mom was not planning to charge us but later was looking for ways to scrounge up extra money. My roommates and myself are all college students. Renee and I struggle to pay expenses on our own while Sarah’s mom helps her with rent and other bills. \n\nSo all in all, Renee and I explain to Sarah that this isn’t fair for the reasons mentioned above, and it ends with Renee getting pretty mad at Sarah, neither of us paying the $65, and Sarah saying she’s going to get her own groceries from now on, causing Renee and I to have to pay more each time we go shopping.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not paying her for these groceries that I may have eaten a little of, not knowing I was gonna get charged for months later? It just doesn’t settle right with me, and it honestly kind of angers me that Sarah’s mom appears to be trying to get money out of broke college students.",

      "description": "Ok so I know it sounds bad at first, but my wife suddenly lost her job in her chosen profession last summer. Fortunately, a friend of ours Mom runs a small business and was willing to hire my wife at the same pay she was making before, albeit only 6 hour shifts, five days a week. My wife and I looked at this as a stopgap until she could find other, closer work.\n\nWe learned very quickly going in that the business was in some legal trouble with the previous owners trying to cause issues. We figured it was fine as it was a temporary job and she would be long gone before anything bad happened.\n\nTime passed and I would ask her occasionally if she had applied to jobs or worked on her resume and I was always answered with her telling me she was working on her resume, or that she saw a job she was going to apply for. I didn't really push her on it as I didn't want to nag, and was busy with my own new career. I would sometimes suggest pottential jobs for her as I saw them come up. \n\nThe months ran on, and still no new job, still the same answers. Finally I realized it had been 8 months, so I about three weeks ago started to look for jobs for her and send her links, I started to ask her what jobs had she applied for, and how much more work was needed on her resume. Still she didn't apply.\n\nToday her boss lost the court case and her and all off of her co-workers are out of their jobs with no notice.\n\nI'm pretty angry because we need her income to not be close to broke every month. Our rent is almost an entire paycheck for me.\n\nI told her I'm angry that she wasted the last 8 months, now she's mad at me because I'm not being supportive.",

      "title": "WIBTA for asking adults to pay for themselves at my daughter's birthday party? (TIME SENSITIVE)",
      "description": "My daughter was born in December. She has always been envious of kids who get to have summer beach/pool parties. This year, I decided that I was going to make her wish come true. I found a swim school with an indoor pool that hosts birthday parties. The package for up to 20 kids in the pool was $475. (Or so I thought) I added six pizzas to that, so we are at $535. Add a cake, party favors, decorations, etc., and I'm looking at around $700 for this party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, while I was setting up the specifics of the party with the coordinator, she mentioned (now, three days before the party) that the 20 \"kids\" included in the pool actually applies to everyone in the pool, not just kids. She said that if any adults go swimming at the party - over that 20 person limit that I paid for, there will be a charge of $10 per person over the 20 people. We have 19 kids coming - I came in just under the 20 people. So now, if ten adults decide they are going to swim with their kids, that's $100 out of my pocket in addition to the $700 I am already spending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't sign up for that. This party is for the kids. I don't mind paying if aunt/uncle/grandparent of my daughter wants to swim, but am I expected to foot the bill for any random parent that decides they want to take a dip?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to send out a notice to all parents that responded to my Evite that with some party notes.

Some think I should suck it up and pay for whoever wants to swim. Some think this party is for the kids, and adults are on their own - I should send a polite note. My dad says I should print out a sign and hang it on a wall somewhere that says explains that they need to pay for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't sent the note out yet. I want to gauge the reaction I get here before I do anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Here is the note I am thinking of sending:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi All,\n\nJust a few notes regarding \\[Daughter's Name\\] Birthday party this \\[Date\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The room housing the pool is kept at a temperate of 90 degrees. Dress appropriately so you won't be too warm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Life vests, rafts, pool noodles, paddle boards, etc. are all provided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. There will be a lifeguard on staff during the entirety of the party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. The pool depth is four feet all the way around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Children under three years old must be accompanied by an adult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. The Swim School has informed me that adults are welcome to swim as well, for a charge of $10 per adult. You can pay at the front desk when you arrive if you choose to swim with your child. They will not allow more than 30 people in the pool at any one time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit #2: UPDATE posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a325w2/update\\_wibta\\_for\\_asking\\_adults\\_to\\_pay\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a325w2/update_wibta_for_asking_adults_to_pay_for/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my sister to get a second dog?",
      "description": "My sister wants to get a second dog. My sister and I both still live with my mom, she's turning 20 soon and I'm 18. We have a few pets, namely a cat, dog and a few fish. The cat and dog are just kinda \"the family's\" but the fish are bought and kept by my sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to understand where I am coming from. I love dogs and cats, but my dog is the light of my life. The one we currently have is called Marvin, and we've had him for six years. This dog is everything to me. I'm a huge introvert and due to having to move a lot of times throughout my childhood, hopping between schools and such I haven't got many friends. Most of my friends I only see online, and the only times I go outside are to go to the store and to walk my dog. So this dog has helped me through some rough times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday my sister and my mom were both downstairs. I went downstairs to grab a drink when my mom says something about how my sister was in a predicament. My mom wanted to hear what I had to say, but my sister seemed less eager to hear my thoughts. My mom told me that my sister was gonna get a second dog with her own money, and if I thought the dog looked cute. Now, I was kind of tired and generally speaking not thinking too hard so I simply shrugged and said \"yeah it's pretty cool\" and kept walking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's only when I got back to my room and sat down that I actually thought about it. And then it hit me, I really don't think this is cool at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we live in a duplex apartment. We aren't poor, we could probably sustain two dogs although it would cut things kind of tight. As for myself... I just can't. I hate the idea of another dog in the house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's mostly just the fact that I'll have to get to like this second dog, and I know I won't. My first dog, it clicked instantly. But a second dog? I just don't have room for that. And since I spend most of the day at home, and walk the dog most of the time, I just feel like I can't get myself to care. No matter how hard I try. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorst case scenario: The two dogs hate each other. In which case we just brought an actual invader into our home. If the new dog is a piece of shit then I will probably grow to hate it, as I love my current dog too much. If the dog is actually nice and friendly, the two will become inseparable. This will basically mean that by default if I wanna spend more time with our current dog I better start liking this new dog too. Then there's also the fact that I doubt my sister can care for the dog properly. She barely cleans the fishtank enough times, let alone something as fragile as a dog in an apartment. Our cat won't like it either, and just in general the time and effort it'll take to get used to this new dog will just be too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told my sister I hated the idea of getting another dog in the house, we had a debate about it. She ended up calling me selfish and saying that I'm not the only one living in this house. She told me she had been planning this since 2018, and wasn't gonna give up on it now. This was my boiling point, and I didn't really wanna have a massive fight with my own family so I just gave up and continued with my day. The reason why this comment pissed me off so much is cause of how inconsiderate it feels. She's the one who wants to bring a new dog. She's the one who's forcing everyone else in the house to adapt. And she never decided to tell me anything about it. All just because she wants another dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even know why she wants another dog so badly, and I'm not about to ask as it'll probably lead nowhere. I really just don't know, am I being selfish? I hope this whole situation fits here.",

      "description": "I'm not talking about sharing food or objects, I've got no problem with that. But for some reason I feel really bothered and uncomfortable when I have to share \"traits of personality\" with them. This goes both to stuff like bands we have in common, or with more serious stuff like telling them about my personal life, what I feel, why I'm upset, etc.\n\nFirst, I just don't really enjoy talking about movies, music and books I like, much less with someone that's enthusiastic about it. I like to feel that they're just mine, so talking about it kinda takes away the 'magic'. I just like to enjoy my stuff in silence.\n\nSecond, growing up, my parents taught me lots of times not to 'overshare' because sometimes we don't know if we can really trust someone, and honestly, I think that's a good thing. Probably saved me more than I think. But there's been some times where I'm upset at my friends or something else, and when they asked me I'd just be distant and not tell them. \n\nThey've told multiple times that I'm too closed and that it would make our friendship a lot better, but I don't want to. So, AITA for not wanting to share with others?\n\n(Sorry if it all sounds a little awkward, I'm not a native speaker)",

There was an old lady in the front. As she was unpacking her produce I gave her like 50 cm of room to work with and put her shit there. She sees my sandwich and with all the power she’s got in her arms grabs the toilet paper she’s holding and just fucking rams my sandwich. No one fucks with my sandwich. On the day, I was tired af and had no fucks to give. In my mind I called her a stupid bitch and just gave her a smile. She looks at me like her name is Karen and just turns around. Ok I guess. A minute goes by and suddenly out of the corner of my mind I see some meds start slipping from her area. They fall on the ground.

      "description": "The downstairs tenant has a tendency to leave at really late hours at night. She works from home and doesn't really leave the house during the day. Our driveway fits exactly 3 cars, so hers, my car and my mom's. Our town doesn't allow for overnight street parking and will issue you a ticket for doing so. My mom and I pull out our cars during the day so the tenant isn't blocked in (driving to work). This musical cars business happens on a regular basis but the other day especially annoyed me because my mom bends over backwards to accommodate the tenant.  It was 11:00 pm and I wanted to pull in my car. We always try to arrange it so the tenant is in the driveway first cause she doesn't need to get out in the morning. I go outside and see that she has left and her car isn't there. My mom insists that I wait to pull in my car until she's back. This is a weekday and I have to get up at 6:45 the next morning. 1:45 am rolls around and she's still not back. I go outside and pull in my car so she can't park behind me. The next morning I get a passive aggressive note in the mailbox saying \"don't block me out of the driveway\" from the tenant (she didn't get ticketed from parking on the street that night though). My mom gets mad at me that I did this. Maybe it is a tad petty but I have received $60 worth of overnight parking tickets in the past few months from waiting for the tenant to pull in her car at absurdly late times. Of course I have to pay them. The tenant also gets mad if I knock on her door in the morning to move her car so I can get to work. My mom just says \"we have to work around her schedule\" because she's paying my mom. I just don't get why I have to work around her abnormal schedule and pay for these parking tickets in the process.  AITA for blocking her in this one time to prove a point? ",

      "description": "I’m the manager at an office job so all of my employees are pretty well acquainted. We all generally get along and they know that they can come to me with work related issues. I’m an easygoing boss, it’s obvious to them. \n\nFor Valentine’s Day, everyone brings in some snacks to kind of celebrate the day. Usually stuff like brownies or cookies. I thought it would be funny to get the bean boozle jelly belly beans as a prank since basically everyone was bring something. I bought a few boxes of the beans and spent an hour or so picking through them and tasting which beans were regular and which were the nasty ones. Definitely wasted a lot of the nasty ones but oh well lol. They weren’t that bad, so I didn’t think anyone would react the way they did. \n\nI wrapped up around 20 jelly beans per person in Valentine’s Day plastic bags. There’s 9 people in my office. Valentine’s Day comes and I pass them out while work is slow and everyone came to the break room to snack on everything else there was. I told everyone happy Valentine’s day, that I appreciate them, and to enjoy the jelly beans. I saw a few people eat the beans and made weird faces which I thought was hilarious, and then they put them down lol. Eventually everybody was eating them around the same time. One worker came up to me and said he thought it was the funniest thing ever. Then, another worker that was sitting at a table says “what the fuck is this, throwawayquestions220?” \n\nI was honestly shocked, not only because of the attitude but because he cursed at me over a joke.. Next thing I know, three more people are complaining. A few people were laughing and some didn’t care, but it seemed like the majority of the break room was mad at me. I told everyone it isn’t a big deal while laughing, and I got a lot of stank faces and scoffs. After a few minutes everyone cleared out except the guy who was laughing with me. \n\nNow a few days have passed and people are acting resentful towards me. Not really engaging in friendly conversation, only work related bullshit. One worker keeps bringing it up and complaining, it’s been so annoying. I’ve thought about transferring him because he’s been such a downer about it. \n\nAnyways, AITA for this harmless prank? ",

      "title": "AITA For asking my housekeeper to be paid hourly/stay min. amount of time",
      "description": "I am a FTM to an infant who is kind of high maintenance (minor medical issues). My husband recently started a new high-stress job. Since then, he has been refusing to help with anything around the house. I don't just mean chores. He won't go to the store and buy his own deodorant, he won't clean up when he spills salsa on a rug/table, he won't pick up take-out on the way home from work and he won't take care of the baby. He is being treated for depression. This is just to let you know I am really overwhelmed because everything household-related is my responsibility - from cooking, cleaning, taxes, yard work, bill paying, to household repairs, etc. We don't have any family around. He agreed that we should get a weekly housekeeper...that way I can cut the cleaning portion of my load to 1-2 hours a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hired a housekeeper and she worked out great for awhile. She would stay 2-3 hours and charged $150 (with assistant). The first time I left her alone in the house, she basically left as soon as I was gone...staying a total of 50 min. The floors were not mopped, the carpets were not vacuumed and she left all the trash by the back door and didn't put it in the bins (and she didn't tell me, so it wasn't collected the next morning). When I told her all this, she apologized and went back to doing a good job...however, she started staying less and less time. One day, she was here for only 75 min. Things were undone.  So I asked her as nicely as I could -- \"I notice you seemed rushed yesterday. Is there a time that would work better for you to come clean?\" She said she wasn't rushed and she had done a good job. I pointed out the time (verified with the security log) and that her effective rate was $120/hour if she only stays 1.25 hours. She apologized. The next week, she stayed exactly 2 hours and then quit. She said that she is having surgery in 3 weeks (I don't know if this is true, she was smiling when she said it) and didn't think that her assistants could clean up to my standards. I was really surprised she quit. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask especially because we had a previous housekeeper who had similar problems. She would come when I was at work and, when I got home, things were left completely undone (dishes in sink, etc.) Security logs would show her coming for less than an hour, but when I brought it up with her she would lie and say she was here for 2 hours but my place was too messy for her and her assistant to clean in 2 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we have had a replacement housekeeper for 2 weeks. She is just one person. The first week she stayed 3.5 hours. Yesterday, she stayed less than 2. That means her effective rate is $75/hour. I feel like 1) if my house could be cleaned in less than 2 hours, I wouldn't need a housekeeper. 2) If it really can be cleaned in less than 2 hours, I am happy to provide more work like cleaning out the fridge or folding laundry.  Am I just an asshole?",

      "description": "Tl;dr: My SO shouted and hit my phone off my hand, i shouted back at her and now she wants to break up. \n\nMe and my SO (both 19, she is my first / i am her fourth) just finished a half-term test today. While doing the test we and another classmate were confused with a question, my SO chose C while me and the other classmate chose D. My SO switched her answer to D when the test almost end but later found out the correct answer was C. She started shouting and threw a tantrum, the janitor just happended to past by and do his job (lock doors, turn off lights, etc. since it was time to leave). When she turned off the light my SO was still checking a few things with her notebook. My SO then shout at the janitor with some very bad words and i just quietly told her it's time to go but she then shout at me that it was too dark and she can't get things in her backpack (it was not that dark) so i turn on the flashlight and its all good. Later on, while we were walking in the hallway she said \"take this\" to me. I didn't understand if it was her backpack or her phone since she's holding them with both hands so i just grabbed the backpack thinking it was the one she meant but she then use her phone to hit my phone that i was holding in my other hand to the floor while shouting \" i meant the phone!\". She then picked up my phone and handed it to me but instead of saying sorry she just looked at me with hostile eyes and hiss. I lost my control at that moment and shout \"I am tired of this, i can't be around doing this all the time!\" to her then walked off the other direction. 15 mins later i found her walking home and approach to say sorry, she then pushed me back and walk home alone. Later that night i tried to call her but she didn't answer and now i just got her texts saying she has nothing else to say and want to break up. We have been together for almost a year now and she was always almost insufferable when it comes to tests time, I know what happened was most likely an accident from her part and i was probably an idiot (She still hit violently enough for my phone to fly away from my hand though) but i want to know if my action was appropriate and how i should have reacted instead. Thank you for reading this long post!",

      "description": "I used to be very close friends with this person and we had lots of good times together, but I cut them off last autumn because they were toxic and manipulative. The \"break-up\" was messy at the time but we're civil nowadays even though we don't talk.\n\nThey have been smoking weed for the better part of a year now and it is illegal where I live. They tried to sell some to me as well while we were both underage last summer, and I am 99% sure they are currently selling to kids at our high school (I have heard these interactions). I am 100% sure they smoke regularly, and they have come to school high a few times as well as smoked outside during our breaks.\n\nThis person barely comes to school (1-3h a day even though they would have an 8h day) and often just disturbs the class if they are there. Though we aren't acquainted anymore I still know a lot about the severe mental health issues this person has because of how close we were earlier; they are becoming worse and worse. Almost everyone knows that they smoke weed - it's part of their reputation.\n\nAs I was discussing some stuff related to me with our school counselor, I decided to tell her about this person and their drug issues. This has now been forwarded to the principal, but that is all I know. I provided some screenshots where the person was trying to sell weed to me via text messages as proof of what I told the counselor per her request.\n\nAm I an asshole for busting them? This person has told me that smoking makes them less anxious and depressed - my morals do not align with what they are doing (selling, promoting) in our school community, which is why I decided to bring this up with a personnel from our school.\n\n",

The poor dog kept barking all the first five days.\nOn Friday when my brother (M25) is leaving to university the dog run out as fast as it can and my brother gets stuck on the door because of his backpack. He searched for it for ten minutes and come back to tell my mom, he leaves to college because he was having a important meeting with his thesis assessor (?) And my mom took her car and went to look for the dog. Nothing.\nWe told them about that. \"Your dog escape again\"\nAt the 7pm I was alone with my brother.\nMy cousin enters in the house without asking first and ask my brother about his dog in a very agressive way, as if taking care of him was my brothers obligation. Cousin told him that he doesn't give a fuck about his college, that he is going to help him found his dog, I repeat, the dog that they weren't taking care of... My bro is a very calm person so he just nodds. My cousin leave and slaps the door.\nI forgot to say that for years ago they let one of our dogs (a puppy) escape and they didn't tell us, I found it dead on an avenue, a car killed it.\nWe didn't complain. It was an accident...\nSo now, my cousin is full of anger and wants to \"talk\" with my brother because \"they made a deal\"... He even blame us because my aunt have a facial paralysis after the problem of the dog.\nAlmost tried to threaten us \"I don't know if something is going to happen or not...\"\nSo, we search for the dog the first day (including me when I came back to school) but because of his attitude we don't want to do anything. We're just waiting the exact moment to put a demand on him if he hits my brother or if he kill our two dogs.\n\nSo, what do you think?\nAre we the assholes? :( \nI'm very scared because I'm short (153cm) and I can't protect my brother(176cm) because my cousin have the height of a monster (2m) and I don't want my dogs being poisoned...",

He didn't really care about either of those scenarios and claims that if I won't give it to him, he won't have fun in college, in attempt to from what I understand, guilt-trip me into helping him break the law (not that good of a argument). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked my best friend AITA and he said yes, because realistically nothing would happen and I'm just being prude about it. I was a lot more responsible than my brother in college, and he's in a fraternity and will most likely make far more reckless decisions than I did, and I'm certain he would eventually get caught.

      "description": "So, my friend (30 years plus) posted a video to her FB page which showed a movie star commenting for about 40 seconds on how this current administration is taking away “transgender” rights. The actress provided no context to her claim. So I commented on the video she posted on her FB page with, “what rights have they lost”?\n\nShe couldn’t answer. Which developed into a “she’s only describing what she’s experienced”. So I asked again, what “specifically” has she experienced? She followed up with “It’s not my job to educate you” and “can you read”?\n\nSo I listed a few of my higher education certifications/degrees and so forth, and followed it up with, “those higher academic institutions require advanced reading and comprehension to succeed”. I know that she doesn’t have the same education and credentials as myself.\n\nWe bantered back and forth, to where she eventually responded with “The rights they are losing include serving in the military, losing healthcare because of the defunding of Obamacare, and the gov’t forcing doctors to confirm how many genders exist”. So I responded with:\n\n1 – No one has the “right” to serve in the military. Less than 1% of the population serves in the military, with good reason.\n\n2 – Obamacare was shit. I lost my dr and one my insurance plan once my premiums quadrupled immediately after it was implemented. Forcing people to buy into this program is not right.\n\n3 – Using “science” in now a bad thing? I don’t see how confirming how many genders is losing a “right”.\n\nShe didn’t like my responses, and immediately deleted the entire conversation. She followed up with that she would not allow “bigoted” conversation on her FB page. This was met with accolades from her peers.\n\nI'd like to mention, I do know that she has a nephew/niece that identifies as a transgender, so I can see why she gets defensive on the subject.  But, I have yet to identify the “rights” that trans people have lost with this current administration.  I am open minded.  I just like to be presented with facts, not feelings.....",

      "description": "This is more of are we the asshole. Me and my wife have been married for 2 years she has 3 sisters all of which we care about a lot. This is about her older sister Maira (28). Currently in a relationship with a guy named Erik (32). Both work in finance and make good money, while he is a little better off in the money department. Now from the beginning when I first met this guy I didn't get a great vibe from him. For one he was way to nice and another he was a certified platinum ass kisser to my wife's parents. I just remember telling my wife \"there is something wrong with this dude.\" She would be against me of course and say I needed to give him a chance and hang out with them which I agreed to, and we made it work. \n\nUntil about 6 months into their relationship my wife gets a call from her sister saying that Erik wants nuts. Apparently he went ape shit on his house and tore a door down and ripped a faucet out the sink. All this came from a message from a co worker my sis in law recieved. Started calling her a lying bitch. Slut. Yata yata. Demanded to know everyone she had ever dated and if she still speaks to them. All this with his nephew in the house. Apparently they move on from this until about 2 weeks later. When my wife gets a call in the middle of the night from some random stranger saying that he has Maria in the car with him asking if we could pick her up. What happened that night angers me to the core because I don't condone that type of shit. That night they were drinking and had one to many. Got home and she was chatting with some co workers through text. He got angry because he thought it was a dude. This led to him hitting her, smashing her phone, and taking her car keys so she wouldn't leave. She ended up running away from his house barefoot, in her underwear and a tshirt. Luckily the random stranger was a great guy who picked her up and asked if she needed help. \n\nAfter we get her home, she goes back to his house the very next day. Like nothing happened. Her parents found out about it and act like nothing happened. Say she should work it out with him and go to counseling. I for the life of me can't comprehend this. Me and my wife think she should get out of it, and it makes us look like bad guys because we try to avoid him at family functions. My wife's parents get angry at us for this and it makes us look like assholes to her family. No one else knows except us 4. Are we assholes?",

I'm very socially awkward , anxious and insecure about myself and body due to a girl I really liked and thought we were going somewhere ended up playing me and destroying my self confidence. To add more I also dropped out of college last year, I'm 18 and I have zero clue what I'm doing.\nBasically my parents have been constantly berating me about why I don't hang out with friends or have a great despite me being open about not having many friends and only one girl who is a really good friend, yet they seem fixated on that which doesn't help when I'm constantly being told that I should hit the gym, I weight 70 with a small sort of belly kinda not really but it still makes me insecure\nI guess TL;DR would be that my parents criticize everything I do and constantly try to control and manipulate me despite putting my flaws and fears on the table\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway because some friends know my main account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 20 years old female university student. Since last year I've gone through some shit with oxycodone and opiates in general, I've literally had highs and lows and now I finally decided to put an end to my addiction. I'm basically clean from opiates right now and I've rehabilitated by myself with the help of my psychiatrist, who also just diagnosed me with BPD, a NAS eating disorder and bipolar disorder. My parents know about by mental health problems just because they're the ones that \"pay\" for my therapy. Actually I luckily live in a country with a really good public health care system so it's not like they're throwing than much money on it, but technically they are paying so they want to know. I've never told them about my addiction because they are going through a bad period themselves and I didn't want them to worry about me as well (my mom just underwent brain surgery and she has BPD as well, along with anxiety and other stuff). To make things worse I study in another town and only see them a couple times a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm getting my shit together, trying to be healthy and take care of myself. I turned my life around and I've been pretty successful in the last couple months, got good grades at university, took care of my family (it was hard for me to do it before) and got a lot closer to my parents. Yesterday I decided to tell them that I had \"drug problems\", but I don't really know how to talk to them, so I just dropped that bomb and refused to give them any further information about it. I tried to, but it's extremely hard for me to talk about it, so I just told them that I'm now fully recovered and they don't need to worry about it. In the beginning they seem to take it kind of well, but today my father looked horribly depressed and my mother was basically crying the whole time, she was extremely nervous and had some panic attacks throughout the day. Now I'm thinking I should have kept it for myself, and since the problem is already solved they didn't really need to know. I'm feeling horrible for making them worrying so much about me and for not being able to show them how much I love them. I can tell they're really scared of losing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: told my hyper-protective anxious parents about my past drug addiction and now they're freaking out and worrying too much, and I probably should have expected it. I didn't give them any details and I'm having a really hard time talking about it so I'm basically avoiding the conversation, which doesn't help at all. Maybe I shouldn't have told them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for making them worry so much about me? AITA for not telling them more? What should I do to fix this?",

      "description": "For context, I am a 20 year old female, who has been diagnosed with severe social anxiety and depression, as well as high functioning autism. \n\nI don’t hate people; I’m just horrified of social interaction (most likely because of the above and people were horrible to me as a kid).\n\nFor Christmas, I asked for a pair of headphones so the long walks from my house to my job could be a little more bearable (it takes about 50 minutes to get there in the morning). I was expecting a cheap pair of £15 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn’t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.\n\n*Context over, here’s the important stuff*:\n\nI wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it’s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it’s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.\n\nI’ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn’t think it was a problem.\n \nHowever, a friend mentioned to me that at work her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn’t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I’m weird) and that everyone thinks you’re an asshole when you do that .\n\nI realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn’t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(PS: please be nice to people in retail, it’s a tough job and they don’t get paid enough to deal with assholes)",

      "description": "My ex and I started dating around junior year of high school. Things were going fine in our relationship until we started having cultural differences. Her being white and me being Mexican. My mother was never fond of her but she let it go. During high school we fought quite a bit but loved each other, but the fighting always ended with my having to apologize and asking for her to take me back (pretty dumb of me lmao). Anyways, she was very manipulative during high school and she always got her way, if I didn't agree with her viewpoint she would always chalk it up as \"you're a lousy boyfriend if you dont side with me.\" She made me lost very close friends of mine because I always chose her over them. \n\nI was very miserable with her until I decided I had enough and we broke up as high school ended. She bombarded me with countless text messages and voicemails. And I'm talking about 300+ for both in one night.\n\n The week before she goes to college in another state we decide to try long distance but i told her under one condition: I dont want people to know that I'm with her again until I feel ready. I had set this condition because I was barely getting some of my close friends back and I didnt want to damage things with anybody. She agreed and we departed to our colleges.\n\nThe first few weeks were alright until the long distance dilemmas started occurring. I would always tell her where I was and who I was with for safety purposes, yet She couldn't do the same. After our days of class was over all she ever wanted to talk about was how my day was. I always tried to start other topics such as movies, politics, research, science, and the latter, but she always told me, \"all of that bores me.\" I get mad but ultimately let it go. Halloween comes around and we decide to take a break from each other, I go to a party and end up making out with a another female. The next week I visit a friend at another college near me and do the same thing. At first I knew it was wrong of what I did, but we were technically on a break and still fighting with each other.\n\nJust to state: there was no sex, just kissing.\n\nWe begin to fight more about the long distance and we ultimately break up for good this time. She still sent me countless voicemails and texts as the first time but i decided to not answer. She begins to barely tell me about how she had a mental condition of bipolar disorder and depression and Thats why she was acting the way she was. I told her I had had enough and didnt want to speak to her again. She leaves me alone for a good few weeks and Christmas break comes along. \n\nLong story short, we end up having sex at a hotel room and decide to try again. The day after having sex I tell her it wasn't right what we did and I couldn't get back with her. She claimed that I had taken advantage of her but I never did, we both agreed to everything and we always stopped if one of us was uncomfortable. We go back to our schools and she begins to do the same thing again with the texts and calls.\n\nShe eventually stops until she somehow found out that I had started getting feelings for some other girl from my school. (She found out because I posted about that girl on my snapchat.) She got her friends to message that girl and basically shit talk about me. Unfortunately nothing went forward with that new female and we stayed friends. My ex tried to \"comfort\" me while I stayed mad at her for allowing her friends to do that. Somehow she began to send me endless calls and texts and even threatened to kill herself if i didn't take her back. I had no choice but to hear out and talk to her out of it atleast 3 times. She said that I was a horrible boyfriend to her and how I cheated on her for what i did during those parties.\n\nAll of her friends kept messaging me to take her back because she wasn't the same bad person she was during high school. Time passed and my ex got on medication and started getting better. She would occassionally beg for me to take her back and I would reply with a firm no. More time passed and this past November I ended meeting someone and we hit it off as soon as we met. We made each other laugh and overall I was finally happy.\n\nBut once again, my ex's friend somehow found out through mutual friends' snapchat stories and decided to message this new female telling her how \"he always cheats with all of his girlfriend's so watch out.\" My new female friend lets me know about this and things did not proceed any further. She can barely talk to me now because of what happened with my ex's friend. \n\nMy ex acknowledged that what her friends did was not right and tried once again to get back with me. She kept telling me \"I'm a new person because of my medication and I'm not that much of a bitch as I was during high school and first year of college. I can make you happy again if you let me and I know i wont mess it up.\" I replied with a strong no like before and told her to leave me alone. She did not so i blocked her from everything. Her friends ended up messaging me and saying \"she's a new person and you're an asshole if you cant see that. She's way different than before and can actually give you what you want, unlike those two other girls.\" \n\nHer friends ultimately accused me of not wanting to be with her because she had a mental disease and how i couldn't handle being with her because of it.\n\nI know she's doing better but I believed we deserved to break up for the best of reasons. I'm really glad that she's keeping up with her medicine and feeling great but I don't want to be with her. Her friends keep saying that I'm extremely stubborn for not wanting to be with her and how much of an asshole I am for not taking her back. I just no longer have those same feelings for her anymore and want her out of my life. Her friends put me in a really depressive mood and it made me question my self worth, if i was even worth being with someone else. I just want to be happy again.\n\nAITA for not wanting to hear, talk, or know about her after all of this? ",

When we initially met, there was some flirting going on but nothing ever really came of it and we both started dating other people. So, not a big deal.\n\nOnce we graduated, we kinda drifted apart as most people do but still kept in touch from time to time. But for the last two years, it's been down to me wishing him a happy birthday. Literally in our chat was me saying happy birthday last year, him thanking me and me asking him how he's been. He left me on read for the year. Yesterday was his birthday so I again wished him a happy birthday. He read it and hasn't said anything. Not a huge deal normally, I get that people are busy and especially on their birthdays, are inundated with messages. But you can't even send a smiley? To someone you've known for 12 years? \n\nJohn and I used to be super close and yes we have drifted apart as adults but the lack of communication is just annoying. I've made a rule with myself to only have people on Facebook who I truly talk to and are active in each other's lives. He's made it obvious that Im no longer a part of his life.\n\nSo would I be the asshole to just remove him from my friends list? ",

      "description": "I'm 2 days post having a pretty intense facial surgery, excuse any errors. Had a total nose reconstruction. My bf and I are in a LDR with 16 hours of time difference. He works a very strenous job and values his time off and time with friends. We've been working out the kinks with the time difference, and he has told me multiple times that he will change his schedule to accomodate me for this surgery. I know there's not a lot he can do from a distance, but I've been struggling with pain, loneliness, and very slow recovery. I was hoping to watch Netflix together or something but on my surgery day he went and played a softball tournament, and I haven't talked to him much since. He's sent me memes and asked me how I'm feeling, and ordered a pizza to my house ( I appreciate the gesture but I can't chew anything). \n\nI woke up this morning very sick, puked all over myself, and was considering going to the ER cause of how terrible I felt. I FaceTimed him and he said he'll call me back, but didn't and fell asleep.  It's been 10 hours now and I suspect he's sleeping off a hangover. \n\nTLDR; had surgery, recovery isn't going as planned, and my LDR boyfriend hasn't been there for me as much as I expected.",

      "description": "Preface, I am Vietnamese and when the infant is 1 month his/her family will host a small party to celebrate it. \n\nMy cousin, who I am really close with, is the mother of my nephew. She asked me a few weeks ago to do a photoshoot session with my nephew ( I just like to take photos and create scenes, I am not that good at photography anyway). I happily agreed and bought 2 cute bodysuits for the baby to wear to take photos. Her birthday was also a few days ago and I even asked her what she liked and bought it for her. \n\nNow yesterday was the day my nephew turned 1 month old, and my cousin's family hosted a party. My cousin talked to me all day yesterday, but somehow it *slipped* her mind to mention the party to me. It was only later last night after my dad came home from the party that he mentioned all the other relatives were asking where I was. I asked my cousin why everyone asked about me, and she replied she wasn't attending the party, she was upstairs with the baby the whole time. \n\nI didn't confront her, but I was and am still upset that my cousin didn't at least mention the party, let alone she didn't even invite me, yet she asked me to spend my time to take photos for her baby ( I also took photos for her pre wedding album and didn't get paid except for them inviting me out for dinner). So I told her I am now busy on the day of the photoshoot ( even though I am not busy). \n\nSo Redditors, Am I the Asshole for feeling upset and not doing what I promised to do?",

We dated for like 2 months and then one day she broke up with me out of the blue. \n\n A few days later she posted a picture of herself cuddling with this other guy that I went to school with. I was pretty upset that she moved on so quickly. A few weeks later my friend told me that my ex had been talking to this guy before she broke up with me and basically planned on leaving me for him. I know this isn’t necessarily considered cheating but I would say it’s at least emotional cheating. \n\n Anyways, a few months later he dumped my ex and she took it pretty hard. Me being a dumb 14 year old, I decided to talk to her about  it and she confirmed that he ended things with her. I then told her “now you know how it feels” and she got very upset by that and told me I was a terrible person for saying that. She was super pissed at me for awhile after that interaction occurred. \n\nWas in the right to say that to her?",

      "description": "This is gonna be long, so buckle up. Here's the backstory: 3 months ago me and my mother made a 4000 BRL (1000 USD) purchase on a website we trusted, called Kabum. We were used to making purchases there, and were actually frequent customers on their website.\n\nHowever this changed last august when we made the aforementioned purchase, and noticed it was taking longer than usual for delivery to begin. After an entire month of calling and emailing them countless times so we could get a straight answer from their support, we discovered someone had used our address (Though only our address) in committing a fraud 6 months prior, where 8000 BRL was stolen from Kabum (2000 USD). Thing is though, we don't have anything to do with this fraud, and up until now, we weren't even informed of this, but Kabum has decided to confiscate out money until the stolen goods are returned.\n\nJump to earlier today and we had our first court hearing regarding this case. Kabum's lawyer didn't really bring up any relevant points and just asked to reschedule the hearing - which did in fact end up being rescheduled.\n\nBut here's the part that matters: When the hearing began, and my mother was asked to tell her part of the story, she went absolutely apeshit. She was screaming, hysterical, disrespectful and basically threw a temper tantrum, calling Kabum and it's owners and employees all sorts of names (She even cried in anger).\n\nMeanwhile i stood quiet and gestured to her to try to stay calm and to control her anger - though she basically ignored that. And after an hour of Kabum's lawyer and my mother \"speaking\" the lawyer asked the session be rescheduled.\n\nAfter it was over and we had got out of the building, my mom said that i'm not invited to the next hearing, as i had not supported her - to which then i brought up (Calmly and respectfully) that her behavior during the hearing was unacceptable, and that though i strongly believe she is right, the way she conducted herself there was absolutely abominable.\n\nShe then proceeded to scream at me for bringing that up and not supporting her - she told me to \"not count with her for anything from now on\" and that she \"doesn't want to talk to me again for a very, very long time.\"\n\nA few extra details:\nThe hearing did not get rescheduled because of my mom's behavior - it was because Kabum's lawyer was \"missing a few documents\"\nAt no point was Kabum's lawyer or anyone else disrespectful to my mother.\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend’s mom that she is the main source of why he cannot have sustainable relationships, and therefore his depression?",
      "description": "So a little background here: I was a senior captain on a division I sports team last year. About a month before our championships, one of the freshman stopped showing up to practice. When I confronted him, he told me he had severe depression and was thinking about hurting himself. I stayed with him that night listening to him and telling him about my own struggles. The next day I walked him to campus counseling, and they admitted him to a psychiatric hospital for a few days.\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. One of my former teammates let’s me know that he’s worried about him. I arrange to meet up with him after one of their competitions and he tells me how alone he feels. I suggest that he probably needs to put himself out there a bit more, especially with the ladies. I tell him he can reach out to me whenever. He basically yes’s me to death.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, his mom is texting me thanking me for looking out for her son. I’ve known for a very long time that she is part of the problem. She has built up his self confidence to the point he has an incredible superiority complex that disallows for sustainable relationships.\n\nAnyway, we texted today:\nFriend’s Mom- “Did you talk to [son] this weekend? He saw a new psych on friday who said his 2 anti depressants may have been somehow making his lows even lower. Put him on a different med which [son] started on Friday.”\nMe- “Do you want my honest opinion?”\nFriend’s Mom- “of course”\nMe- “I did. I tried to get him to study with me at some point this week but he would rather study alone and in his room. So I sent him a scientific study that provided empirical research that changing up your study environment actually helps you retain information better, but he told me, “he’s not interested in other people’s opinions.” (Even though this is academic research). He doesn’t feel the need to “switch it ([his study habits]) up”.\n\nThat dialogue tells me that your son is extremely rigid, and closed-minded.  How do you, as a man of science, reject scientific research? That stubbornness/forthrightness combined with the pressure he puts on himself has undoubtedly served him well on achieving his goals. However, he disregards any blowback or things that might get caught up in his wake because “nothing can get in the way of me [(Your son)] studying for the MCAT.” \n\nThis parochial mindset is not conducive to developing positive, successful relationships. And I believe a therapist/psychiatrist will have trouble making that assessment because we are all inherently biased when communicating with professionals.\n\nAnd what that philosophy reading conveys is the same tragic case —an uncompromising “moral” agent who feels removed and alone because of their seemingly “successful” approach to life has no room for adaptation.”\n\nFriend’s Mom- “I see what you’re saying. And I don’t disagree that he can be rigid and closed-minded. What do you mean about a therapist having trouble making that assessment? Where does the bias come in?”\n\nMe- “When we talk about ourselves, we are doing two things:\n1. Mis-remembering reality. When we experience an event, our brain does not store the actual event. Our brain stores a condensed, easily accessible version of what took place.\n2. Misrepresenting ourselves. This is particular to those people who have trouble admitting their flaws. Your son falls into this category in my opinion.”\n\nFriend’s Mom- “Sure, we remember things like we think it happened or like we want it to have happened. [Son] has trouble opening up and appearing vulnerable. He probably does it better with me than with anyone.”\n\nMe- “Yes, I figured. And, respectfully and sincerely, I think that’s a big part of the problem. \nYour son has a superiority complex that I believe has been fueled by you. Now, I’ve never been a parent, so I don’t know where the balance between instilling self-confidence and promoting ruthless, unwavering hubris lies. But you may want to seriously reflect your role in developing your son’s self-aggrandizing behavior.”\n\nMe, a few hours later- “I’m sorry if I offended you. You asked for my honest opinion. I really do want your son to get better”\n\nI feel like an asshole but I also feel like it needed to be said. I sincerely care about her son because I was in a terrible place my sophomore year, and I feel a certain personal responsibility.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

By mid-day we were all pretty concerned because he's never far from his phone. I still have a friend that lives near him (my sisters and I are about an hour away) so I asked him to go check on him. He found him laying on the floor of his bedroom, he had had a stroke. The doctors think he had been on the floor like that for over 30 hours by the time he was found.\n\nMy dad was smart. He was a really intelligent, funny, and insightful person. I never got to say goodbye to that version of my dad. After the stroke he's different. He's not the same person he used to be. I still call him dad, but he's a total stranger to me.\n\nThere's a part of me that wishes we never found him. His life in the two years is not what he would want. He hasn't regained much of his mobility or cognition. At 72 years old he was still hiking, and playing guitar, and ice skating, and going out with friends. He was always an incredibly social person. Now he just sits in a wheelchair and watches TV.\n\nAITA for having these thoughts?",

      "description": "Cast:\n\nMe, H (my husband), K (kid), OH (old hag)\n\nHad a family movie day my H and our son, to see Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse this past weekend. There was only \\~10 people total in the theater, a family at the front, 3 of us on the left middle, K with her friend on the right middle (our row, but we are on either end), a couple in the middle a few rows up from us and OH in the very top row, middle. About halfway through the movie, I hear someone from behind me talking loudly, but it was also during a loud scene, so I turned to hear what was actually being said. It was OH, standing up and leaning over the row in front of her, almost shouting (because of the loud scene) GET OFF YOUR CELLPHONE!  I was a little confused since I hadn't heard a cell phone, and there wasn't the telltale bright glow you see. I watched OH for a few seconds and figured out she was talking to K in the same row as us. I watched K for another few seconds, and I saw that she did have her phone out, but it looked like it was seriously dimmed. Whatever, I go back to paying attention to the movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 35-40 minutes later, I notice movement out of the corner of my eye. OH is standing right behind K and is in her ear, YET I CAN HEAR HER, so she was almost yelling in this poor kids ear, GET OFF THE CELLPHONE! You aren't supposed to be on your PHONE! Do you want me to get the worker to kick you OUT!? Then she waddled her way back to her throne to continue watching over her theater kingdom for further infractions. There was no more outbursts, but afterwards when I was talking to H he thought I was crazy for thinking that OH was the true disturbance and that K with the cell was easily ignore-able. H thinks that if OH was annoyed by K, she was within her rights to say something. I feel like if OH was really that annoyed, after the first warning, go get someone to deal with it.\n\nSo, who is the asshole here?",

This is not untrue, but I feel like I also have a right to find some of them off-putting and express that like in this case. \n\nI am plus size and whereas I consider myself to be more confident than other my size, what I can't stand to think of is how this might have made someone else feel. I'm very body positive and to me, it's just ill-thought commentary that he didn't need to share.\n\nWhen I pointed this out, he backtracked and said he doesn't think being overweight is bad, but he was making a facetious statement about how people blue the lines between being plus sized and obese. \n\nI still maintained that his post made him out to be an ass because at the end of the day, whose life did he change by dropping this nugget of knowledge? If obesity rates were a genuine concern to him, he could have just as easily shared a kind or motivating sentiment that would have resonated with someone having body image issues. AITA?",

When we started having sex, he asked if I had anything I would refuse to do during sex. I told him that anal was a huge no go, and thought that was it. I've tried anal once, the guy I was with used a lot of lube, it still hurt and when I told him to stop, he didn't. He knows this. \n\nNow he's started begging me to have anal sex with him. I've told him that it was a firm no, that there's a lot I might be willing to do during sex, but anal is a boundary I don't want to cross. \n\nNow he won't stop bothering me about it. We should try this or that, \"it doesn't hurt if you use lube\", \"pleassee\", \"I promise it won't hurt\" and his favourite, \"But you've never tried it with me!' I don't care that I've never tried it with you, I don't enjoy it, have a bad history with it and I've tried compromising with you, but you refuse.\n\nHe's called me an asshole and asked me why I'm such a prude.

For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse.

      "description": "Sophomore year (I was 15F and am a senior in HS now) this guy who is a year older than me (16M at the time) repeatedly manipulated me into doing sexual things with him. He’s gotten quite a bit of flack in the past on the internet for doing some other things (harassing girls for nudes (two of them being a year underage under Washington State law), cheating on his girlfriends, etc.)\n\nThe issue is that I’ve done pretty much exhausted every option I’ve had to get him in trouble for being a famous douchebag, but there hasn’t been a lot of justice. I got him in slight trouble with the PD over the two underage girls, but he only has a *file* made now and no actual charges because we were told it wasn’t worth it to press charges being that it was likely that it’d be thrown out of court. I went to our high school about it and tried to get him out of the school show because we had a lot of younger girls in the program and he was doing illegal shit, but the school didn’t do much and our drama director didn’t kick him out because he was “valuable” to the program. His parents were told about this among other gross actions of his, and his mother lashed out at *me* instead of controlling her kid. I also can’t prove sexual assault on me (or the other girl he abused) because everything he did *to me* was *technically* consensual, but absolutely morally abhorrent and deliberate and caused me a lot of psychological damage. As for the other girl, she won’t press charges and I can’t and won’t do it for her because it’s not my place.\n\nHere’s the thing: I am sitting on a *shit ton* of evidence of him being a pervy, rude scumbag to a lot of people, and I have my personal testimony that can be backed up by numerous people that I confided in secretly at the time. He’s trying to become an actor, and I don’t think he deserves to have any sort of platform, nor do I think that it’s right that he didn’t suffer any consequences. He has since apologized to me, but from what I can tell, his actions have not changed and I wholeheartedly believe he only apologized because I was close to telling all of our friends what he’d done. I also confronted him numerous times in the past about what he did, and it took him about the 15th time to actually apologize.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I went public with what he did? This is a legitimate question, not trying to karma-bait or just get validation. I’m just seriously not sure if it’s the right thing to do.",

      "description": "My \\[24M\\] live in girlfriend \\[25F\\] hates her job in advertising. She often comes home and starts crying because of how abusive they are to her. I've met her boss and he is honestly kind of twisted. He knows that she will get deported if he fires her, so he dangles that her job over her head because he knows it will make her work overtime. He underpays her and tells his whole office that anyone who discusses salary will be fired. One glance at glassdoor and it's obvious she's underpaid for her role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is a very talented individual who went to a top 3 school in China, and then got her masters in states at a prestigious program in the US. She works super hard and all her coworkers that I've met tell me she's a superstar.She has been promoted multiple times but without a substantial salary increase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know she can get a better job at a better company that treats her well if she tries, and she **talks** about applying for a new job all the time. But inertia is incredibly powerful, especially if you're already exhausted from working from 8am - 11pm every day. We've had a lot of discussions where I try to talk her into actually setting aside some time to network and apply at other places, but she never gets around to it. For context it has been **1.5 years** since she started complaining about her job and she hadn't even applied to other places. In fact we talked about it briefly on our first date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer boss is intelligent &amp; manipulative. He will occasionally throw her a bone, like give her a tiny raise, or compliment her work, that makes her feel like \"maybe things will get better\" - but they don't, and she's always in tears about it a few days later. She also has some sort of internal confidence issue, combined with inertia, combined with not having the energy / motivation to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to do - it's not like I can apply for her. But it was breaking my heart to see her like this. So one day I asked her to cover her eyes because I had a surprise for her. I led her into the bedroom where I had put her laptop and then shut the door behind her, and held it shut. I told her through the doors that I would not be letting her out until she showed me a few submitted applications. I even left some water and food in the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe whined a bit at first and asked me to let her out but I refused. It felt cruel but necessary to finally give her a push. Honestly I have done a lot of talking with her, and I feel talking is just that - talk. She eventually caved and started editing her resume and writing the cover letter. After 2.5 hours she had sent a few applications out and I let her out, and we hugged it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told a friend about it, he was aghast and said it was an abusive thing to do. I have mixed feelings myself. It seems fucked up but it was the last thing I could think of and it worked. So I'm wondering: AITA?",

      "description": "This may seem really stupid, but after browsing this sub and reading about the similar situations.. \n\nI(28/m) decided to ask my gf (25/f) that very question, right after reading her the previous sub. At first she was like the guys the asshole she was thinking 7 to 10), then she heard the numbers(7 to 50) was like no okay that's normal. He's not the asshole\n\nSo I asked her, how many people has she slept with? She refused to answer and kept wanting to know why I was thinking about this*... Kept insinuating that it was only coming up because of the Reddit post. I had to break it down no it didn't, it was how she acted about lying about being a virgin, so already I have very little trust in what she tells me. Coupled by the fact that the last time she had sex date has changed twice (2 years to 1 year). I can honestly say that I'm not fully able to trust what she says. \n\nLets just say she refused to answer the question and kept changing subjects. I repeatedly asked her if she's going to answer the question, she said no then I replied, okay well I don't think we should keep talking tonight. Then she got into the entire your forcing me to answer this question, but when I force you to answer questions you get mad at me etc. We ended up getting into an argument loop, and it was already 4 am my time (she's 3 hrs behind). \n\nThis morning she called again, and well still feeling resentful from last night and kinda was looking for an argument. She gets off the phone, and ends up texting me, \n\n 'We've been fighting alot for the past couple days ... I think it's best if we clear our heads and take a break ... I don't have the energy to keep arguing with you and fighting every single day.\nI'll talk to you later.\" \n\nI replied with \"Yeah, I was going to send you a similar message, im going to focus on my school\" \"I need a break\"\n\nShe says no problem good luck. \n\n*Some background, she had me believing she was a virgin for over a year (when we were just talking). This past January, we almost had sex (LDR, and finally had own space), but let's just say it wasn't going in. And when she finally spoke up all she said was I'm dry af and started uncontrollably sobbing for 20 minutes. When she finally calmed down enough I helped her get dressed, and dropped her off at home thru a crazy crazy winter storm btw. She refused to speak about it the next day, nor has she spoken about it since. \n\nI honestly think we've gone too fast too quickly, and not by her choice, but rather than what her family wants her to do (get married etc etc). This winter break (last year of university for me)we spent 2.5 weeks together, were in my Hometown everything was peachy, she met my parents, brother, dog etc. \n\nWhen we went to her hometown she completely changed, was very short always fighting with me. When I was leaving her hometown to go back to university she even told me so. About how her city brings back her bad memories about people. And that she was being extra bitchy. \n\nAITA?",

And I asked him today if he wanted to jump on it and so on. Then I went up, b got a ball, then he came up too. And then he just began laying down and I began asking b if we could actually jump and such. B didn't respond pretending to be sleeping. Then I started jumping to get him up. B didn't get up. Then I just began laying down too and taking my own pillow and blanket I brought up earlier (He took it, I brought up other blankets and pillows too) He didn't want to give it to me. Then a pause of 5 min just of me trying to take it... And then I started jumping again to get him up cause I still wanted to jump. Then I tried and tried for a good 10 min. He just didn't want to get up. Then he said I could do flips if I wanted (cause that makes everything way better) But didn't allow me to actually jump doing it. Then my mum came in cause she heard us fighting about him not wanted to get down to his own bed and said he could take a sun chair. He didn't respond. Then he said I could also play football. Then I did it and then I hit him in the head by mistake and then threw the ball at my hand quite hard and it still hurts rn lol. And then I just tried talking to him saying I asked him to JUMP and he's ruining my day by this. And then pretending to be sleeping again smiling (I think he just tried to be annoying against me). And then my mum came back saying she didn't want to hear us fighting. And then I just left. And I said he was gonna clean up the trampoline and he said that was fine. Then I gave him his pillow and his duvet cause he clearly wanted to sleep on the trampoline and he was mad at me for making stuff more comfortable to him... Then I took a glass of cold water came back and just told him he isn't quite nice and he's 15 he shouldn't act like he was 3 (And I were also about to say it's like he's an autist but I forgot I got autism) And then I just went in and my mum told me she didn't want to hear us fighting again.

      "description": "Hi. This will be a long post so please bear with me.\n\nLast year I completed my one year masters' degree. I came to the uni as a shy, awkward guy. Not having much experience in the realm of romantic relationships, neither was I actively looking for them. I was insecure and still am.\n\nDuring the first few days of the degree I met this super pretty girl, who was way out of my league, I'll call her Sarah hereon. we hung out sometimes with groups and sometimes just us. I felt we were close for a few months where I ended up falling in love with her, but my life experiences told me that it will just end up as an embarrassment for me and ruin things between us so I never pursued her.\n\nThere was a speed-dating event that was organised in the campus to which she went and ended up dating a guy. I felt jealous and humiliated - I tried very hard to keep our friendship afloat but a sense of indignation was rising inside me. Months went on.. we definitely talked less, she started missing classes to hang out with her boyfriend and his friends. I told her what I felt about that.\n\nOne day we both got drunk and confessed our feelings to each other. She said she loved me...and that it was too late. From thereon she started texting me nearly everyday about how she feels about me,how she loves her boyfriend and me both, how she cannot break up with him, how I would've done the same or worse if I were her.But she also started lashing out on me if I hung out with girls she didn't like. She started dumping her assignments on me. \n\nDuring the last month of our course, we got drunk at a party and ended up making out in a bathroom stall. She said she loved me. I told her I loved her. The next day was spent by her trying to know who saw or knew about us doing that. She made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone because the implications that will have on her life would be severe. But it happened again, and then again.\n\nI had no ways to address my frustrations. I felt the un-uttered secret just never happened. I felt used, manipulated and silenced. A friend of ours, I will call her Lisa, was to leave to work in a remote region for two years. Realising she was going to leave in a few hours, I told her when she wondered why nothing ever happened between Sarah and I. I asked Lisa to not tell anyone. Except she told it to another mutual friend of ours, Jane, on text. Later Jane showed Sarah the texts\n\nThereon,she would bombard me with messages, she would call me a liar, untrustworthy etc while posing herself as someone who is always anxious about her image and what people are saying about her. She said I contributed in fueling her anxiety. At some point, she also said, \"Would you get me if I made fun of you for your looks\".. Right now she has blocked me. and is enjoying her weekend with her boyfriend and all of my friends, including Lisa and Jane from the looks of it. Everyone has sorted out their differences, except me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

Yep.\n\nD: As a coach I would recomend you to work out a little bit, I need to show something to this girl on the treadmill.\n\nI got really confused.\n\nM: Well, I can't just stop my exercise now, I need to finish it.\n\nAfter that he asks my friend the same thing and gets rejected too. After finishing exercising we went to the changing room and that guy was there too.\n\nD: Guys, sometimes you have to give up if someone needs it, especially if it's a girl. \n\nAfter that he made a \"great\" analogy saying that we should also give up seats to the elders in public transport (btw he was saying all this being full comando, not really relevant, just a funny detail)\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for resenting my partner’s teenage daughter?",
      "description": "My fiancée and I have been together for three years. When we first got together I really made an effort to connect with his then 12 year old daughter. Her mother is a chronic pot smoker who already had grown up children when (let’s call her Poppy) unexpectedly came along. I think out of a “been there done that” sort of mentality, her mother has never really put in much effort with her. \nHer father works full time and weekends to help support his daughter and to pay child support to his pot-addled ex-wife. As a result of this, he’s always done everything for her and she’s never really learned how to do things for herself. \nOver time it felt like the more I tried to help this kid, the less she was interested. I would take her to movies, classical music concerts, try to teach her how to cook, even things like how to put petrol in a car. \nI get that she’s a teenager and laziness is completely normal but she just doesn’t seem to have any motivation or interest in doing anything. \nI hate to say it but a few people have acknowledged that she doesn’t do a lot for the dumb blonde cliche. \nShe goes to a less than average public school that I realised when she was 14 had allowed her to get through without being able to pick up the basics like how to spell “Wednesday”. She once (via text) asked if nachos were something that could be “makon” for dinner. I contacted her school principal, alarmed at her lack of literacy skills and he said that they were aware of the problem and had been testing her reading levels every six months. He acknowledged that in the last test, she had been ill but wanted to go ahead, at almost 15 years old she had the reading level of a six year old. She’s now in the tenth grade and continues to come home every day saying she doesn’t have any homework. I can’t tell if this is a lie or if the school isn’t pushing them on homework. Either way, she loves the school and I suspect it’s because she’s not pushed very hard to learn. \nIt appears that neither of her parents have ever been to a parent/teacher meeting (one due to lack of interest, the other due to having to work), and so she’s managed to slip through the cracks of the education system without getting the basics. \n\nIt ultimately came down to me to start tutoring her in spelling and grammar. I work for an education based organisation but I’m in marketing so I’ve got no inkling on how to teach kids. All the while despite my best efforts in finding her worksheets to do and going through them night after night, I’ve grown resentful to the fact that I’m the one trying to push her to learn and she has no initiative to improve herself or show any gratitude (I know, teenager). \nShe will also ask questions that the answer to are obvious or could be worked out if she just thought about it. I’ve tried to say to her things like “let’s see if you can use your problem solving skills and work this out” until her father said I was being condescending and I shouldn’t be so mean to her. Today we were at a plant nursery and she asked what a plant was despite being barely two metres away from the big red label with the name of the plant clearly labelled. \n\nI also try to teach her to cook, showing her the basics in the kitchen and how to prepare fairly easy meals. When I try to get her to choose something and cook it under her own steam, she usually ends up crying over not knowing what to do. I’ve been showing her what to do for years. I’ve put her in charge of cooking once a week and picking what’s for dinner another day each week. She will procrastinate on both every single time until I feel like I want to bash my head against a brick wall. Her father’s work is physically intensive and he generally finishes work at 7pm and is absolutely starving. Poppy will still be trying to avoid doing anything in the kitchen until 8-8:30pm. I feel like she’s trying to get me annoyed enough that I will just give up and do it myself every single time. Nowadays it doesn’t even cross her mind to ask if she can help with dinner and will usually make herself scarce when dinner is being prepared in case she’s asked to do anything. \nWhen she went to go to her mother’s for the last three weeks of the school holidays recently, I suggested to her mother that she should continue what I’ve started and get Poppy to cook once in a while. Her mother immediately rejected the idea. I was aghast and tried to say something about teaching her life lessons but her mother just flippantly said that she’s happy to leave that up to me. \n\nThere are many many more examples but Am I The Asshole for being frustrated by the fact that I’m the only person who can see this kid needs to be taught and encouraged to learn how to do things so she can get by later in life but the lack of initiative, motivation and interest from everyone including her is making me resentful and less inclined to want to help her?",

      "description": "I live with my best friend (let’s call her Stephanie) and her now fiancé (I’ll call him dave) , I pay rent for a room in the house they own together. Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn’t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie’s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn’t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie’s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for £350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn’t afford it Stephanie’s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back £60 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The £350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have £350, I do not have £60 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back £55 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don’t buy clothes, I don’t go out for dinners, I don’t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can’t afford the hen do, and that I just didn’t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or “sell a limb” to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was “being negative” that I would “upset her mum who offered to pay to be nice” and that I’m “ruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl”\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra £60 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can’t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I’ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I’ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can’t afford it and I’m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don’t want to hurt my finances but I don’t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around £200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? ",

      "description": "I’ve been dating a guy, about 6 weeks. It’s been fun, he’s been thoughtful and accommodating. Yesterday he came over to my place and a couple things I’ve noticed make me want to end things with him - my friend says he was rude to them (and I fully believe my friend), he kept talking over me, explaining things that I already know. \n\nI know that ending things with him for those reasons is reasonable, but the reason I noticed them is because of a conversation about politics we had. \n\nFirst thing to know about me. I’m disabled, Jewish, Hispanic, and bisexual - I and people I love are directly affected by Trump’s rhetoric. I understand that some people think the system is doing more harm than any individual president can do, but I think that mindset is irresponsible due to the massive numbers of people being demonstrably hurt by Trump’s administration’s policies. Vote 3rd party in local and state elections to give them more recognizable candidates for bigger elections, canvass for whoever you want in the primaries, but when it comes to national elections, especially presidential, first priority for me is getting someone in office who will prevent the most harm from happening. I grew up in Florida - I’ve seen how third party votes act as spoilers. \n\nMaybe it’s a little judgmental, but I want to date someone who at least leans left (even if it isn’t as far as me) and votes practically in the elections (e.g. recognizing that voting your heart for a Green Party candidate because that’s who you truly want as president means that you’re eschewing your responsibility to do what you can to keep the worse viable candidate out of office). \n\nAnyway, my political diatribe is over. This guy is the one that brought up politics. He just. . . Doesn’t do them. He says he’s politically agnostic. \n\nHe bought into the “Hillary is no better than Trump, I don’t trust her, the DNC is evil for how they pushed her in over Bernie” propaganda. He said that he definitely thinks Trump is awful, but that having a choice between two terrible candidates was a tipping point for him, and that the system is awful (agreed) and we need to get rid of it instead of voting between two evils (disagree - we need to change the system, but voting third party when they have no chance isn’t going to do that, and is going to allow whoever you think is worse a higher chance of getting in). \n\nI tried to find something we agreed on, but it seems like we have a fundamental disagreement over what’s more important (fixing the system long term or preventing harm short term). And also in political engagement - I go to protests, I phonebank, and the injustices in our political system are important to me. He doesn’t seem to have an opinion other than “everything sucks tear it down.”\n\nI think this would cause long term problems. Do I suck if this is why I turn him down?",

      "description": "So context. Me and my wife have been going through a really rough patch in our marriage. So rough thats shes suggested we seperate. Its also important to mote that at this moment we live in seperate countries. Anyway today she thanked me for being strong and doing what i had to do in order to survive. I was confused because earlier that day she gave me a bunch of reasons why we possibly weren't good for each other. I replied with an ok thank you i guess. To which she asks why im unsure of my answer but not so directly. Theres alot of sarcasm involved and self criticizing that after 4 years together im able to translate into the previous statement. I told her i was confused and didnt feel like i deserved her thanks. She asked me to elaborate and so i did. She made a statement about how my texts seemed emotionless or uncaring. I apologized and explained that i had a bit of a mental break down today and was feeling very drained and just need time to reset myself. Immediately she starts calling. She just disregarded that fact that i was already putting my emotions to the side to help her understand what i was thinking and feeling because she felt the need to \"be there for me\". I ignored the calls. She followed up with some more sarcasm and self criticizing to provoke me to respond. I told her \" I literally just told you I broke down today and need some time to recover\". She followed up with more self criticizing comments to provoke more responses out of me. I replied with \"Im glad we made this about you\". Shes still messaging me but at this point nothing well say to each other will help the situation.",

      "description": "Hi all. So this morning I (M21) was talking to my girlfriend (F20) just as I normally do most mornings. She tells me that she was talking to her ex-boyfriend the night before (this doesn’t really bother me because it’s just talk and nothing more, I trust my girlfriend as we’ve been dating for 3-4 months now). Just some background, we’ll call her ex-bf “Bob”. Bob was, as she describes it, not the best bf in the world. He would never show up to visit her, left her on read for months on end and not talk to her for long periods of times (worst was like 4-6 months), and other more shitty things that I won’t get into. She has told me in the past that Bob hurt her a lot and I understood completely, which is why I told her to not talk to him anymore, but she keeps doing it, so I can’t do much more. Again, her talking to Bob doesn’t bother me. What does bother me is that afterwards she told me that whenever she has suicidal thoughts, that she talks to Bob about it. This had me completely upset and appalled. How could the same person who treated her like shit be the same person to be consoling her whenever she’s feeling down. I’ve done everything for my girlfriend like go out to see her every weekend (I work Mon-Fri and we live in different cities 2 hours apart), attend her recitals, talk to her every day, respect her wishes and boundaries, etc etc… I’ve done everything I can to make her feel happy and please her but she would rather talk about this type of stuff with scumbag Bob than with me… It just makes me feel like all my efforts are going down the drain and mean nothing to her and it's just completely disrespectful, I feel. Then she tells me that because the topic at hand (suicide) is extremely serious, it doesn’t matter who she talks with. AITA for being upset about all this?",

      "description": "My friendship with \"rachel\" has been tumultuous over the 10 years we've been friends.  She makes very poor decisions and expects me to either help her out of whatever mess shes in or listen to her whine and complain. \n\nExample: she decided to furnish her home with \"rent to own\" furniture and electronics.  The type of situation where you pay a small amount every month but you pay for years.  You end up paying 3x what the furniture is worth.  Ok.  Not the best idea but not a disaster.  But then she started getting calls from the rental company encouraging her to \"upgrade\" her furniture and electronics.  She upgraded.  When i pointed out that not only did she increase her payments she extended her debt another 5 years.  She told me to mind my own business.  Fair enough.  But then she whines about her debt to this company.  \n\nThe last straw for me was when. We went out for dinner and she whined and complained the whole time about how she cant get out from under the \"crushing debt\".  But in the next breath shes bragging about the new 4k tv she just purchased(rented?) through this company.  I basically tuned her out but then the bill for dinner came.  Suddenly she \"didnt know it would be this much\" even though its a restaurant we frequented.   She hinted strongly that i should treat her because shes saddled with horrible debt.   I paid to avoid causing a scene.   On the walk home i decided i couldnt take it anymore.  So the next time she texted i ignored it.  \n\nI feel terrible because we have been friends for a long time.   But i also feel like shes never going to stop complaining.  I dread talking to her.   I never thought id ghost anyone.  But i feel like there is no choice here.  \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So big trigger warning if you can’t hear about sexual assault or abuse of victims. \n\nBut am I the asshole here? \n\nThe short of the story is that I dated this dude for a year, we’ll call him Jake. And I started figuring out pretty quickly that Jake was problematic as fuck. And the longer we were together, the more I had to call him out on his shit. \nHe groped me at a party after I said no repeatedly, he set me up on a blind date with this dude who thought I was hot without my consent (and told me we were just hanging out with him to play video games until the last minute when he told me the truth). He lied to me about a lot of things big and small, and he gave me an STI without any disclosure whatsoever that he had one. And the longer I dated him, the more I heard him tell stories about how he’d ‘get crazy drunk’ with female friends and then fuck them. And as he kept telling me these stories, I realized that at least two of them had made it super clear in front of me that they weren’t interested in him. \nEvery time one of these offenses happened, it would be a fight. We’d go in circles for hours. I spent a lot of time doing my best to patiently explain why these things were wrong and that he needed to stop. But it was of course super frustrating because he wasn’t taking real accountability. As it went on, he started gaslighting me and telling me I was overreacting, and then we’d fight about what gaslighting was and why THAT wasn’t okay. It was a damn mess. \nNeedless to say, we broke up. But st some point, I had committed myself to trying to hold him accountable rather than just bailing on the relationship. So what ended up happening was, he made up a manipulative situation where he tried to claim he was mad at me after he fucked up, and then when I tried to get a hold of him to be like ‘what on earth did I do? What do you mean you’re mad at ME?’ He refused to answer or take my calls, no explanation, and then started telling all our mutuals that I was crazy and stalking him. He basically tried to escape from the accountability, and also frame me as crazy so that nobody would believe me if I told them. \n\nTHAT was the last straw for me. At this point I was finally convinced that this dude was dangerous and there was nothing I’d be able to do to get him to change. \n\nSo I went to his roommate/bff. I went to this dude we’ll cal Albert, and I reached out first to say ‘hey, I’m super concerned about a bunch of things regarding Jake, can we sit down over a cup of coffee? Because it’s a lot.’ I regret now doing this all in person, but we’ll get to that. \n\nAlbert agreed, so we sat down and I laid out everything that had happened to me, as well as everything Jake had told me about. In addition, Jake told me how he had a restraining order against him for raping someone in college. Someone we all still knew. So I felt like I had a lot of reasons to be both angry, but also concerned. And because Jake had created this whole stalker narrative, I was afraid to talk to anyone about this, and I was afraid to go public myself. I felt powerless. \n\nAlbert agreed with me that I had reason to be concerned. He was very reassuring. And he basically told me ‘don’t worry. I’ll take point on this.’ So I trusted him. \n\nA few months later, I had moved on. I left our whole friend group because I didn’t feel safe there anymore, and I was trying to get on with my life. And Albert reached out to me on Facebook and says ‘hey I just want you to know, I’ve decided to try and rehabilitate Jake. I’m gonna try to hold him accountable.’ And I was like ‘are you kidding me? I already tried that. And I already TOLD you I tried that. He hasn’t even apologized to me or shown remorse for anything he’s done.’ \nAnd Albert was basically like ‘sorry you feel that way.’ So tough titties for me, I guess. \nI also asked Albert what exactly that meant. Did he go down the list of behaviors and tell Jake to stop them? And Albert was just like ‘nah I asked him if he understood he’d fucked to and he said yes, so I think he got the point’. Massive eye roll on my part. But what was I gonna do? \n\nFast forward to a year later. A mutual friend of ours, Catherine, reaches out to me and asks me if I’ve heard anything about Jake having negative/predatory behavior. \nI was too afraid to tell anyone else what had happened because Jake was telling everyone I was a stalker. So I’d kept loosely in touch with Catherine, but once she asked for info, I unloaded everything I knew   Then Catherine told me that Jake had assaulted two more women at a con, and she was about to go public with everything. She did, and it caused a huge stir in our community, as those things do. \n\nBut shortly after the truth came out, Albert starts posting on Facebook about how shocked he was, and how he had been ‘following his blind optimism and believing the best about his friend’. He went on and on about how much he was hurting, and it was a clear grab for sympathy. \n\nThat was it for me. I lost my damn MIND and went off on him publicly. He was making all this about HIM, and how hurt he was that his bff was raping women, but dude, you weren’t a victim! You weren’t one of the (now many) femmes that this dude actually hurt! And when I tried to tell you, you blew me off! A year ago! \nSo I went O F F. Told him that this ‘blind optimism’ bit was bullshit and that he was actively choosing one man in his life over many women. And further, it was a roommate, so he was protecting and enabling this dude because he didn’t want to lose the house they shared, or give up Jake doing all the work Jake was doing to keep things together for the household. He had a lot to gain by keeping it quiet, and a lot to lose by doing the right thing. Even after Catherine outed Jake as a serial rapist and abuser, it took like 4 more months for Albert to kick him out of the house. \n\nBut here’s the thing. Albert is super popular. When I went off on him, he fought back and started attacking my character. \nHe said that ‘the reason I didn’t believe you or keep you involved is that you’re a toxic, emotionally violent, vindictive bully.’ And he started trying to imply that I was lying, breaking down some of the timelines and details of what I was saying, questioning the truth of it all. And several other people chimed in and came to his defense, calling me similar names, or saying basically ‘how dare I kick Albert when he’s down’. \nSo I backed down and unfriended him, and decided to remove myself from the conversation. Nobody had ever called me any of those things before. And I don’t honestly know if they’re true. I’ve been wondering ever since. But of course I also can’t help but feel like maybe he was just trying to deflect and discredit me to cover his own ass. \n\nBut if they are true, does that impact things? Would me being a toxic person mean I should have stayed out of it? \nWas I wrong to call him out on what I perceived to be misogynistic behavior, disbelieving women, and enabling a rapist? \nAm I wrong to feel like he betrayed me personally and owed me an explanation? \n\nThank y’all for reading, I know it’s a lot. \nI’m still really hurting over this, obviously.

Things seemed to be headed towards a relationship but I did notice some red flags as I got to know her more and more. Eventually, I asked her out and it went well. However, I didn't feel right about knowing that I was getting myself ready to soon have to say goodbye to this girl because she'll be headed off to college soon.

      "description": "So, a little bit of context here: I just turned 17, and I currently am and have been unemployed for all my life. My dad's been pushing for me to get a job since I was 15 because of my fierce spending habits(I have been incredibly spoilt by both parents for my entire life. I know, I'm a spoilt shit blah blah blah, but that's not the question at hand.) My dad runs a clothing company in where he supplies clothes to multiple different retail stores. It is not a big company, with only about 3 employee's not including himself. It makes an income that is incredibly inconsistent, yet has never gone into the red. This has caused my dad to become very conservative when it comes to money and spending in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last Thursday my dad came home and told me that I could do a quick job at his company. My job was essentially to work as a photographer for the models he had already hired because hiring actual, professional photographers was incredibly expensive ($100+/hour) The idea was that he would buy a cheap camera and I would try to become the best photographer I could in 3 days. I assumed this was going to be a one time thing and I had nothing else to do anyway since it was spring break, so I went with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day was my 17th birthday. My dad went off to work but left me a birthday present: a car. A 2004 Grand Cherokee. This was not something I asked for, mind you. This was a complete surprise. I knew that my dad would help me fund a car to some extent (We had talked about him funding 1/2 of the car that I would buy) but the idea was that I would get the car when I could legally drive, which happens to be in about 5 months from now. I was thankful of course, but not as thankful as I probably should have been since the idea of buying a car was not even in my mind yet. This comes into play later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, fast forward to the day after the shoot: Monday. Turns out, the pictures I took were good. Good enough for both the model and the people editing the pictures not to question my skills as a photographer. My dad took this and ran with it, booking two more sessions on the spot without mentioning a word to me until Wednesday. He booked a shoot for Friday and for Sunday. Luckily, I had nothing planned for either of those days, so I have no problems with doing either of those shoots. The problem is that I know for a fact that once I do these shoots, he's going to keep booking shoots with the idea that I would be the photographer and work for free, i.e paying off the debt of the car. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't particularly enjoy photography, however. It's not something I would like to be doing on a regular basis. Add to that the 6 hour, semi randomly occurring shoots that he has made clear I don't have too much control over, and it's creating a very foreign situation and I'm not sure if I should continue with it or not.",
