      "title": "WIBTA for threatening legal action on our ex roommate if he doesn’t pay us for the carpet/windows he’s ruined?",
      "description": "Ok so I posted here a while ago about evicting our roommate due to his lack of hygiene. I was ruled NTA. So I have one more thing to posit here to you good folks. We had the landlord give him his eviction notice it due to the hostility that was quickly rising, we had the landlord make him a deal; if he could be out by the end of the week (he was called on Tuesday night, we would want him 100 percent out by Sunday night) then he wouldn’t need to pay rent (Otherwise it was a standard, pay for this month and you’re out by the first of the next month eviction). He took the deal, which in my opinion was more than gracious.\n\nThen come Sunday, with a pretty good amount of his stuff still at the house, we hadn’t heard anything from him. We waited another few weeks to give him his space. But finally three weeks a after giving him the boot, we had the landlord reach out to him again to tell him he needed to get the rest of his stuff out. He said he would and he showed up the next day to get some of the remainder but he still left a handful of pretty nice stuff, and a bunch of garbage in his bedroom. So we decided to “assist” by gutting his room and relocating the contents to bags/boxes in the garage. \n\nThis is when we “experienced” the real condition of the room he was renting.  The smell was still attached to the walls/carpet/ceiling. The carpet was, for lack of a better, less disgusting term, “crusty” including several spots with stains and still others with what I’m hoping is melted candy. Best case scenario we can have the carpet professionally cleaned, worst case is a full recarpeting of that room. Also he’s cracked one of the windows and broken the track on the other. Ultimately we’ll need to replace the windows sooner than later. \n\nSo my question is would I be the asshole if I reached out to him and tell him that if he doesn’t either pay rent for the month (because he didn’t hold up his end of the deal and wasn’t out by the end of the week) or at the very least pay to have the carpets cleaned and the windows replaced, we’ll be taking him to small Claims court? Also, I know this isn’t r/legaladvice but would we have a leg to stand on in SCC? ",

      "description": "My friend has depression and has been struggling with it for a while and one of her closest friends (z as I will refer to them) has gotten into an argument with her and she said is making her depression worse than it has ever been in two years and I am really worried about her.  \n \nThe backstory to this is that she told z that he shouldn’t be friends with a certain person (L) because he is a bad influence on z and causes a lot of drama in any friend group he is a part of. L was accepted into a group that already had enough drama to begin with and is only making it worse. The one party I went to with him he locked himself in the car and wouldn’t come out because his shoes got messed up. Overall it’s a generally accepted idea that L is bad for everyone so was my friend in the wrong telling z to drop him?\n\nAfter she did this they got into an argument and z started ignoring her with caused a spike in her anxiety and depression and things haven’t gone back to normal the way she would get her anxiety and depression back under control. The only problem in z also has anxiety and depression and it’s having a flare up that was most likely the cause of drama with L so is it right for her to drop him tomorrow? If she doesn’t I’m worried she will do something drastic she already tried to do something drastic. So is she the asshole or is z the asshole?\n\n\nTL;DR my friend wants to drop someone who is making her anxiety and depression worse is she the asshole for doing this?",

During the day it is usually kept at heat 71 with no complaints. \n\nMy roommates however (2 of them, 1 of me) insist on turning it to cold 68 at night because they get “too hot.” But they don’t verbally express this and make it known when it’s changed, one of them just stays up until 2am to change it. To me this doesn’t make sense as the temperature will be regulated by cold air, never actually reaching 68 degrees. Every morning I wake up due to shivering and proceed to change the thermostat to heat, while sending my disappointment in our group chat. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I don't live with my parents, I pay for everything involving my dog including Vet, food, toys, grooming, etc. She is 6 yearsold, a small breed, and not high energy. \n\nMy mom heard I was paying for doggy daycare 3 days a week so that my dog isn't alone my whole work week during the day, and offered to have my dog stay at their house every day during work instead for no charge. We have a strong relationship and her and my dad both love my dog and insist that it's no problem having her over. They also have two other dogs who are large breed.. the three of them get along great.. so it really is an ideal situation.\n\nThe problem is, in the two years we've had this arrangement my dog has consistently put on weight because my parents will not stop feeding her treats and people food (chips! cheese! large dog biscuits!). I've bought small dog treats to leave there, asked them repeatedly to stop feeding her people food, and they have not stopped. They just keep buying other treats and feeding her off their plates and at the TV saying things like \"Oh but she loves it\" \"It's not a *big* piece\" \"It's not a big deal, let her live a little\" \"She runs around the yard when she's here, she'll burn it off\"\n\nThis week I took her for her yearly vet checkup and shes gained even more weight since last years checkup. The vet commented that her weight should be something to pay attention to.\n\nI spoke to my mom about it and said \"This is out of hand, she can't have people food okay? She has to go on a diet.\" and she said okay but then a few days later I SAW her feed her a chunk of cheese when I picked her up, and exclaimed loudly \"you CAN'T feed her like that mom, we TALKED about this!\" She got super offended and said I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill and that this was the first treat she's given her since our talk, and I don't have to be a jerk about this after all I've saved so much money not using daycare (which she has never thrown in my face before) and i shouldn't be ungrateful.\n\nThis feels like such a trivial thing for an otherwise great arrangement. Am I the asshole? Am i making this a big deal when it isn't?",

But he's throwing things, and crying after they argue all the time (and they argue over NOTHINGs again and again) she is, in my obsorvational opinion, being cruel to him, name calling, refusing to answer calls or texts for hours when they are apart, physically walking up on him and finger pushing him asking him if he wants to hit her during arguments. It's all because she knew he has always come back to her, even after an infidelity issue 3 years ago, he always will. I couldnt watch it anymore! I pushed and steered him down the path of agreeing with me that her behaviors have become abusive, cruel and for the sake of his sanity he needed to walk away. He broke up with her last night and left her at her dads with her clothes (only for her to start a new fight over letting him pick up a dog he bought while they were together.)",

      "description": "I am a female. I've wanted a haircut for a while now. Like, a pixie boy cut. Right now my hair is super long, it falls at my back dimples. I love short hair and want it cut it off because I love the way it looks and frankly, hair as long as mine is too high maintenance, it falls out all the time, gets caught in things, tangles, etc. So I made the appointment to get it chopped.\n\nMy boyfriend, upon telling him, says \"Oh no, please don't do that, I'll hate it\" and gets this disgusted tone in his voice. He says that short hair isn't attractive to him and that when I cut it he won't be as attracted to me. This obviously hurts because I want to be a short haired lady but I know if I cut it, I will always be thinking in the back of my mind about how much he hates it. He compared it to if his girlfriend got fat, he would be less attracted to her.\n\nBreaking up over something as trivial as a hairstyle seems immature but I want short hair damn it. But of course I don't want to intentionally do something that I know my SO doesn't like. AITA if I go through with cutting my super long Rapunzel hair to a short Ellen Degeneres?",

      "description": "I'm generally one of the belief that women should have autonomy regarding their bodies, which is why this is a hard one for me.\n\nOriginally when my wife got pregnant I thought nothing of her continuing to smoke, because it was my understanding that as it became more socially acceptable of a habit more research had been done that showed it was safe to use during pregnancy. However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.",

      "description": "Throwaway account cause my main one has references to what school I attend.\n\nThe other day a group of students approached me and asked if I wanted to be in their group chat they were planning to use during the final.  As in the are planning on keeping their phones under their desks (the desks are shaped weird and it’s pretty easy to hide material underneath) and texting each other back and forth during the final exchanging answers.  I said no because I’m personally too afraid of what would happen if I were to get caught being a part of the group chat.  But ever since they came to me I’ve felt like I need to tell the professor.  I’m not normally such a little bitch about this stuff, but this isn’t saving the equations you’re supposed to have memorized into your calculator, this is legitimate cheating.  It’s unfair to everyone else who studied/has been studying the past few weeks.  All I want to do is somehow suggest to my professor that he check for our phones or collect them before the exam begins, just tell him I’ve heard some rumors that some students were thinking of using them during the exam.  I would never give the professor names, I feel like that’s kind of fucked up.  But is it just as fucked up to for me to say anything all?  Should I just stay out of it, let them risk getting caught, none of my business?  Would I be the asshole for warning my professor, even if I don’t give up any names?",

      "description": "Quite a bit of relevant backstory to this. My parents divorced when I was young and I grew up predominantly with my mum &amp; step-dad, who I am very close to. I see my dad from time to time but I’m not super close him. I also grew up in London (UK) in a medium-nice area and I am 28. \n\nMy mum &amp; step-dad bought our reasonable family home in the late 90s for under £200k. They eventually bought another, smaller house on the English coast thanks to both being quite high earning professionals. In 2014 they sold the family home for nearly £1M and live mortgage-free &amp; retired in their coastal home in their 60s.\n\nMy wife and I are thinking about having kids and are currently living in a tiny rented flat in the same part of London to save money. I had a chat about future housing with my mum who implied they would only have £30k they could help us out with. I would guess their current net worth to be around £2M. The only peers of mine who have bought places needed considerable contributions from parents. \n\nI have politely but firmly kicked off that the reason they can live a luxurious life now (around £90k per year with minimal housing costs) is because the £1M they sold their house for means people of my generation need to find a million to buy the same building. I tried explaining the numbers to my mum of how unbearable even a £400k mortgage would be (70% of post-tax salary on mortgage payments) and she dismissed this as being normal for when you start on the property ladder. \n\nAITA for being ungrateful with her offer or is my mum the arsehole for not helping me out enough?",

      "description": "I was not present during this. Names have been changed.\n\nSo my grandma comes over to my moms every other week and stays for awhile. She brings her dog, B (corgi mix).  My mom has Worm (aussie mix). We have had Worm for 8 years.\n\n\nI recently got Worm a bone. The dogs fought over the bone and Worm bit B’s neck and held on - but from what my mom told me, there’s no injury at all.  My mom tries to break them up, but B bites her on the wrist, making blood SPURT out of her. My mom went to the ER after locking them in different rooms. My grandma drove her.\n\n\nMy mom didn’t report B. This isn’t the first time my grandmas dog has sent someone to the ER.  In high school, he sent one of my friends to the ER for biting their pinky so badly.  He was also not reported for that incident. B is a very possessive and jealous dog when it comes to food, toys, or humans.  B has also NEVER been professionally trained and has barely been trained by my grandma.  The boy barely knows how to sit. \n\n\nMy family (my late father and I) trained Worm, but we’re no experts. Since my mom moved to a smaller house with no backyard, Worm has gotten leash aggressive and less friendly with other dogs.  Before B came along, Worm was always playful and social with other dogs. When I’m home I notice that Worm will whale eye and move away when B comes towards him. I don’t think my family notices.\n\n\nGenerally, I’ve been having issues with my mom about Worm.  She doesn’t make the time to walk him for longer times, or put in the financial effort to get him a dog walker or even groom him.  The only time Worm gets brushed is when I am visiting and that’s only once out of a few months.\n\n\nI told my mom that I’m looking into a dog trainer for both dogs, esp for B. I told her I would help pay since my grandma is poor; I also offered to pay for Worm. My mom seemed sad on the phone.\n\nI regret saying that I would help pay.  My friends tell me that it’s not my responsibility.  I worry that it would be a bad investment if my family doesn’t put in the effort. I also just started out at an ok job in an expensive city and my first student loan payment is soon.\n\n\nTL;DR: my grandmas dog bit my mom while fighting with my moms dog. Mom went to ER. 2nd time this dog has sent someone to the ER.I am pushing for professional dog training and I offered to pay but now realize it is not feasible.\n\n\nWIBTA to revoke my offer to pay and, if they don’t put in effort, give them an ultimatum of “train B or I will report him” to whoever you report this shit to?

I usually don't go to those games because the timing doesn't work out even though we pay for the full season. \n\nShe runs the front desk two days a week at a local your studio and takes a 7:00 p.m. your class most Tuesdays. \n\nSince I wouldn't make a lot of the games this season I asked if she could maybe switch her schedule once or twice so I can make some of the games.\n\nWhen I came home today she told me the yoga  studio is closing. And that she rearranged her entire Tuesday schedule so that I can make the games.\n\nShe really loves the yoga studio because it gives her a little break from the kids and she has developed a lot of good relationships there. She is really upset that it's closing and stormed out the door to go to work. Saying that I can go to soccer anytime I want now that she doesn't have a purpose anymore.\n\nThis is not all what I asked for I asked to see if she gets while only if it wasn't a big issue.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Some background: I currently work at this fastfood chain specializing in selling hotdogs, hamburgers, fries and shakes for a little over a year now. It was nice when I got put on drive thru then shift manager in a span of less than half a year. \n\nThe manager started calling me in quite often which I agreed to (20-28 hours/wk to nearly 42 hours+ a wk) along with my classes in the morning-afternoon its tough. I got my sibling a job here as well (its their first one) - the problem stems that it feels like the manager won't hire people even with team members leaving. \n\nWe lost maybe 7+ workers over the last year alone and now we are short-handed while the store got busier and busier; most nights we have \\*2\\* people covering the store (my sibling and I), from fryer, grills, front register, drive-thru. He plans to pay me a higher hourly wage this year but I rather not take it and he hires more workers. Another thing: one of workers has been here for over 3 years plus and gets treated like a princess (free food, calls out when she wants to for weeks/months at a time - I don't think she is even in the system and gets paid under the table in cash using a time card by the boss). So yea - if we leave he will be the only one working the store at night, kind of feel guilty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I live in San Francisco. This is the first living situation I’ve been in where a)*my landlord shares part of the property* and b) *my roommates don’t smoke*.  \nI’m naturally a tightly wound person, and I tend to overthink things and be overly cautious about how I’m affecting others. All this said - when I smoke I use the backyard. I’m not worried about bothering my roomates or landlord; rather a daycare ran out a house somewhere up the block on the adjoining street. I really cant tell the distance, but I know it’s at least two yards over and two ‘up’ from ours. I often find myself getting ready to smoke, walking outside and hearing the kids playing in the yard. I’m not sure if I’m just guilt/shame/paranoia trippin’ myself or if I should really feel bad or go back inside if I hear that the kids are outside.\n\nSome more facts:  \nThe daycare isn’t listed on google maps so I don’t know exactly how far it is. The kids are always screaming, so it seems like it could be close or quite far, I’m tired of listening to hear if they’ve gone inside yet. It just messes up the flow of when I get myself excited to get home, smoke, clean up, change etc.\n\nIt’s perfectly legal to smoke on my own (rented, haha) property in the city, and this is often what folks tell me, that I shouldn’t feel bad (or even that the kids could use it /s).\n\n**AITA for smoking weed in my backyard in San Francisco if I hear daycare kids in a yard more than 3 houses away?**",

It's about 16 hours away from me but I'd have a good connection via train. I told my mom about it and all of the sudden she was like \"I won't let you go there alone, I'm your parent I have to got with you!\" while I kind of understand her problem I have a few issues with it\n\n1. She says she is required by law to not let me got alone, what is bullshit I'm sixteen and that allows me to travel alone trough whole Europe with her consent, she doesn't have to go with me just approve\n\n2. She knew I'd have to go there and I may be living there soon so I don't understand why traveling there is an issue but moving there is ok\n\n3. It would cost a lot for her to go with me, we don't really have a lot of money. If I'd go there alone it would cost 120€ what is already a lot but she would need a hotel room and it's a tourist erea (I'd stay at the apartment I may be moving in to when I get the job)\n\n4.

I feel bad regardless though.\n\nShort Story:\n\nI've had a friend for about three months and immediately in the relationship revealed that she was suicidal/depressed. Even though I only talked for three months she was from my hometown and we had acquaintances. For months I talked to her daily. Sometimes for over 6 hours, to try to help her out. I even sent her care packages. About a month in she said she wanted to date me, but I was seeing somebody and wanted to keep things platonic. She also still lived in my hometown and I was 8 hours away.\n\nThe usual supportive messages continued until things got sour. She started trying to make me feel bad for her and I got the vibe she was doing that so I'd date her. Then about a week ago she was trying to sext with me with me but I was turning down her advances. Then, she tried to guilt me into doing it and said that I was too afraid. However, I have a girlfriend that I am very happy with. She then said I wouldn't date her because she was asexual and said I was unsupportive of her sexuality. This was not true.\n\nAfter that, I tried to make amend things then she said 'Im sorry, but' and blamed me for the fight. After that, I decided to cut her out of my life.\n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE?

They used to go to church but no more, but still believe. She is strongly atheist and rejects her upbringing. She has strong views about religion. Additionally, she would often tell me that she is jealous of other people who still believe because \"it must be nice knowing that there is something waiting for you/there is a heaven to go to/etc.\"\n\nWe were talking the other day, and I said that if she were religious and it mattered to her if I were religious (but not strictly Catholic or Christian, just that I believed in something) that I would pretend to still be Jain. She said that is not right because it is important to her and that I shouldn't lie to her about that. I said that I don't care about religion only about her, and since it's not important to me I didn't think lying about it mattered. Additionally, like I said before, Jainism is more of a lifestyle than praying to god so it wouldn't really change much about me or what I do day to day.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? WIBTA if I told her I was Jain in this hypothetical situation? (Also, sorry if there are any grammar errors as English is not my first language.)",

      "description": "I moved into an apartment with an acquaintance/coworker that worked at the same location on campus and her friend. We were all university students at the time and generally very respectful of each other. The apartment was a 2bd/2ba, consisting of one master bedroom with the bathroom directly in the room, and another room with a bathroom across a corridor.\n\nI was the first to arrive at the apartment when we first moved in, and therefore had a choice of taking either the master bedroom or the other room for my single (the other two girls would share a double). I wanted to be considerate, so I took the non-master room.\n\nThe room I took had the bathroom very conveniently 3 steps across a the hall with a storage closet on one side, and the other side exposed to the living room. I realized that if I hung a little curtain over that opening, I could have an enclosed space for myself where it would be as if the bathroom was connected. I am a nudist at home and don't enjoy wearing clothes, so I thought this was a good idea. The only problem was that the storage closet would be blocked, so I pitched this idea to them: I would have the curtain up, but it'll be parted most of the time. The only time I'll drag it closed is if I need to use the restroom. This is so I don't won't have to put on clothes, walk 3 steps to the bathroom, do my business, come back, and take all my clothes off again. My door will be closed while the curtain is parted, so it'll still be convenient to access the storage closet.\n\nI jumped the gun and bought the curtain first before pitching the idea to them - after I set it up and explained my idea, my coworker's friend was upset and said that it made the living room look uglier/smaller. She said that if I wanted more privacy, I should have just taken the master bedroom in the beginning. (At this point we were all settled in so it would've been a huge hassle to switch). I considered her point, but when I first arrived at the apartment the master bedroom seemed bigger to me, and I thought it'd be nicer for 2 people to share whereas I would have the space all to myself.\n\nI try to avoid conflict if I could so I took down my curtain immediately but this has been something that bothered me for years after it happened.\n\nTL;DR I wanted to set up a curtain in my apartment for extra privacy, but my roommate said it would make the living room look smaller/uglier.\n\nAITA for wanting to do this? WIBTA if I actually did do this?",

He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision?

She falls for guys very quickly when they give her the smallest amount of attention. \n\nMy friend met this guy in her class and was pretty excited about it because it was a boy. My friends and I encouraged her to become friends with him because she was pretty upset over my boyfriends best friend rejecting her ( they had 1 date lol). When she found out he had a girlfriend (of 4 years) we encouraged her to stay friends with him because it would teach her to be cool with guy friends instead of falling inlove with them everytime. \n\nWe noticed he started staying over til 2am everyday so we confronted her about it. We asked her if his girlfriend knew where he was and who he was with. She said she couldnt control her feelings for him and that it's none of her business what he tells his girlfriend. She got defensive so we dropped it. a few days later she confessed her feelings to him and he said he felt the same way but they had to be friends for now. He continues to stay late at night. He says he can't break up with his girlfriend yet because he doesn't want to be homeless. She says that she wouldn't let anything physical happen between the two but she tries to convince him to break up with his girlfriend every time he is over which I think is just as bad.. \n\nMy friends and I have slowly distanced ourselves from her because she never stops talking about him and she is pretty much helping him cheat. I know it really isn't any of my business but I can't help but feel disgusted by her actions. I can only think about how his girlfriend must feel. ",

I told him I could get in the mood if I had some time to “come down” from the movie, but he got really upset with me and we got in a fight instead of having sex.

      "description": "I keep my computer, on which I play video games, in my bedroom. When playing games, I will sometimes talk to my friends over Discord, and some nights I will talk to my girlfriend. On weeknights I always make sure to hang up by 8:30 pm, because I need to get to bed for work in the morning. On Friday and Saturday nights sometimes I'm up till about midnight, but when it's later I try to keep myself to a whisper. Nevertheless I will often fail, especially when a particularly good joke is made (my laugh is quite loud).\n\nMy sister, whose bedroom is next to mine, has in the past made complaints about the noise I make keeping her up, often using the term \"paper-thin walls.\" She has only asked me to stop playing games with my friends and girlfriend, offering no solutions that compromise. I don't think it's fair to ask that of me, since not being allowed to interact with the people I care about would leave me miserable (some of my friends and my gf, still in college, are only available at nighttime).\n\nThis morning, I was complaining to my dad that I seem to wake up at exactly 4:45 am very often. It feels like a natural wake-up, but waking up at that time leaves me groggy and tired all day long, so it's annoying. My sister, who overheard, interjected that she has an alarm at 4:45 some mornings, which could explain my problem. On its own - not a rude thing to say, just a chance for us to resolve the issue. But the tone she used was very smug, like she was proud of waking me up, and she followed with \"well, you keep me up playing games all the time, so fair's fair.\" Then she walked away, leaving my request to try and work towards a solution hanging, ignored, in the air.\n\nI'm thinking about just moving my computer to the basement, assuming I can find the space somewhere. It would be a fair bit of work to move my entire computer setup, and I would have to clean out the basement and find a way to access both power and Ethernet in the same place down there (more difficult than it sounds). When I talked about it with my dad, he seemed worried that I might get too cold if I went to the basement.\n\nBut in the end, I would get to play, and she would hopefully not have to hear me anymore. AITA if I don't move? If I do choose to move, is it reasonable to expect her to work with me on the issue of her alarm waking me up?\n\n(Please feel free to ask for INFO if you need more - I wrote a lot more than what's in this post.)",

      "description": "Me and my boyfriend are financially tied in more than one ways for years now, I basically own his business, he owns the house where we live in.\nHe hesitates to make things more serious between us, you know, actually get married &amp; and have kids. I still owned a dusty very tiny apartment on the other side of town, where I officially reside, but never go to, and have troubles letting go, because basically, I don’t feel like his place is my place, although I helped decorating and some of the furniture is mine as well.\nOnce upon a time I had troubles with commitment, didn’t want to get married, and kids were far from my mind as can be - I guess at that time we were perfect for each other - but for the last couple of years I’m over 30 and I realize I really want that. He doesn’t want that, and was always straight that he never did. His priorities are on his career and our business success, which is going quite well, actually. I think because I officially own the company, so he doesn’t want to end this, he will tolerate me more?...\nIn any case, not so long ago I was sad &amp; very drunk &amp; I slept with a random guy.\nI am always honest with my partner, so I come clean and told him this was the most stupid mistake. I asked how will he ever trust me again, etc. he said he trusts me even more for coming clean, as he would have never found it out, and that he had been emotionally unavailable for a really long time. He saw it somehow as his fault as well, and said we will change this, but still doesn’t want to get married, the family, etc. not because of cheating, but because he doesn’t think it’s right time due to the fact he has to concentrate on business. He justifies that for having kids he needs time, which he currently doesn’t have. He also justifies he’s not sure at all about having kids.\nNevertheless, after cheating, I feel like actually, life doesn’t need to be like this, we’re financially stable enough, so I broke up with him anyway and I’m looking for something else.\nOn the other side, he didn’t take the cheating so seriously, at least in front of me, but was very upset about breaking up.",

      "description": "I really feel like such a little spoilt asshole. My mom has a room. My younger sister has a room. I have a room, but my dad doesn't. He sleeps in the living room, on a sofa-bed. He's been doing it for years and I'm not sure how it began, I think my mom and dad were fighting and my mom doesn't want to share a room with him. He's expressed occasionally that he doesn't like sleeping in the living room and that none of his friends have this kind of living situation. But mostly he seems to suck it up. He's a doctor and scientist and the one who supports the family, so it's unfair that he gets the short end of the stick. \n\nThe reason I feel like an asshole is because I'm almost 20 now and I should be thinking about moving out so he can get my room but I honestly am not prepared to do that. I can't afford it and I'm too scared to. I know I'll feel really alone without my family close. My sister cheers me up so much. I don't want to live alone and be sad, I'm really scared of it. My dad told me recently that I should move out, I'm not sure he entirely meant it because it was during an argument but still...\n\nIf I moved out it'd be so much easier to starve myself, cut all the time without my parents seeing, drink, and have random sex with men who hurt me. Living at home prohibits me from all of that. \n\nI'm honestly not sure if this post fits here but the primary thing is I feel really bad over this situation, and I'm wondering if I have responsibility in this or if it's \"out of my hands\"? \n\n",

      "description": "A coworker bought me a drink the first day I was at the job.  Voluntarily, I'd like to stress that point.  It was $4.  This was, admittedly, a few months ago.  Since then, I have kept forgetting to pay him back, but doing the occasional thing for him, like buying him a soda and the like.\n\nI moved offices from my base location (with coworker) into a separate office.  Still within the department, but a solid 10 min drive away.  Yesterday was the last day I was to be in what was previously my home office.  I was left a sticky note and got a message saying \"Hey, pay me that $3.\"\n\nI woke up late due to an alarm malfunction, I was over an hour late to work, I was bouncing between three projects, including one I didn't even have the paperwork for (since it got moved into the next office already), and I was packing my desk.  In the shuffle, I forgot.\n\nToday, I get a passive aggressive email stating that he \\*NEEDS\\* that three dollars from me.  That it's \"silly\" that he has to \"resort to emailing\" me.  I replied with what I said here.  It got lost in the shuffle, I'm sorry, etc.  I also stated (rightfully) that my phone bill pulls today and only have $8 in my bank account until Friday, when I'll pay him.\n\nHis reply, in a petulant child manner, is to state that there's an ATM right outside (not my bank branch, so fees asshat), that I need to get him the money ASAP (I literally told you I have $8 til Friday when I WILL PAY YOU), he'll never loan money to me again (I never asked in the first place dickhead) and that he hopes no one else will too (super professional, way to be a winner).  I can guarantee, considering this coworker's nature (a well-off 22 year old white male who just got married and has his own house) he is shit-talking me to the entire old office.\n\nSo, Reddit.  AITA for not paying back $3?",

Took the box and did my thing. After he finished up he came towards me while talking quickly and unintelligibly. I asked him if he was using the box. He then told me in an aggresive tone never to put his stuff on the floor and next time I ask him to take them. I apologized and tried saying I didnt want to disturb him in the middle of the exercise but he just interrupted me. He didnt check his hoodie pockets when he got it so I doubt there was something of importance in there that he was afraid of losing. Afterwards I thought to myself that he got angry for something insignificant and that he should use the lockers that are 15 feet away and not the gym equipment. So tell me reddit, AITA or NTA?",

I didn't think much of it because my buddy had to stop a friend off with my car. So I let it sit for about 15 minutes and I notice 2 women grabbing things from the truck.\n\nI was going to going to have some people over and needed to get some ammenities so I took my motorcycle to the grocery store. When I went down to get my bike I saw the people with the truck, an older woman and middle aged woman.\n\n\"Excuse me,  could you move the truck please, I have to get out\"\n\nOld woman just stares at me without saying anything. \n\nI give a look like why are you staring at me? \"Excuse me i feel like you're juat,staring at me, (look at the other woman) I don't feel like I'm asking much\" I walk away to get on my bike and go since I can barely squeeze out\n\nMiddle aged woman \"What just for your bike? You can get around\"\n\nMe \"I'm just asking you to move your truck, my friend will be back in 20 minutes with my car and I want it in my garage.\"\n\nMiddle aged woman \"we just got done driving 2000 miles and we are moving in, I've lived here for 19 years, are you a resident?\"\n\nI rent my place, have lived there for 4 years,  I don't answer het ridiculous question and she was raising her voice at me anyway so I just said, \"I feel like your making a real big deal out of this.\" Walk to my bike while she says I'm the one making a big deal out of it. I stopped listening if she said anything after that.  When I get back, 20 minutes later, not 5 minutes pass and my biddy gets back with my car.  They moved the truck while I was arriving back so another 20 minutes after I asked then to move the truck. \n\nThis morning I hear her talking to my friend saying I was rude and all this shit. I'm quite upset about how this woman talked to me and now about me. \n\nSo, AITA for asking these people to move from in front of my driveway?  Hell, it's my driveway, I pay for my stay. In my opinion she can suck a fat one and I feel I derseve an apology, which I know I'll never get. ",

      "description": "So, my sister has 3 kids. She's in her early 30s and I'm only 20 btw so there is an age gap, I'm getting my life figured out and she... well has 3 kids. Due to being bipolar, depressed, anxiety and shit I have neglected my relationship with her at times (with all family at times as well) and now that I'm pulling my life together I am trying to be more involved with family, because I love and care for them and I'm really thankful for their support with my mental health struggles. My sister has really been a big help for me at times, when I had no one else I can count on her and been able to go to her house and hang out and with my nephews. Lately, I have not been hanging out with her, which I've recently noticed and I'm trying to make steps to fix. I posted on r/relationships about this, how I want to improve my relationship with her. The problem is, my sister does not plan well (according to my mom she never has, IDK) and I know that she is really busy. For example, a few weeks ago I called and asked my sister what her and the kids were doing Saturday, and if it was an option I could maybe join them. She said they were doing a community clean up with the city/boyscouts, and then a hike and then a movie in the park. I said I would go on the hike with them and then the movie, if she didn't mind. She said sure and said she would get back to me on the times then never did, so I didn't go. Then, on Sunday she calls me \"Hey, we are about to be at the house in 2 minutes to pick up something and go to the park, do you want to go?\" I said no because, I really don't like last minute things like that at all, anxiety wise. I like to be able to have some planning on when something will be, even if it's a day or two, it helps a lot. The problem is, I can't ever seem to plan something out with my sister, and it's all last minute things which I 9/10 times say no too, due to anxiety. Anyway, in r/relationships I got told by a couple of people that basically I'm being unreasonable and entitled basically, because she had 3 kids and is busy and I cant expect me to get preferred treatment.OK, I get it she is really busy, while I am not. I am 100% focused on bettering my mental health, so maybe I'm lacking perspective here. Am I an asshole for expecting my sister to be able to work with me on times to hang out, and not just last minute \"hey Im in town right now\" scenarios? Keep in mind, I am fine going out and doing her already planned activities with her and the boys as well, not asking her to cancel plans or work my in her schedule.   \n\n\nAlso, my sister is NTA, i posted on relationships to try and figure out how to talk with this about her and absolve this issue, because she's not doing it on purpose- I just got told I was wrong for expecting this for her. So AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

However, you need to put in the time to do things like pay off debts, to travel, and to have nice things.   \n\n\nShe currently lives with her parents but they are looking to move and she will be left stuck here with little options.  I am wary of letting her move in because she is not financially independent.  I dont think it is fair to the relationship to put that stress on it.  Say we dont work out then her moving out means living on the streets.  That is incentive for her to stay in an unhappy relationship and also puts me in a bind if i realize this relationship is not going to work out.  We have been dating for a handful of months.  Am I the asshole for not letting my girlfriend move in?? ",

      "description": "So, I know most of the stories on here are way more serious than this but here’s something to lighten it up I guess. \nSo me and my friends have all been enjoying Super Smash Bros Ultimate (like any sane human). However, I’ve found myself becoming resentful towards my friend group. I wouldn’t consider myself an amazing player or anything, but I am definitely better than my friends who play. In a 1v1 scenario, I can usually win with most characters.  This doesn’t mean that they never beat me or anything, but I am just slightly above their skill level. The problem is that when I play with them, they always seem to team up on me. They will occasionally fight each other, but usually the battle goes like this.\n1) They shoot projectiles at each other for 30 seconds and get one or two hits.\n2) I hop in to try to actually fight them and not just fire off a projectile every five seconds.\n3) They both spring into action and hit me up close as much as they can until I rack up damage and die. \nThis is basically a rinse and repeat for every battle, every character. I don’t find it fun at all to sit on opposite sides of the stage and shoot at each other hoping you get a hit in for 10 minutes. I feel like they aren’t even playing the game, at least not the way it’s meant to. For this reason, I play with my friends less and less, and it doesn’t seem like they care anyways. This both makes me resentful and it hurts me because I don’t have many friends and I feel rejected by my group. So, AITA for feeing this way?",

      "description": "A bit of context here, I sit next to this friend of mine at Uni. He is by no means a horrible person, he's actually pretty good. Its just this one thing he frequently does that irks me which is his desire to compare grades. For example, whenever we get back our results for stuff such as quizzes or marked homework, he'll ask questions like 'What did you get?\" or \"What did you score on this?\". I'll usually tell him that I don't like to compare results regardless of whether I did well or not. However, he would normally persist and say stuff like \"Cmon dude, no one's gonna judge you\" or \"Its just a score, just tell me dude\". Prior to today, I would sheepishly smile and say no thanks and get on with my day. However, I was in a particularly bad mood today. When he persisted with the 'Cmon let me see your grade' I retorted by telling him to fuck off. He was shocked at my reply and didn't talk to me for the rest of the class. I also got a few dirty looks from my classmates who are similar to him in which they also like to compare each other's results. Now I really hate the mentality of dick measuring in general, whether it be grades, gym or trivial stuff. But I feel like I took it a bit too far today. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": " \n\nOkay so to provide some backstory when I was in 6th grade I didn't have any friends in my grade. It was a very small school and I was one of the \"weird\" kids. You know the drill. I ended up befriending this one guy who we'll just call Liam.\n\nHe also didn't have any friends and was sometimes bullied by the guys in our class. We sat together at lunch all the time and mostly talked about Youtube channels and Tv shows we liked since we liked a lot of the same stuff.\n\nLater on, in 7th grade I accidentally came out to an upperclassman, telling her that I was a lesbian since she thought Liam and I were dating. It quickly spread around the school (remember, it was very small) but it turned out for the better since no one seemed to care too much (not out loud anyway).\n\nBy this point, in 8th grade, I had a few new friends and I didn't hang out with Liam too much. He also started doing little things that kind of irked me the wrong way. He talked to me about the same shows and channels we used to talk about, but I didn't have the heart to tell him I wasn't interested in them anymore. He also did slightly homophobic things, like say that no one would take a gay romance movie seriously because everyone would be laughing at it so much, and refer to me as his \"token gay friend\". I know he was joking for that second one but it kind of hurt. My new friends also thought he was really annoying, and would designate certain days as \"girls only\" days where we could be alone. I felt bad for him since he didn't have any real other friends, and I thought it would get better in high school.\n\nIt didn't. Liam latched onto the first girl who liked the same anime as him and started hanging out with her and her friend group. This also happens to be the friend group I came into in high school too. Despite hanging out at the same lunch table every day, we never talked. Eventually he stopped eating with us since one of the girls got really fed up with him, and threatened to beat him up if he ever came back (and believe me, she could).\n\nThen two very important things came up. One is that he came out for me to my brother. Liam sits next to him in a class we had together. The thing is about my brother and I is that we look very different and have different last names, so people don't know we're related unless they're told. The subject of some gay shit came up in class and he turned to my brother, pointed at me, and said \"did you know that she's a lesbian?\". This absolutely enraged me since I found out that he was willing to tell *my* secret to what he thought was a complete stranger. I then stopped willingly talking to him.\n\nThe other was that a while later I found out Liam had a crush on me from one of our former classmates. I had always suspected it, but this made me feel even more guilty about leaving him than I already did. We've only talked awkwardly and sparsely since, mainly him asking questions and me not looking at him back and giving only the most basic of answers. (childish, I know)\n\nThis was all about a year ago. Around a month ago, I added a girl on snapchat and the next day Liam started talking to me while I was getting stuff from my locker. He said he noticed I had added her (which I'm not sure if you can even do? I'm not very well-versed in snapchat) and he thought that since we had a mutual friend we could start hanging out again. I told him flat out that I've drifted apart from him and we didn't have many of the same interests anymore. I don't remember the exact details of the conversation, but I remember him getting mad and saying we're still not that different, and me walking off with my headphones.\n\nI still feel really guilty whenever I pass him in the hallway. I feel I could've done some things better, but am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This happened only a few minutes ago from when I posted this... Only two people I will be describing in this are me and him. Should be clear enough who's who.\n\nSo - I have this friend, a rather close friend. At least how I see it, I have no idea if he feels the same although he said he has. Has been continually depressed for a good long while now. He has a propensity to be ill-tempered towards certain things and, as I see it, overreactive at points, he deals with this by leaving group chats and sometimes unfriending those involved. Then coming back later.\n\nHe had decided to share a song with a group I'm in the night before, some sort of deep sounding song or whatever. Fine by me. Nothing wrong with sharing anything. He asks me if it reminds me of Minecraft music, which I said yes to because it did, and that was that.\n\nNow, the next night, this night, he posts it twice. and the second time he did I called it lame. We have a running joke in our group where we're petty as possible and he's well in on it too but sometimes gets irate at it? I'll never figure out why, if he does it all the time himself. Including calling stuff the other likes in the group lame for no good reason and coming up with a ridiculous reason for it, an example would be \"well my state is better than yours because we have a potted plant at 34°13'42.5\"N 77°56'59.2\"W\".\n\nWhen he posted it this time he called it something along the lines of \"being pretty deep\" and jokingly said \"i'm not crying you're crying\". I respond to this with \"lame\".\n\n...then he says \"oh fuck off\" and leaves all the group chats we're in and goes offline. My  reaction to this is \"*really?*\". And honestly, that's how I feel about it. I'm not in the mood to deal with drama or other people's feelings over something *this* minuscule. It's a song, I jokingly called it lame, please get over it. You know I'm not serious, you do stuff like this all the time as well. And if you were genuinely feeling something over it, you'd think that maybe conveying that you did would have evoked a different response...? But he was all lighthearted about it. Don't fail to convey your actual feelings and then get angry at someone for reacting in a way that would be detrimental to them. You're joking around so I responded jokingly. I know you are facing difficulties with emotional stress but I am as well. I'll say it again, if you want to be serious about them don't hide them and joke when you're trying to cope then get angry at me when I respond in a similar way. There's literally no way I could have known how he felt in this circumstance.\n\nI do not react or reach out to him this time like I usually do, I let him leave and I don't intend on speaking to him until he returns. I'm not going to expend my energy on someone getting assblasted over me calling a song lame. It was completely uncalled for and a massive overreaction.\n\nSo, concluding here, am I an ass for calling his song lame?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm gonna come right out and say that I'm a pretty socially inept dork, so forgive me if the answer here (as in what I *should* have done) is blatantly obvious. \n\nThe situation is pretty straightforward: I was walking home from a late night at work when I saw someone up ahead staggering drunkenly, and then actually sort of tip over onto the wall next to the sidewalk. I jogged up ahead and asked them - a lady - if they were OK. She was very intoxicated and slurring her words but said she was fine. First I tried to see if there was someone she wanted to call, but I guess she wasn't capable of articulating who that was (I asked her if I could see her phone but she wasn't into it). I then asked her if her apartment was nearby and if she needed help getting there. She said yes, and sort of leaned into me and I helped her walk about a block to an apartment building. I unlocked the door for her and asked her if she needed help getting up the stairs, and again she said yes. Finally we get to her place, where I then unlock the door for her and then help her to her couch. I'm trying to get out of there as quickly as possible but immediately (what I assume is) her roommate comes out, looking pretty alarmed. I explain what went down. Roomie is incredibly brusque with me - to the point where it seems like she's about to call the cops - and then tells me to get out. I don't need her to tell me twice. \n\nObviously a weird situation, and I get the negative reaction to a strange man in your apartment... but, am I supposed to feel *bad* about what happened? Obviously her reaction makes me feel like an asshole, but I don't know if that's right. Basically what I'm saying is if it all went down again, I'd probably do the same thing. But I am fully prepared to be told what a boneheaded and potentially wrong thing that is to do. AITA? ",

      "description": "This is my first time posting...I have a friend that send out messages on her husbands birthday event page that he would like for his birthday even uploads pictures...when its her birthday she suddenly wants to go out to lunch and dinner with everyone... not all at once either....so she can get a free meal in my opinion.  I recently had my first birthday party ever at a friend's seafood restaurant.   She ordered 3 appetizers for the table. I never asked her to.  By this time I was more than half intoxicated and when she got the bill for her and her husband and the appetizers she had this look on her face like she couldnt pay and i didn't want to make a scene in front of everyone nor embarrass anyone..so i paid for my dinner and her and her husband's dinner which was $140. I had no problem whatsoever paying for my dinner and paid for 95% of the birthday decorations and cake. She paid for some we bought at a dollar store which I argued with her about but she wouldn't let me pay.  I hate confrontation so I never said anything.  I regret it now and am so tired of the shit I put up with just to have her as a friend. She was there for me a lot when my sister and her wife died but i feel like she holds it against me and takes advantage of me. I feel like she has a narcissistic personality.  I'm considering not going to his birthday party and slowly getting her out of my life. Am I wrong for feeling this way?",

      "title": "AITA for not being okay with my fiancé’s brother staying for the weekend?",
      "description": "Hello everyone, I just wanted to get some outside opinions on something that happened a few weeks ago. \n\nMy fiancé and I have been together for about 3 1/2 years, lived together for a little over a year, and he is a gem. His brother however, not so much. He is frequently racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally rude. He can’t handle being called out on any of this behavior, and it often results in tears  or agitation if I try. \n\nMy fiancé knows how I feel about his brother, and feels the same way about a lot of it, but feels like I should be able to just put up with it as he is family. He also says that when we are married, he will take my side in any arguments that arise, but for now, he is staying neutral. This culminated a few weeks ago as my fiancé let his brother stay with us for a weekend. \n\nIt is important to note that the weekend he stayed is the weekend of a music festival we go to every year in our city, and he has stayed with my fiancé in the past every year. I have as well, so I have put up with him over this weekend in the past few years. Two of the years, it has coincided with my birthday, and this year was one of those years. \n\nI told my fiancé for months leading up to this that I was very nervous about it, and he insisted that he was family and he would not ask him to stay elsewhere. When the weekend came around, his brother was his usual self (using gay slurs and ignoring/talking over us, me in particular as I am a woman and he does not like women, being generally racist and sexist) as well as being a terrible houseguest. For example, leaving pubes in our bathtub and sleeping on our bare couch in his underwear after refusing to put down a sheet that we provided, as well as not letting us use our own couch throughout the day as he would not stop laying on it. \n\nI have very bad anxiety, and having this type of stress in my home, which is typically my safe space to escape from everything, was making things very difficult for me. I had a few crying meltdowns in the privacy of our bedroom, and wasn’t able to eat towards the end of the weekend as I was so anxious. On the last day, my fiancé asked me what was wrong, and I told him his brother was making me anxious, and that even though he didn’t want to choose sides between us, he absolutely had that weekend, and it wasn’t mine. He then got very angry, told his brother his presence was making me anxious, and his brother got upset and left in tears.\n\nMy fiancé was very angry at me, as he thought I should have been able to suck it up, and that I ruined the weekend and music festival for them, and was upset he had to say that to his brother, even though I did not ask him to, in fact asked him to do the opposite. He has said he won’t let his brother stay with us in the future because of this. \n\nAITA for not being able to handle being around my fiancé’s brother for the weekend, and upsetting him and his brother?

      "description": "Me [m16] and my gf [f16] dated for about 7 months. I had knew it would end soon but honestly did not know how to do it. One day I got a call from her crying saying her friend. It was big news around us too. I tried to be supportive of her but about a week after we got into a big fight. I had pictures of girls in bikinis and stuff on my phone and she got upset over this, I tried to defend this as not being cheating but she insisted it was. I understood why that had hurt her, and she told me she wanted to ‘take a break’. I was okay with us taking a break because like I said I was just trying to get the gumption to break it off. \n\nSo, a few days into us not really talking, she’s at a service for her friend (that I was going to go to) she calls me crying and is asking for support and stuff. I try to talk her through this, but she starts asking me if I still love her and if I want to be with her and says don’t give up on us and stuff. I really really don’t know what to do about this, but ultimately I think I said I love her and will be there for her but I “want some space right now” in terms of our relationship. Needless to say we never really talked again except for her texting and asking why I broke up with her and me answering like a week later and explaining I lost feelings. A few weeks later, She goes on twitter and says something along the lines of “imagine leaving someone at the worst time in their life”\n\nSo... am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Me and my mom live together and my uncle moved in with us around 6 months ago. I was very against it since he is a major asshole. To keep things short he is a leech and we had lived with him before. He left last time owing us money, talking smack about my mom, and never lifted a finger to help with anything. This past 6 months have been that all over again. We are moving in the next few days and he still has no where to go, he is expecting us to just let him back in with but my mom has already said \"we don't have any room for anyone besides me the dog and -myname- in the new apartment. Since we are downsizing big time because we can't afford our current home (and no he isn't helping at all). He said he was going to move out 3 months ago when my mom tried increasing his rent by $100 (its only 300 with no bills and he gets his own room/free food) but he never moved out and continued paying the $300. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe where already doing him a favor, he eats all our food, doesn't clean anything, pisses off the neighbors and is super nosy. He is always snooping on us and trying to hear us across the hall or doors. I can't stand him and I refuse to live with him. If there is one silver lining to having to move is getting rid of him. So even if he ends up homeless im pretty much putting my foot down and refusing him to continue to mooch of us when we move. I won't even let him park his car outside our new driveway and sleep there because thats how he has wormed his way back in to our home in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a teen I had to put up with it because I wasn't contributing with he bills but now I'm pretty much going to be in charge of them and I'm not going to waste my money on him like my mother has. He is currently trying to get us to feel sorry for him and is trying to snoop on our conversations to see how he can force his way back in with us but I'm going to shoot him down hard. I don't think I have ever disliked another person as much as I dislike him because of how he takes advantage of my parents and their (we can't let down family mentality). Am I being heartless here and AITA for not caring where he ends up as long as it's not with us? ",

      "description": "Will try to make a long explanation short. I’m a generally sarcastic, joker who has always ribbed people, as was done to me by my own family. That’s just how we all were, and you learned that it was all in good fun, and to not take it personally.\n\nAs I got older, I would say this trait subsided a bit, especially as I dated because I was shy around new people. However, as I become more and more comfortable, I slipped back into my normal personality - which included these jokes.\n\nBeing a year into marriage, and knowing my husband for a few prior, I thought he was used to it - and he really hadn’t shown a problem with it. But now, he’s telling me that it’s too much, that I’m rude, a bitch at times. I don’t recall saying anything particularly mean, although I would never say I don’t toe the line at times. It seems to be becoming more of a problem though, one that could seriously hurt our relationship.\n\nThe other issue, is that it’s apparently impacting his confidence. He says he’s not confident in his body, that his once extroverted personality has become introverted, and other similar things. I never would intentionally do this and I want to resolve it - but I honestly don’t understand what I’m doing that could have such a huge effect. I want to cry at times knowing that I’m such a horrible person to make him feel this way, and for something I don’t truly understand. It’s just a part of me, a huge part that feels to be me at my most comfortable level. \n\nNow, I’m not ignorant to the fact that jokes get old, and sometimes they can be taken too far, or said harshly. I myself had these moments growing up, taking shit from my own family, so I do see that it can be a lot. My question is, AmItheAsshole for continuing to make these jokes that are such a big part of my personality? Should I cut this area of my personality out altogether? Or is my husband overreacting, and just making me feel bad? Is there a middle ground, and if so, how can I achieve it? TIA",

      "description": "I'm 20 and I've been going to meet with friends at a furry meet in London for several months, my parents are very scared for my safety all the time, despite the meets being a really safe place, they call me constantly to make sure I'm getting the correct trains and I'm not going to be late and I won't forget things (it's all unnecessary and I've told them that multiple times, I end up ignoring half of their calls because I'm just trying to have fun). I'm high functioning autistic so they are very overprotective of me, I can see that it's all out of love but it's just too much, I've made that clear to them too.\n\nI drive myself to the train station and back so my parents don't have to actually do anything at all, they just are always \"really worried and can't sleep without knowing I'm safe\" despite me coming back at 2am last time and them all being completely asleep.\n\nSome of my friends are really hot, a few have made it very clear that they want to hook up with me too. I've not stayed around someone's house in years. I really want to do that so my plan is to:\n\nGo as normal, pack some extra clothes in my bag  (I have a big bag anyway to fit in a tail)\n\nWhile I'm there to send them a text saying that I'm staying with someone overnight.\n\nWhen they inevitably call stand my ground, there's nothing that they can do anyway.\n\nSend them texts so they know where I am a few times. \n\nThen go home the next day and deal with whatever fallout there is.\n\nDoes that sound reasonable?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my roommates to move out because I do not want to live with pets?",
      "description": "Back in July I found a rental house that I eventually moved into.  I really want this house to be my last rental before purchasing in a few years, so I was kind of picky as to where I was moving. I have also furnished a majority of the house including the entire living room (sofa, tv stand, coffee tables, etc) with GOOD quality stuff (not like college dorm furniture) that I have saved up for. After I moved in alone I posted an ad on craigslist looking for roommates to occupy the two rooms. I made it very very very clear that I did not want to live with pets of any kind in the house. I actually DO like dogs, but I do not like living with them. I honestly hate the smell, the hair getting into everything, etc.\n\nI found two roommates (roommate 1 and roommate 2) who do not have pets. Roommate 1 has a girlfriend, and she does indeed have a dog. This is fine, as my first impression was that the dog would not be living with us full time. After a couple of weeks roommate 1 asks if the dog is allowed to \"come over\", which to me I took as \"can the dog come to the house with my girlfriend right now\". The dog started coming over more and more frequently, spending the night when the girlfriend spends the night, and basically living at the house full time. I have not been happy about this, and I've expressed that to roommate 1 multiple times but the dog is still over 3-5 nights a week and has been for the last 8 or so months. I realized I am fighting a losing battle, and to keep the peace between the three of us I have not really brought it up.  Keep in mind we have NOT paid a pet deposit, nor do I want to contribute to one.\n\nA few weeks ago Roommate 2 moves out due to a job relocation. We posted another ad on craigslist, and find Roommate 3. Roommate 3 is a pretty cool dude, and we all gel well so we have him take over the lease for Roommate 2. Well, come to find out he has a dog that he wants to bring over to the house too. Roommate 1 is all for this as obviously he has a dog, where I am very very hesitant. I told roommate 3 that I really don't want pets in the house, but roommate 1 had already told him the dog would be fine. So the dog comes over, it's a pit bull mix, and checks every box of what I do NOT want to live with. Immediately jumps all over the sofas, starts running around on the carpet and ripping it up with his claws, starts barking, etc. He is aggressive too, and as I was walking upstairs last night jumped up and nipped at my hand for no reason. Roommate 1 and his girlfriend love the dog, love that their dog gets along with it, and were really happy that roommate 3 brought the dog with him. I am absolutely LIVID that this is happening. It's everything I did NOT want to live with but now I am the odd man out here.\n\nI am basically considering asking roommate 1 and roommate 3 to find another option at the end of the month if this keeps up. I know that bringing this up is going to upset them, and they really are good roommates otherwise.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "We had 60 MPH winds yesterday in Delaware and as I was leaving for work in the morning almost all the trash and recycling cans were fallen including my own.  I looked in my immediate vicinity for trash but saw none so I went to work.  I assumed just some of my recycling with my address is floating around somewhere.  \n\nMy neighbor down the street is a classic Karen.  My wife hates her because years ago she cursed out my wife when she was walking a dog we were dog sitting.  \"How would you like it if I went and took a shit on your lawn!?\"  My wife said the dog wasn't even doing anything but just walking by.  \n\nYesterday night before I got home from work my brother calls me and says my neighbor went to our house and started yelling at him about the trash.  She's really mad and says \"You better go to my house and pick up ALL the trash, cause I'm not picking it up or I'm calling the cops\".  \n\nWell she comes to my house at 7 am this morning and starts ringing the doorbell and banging on the door multiple times.  I'm pissed since I have two small babies and shes banging really hard and don't answer the door.  I plan to just ignore her.  My mother-in-law twice went outside yesterday to pick up trash around our house that's probably not ours while I was at work.  The neighborhood has random litter from everyone not just my own and everyone is doing their part cleaning up after the high winds.  My plan is just to ghost her and if she calls the cops I would consider ONLY picking up trash with my name on it although I would be surprised if the police care enough to get involved.

      "description": "So not necessarily much back story - just that this was a one year intensive course for university where if you wanted to progress further, you needed a minimum score across subjects and yada yada. Naturally this makes me pretty intensive with all my individual work to be expectedly up to my own standard and such. I write up all my own notes and am generally secluded when it comes to working and submitting assessments. \nThen comes the finale of the year and summation of all the coursework, where I’m feeling obviously burnt out and actually really proud of the results. So then comes “friend” which can hardly be considered friends, as we only met at the start of this year and everyone will be splitting off into different pathways. He’s been obviously known to be a slacker in terms of his academics and has previously borrowed copies of other people’s assessment. Everyone obviously talks about how irked they are due the legality and such, but (f) was incessant with how bad of friends we would be if we don’t support him to get the proper grades and such. \nAITA for making a remark that he basically used me all semester because he’d known that I’m much more lenient to offer help than others. But while I’ve made it clear that I’d offer guidance in helping rather than straight up giving my work, he says I’m a bad friend and other stuff and then leaves the group \n",

      "description": "Around 4 years ago I deleted a bunch of friends off of Facebook without explanation. This lasted for around a month before I slowly started re-adding people and reintegrating into my old friend group. Recently, a friend of ours did the same thing and was treated significantly differently. Am I the asshole if I bring this up nearly four years later? More context below. I apologize in advance if it's a bit rambly, I'm not sure how to order this.\n\n**THE BACKGROUND - The sad times :(**\n\nI've been dealing with feelings of depression for most of my life, for anyone feeling vulnerable or depressed please be aware that this post might not be for you. Mostly my depression was due to being unhappy with my circumstances in life, but also largely because my brain's an asshole and keeps trying to kill me. \n\nFour years ago where this fun little story begins, my tightest knit group of friends was a gaming group. We all lived in different cities a few hours away from each other, but we'd meet up every couple of months to go camping or go on mini-trips. I'd known everyone in the group for a couple years at least by the time all this stuff went down. I was not 100% open about feeling depressed at this point, because HEY GUESS WHAT, baring your soul is really difficult. The group was aware that I was generally 'unhappy', though. \n\nI was closest with two people in particular, one we'll call FishFan420 and the other we'll call The Noodle Gimp. These aren't their real names or usernames, but I kind of wish they were. The Noodle Gimp was a lady streamer on twitch who regularly pulled about 7 viewers a night, and we often would game together just the two of us. We grew really close to the point where she started throwing the word best friend around. FishFan420 was my brother's roommate and we're extremely close now (after all this shenanigans).\n\nAnyway, things were generally good until one day I grew sick of living and decided I should just go off and take my own life, wrote a lovely ole note and everything. I wanted to just kind of *fade away* so I deleted basically everyone except for family off of Facebook and went no contact. Didn't end up doing it (Yay!), but it was a very close thing. There's a real treacherous road near my house that runs along the side of a canyon. Plan was to just drive off real fast without a seatbelt. I remember one night sitting there in my car by the side of the road just sobbing like a gigantic manchild trying to work up the nerve to do it. Shit was real bad guys. \n\n**THE INCIDENT - In which LowerNotice has his feelings hurt**\n\nAnyway, about two weeks into my self-imposed isolation, I posted something on Twitter. I don't remember what it was, but it was something to the effect of \"shit sucks life is pain and linkin park's lyrics finally make sense to me\". A few hours later a rando we'd all played with before sends me a message and tells me to check out The Noodle Gimp's stream. I tune in and she's reading my tweet out on stream and laughing about it, and calls me Mr. Dramatic. I remember that FishFan420 was there on Skype with them, but I don't remember anything else that was said. I deleted the tweet and went to bed. Looking back, I really wish I hadn't so I could recall see what I wrote. \n\n**THE CALLOUTS/THE AFTERMATH - In which adults do not properly communicate their emotions and we bury things for later**\n\nI took some time to process what happened, and a few days later I asked The Noodle Gimp to talk. I told her what had been going on and why I'd been absent (tried to neck myself yo), and that I'd heard what happened on her stream. She said sorry, and then started talking about how no one knew what was going on with me and they were confused/worried. As far as apologies go, it kind of blew chunks. \n\nI reached back out to FishFan420 at this point too, but I honestly don't remember that conversation that well. I don't remember if I talked to him about the tweet too, or told him about my depression, or really anything. I do remember he told me that they didn't know what was going on but they missed me.\n\nI spent a few more weeks not talking to anybody, and then I just started showing up for games and stuff again. Over time, I slowly made positive changes in my life and I'm in a significantly better place now than I was then. Eventually, our friend group found its new normal and I put what happened behind me.\n\n**PRESENT DAY - The largely happy times but currently (and hopefully temporarily) unhappy times**\n\nYeah boys there's a present day. I bet you forgot by now ya lil scamps, last time I mentioned it was like five hundred words ago. Anyway, these days FishFan420 and I are really tight and generally get along great. I still talk to The Noodle Gimp and we hang out from time to time, mainly just hiking or having fires and just doing fun shit without any crazy emotional engagement. I was pretty cool with things, and I'm so far removed from the person I was four years ago that it can sometimes be hard to remember details from my old life. Things are mostly good. \n\nBut then, BLAM, a third player joins the arena. Tim Tiny Toes (we call him TTT for short) is a friend I met through FishFan420. He recently pulled the same move I did and blocked everyone in our social circle on Facebook. I believe this was largely due to his recent breakup with his ex (whom I've never met), and some drama that went down at my brother's wedding a month ago. Basically, he didn't know she was invited and he wasn't happy about it, and he left immediately after the ceremony when his groomsmen duties were over.\n\nFishFan420 let me know that he'd blocked a bunch of people on Facebook, so I checked and... *bummmerrrrr*, I was one of them. He'd deleted me but hadn't blocked me, so I sent him a message that said something to the effect of \"Hey man, I hope you're doing okay. I deleted a bunch of people from Facebook a while back and it's because I was in a really bad place. Is there anything I can do? I'm down to chat if you need it.\" He blocked me without responding, so I'm not sure what's up with him, but this post is about me so forget that dude for now.\n\nTTT lives four hours away from me and FishFan420 so we wouldn't have a chance to just randomly bump into him. But last week FishFan420 and I were on the phone just catching up, and he tells me he's been trying to get ahold of TTT. He tells me about how he was passing through TTT's area so he put together a gift basket with a bunch of awesome kinds of beer in it and a card, and left it on his balcony for him. \n\nFellas, that really hurt me. It instantly reminded me of when I was in the same situation TTT was in, and my friends made fun of me on a livestream. It sucked so much. I haven't spoken with anyone yet, but it's been weighing on my mind a lot lately.\n\nThe Noodle Gimp is in no way involved in the situation with TTT, I don't think they've ever met and I don't think she knows about it. \n\nRight now, I want to go back to The Noodle Gimp and properly explain why I feel that that what she did was incredibly shitty because I don't feel like I covered it properly last time, and I want to go to FishFan420 and ask him why the hell he couldn't put in that kind of effort for me.\n\n**MISCELLANOUS**\n\nWe have all changed a lot in the past four years, and I'm generally quite happy with my friendships with both The Noodle Gimp and FishFan420. I know that if I asked, they would both sit and hear me out. \n\nI think it's also possible that FishFan420 only acted differently with TTT because this is his second time around the block and he's had some time to think about how to handle this kind of situation.\n\nI also don't know what the hell I'd get out of bringing this up again after all this time. I would have no goal having this conversation. I don't know if it's worth bringing this up so I can have some catharsis or if I should just let sleeping dogs lie.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAm I the asshole for bringing up something shitty that happened four years ago?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mother I won't be visiting my nephew?",
      "description": "My nephew was born to an addict mother and his first 4 years were full of abuse. My brother began fostering and picked up him and his sisters. My brother eventually adopted them all. They all have FAS, and myriads of other issues, but my nephew was affected the most. He has learning issues severe enough that he will likely never learn to read, and he has violent tendencies. Lying is so instilled in him, it's impossible to ever take him seriously. My brother would have to routinely pick him up from school for attacking his teachers/classmates. He constantly steals things to the point that he would have to have his pockets cut out of his pants or folded out. If he was ever unattended, he would set fire to things (toy boxes, grass, etc.). Under constant stress and threat of danger to his siblings, my brother gave him back to the government around the age of 8. He was immediately put into a children's psych ward, and then into group homes ever since. My brother and his family have stopped visiting him. He's now 11. He has recently moved from one group home in one city to another in my city.\n\nMy parents are ridiculously amazing people/grandparents and were rocked by losing him. My mother is a very caring woman and believes in the best of outcomes almost to a fault. She downplays his violence a lot, and they almost adopted him themselves. My mother and father would host visits for him (and his caretaker) every so often, but since he tried burning down their house the last time, my father barred him from coming back. They still go to visit him at his group home, and I don't fault them for that.\n\nI've been in separate cities from my family this whole time so I have never connected with these adopted children. I see them once in a while, and since I don't really like children to begin with, I don't really care to interact with them when I'm home. My mother gave my nephew's group home my phone number and he's called me once every few months to have an awkward conversation where he tells me some tall tale. I visited him once when he was in the psych ward (in my city), but mostly to help give my mother some peace.\n\nWhen he recently moved to my city, he called me and I answered the once. Then the rest of the week, I got about 10 voicemails from this child with a new lie each time. Things like \"My 15 year old girlfriend is pregnant\", \"I killed my friend\", and \"I'm in jail, get your butt over here\". So I was getting harassed by an 11 year old. It's sad, and I have pity for him, but I have no interest in talking with this child or visiting him. I actually want nothing to do with him.\n\nMy mother and father were planning on visiting him that weekend, but she fell ill, and then called me to ask if I could go see him since she was worried about disappointing him. I told my mother I wasn't going to visit him. Then she asked \"Will you ever?\". And I said no. She sounded heartbroken, and I'm not a fan of that. My mother is definitely not the asshole, but AITA?",

      "description": "Like most post I'll start with some backstory, I'll try and keep it as close to the truth as poss (find some posts here seem like very skewed versions of the truth). \n\nAt the time I had just finished university and was in the stage of trying to stay in contact with my close friends from then. With one friend, let's call her eve, we had been through alot of ups and down. I used to have a thing for her, sheet tonnes of mixed signals where she's say she didn't want anything like that with me, but would then get really drunk and try to sleep with me. I never did because of how drunk she was, definitely in the blurred lines of what could be rape, plus sober she didn't want anything so I respected that. Through the last year I tried to move on, and got a girlfriend, and was happy. It was obvious to see eve was not happy with this, I was open with my gf at the time and told her about the now distant feelings I had for eve. Eve would then carry on to try and break me and the gf up or that's what it felt like. (Won't go into detail trying to make post as short as poss). Gf would get jealous that I was spending so much time with eve (not out of choice we were housemates). After the breakup I would continue to get very mixed signals even though now eve had, and still has a bf. Then on the last night out of university we end up hooking up (I was very intoxicated at the time had dropped some mdma, eve didnt).\n\nAfter the night I felt pretty guilty as I knew she had a bf but still went there. But I didn't think it was my place to say anything, I don't want to be the reason a relationship breaks up. After uni finished contact was strange very hot and cold. Fast forward a few months to now, eve invited some old friends up for her b day, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go as things seemed very off with her, from some other mates I was pursuaded into going. The plan for the b day was pretty chill, go to a few pubs and bars in the day maybe go clubbing at night. Some of us pre drank before, without eve, we were all sorta dreading it because things between her and us seemed awkward (not just because of me, the others had reasons too). As we pre drank we turned up late which she wasn't happy about, and about two pubs in I was too drunk, rookie error of not eating, so ended up spewing in the toilets for a good while, when I get back I get in a spat with eve because of the state I'm in. I promptly decide to leave.\n\nLater I get a text from eve saying I ruined her bday. At this point I have lost all patients with her and tell her I do not want a friendship with her anymore, the confusion she has caused over the years has left its marks. She doesn't take that well and goes on to bitch to our whole group. \n\nSince we have not had contact I am a much happier person. But AITA for ruining her bday and the friendship? I can't help but feel some sort of guilt for the day.",

      "description": "(Warning this is fucking high school drama level BS but I just wanna make sure I am not in the wrong for this.)\n\nSo for the past two days I have been driving my sister and her friends around. Day one I had woken up at about 6:00am to go tour a college and was there till about 4:00 and then I had two hours before I worked from 6-10:30. After I got home at 10:30 my sister immediately asked me for a ride to the local Perkins. I told her I would drive her as my parents were working at our business. I drove her there assuming she would be there for about an hour. I get home 5 minutes later and right as I sit down I get a text that they decided that they want to just save money and make food at home. So I had too go pick them back up. Now I wasn’t annoyed at picking her up as she is a young girl and would not want her to try to walk home at almost 11:30 at this point. So I drive back to where she is. I get there and text that I am here. She takes 10 minutes to get out with me waiting in my car with not heat (heater broke on car). So at this point I am kind of annoyed. \n\nDay two she wakes me up at 9am and says she needs a ride. My parents had left too go work on our business again so I drove her and waited in the car again. I got home and finally had a few hours too myself. Until about 3 hours later she tells me she needs another ride. I ask why and she says she wants to meet friends at Starbucks for some joke (I don’t really get whatever joke it is but it wasn’t important.) I told her I don’t think I want to drive again for a joke. She than complains that it’s not that big of a deal and it’s only .4 miles! I told her it’s more about having to get up and get ready for a thing that will only take 10 minutes and isn’t really worth it. But I end up driving her because I wanted food and there was food close by. I get my food and drop her off and wait in the car again. Instead of going into the Starbucks and staying she somehow ends up in a Walgreens close by and take 20 minutes to do whatever she wants. And this point I am pretty annoyed. \n\nSo I get home and tell my sister I need to be downstairs to unwind and j think I deserve it. She says that whatever I am doing I can do upstairs and complains for 5 minutes straight before I just give up. \n\nSo the day passes and my parents get home. I tell them all that happens and they said they will talk to her. I than have her come into my room and apparently my parents have banned her from having friends over and lost the privilege of me driving her around. She is mad and calls me a bad brother and I quote “thought we had a fun time driving together.” \n\nAnyway AITA?",

At this gym, it is always busiest at around 6-9pm weekdays and particularly on Mondays. The gym has 2 elliptical machines and 5 treadmills.\n\nToday (Monday evening around 7:30pm), all the elliptical machines and treadmills were occupied. I notice that one of the staff (the head of the trainers) was on the treadmill. A lot of people were just waiting around for an empty machine and this staff member was on this machine for more than an hour while looking at her phone and seeming like she was on a leisurely stroll a lot of the time. This is the first time I have noticed this happen. I know staff members can use the facilities because I see the trainers use them, but mostly during the late off-peak hours.\n\nWould I be an entitled asshole if I said something/complain if it happens again? Looking for opinions whether I am correct in my thinking or I’m just plain wrong.",

      "description": "To understand this topic you'd have to understand my background. Im a 27 year old male, and I expect the best out of myself. Many people are afraid of appearing arrogant so they downplay themselves, I hate that. I keep in very good shape, and I have a promising career as an executive in the plastics industry.\n\nI have little trouble finding women, but in my life ive only had two \"girlfriends\". Each of my previous girlfriends didnt last longer than eight months, and each ended on a bad note.\n\nFor intimacy I keep a social circle of younger women who I meet casually for dates and/or sex. However as I get older and I approach the big \"three zero\" I desire a real relationship. I want a wife and kids.\n\nBut I also have trust issues due to my past relationships, and my high standards. So I have developed a \"screening\" process to pull women in my casual circle closer to me, amd test the waters on whether theyre someone I want to be with forever.\n\nI mostly already know where these women live and work, but I dont know \"what\" they do. I record the make and model of their vehicles and follow them around discreetly to see what theyre really doing. One woman who claimed to be a full time nail technician is actually unemployed and lives with her parents.\n\nI also use the web to find information and use a third party for this. Another claimed to run her own fashion label but is actually just an amazon dropshipper for womens jeans.\n\nThere have been times that women will see other men, which is fine in and of itself as we're not committed, but the men they see have extensive criminal records and unpaid debts.\n\nI do these screenings to make sure theyre ready for long term commitments and arent just after my money. My sister thinks that I should just go with my gut instinct instead of screening them, just follow my heart. But that seems illogical as I dont know whats in their hearts. AITA?",

      "description": "I have a friend (F1) who has young kids, and is out of town with them and her hubby for spring break. We are not particularly close as we do not have a ton in common, but do see eachother at least once a month usually at mutual friends or in town, and I make sure to always be very cordial with her. Another friend (F2) who I am much closer with is housesitting for them, and we went out for a drink after work. Afterwards F2 asked me if I could bring my dog over as she is great with other dogs, and F1 has a dog about the same age that has been driving F2 batty since he has been getting into everything and she was hoping the dogs could burn off some energy playing. We put the two dogs out to play and they did great ran all around the yard having a grand time, and wore each other out. I sent F1 a picture and just said, “having a blast” under it. I did text it super late probably 12:30am, and didnt think anything of it since it was a text and I am personally one of those people who thinks people can check text whenever they want, and especially if you are not asking them a question or to do something it doesnt matter when you send it cause the person can reply when they find convenient.\n\nF1 lost her mind she replied back at ironically 2:50 am saying never text her late at night unless its an actual emergency, and that she does not want the dogs playing in the yard at night in case a animal comes into the yard. I did not reply right away as the text rubbed me the wrong way, because if I am taking a photo clearly I am right next to them supervising them and the yard, and she knows F2 super well so clearly I am not just grabbing dogs and doing things without her approval. As for the time thing I thing I was frankly a bit mystified as I have never had someone comment on what time a text came in before. With phone calls I do always try to follow the business hours rule of thumb to call between 9am-5pm(ish) unless urgent. Is it perhaps a age difference thing as I am mid-twenties, and F1 is about 5 or so years older and in her early 30s? I apologized to my friend F2 saying I hope I did not get her in trouble. Should I reply to F1s text? Do I owe her apology?",

      "description": "I'm a 5'8\" woman. Kind of tall for female I always thought. I don't see men in a romantic or sexual way if they're shorter than me. I've always felt this way. I'm very self concious of my height and around shorter guys I always feel lke I'm half giant like Hagrid. Same height and up is fine. I've talked to a handful of lads about this and they say I'm shallow. (They're a little taller than me, not even short.) I just feel as though it's preference. \n\nI recently went on a Tinder date with a guy who I was semi-interested in. Not too much, but enough to give it a shot. When I got there he was about 5'2\" or something (His tinder bio said 5'10 but that's besides the point). I had a nice chat but his personality wasn't for me. It happens. I mentioned to my friend that his height turned me off anyway, and he lied about his height too. \n\nMy friend then said I shouldn't decline him if he's short, I should have just screwed him and left. (I was looking for sexual partners at the time) but people shorter than me turn me off big time. Like I mentioned I feel like a half giant. Because I expressed this notion, he started ranting about how men can't control their height so you shouldn't have a height preference.\n\nTl;dr:  I have a preference for same height guys or taller. I don't have sexual or romantic interest in shorter guys.\n\nAm I the Asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA For taking my Car from a friend and ruining a road-trip",
      "description": "I lent my car to a close friend as I was traveling overseas for what was meant to be 1 year. I was forced to come back after just 6 months due to my abysmal financial management. A month before I returned home I messaged my friend and told him the date I needed to take my car back - he agreed and everything was sweet.\n\nThe date arrives and I message my friend around 10am and I asked what time I could pick the car up in the afternoon/night.  He's a teacher at a local school and normally replies to my messages in work hours during the time between classes or 1 of the 2 breaks they have. He doesn't reply so I call him during their break which is around 11am. No answer, at this point no big deal I just send another message asking if he can let me know what's going on.\n\nI call again at ~2 which is their lunch break and receive no call/message from him which is very out of ordinary for him to not even reply.\n\nShortly later I receive a call from his GF who explained that they had already booked a road-trip for the weekend and could they keep the car until the following Tuesday. I said no, I had told them the exact date I was picking the car up. She told me not to be a dick and don't ruin the trip, I said that they shouldn't have planned a trip knowing I was taking the car back. At this point we got into an argument and I said I will get the car from the school with the spare key.\n\nHis girlfriend only said he was busy and she didn't mention any phone troubles or anything. At this point I was a bit angry since if my friend had contacted his girlfriend, he could have easily sent me a brief message explaining what was going on. I'm not sure why, but I felt like he didn't want to ask me directly to keep the car longer or was ignoring my calls and messages. He had always replied to messages at work before, if he was too busy to talk, he would at least send a message asking if we can talk later.  \n\nI walked up the school with my spare key, found my car in the parking lot and drove off. The car was a bit messy with their stuff (such as clothes, some personal items, etc) which I left at the front door of my friends house. In our area I was confident they wouldn't get stolen and they weren't in view of the public.\n\nI sent a final message to my friend (~4pm at this point) telling him I grabbed the car, left his personal effects at his house and thanked him for keeping it in good condition while I was gone (which wasn't sarcasm), which again no response to.\n\nIn hindsight I didn't end up using the car much over the weekend which makes me out to be worse, however, I didn't know what I was doing and if I would need a car or not. Had they told me before that they had planned the trip I would 100% agree to let them keep it 4 extra days. \n\nSo, am I an asshole here? ",

I think he even got into trouble with the police once. I've spoken to some  neighbors and they are actually amazed someone can be as spoiled and rude as that kid is.\n\nThe thing is, I was biking the other day next to a skate park and the kid was there. I prefer to ignore him so that's what I did, as usual. Now, he must've tried to make a jump or something because I hear a loud sound and next thing I know he's on the ground, crying. I seriously think he's broken something. And I just keep on biking. I feel terrible almost immediately, but I do not go back.\nI did tell my parents when I got home, and they have warned the kid's parents so he should be ok.\n\nBut I still feel terrible for having walked away when I saw him getting injured.

      "description": "Today my girlfriend asked me to go to her church, go to dinner with her friends, and take pictures afterwards. Since I am spending the night at my friends house I told her I was planning on getting to his house at 7/8 PM, so we would definitely have enough time for church and dinner (4 and 5:30, respectively), but it would depend on the timing for pictures. She said that was fine, so we went to church (which I had told her I disliked before), and went to dinner with her friends (who I’m not particularly fond of), and I even paid for her meal as well. When we left the restaurant it was about 6:50 and I wasn’t feeling too good, so I started heading to her house. She was fine until I pulled into her neighborhood, then got mad at me for not wanting to take pictures. Am I the asshole for not taking pictures, which I previously told her we may not have time to do?",

      "description": "Super brief history here, me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 6 months (though it feels like we’ve known each other for years) and we moved in together and it’s been fantastic (I’m aware how soon it is, there’s a reason for it, disregard the part where you advise it’s too soon, we both know). \n\nWell, when we’re trying to relax and watch a movie on Netflix she always likes to pick things that both haven’t seen. Me being a huge movie buff that regularly browses IMDb and rotten tomatoes for the best movies, have seen most “critically acclaimed” movies that are out. So when we started to talk about the movie “eternal sunshine of a spotless mind” (fantastic movie by the way, go see it if you haven’t. It’s a classic), she said she had never seen it before and that she always wanted to. So me, having already seen it and knowing she wouldn’t watch it if she knew I had known I had already seen it, she wouldn’t want to. \n\nSo I told her I haven’t, I knew she would love the movie so I really wanted her to experience it. \n\nAfter the movie finished, she loved the movie. I confessed that I had already seen it and that just wanted her to experience it. She gets furious, saying that I should never lie about things no matter what it’s about. I tried explaining that I’m well aware that lying is bad, but the morality of this was for you to enjoy something you haven’t before. She then said “what other things could you lie to me about to ‘save my feelings’ , where’s the line draw?”. \n\nI told her I was sorry, I truly didn’t mean to offend you. And I’ll always be honest with you because I truly have nothing to hide (I’m not a cheater, liar or a fake person, I’m an open book in every way). I also said that I will never do anything to you that I would ever have to hide to begin with, so lying isn’t really a necessity from the start. I didn’t say that I think she was blowing it out of proportion a little bit, and that your really questioning my morality as a person and I’ve never, and will never do anything that will need to be hidden from you to begin with. \n\nSo am I the asshole for lying about having already seen a movie?",

      "description": "So last night I met up at a bar with a very cute guy that I met on a dating app at a bar. From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?",

      "description": "Early October my brother came out to my mother and it didn't go well. She was extremely disrespectful and even laughs at the fact he gave her a letter after their argument explaining himself. In defense of my mother, he was originally asking for money which turned into him coming out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts been over 3 months and she still won't accept or respect his sexuality. I am 18 and about to graduate High School and he used to be over at our house frequently so this has affected my day to day life. I also just miss my brother. I talk to him quite often and he tells me he is grateful I am talking to her but he doesn't want to make it my problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today and he obviously isn't home which really put me down but no one else seemed to mind. I was sitting next to my mother when I gave her the suggestion to reach out to my brother and let him know you love him and accept him or at least make some progress. This turned into my mother saying something along the lines of \"I can't accept that way of life because it is wrong\". This set me off and I became extremely frustrated because of her tone and lack of compassion. She then said she has reached out to him multiple times (which I know is a lie) and said: \"I don't care if he doesn't want me in his life\". At this point, everyone was ganging up on me and backing my mom up and I felt so shitty. I was just giving her a suggestion! I never wanted to turn our morning into an argument but I hated how she was talking about my brother whenever she could've said something to me that was so much more neutral and positive like \"We need to sit down and talk it out\" not \"I can't accept that way of life because it is wrong\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole but I'm just not sure. I never meant to start something and I wish I never made a comment like that, to begin with because I suppose it isn't my business but he is my brother and I want to see him, especially on Christmas.

I'm not sure if I went too fast, the button didn't register or what, but I handed it back only to have the lady at the register, not my server give me the nastiest look.\n\nShe yelled out \"EXCUSE ME SIR, THERE IS A 10% MINIMUM SERVICE FEE, YOU DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING!\". I honestly froze. I looked at her and said \"Oh,I thought I tipped 20%?\" and she replied \"No sir, there's nothing here!\". I was still a bit shook for getting called out and yelled at. I just wanted to leave so I said \"Oh, sorry about that\" and left.\n\nI honestly would have left the $3 tip in change, but I kind of felt like I was attacked for a simple mistake.

      "description": "Brace yourselves, it's a long story and I am sorry for any typos, English is not my first language.\n\nLast summer I dated a guy that was studying to be a flight attendant with my best friend. At first he was sweet but as the course went on he had less time to hang out, he didn't answer anymore, he was stressed out and he started to stand me up on dates and stuff.. I reacted pretty badly at first as I was also starting a new job and I had to travel 3 hours every day and bike 20 kilometers to make it. I guess neither one of us were really in the right mood. Nonetheless, I got mad, started to get insecure and had a breakdown on him. So my best friend just told him to back off and he did. I was quite ashamed of myself so I apologized and he ignored me. When I saw that he was still watching my stories I just wrote to him something in the lines of: if you're going to ignore me do it right. Don't watch my stories. To that, he promptly deleted me from social medias and that was the end of it. \nAt that point I was pretty much the asshole I think.. anyways I leave that to your judgement. \n\nCouple of months later, he does his grand comeback and adds me on fb. I message him saying that I am not really comfortable with us being friends and all.. And I do it very nicely I think.. He gets mad tells me off and blocks me on fb. I tell it to my best friend and he then confide that my ex is feeling lonely and that he hasn't really connected with any flight attendants and his job doesn't really allow him to with anyone. I find his number and text him telling him that I didn't mean him to take it that way it's just I still remember the nice time we had together and it still hurts to talk to him. We then formally apologize to each other (especially me). But nothing more comes out of it. We don't talk again as I made it clear that it was over and that I don't befriend my exes. \n\nFast forward to last Sunday.. my best friend posts a story of us at a party and my ex suddenly remembers that he didn't wish me a HNY... 13 days later.. I just answer thanks, you too even though it's a little late. He starts joking around with wink faces and I just tell him what's new to be polite... Two days later and he didn't answer.. I texted him well never mind, hope your having a good one, bye now... Through that part, you have to keep in mind that I'm really depressed because my contract ended so I don't have a job, both my best friends are an ocean away and well I'm bored, I don't have social contact or anything.. the smallest thing throws me off.. So small talks with someone I don't specially want to talk too are not really something I enjoy. \nHe gets mad at me, and says still moody I see, I've been working you should know. And I tell him that I'm not mentally well so to cut me some slack. So to that he kinda tries to apologize and the typical if you want to talk I'm here. And if there's one thing I really don't need right now is pity. \n\nSo I try to explain to him gently that even though I appreciate his support, it's really not what I need right now and I'd rather not talk to him.. and he gets mad saying that I'm just trying to push him away, that I shouldn't treat him like that he's doing everything out of his own free will.. And I try to explain to him that I need someone to hang out with here in my city not half a world away, I don't to feel vulnerable to him by talking with him as a crutch as it would hurt me more than anything.. he gets mad again, and so explain once more putting an accent on the fact that I don't hate him or anything. He doesn't answer again for 2 days.. So I just tell him not to contact me again as the wait is more painful than anything. And he starts saying that I'm spitting in the face of maybe the only person that cares for me, and if that's how I treat people who care, I'm going to need luck. That everything he did he did it out of free will and that I twisted it all around. \n\nThere I got mad, and I told him that I tried to explain to him many times, and that I do have people who care and not to presume on how I treat them. As for him caring, it's all lie he's telling himself to make himself feel better that he better not blame me, if he still hasn't got it through his head that by texting me he's not doing me any good. Theeeen I blocked him.. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nThanks everyone who kept on going until here! ",

I love that we are given this amazing opportunity I just don't know how I would react seeing all those poor children suffering and in pain. \nThis kids condotion are severe, we are not talking about broken bones or that kind of stuff we are talking very serious diseases. This hospital is one of the most famous in my country for children care and even people from other countries come here because they are specilized in serious illnesses.\nMost of the people in my group are going but I don't think I can handle it emotionally and I feel like an asshole because I think of the joy that this would bring to those poor children.\nI should add that I suffer from severe anxiety.

      "title": "AITA For calling my boyfriend's work?",
      "description": "Today is an *anniversary* of when my boyfriend and I first started dating.  I have some extra money so I decided to send my boyfriend a pizza today. He told me he was just getting back from lunch but I figured that if he didn't want it now he could hold onto it in his company fridge and bring it home, since we wanted to spend the evening together. \n\nLately all we ever get is frozen supreme pizzas, so I ordered him a large Supreme with Handtossed Crust and some things called cinnamon twists. I texted him and told him I was having a present delivered and he would need to sign for it.\n\n\nSo I tell the pizza place that he specifically needs to sign for it, and I'm excited, waiting at my desk for the text saying he got his food, because I figured even if he didn't want it right now, he'd have stuff to snack on later. \n\n\nThe delivery time comes and passes and I end up telling him his present was pizza, and I needed to know if he got it or not, and he says, \"oh the supreme? I didn't get any.\" \nSo I'm immediately upset because I think someone else signed for it and ate the food I bought for him. \n\n\nI ask him if he signed for it and he just says \"why would you send it to a place where a bunch of old dudes work and expect them not to eat it all?\" \n\n\nSo I call the business, thinking someone else had signed my receipt, effectively stealing the product I purchased for my boyfriend, because he didn't specify that he signed for it, and he didn't get a single slice of the pizza or a single cinnamon twist. \n\n\nI got his boss on the line when I called in, and I asked if they knew who signed for the pizza, because I was told that he didn't get any. She said he did sign for it, and he told her, \"She should know me well enough to know that I don't like supreme pizza,\" and refused to eat it. His boss said \"I tried to get him to at least eat a cinnamon twist, but he didn't want to.\" \n\n\nSo I text him to ask why he gave it away, and he wouldn't answer, and the conversation ended up devolving into him practically yelling at me through text saying that sending him the pizza was dumb, he signs for things every day, how was he supposed to know the pizza was for him, that I shouldn't have called his work because he would get into a lot of trouble if the BIG BOSS had answered the phone. \n\n\nI am now terribly upset because I'm out $30, and I didn't want to feed his coworkers, I wanted the pizza to be for him. I was under the impression the pizza was stolen, but it wasn't, he'd just given it away. And on this day that is supposed to be at least somewhat special, the one nice thing I was able to do for him was not even slightly appreciated, and he's furious at me for calling his company to see who signed for it, when I asked him directly several times. I had no idea what kind of tip was left, and I was upset that he hadn't eaten, and had no idea who charged the tip to my card. \n\n\nAnd then being told that he doesn't even like supreme pizzas, when thats all he eats at home when we get frozen pizzas. I don't pick that style, he does. \n\n\nAt this point he's texted me saying \"BIG BOSS found out, bosslady told him. All I heard was \"Why does that involve you!?\" So thanks. I could get in big trouble for this.\"\n\n\nSo am I the asshole? Did I overreact? \n\nThe big issue seems to be me calling in. I just wanted to make sure someone else didn't sign off and claim the pizza. \nI was just trying to do something nice and now I'm super upset. It might be an overreaction but the way he was talking to me through text and how angry he seemed to get over a PIZZA of all things had me so upset I started crying and had to step away from the office. \n\n\n*not specifying the length of relationship because that shouldn't matter in this context.\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the mobile formatting. So we are both 25/F and are turning 26 in October. Our birthdays are two days apart and we came up with the idea to travel to Los Angeles for our birthday week. While we were planning everything, we were both super excited and started naming things we would want to do. When it came to the dates, she was adamant that she wanted to go for seven days, which would be Sunday-Saturday. I did not like this idea and told her that it would be way too expensive and that it wouldn’t make sense to go for that long. She said we would compromise and only go for six days (which I still didn’t like). I said that going for three or four days would be more than enough, but she insisted that she would need a day to “recover” from the flight. The flight we were looking at gets to LA at around 10:30am, but she wants to spend the day at the airBnB after we arrive. \n\nOn top of this, she wants to do a bunch of things that I know for a fact she can’t afford. She wants to go to Disneyland, rent a car (which I would have to pay for, because she doesn’t have any credit cards), and stay at a private airBnB. Without giving out too much of her financial situation, I know that she owes a lot of money and only pays about $200 a month to live with a friend. I know that I would have to pay the majority of the trip and it frustrates me to no end. Moving forward to today, I just found out that I got accepted into the fire department for my town and I am so excited for this! Unfortunately, I am having surgery next month and have to miss one of the training classes. Missing one of the training classes means that I have to go to the next full class entirely, which isn’t until September. I texted her and told her that we might have to consider moving the trip to November and she flipped out. She said that she wanted to have one birthday that wasn’t a shitty one and that I had to let her know ASAP. \n\nAt this point, I don’t even want to go on the trip anymore. I mean, I want to see LA, but I don’t want to go on this extravagant vacation that I’ll end up paying for most of. I am happy with a three day trip that I can stay in a cheap hotel and see everything that I want to see. I go on solo vacations a lot and I have always enjoyed it. I don’t know what to do, but would I be the asshole if I just booked my own trip and went without her? Someone told me that I should just book the trip I want and tell her if she wants to tag along to go ahead, but I don’t know if that’s the best move. ",

So this all started a month into dating when she made an instagram account and she didn't add me but told me to add her and like all her pictures, at the time I didn't think anything of it until a friend asked why she didn't follow me on Instagram. I asked her about it and she said \"you don't post anything so why would I follow?\" it made sense and I told her how I felt about and everything seemed good and she added me. Fast forward to yesterday she decides to make a snapchat because her friends told her to ( I've been trying to get her to make one since I've known her) and she starts telling me about her sending thingd to her friends and I get really upset about and she gets mad at me because \"it's just snapchat\" .\n\nThe reason I get upset is cause we had recently discussed how I feel like she's ashamed for people to know that we are together. It wasn't until that conversation that she told her friends that she had a boyfriend. She's a shy and private girl with anxiety so all this just seemed normal to me. But all these feeling came rushing back when this happened... \n\nShe is upset that I'm making a big deal about and I'm starting to think I may be.\n\nReading this over makes it sound like we are in junior high lol we are both in our late 20s\n\n So reddit, AITA for getting upset?\n\n",

      "description": "The title isn’t exactly the best, but I have to vent somehow and I don’t have enough real life friends to get a diverse opinion.\n\nSo, a few years ago, I played Destiny. And I was able to meet some friends on there. One of them is the friend I’m referring to, we’ll call him Frank. Thanks to Frank, I am now friends with very wonderful people who I wouldn’t trade for anything else. We played many games and we had many wonderful moments together.\n\nBut one night, he confessed he loved me. And I reciprocated... but I’m a complete and total idiot who thought the type of love he was talking about was platonic. Nope, he wants me to be part of a three way relationship with him and his wife. I should also note that I’ve constantly mentioned my fiancé in much of our conversations.\n\nIt’s been a few months, we chatted and talked about meeting up sometime soon, but I’ve been having second thoughts about this relationship. I thought he would understand me just wanting to be friends but he always says “just give us a chance” and “you love me, right?” The issue being he knows I hate confrontations and I have an issue about saying no (the wonderful gift of low confidence). Recently when I mentioned the doubts I have about this relationship, he proceeds to claim he spent $600 on stuff for me!\n\nHOW? The only things I got from him was enough platinum in Warframe to get 2 new warframes! (For reference, he would have to pay $24.98 to get the platinum for both of them) and that’s it! And the idea that he spent $600 on me and he hasn’t even seen me in person says a lot about him!\n\nLooking back at all the messages, I’ve felt like he sees me as more of a girlfriend than an actual friend. I tried to explain that I just want to be friends and I appreciate everything he’s done for me, but he claims “You're going to give us a shot because I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME” and “Your chance to make this up, is to give us a chance. Understand?” (Actual messages, btw)\n\nThe main reason I’m hesitant to end this is, well, he’s been friends with the other guys for longer and I read the stories on here about how someone would become your worst nightmare for rejecting them and I don’t want to be the cause of the ruination of a decade long friendship. Plus, My fiancé found the most recent conversation (he read it over my shoulder) where Frank wrote: “You are going to come visit ok. I am NOT taking no for an answer ok. We're going to set something up for may ok? ( The correct response you should respond with is Yes Sir)”, and needless to say, fiancé absolutely rejects the concept of me visiting Frank now.\n\nShould I just end this relationship right now and look like an asshole for talking about visiting him for almost a year or should I try making it up to Frank before ending it? I feel like the asshole either way...",

      "description": "My gf Ali's coworker, Rob, offered to let us live in his spare room. We hadn't discussed with them how long we'd stay, but after January was finishing up Ali and I had decided we'd leave in late Feb. \n\nRob was living with his gf, Les, and their 4 month old puppy, Lia. Before this we were at a party in their home and noticed Rob hit Lia when she became too playful or jumped on people (she is large). It was weird, but figured it wasn't a typical thing. We proceeded to move in on November 8th, paying $350 for that month and eventually for December + January, too. \n\nWe became reclusive after realizing how they really treated Lia. She was put into her cage usually from the time that they slept until their arrival from work (unless Les slept on the couch with her since Rob hated sleeping with Lia). Sometimes Ali would be home all day and realize that Rob would only let Lia out to pee while he'd hang out in the living room. He would also hit her. Yelling \"no!\" and \"shut up!\" at Lia was common to hear. \n\nIt made us feel uncomfortable. Eventually we'd hear Lia whining past 12 and Rob would come out and hit her. I recorded some of these instances. \n\n[2/2 Second time he came out to hit her after Lia was barking](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0a8ySEpd7o2)\n\n[2/9](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1F84ATsNcav)\n\n[2/15](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0bu2RBgZmJ7)\n\n[2/18](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0TH9vnaCOWG)\n\nI stopped interacting with them after this started. Ali left to spend her last weeks here with her family and I stayed with Rob while working. He  asked Ali if she was mad at him and she explained that her discomfort there stemmed from her father's abusiveness. \n\nHe responded with: \n&gt;\"I may have gone a lil too overboard with her cause her barking was making me think that you guys were not getting enough rest so that's why i did it...You could've come to me about it and I would've realized my mistake earlier.\"\n\nHis response rubbed me the wrong, particularly that he brushed off that he was abusing Lia, so I wrote a letter for Rob. [here if you wanna read it](https://imgur.com/a/lZE33BG)\n\nI left the rent money in a couple of twenties but mostly fives and ones out of pettiness and a desire to get rid of them. I also left behind furniture that wasn't theirs (desk+mattress). And I hadn't vacuumed, but the bathroom was clean. My anxiety in asking for the vacuum or having to move this furniture past them shouldn't excuse me. \n\nThey texted Ali a whole bunch of stuff after this, with some name calling, defensiveness of the abuse, and that I should've paid in full.

      "description": "Obligatory Throwaway account spiel and tl;dr will provided below after long exposition dump.\n\nSorry in advance for all the words and format (I'm a mobile user degenerate)\n\nAnyways to preface my situation I have to give context in the form of explaining my past relationships. All have but one involved cheating, physical, emotional, and mental abuse, and fear of anything romantic or sexual (I don't want to get into too much detail as I'm currently battling severe depression and anxiety).\n\nThe one relationship that didn't leave me damaged however was when I dated my current boyfriend who we'll call E.\n\nBack then I was teenager who had unfortunately fell into romanticizing suicide and constantly made E sad when I told him I would kill myself or he'd leave me eventually. The whole thing was a shit show that I constantly look back on and never forget nor never forgave myself for doing to someone who was like me, someone who wanted to be in a healthy loving nontoxic relationship.\n\nI realized, unfortunately after a year of being with him at the time, how fucked up I was and apologised and broke up with E. In my head I was saving E from any more pain I would've caused from my selfish destructive words and ideals though to others it was because he was moving to a different part in the state I live in.\n\nAfter he left, the string of manipulative and painful attempts of romantic endeavors came and went alongside a suicide attempt that, as messed up and cringy as it sounds, was rebirth I needed to change drastically. I love life now though I make jokes about killing myself from time to time but it's all part of my twisted humor.\n\nCut to a year and months later my ex comes back and my best friend sets us all up to hangout at her place. We all catch up and spill a lot of history about what happened when E left. \n\nE explains that he got into a relationship with a girl months after he moved and lost his virginity to her only to find out that that she was engaged.   I felt sympathetic to the feeling of being used as someone's sexual release toy though I never had sex (when you're a teen with hormones up the ass you're bound to make mistakes in that regard but there's a different reason as to why I remain a virgin which I'll get to).\n\nWe all exchanged numbers just in case we wanted to hangout again and soon enough E and I get to talking. We text for a couple days and one thing led to another and E asks if we could get back together. \n\nI has extremely hesitant to the idea which I told him about and heavily insisted if he was sure. Even though I was no longer toxic I wasn't the same person especially considering the fact that I came out as transgender. \n\nI pressed that considering our pasts we would have to go slow and that if I say things that are similar to the crap I said when I was young or that made him feel like crap or sad, make sure to stop and change the subject. We agreed.\n\nCue to the current dilemma, we're 3 months into the relationship and I'm hanging at his house where out of nowhere I kiss E for the first time. \n\nThat's not where the issue is however. \n\nWe go in for more and in the heat of the moment I start teasing the shit out of him by grinding. He loses control for a bit and pins me down on his bed in the ye old missionary style. I freak out getting a flashback to when my ex before him did it and I damn near kick him in the balls. \n\nI was apologising so much but he said it was his fault for going too fast. It made it worse when deep down I wanted to go further but my extreme fear and cowardice made me pussy out.\n\nWe talked it out and we just went about playing videogames.\n\nAfter that day the same thing happened for 3 more times minus the almost assault via my foot to his testicles. We'd hang, thing's get steamy, I tease, I freakout when he returns it. \n\nHe's started to get frustrated for this double standard which I've apologized for countless times. I've been trying so hard but my past just comes to haunt me and I end up feeling like a whore when I want to go further.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'm sorry if this post is all over the place but it's midnight and I'm suffering from the flu and depression so my mind is not exactly in the right as of now.\n\n**TL;DR Ex who I made sad with teenage angst gets back together with me. 3 months in I sexually tease the shit out of him but when he tries to return it I pussy out multiple times **",

      "description": "Context: At my school in Grade 12 you get two spares which are free-periods. Since I completed two credits in one class I have a spare in Grade 11.\n\nThe spare is in the afternoon, my school as a day 1 (odd days) and a day 2 (even days) so one week my spare would be period 4 (last period) on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This week it is Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nFor the other afternoon period I have Online Accounting. The Library (where I usually work on the computers provided) was double booked which means no computers are free. \n\nI usually find another spot with a singular computer like the Guidance Office. The past 2 days (including today) it is double booked during my account online class. So I went to the Guidance Office to ask if I could use the computers next period, but also asked if I was allowed to \"swap\" the time slots for the online class and spare from time to time when the library is booked. \n\nShe said since I could access the online class at any time of the day and there is no time slot for it I could. I asked if it'd be unethical to swap the two all the time when I had accounting class period to get off school early. She said no since I can acccess accounting any time and the other period isn't a class, but instead a free period.\n\n**So...** WIBTA if I swapped the time slots to be in my control to leave at 1:20 compared to 2:35 leaving my friend (who I mainly on see at the end of school for the walk home) in the dust every day to well get off early, and is abusing my powers unethical?",

From what I was initially told in the interview, I'd be busy all the time, and more importantly, I'd have my own projects to work on. \n\nIt's been 6 weeks, and I'd say I spend over half of most of my days on Reddit or Pinterest. I have almost no work to do. On the other hand, my 2 coworkers, who have the same job as me, are drowning in their amount of work. I've taken to helping them with their work and picking up the slack that they don't have time to do. Since I've been doing this for a bit, I feel like I've become their personal assistant. \n\nWe had a conference this week, with hundreds of people from out of town, and had to make these folder/packets with information on the company. I had to build over 100 packets, while they did actual work. I feel like I've become their office assistant, when we're supposed to have the same job. It's partially my fault for offering to help them do some of their work, but they've started asking me to do these secretarial/assistant duties, that they don't have to do, and that were NOT in my job description. \n\nRight now I'm making $30k/year (before taxes, benefits, and 401K) to go on Reddit and Pinterest. I'd rather make more, even if it's a little more, and actually have work to do.\n\nSo, I've started updating my resume, and looking elsewhere. I learned to not stay in a job if you hate it just because I don't want to be confrontational and quit and upset my current coworkers. \n\nAITA for being upset over this? Most people in the office are super nice. I like them as people and they made me feel very welcome. \n\nAITA and expecting too much? ",

We are very close, talk almost daily and see each other every weekend. \n\nBTW sorry for my english, it is not my native language. \n\nMy parents are the same age, both had a rough childhood. Then they had kids and had a rough time (financialy) bringing us up. Later on I had to go through the same as I worked to get money for my drivers licence, my first car, then worked to pay for college. Now that the kids are grown up and some good things happened to them career wise they are getting wealthier. Not rich by any means, but they can do what they want and still have something left. \nAs they recently both passed the age of 50 they have been expressing concerns of what they will do money wise when retirement comes. For the last year I have been pitching them ideas on small businesses that they could do similar to their current jobs. I dont want to be specific becouse I could get identified, but my dad has a good trade skill in a blue color job and could easily transfer to being self employed. \nNow since they had a pretty poor life up untill now they want to use the money that they are earning now to get back at what they missed out on. Nice cars, expensive vacations. I completely understand their thought process, but... On one hand they spend all of their new income on expensive shit and on the other hand they cry about how they are not gonna have money for their retirement. \nThey completely deny any of my ideas for atleast a bit of financial independence. \nLast weekend they told me that they dont want to risk saving money and dying to early unable to enjoy it.\n\nThey said that if they live long enough to go to retirement I am here to help them out financialy. Now, as I said I love them, but this is just selfish. I told them I will not help anybody that doesnt want to help themselfes. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my fiance and I rarely ever see movies with one another. He often sees movies with his friends quite often though, which is fine because they are mostly star wars movies and or marvel movies. I don't dislike them, just not caught up so I don't bother seeing them. Then when it comes to movies I want to see he doesn't. They are just not his cup of tea, or sometimes he goes with his friends and we just don't get around to seeing the movie with each other. \nWell today the trailer for The Dead Don't Die came out, and I really wanted to see it with him when it hits theaters. He hates scary movies, but I figured because it's a zombie parody movie he might be more interested in it. Nope. He replys with a \"meh\" and \"eh not interested. Don't mean to sound like a dick or anything.\" That's when I snapped. I was fed up of him always doing this, this is like the fifth movie has has done this to. I say stuff like \"you don't understand you are never bothered with me not seeing movies with you because you always go with your friends\" and \"whatever! I don't care anymore!\" He then says with disdain he'll go see the movie. It made me more upset, I don't want him to feel like I'm forcing him to watch it, I'm just tired of the constant turning my movie choices down. So I say something stupid but in truth I still kinda mean \"I'm never going to see another movie with you again. I won't ask to see a movie that you might not want to see, I won't even ask if it's a movie we both want to see. You can just go with your friends and I'll go see it alone.\" He then brings up all the 3 movies he did see with him and told me \"quit acting like a fucking child!\" \nWe haven't talked since (about 2-3 hours) we'll probably apologize when he gets off work. I just want to know, am I in the wrong? Am I the asshole? ",

I use it fairly regularly. I never wanted a refund because there was never any need.\n\nBut apparently, they've decided to give me one....for some reason.\n\nNow, let's cover some of the ethical problems. The product is from Kitchen Aid. So it's not some small company. And the refund on the product is only $20. It would probably cost them more in company time to fix this issue than the refund itself costs.\n\nThere's no expectation of returning the item, for some reason. Apparently the reason for the refund was that I didn't find the item satisfactory. But yet I still get to keep it.\n\nThere's no easy way to respond to this email. I'm given no email to reply to, because the email used was a notification only email.\n\nI'm tempted to just let this go. Consider it a lucky windfall.\n\nThere are no new payment methods, so I doubt this is someone who is refunding my product through my account, only to get the refund payment put on their credit card. It's still my credit card info there, and only my card.\n\nAm I an asshole for doing nothing?",

      "title": "AITA for letting a girl ruin my first year of college?",
      "description": "Context: I had a girlfriend for 3 years, we had a sort of rocky beginning, we broke up, got back together, sort of one of those kinds of relationships. But regardless we loved each other and always would come back (I guess we were just too young and didn't realize what was staring us right in the face). The last time we saw each other we ended up starting a friends with benefits sort of thing and, being a little more mature than I had been the last time we broke up I decided I would try and be the boyfriend I hadn't been, and even though we were not exclusive I would make sure that I would be to show her that maybe she could give this another shot. So anyway, I have been in a lot of relationships in my life and I am not sure if its my personality (I am quite a fun person to be around I laugh a lot I'm super positive all the time and I guess some people like to take advantage of that and exploit my good nature), but I tend to be in relationships that either end badly or ones where the other party is found to be unfaithful. But not this Girl, for the sake of this story lets call her Stephanie. Stephanie never cheated on me, I had complete trust in her, and the reason these other relationships would end badly was that I'd always end up uncovering those secrets people had, I'd always end up finding out things I would rather not know, a pretty stark realization that ignorance really is bliss. But I trusted Stephanie not just with daily life, but I trusted her that she would never intentionally do something to hurt me or my heart.\n\nAnyway, we started this whole FWB thing just as I was starting my first year at college. So I decided I would seldom go out and get too drunk and I wouldn't hook up with anyone because I wanted to prove to myself and her that this time it would be different and I was more mature and ready for a steady start to something new. This continued for a while, and I started getting those gut feelings that she wasn't being honest with me, that there was something wrong. But given that Stephanie never gave me any reason to suspect that she would be lying to me in our 3 years together, I decided that it was nothing and I was being paranoid. But I could never get rid of that feeling deep down in my stomach, and the only way that I could forget about it and feel normal was to play video games alone in my room or smoke weed. Those were the only two things that helped, and I also worked out every morning with my roommate which also helped but not as much. Given that information, you could probably take an educated guess and assume that my grades took the full force of this bad situation and while I didn't flunk out of school, I did not get good grades and the result of that was a wasted year of college and the grades to show it.\n\nI would also like to give some more context as to the nature of this \"FWB\" situation we had together, we almost completely pretended it was an exclusive relationship, we'd go on dates, we would spend time at each other's houses, we'd text like we were in a relationship, it was like a dog shit that was gift wrapped perfectly, beautiful on the inside but as soon as you start to open it, it smells like shit. I had told her multiple times I was still in love with her while drunk, she had mistakenly said that she loved me at least 3 times while we were together, so given all that I really thought I had a chance to rekindle what we had lost.\n\nWell one night I had had enough, she had texted me she was at a party, I was at school at the time, and that she would be staying over at some random guys house, and given that I had fallen yet again head over heels for this girl, it made me feel like a used napkin, like all she wanted was the emotional and sexual support in a relationship without the actual commitment to being exclusive to one another. I called her the next day and said that I would leave if she didn't tell me everything which she did, the late nights she would spend with other guys, all the encounters she had, and it really felt like someone had punched me in the stomach so hard that my lips and my mouth went completely dry and I sat there just trying to figure out what I would do, so, like any guy in love, I made the stupidest decision anyone could make, I said I was ok with it and that we should continue with our arrangement. +more time in video games, +more time smoking pot = bad grades = angry parents\n\nSpring break rolled around, I had atrocious grades, my parents said that If I didn't turn things around, they would stop paying for school and I would have to drop out. I tried to text Stephanie, but she would only respond if I texted her on Instagram as well, which was bizarre. I then realised she had me muted on text and it had been like that our entire \"FWB\" trip. That was the last straw, I said that I was in love with her and that this was tearing me apart inside and that this had to stop. She never apologized and never took any wrongdoing saying that \"I knew the rules and knew that she was allowed to see other people\" so, with this new information, I completely broke down emotionally since this was literally the only girl I could have trusted, the one girl that I had held onto as something that I regretted and something I wanted back. So my grades never improved, I finished the year with probably a C-C+ average and decided to take a year off, gather myself, and see if I could do a second year. Well, I am currently about halfway through my brief sabbatical, I spent three months in France doing a program called WWOOF, I would work on farms and I get a free bed and free food. I came back for Christmas back home and now I found a job that pays well and is working while staying with my parents while we heal our relationship together (that's a whole other story), we got into a fight finally, and I told them everything about why I didn't do well in school and why I was always playing games and the such. And they would not understand that I had been depressed for my entire year at school and decided to cope with it in a way that affected my grades. They said to me that I threw away a year of my life, just because a girl had hurt me, and that it was my fault that I had destroyed my first year because of what had happened to me. My dad said to me that \"You destroyed your first year for a girl?\" With a facial expression that pretty much spelt out \"Really? Are you kidding?\". They pay for my college so it's understandable that they would be upset with my poor performance, but am I missing a part of their argument? Was it really something that should never have happened that I shouldn't have let this affect me so much? Am I The Asshole?\n\nSpark Notes Version:\n\nGirlfriend of three years decided to be FWB, she lied about seeing other guys, made me depressed and anxious all the time, got bad grades, parents were understandably upset about it, told them finally why, blamed me for letting it affect me so much and ruining my first year. AITA",

      "description": "Before I get into this just a bit of context - I’m about to turn 19 in less than two weeks, work full time, and still live with my parents - I’m planning on going to college next year having taken this year to better myself as a person. \n\nI love tattoos, and my father has one on his chest,  which is partially why I think I became interested in tattoos in the first place. He has has told me that he hoped I don’t tattoo my neck or hands but he understands that this is ultimately my decision. My mom however has a lot of hatred for tattoos, and truly I don’t understand why. She makes very derogatory comments towards tattooed people she sees in public and has said things like “tattoos represent lower social class” and “you never see a successful person with tattoos” - when I got my first tattoo she would not speak to me or even look at me for days, and grows very angry if I try to talk about tattoos. I tried to ask her why she gets so upset, as me getting tattoos doesn’t effect her at all, and she told me through tears that it DOES effect her and my getting tattoos hurts her. My admittedly immature response was to get another tattoo immediately. The last time I attempted to seek some middle ground she told me she was ashamed of me because of my tattoos, and that was possibly the most hurtful thing I’ve been told. She insists that I’m stuck in my own delusional world view and am not seeing things from her view. Am I the asshole here? Am I really stuck in my own worldview, or is she just crazy? I’m planning on moving out soon since the constant antagonism from her has caused serious problems with my already existing mental issues, and I think I’m better on my own, but before I leave I’d at least like to know if I should apologize or something. Thanks in advance for any advice, I’m truly lost here and it’s driving me a bit insane.",

      "title": "AITA For Not Defending My Dad While He Yelled At A Bank Employee \"For Me\"?",
      "description": "So this just happened and I'm really heated so I thought I should let it out here, anyway...\n\nI got my card stolen just yesterday, so I decided to call my bank and get it replaced since their online requests weren't working for some reason. \n\nI put the call on speaker phone, reasons being that I'm fairly young and have never asked for a new card before, so I wanted help. That and I also just hate phone calls period.\n\nShe answers in a rather strained tone, this personally didn't bother me (but it's important to note), cause I know they close in 30 minutes and as a retail employee I understand the pain lol.\n\nAnyway first question she asks me is for my full card number. I say that I actually don't know it, and that I'm here to report a stolen debit card. \n\nShe then asks if I'm reporting mine, or someone else's, to which I say mine.\n\nNext, my ssn, which I give her. And then my driver's license number. I'm a little surprised they asked for that since my dad never mentioned it. But I quickly tell her the truth, that I don't have one.\n\nNot to mention you'd think they'd have that in their system right? But idk banks so maybe not.\n\nWell the lady doesn't really like that answer. She asks me, \"You don't have a driver's license?\"\nI'm about to respond but my dad chimes in with, \"But you have your ID number.\"\n\nI repeat what he says to her and she then asks, \"Who is that speaking in the background?\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, it's my dad.\" I couldn't hear her full response but my dad and I both heard her say something about the speaker phone.\n\nTo which I just guessed that she wanted me to not use speaker phone for some reason. In my opinion, that was the only weird thing about her, but my dad thought differently.\n\nHe immediately said in a loud voice, knowing she could hear, \"Wow what kind of attitude is that?\"\n\nI quickly say, \"Dad...seriously?\" Warning him to stop. \n\nAfter obviously hearing us, the lady continues but my dad pushes it further.\n\n\"No that's so rude. WHAT, YOU HAD A ROUGH DAY AT WORK OR SOMETHING?\"\n\nMe: \"Dad stop.\"\n\nDad: \"She's acting like a BITCH.\"\nHe says all of this so loudly to make sure she hears it... At this point I'm embarrassed, and pissed off at my dad, and honestly about to cry from frustation of losing both my debit card and bus card, and now having to deal with this. \n\nThe lady is talking, but I don't hear her, I just end the call, too guilty to recieve help from her. \n\nMy dad then goes on arguing about her apparent \"tone\" and how I shouldn't let people treat me like that. How I'm the customer and how I shouldn't let people order me around. \n\nI argue saying her tone was fine, and she didn't \"order\" me, she asked, and was doing her job. Even if she was a little annoyed or tired, she didn't deserve to be yelled at...\n\nSo am I the asshole for defending the employee? And was my dad right? Was she actually in the wrong and I'm too much of a \"doormat\" to see it?",

      "description": "My sister is flying into New Orleans this Sunday at 5PM. My parents called me today at work asking if I was free Sunday to pick her up, which they already agreed to do on their way back from Houston. I told them I don’t see why not but let me talk to my girlfriend, who I’m living with, just in case there’s something I forgot about or something I’m not aware of. We talked and between the game, the potential weather, and the possibility of getting stuck until late me and my SO decided to apologize and say we weren’t able to and made something up to get out of it. My mom started texting me asking if I could move what I said I was doing, or that she could give me gas money if that was the issue. I said that it wasn’t, and that if they could maybe move the flight up then I could make it work. To which my dad replied saying that picking my sister up was more important and that my SO’s dad would understand (we said we were helping him move a table saw from our house to his) and things like that. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: parents asked me to pick up sister from airport after they agreed to so they could spend more time in Houston, huge NFL game persuaded us to decide against it, insert guilt trip/bullying from my parents, now I feel like a total piece of shit but also feel like enough is enough.

      "description": "TLDR: My dad has hid his medical issues for years and I have to brow beat him for any info. Found out he has major skin cancer. He told mother not to tell me. I'm extremely upset and frustrated and haven't said anything.\n\nMy mother and father have been divorced since I was 13. It was a good thing. My little sister died a few years before due to an accident and they never could recover. But, my mom moved us to Michigan with her (whole other rant) and he stayed in Florida. \n\nMy father was always a happy going guy, but got hooked on opioids and ruined his life for a long time. He turned bitter and extremely sarcastic and moody. Eventually hurt me so bad I cut contact until I was 18. Now, we have a decent relationship and talk about once every two weeks. But he's still gruff and sarcastic, I just know how to roll with the punches better. He's constantly working and I'm planning a wedding and finding a new job. So we dont talk a ton. Mostly \"Hi, how are you?\" And ask about each other. \n\nA few years back I found out he was hiding his COPD from me (he left his medication on the bathroom sink on accident one time and I knew what it was), which my grandfather (his father) had recently died from. I tried to talk to him about it and he keeps everything really vague and changes the subject. I know why, and I dont know if I'd have the strength to tell my kids either. But he would rather ignore the illness than take the treatments correctly. Which is frustrating because my mom, who is a resperatory therapist, has taught him how over and over again every Christmas he comes up. This year, he looked worse than ever... and had a huge bandaid on his face. He said he got cut at work and I let it go. Today, however, I found out he has skin cancer. My mom accidentally flashed the message to me rather than a picture she thought she was showing me. She starts profusely apologizing and saying I wasn't supposed to know and that I can't say anything.\n\nI'm incredibly and selfishly hurt. He's dying. The treatments for his cancer aren't working and he's keeping it pretty vague with her too when she came clean after the discovery. He says he wants to make it to my wedding May 2020 and he can't die before then... I want to help so bad. Fly down and live with him to make sure he's taking his medication, make sure he's going to all his treatments, make sure he's eating... he taught me how to walk for fucks sake... but I know if he knows I found out, he'd be devistated and would retreat even further... I don't think he'd tell me about it on his own, as he never told me about the COPD that he apparently had for years... I'm terrified for him... I know I'm not his mom. But I love him and don't know what to do or how to handle it... \n\nI feel like an asshole because I just want to call him and yell... I'm mad at him and idk if its selfish and I feel like such an asshole... I haven't called, because I know he doesn't want me to know.",

      "description": "Hi there folks, be as brutal as you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I have dated for 2 years, 1 long distance and 1 physically together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground information on me, the potential asshole: I am obsessed with picking at bumps in my skin, if there's a zit I'd rather have a deep gash bleeding than any form of zit, pimple, acne, or those little white dots that appear on your skin. I frequently scratch myself until bleeding with my hairline usually taking the worst of it. None of this hurts when I do it as I've been doing this my whole life, I used to pick my hairs as well but I only do that for my armpits now. Long story short, if there's a bump in the skin it's gotta go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started dating a guy who has some problems with acne. It's not cystic, nor does it flare terribly, but he constantly every single day grows around 20+ individual pimples on his body. They are almost always on his back, along his neck and collarbone and face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was reluctant to let me pop them in his past, but let me do so freely when we were long distance. When we moved in together he became more and more reluctant to let me do it until he started denying me flat out. I used a sterile needle and applied a lotion to help heal the small holes most of the time, I always washed my hands and kept things clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I won't lie and say that I was totally fine with him saying no. I do know that it is his body and his choices, but for whatever reason I get anxious and stressed about acne specifically. I take care of mine, but if he walks around with a big juicy one I feel unrest in my body, both from disgust and also from a desire to get rid of it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe came to a sort of truce where I'd ask if I could pop it and he'd decide if he'd let me or not in the moment, but I will feel so incredibly stressed, anxious and grossed out if he walks around with unpopped acne so I told him that I'd like it if he could at least do it himself. He told me that this was not something he wanted to do and I should just let his body take care of it naturally, but he gets acne every single day anyway so unless it gets popped its constantly there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't discussed skin-care products yet because:  \n1. I am not knowledgeable enough on the field at all.  \n2. I firmly believe that by using a sterile needle, hot water, cold water and being gentle with the hole you make doesn't leave scars as it hasn't left any noticeable ones for me (of course I can be wrong, I just haven't seen anything to prove it wrong).\n\n3. He worries about money a lot due to a credit card debt on his side and would likely feel emasculated if I bought it for him (likely, not guaranteed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely feel like an asshole, but I also feel uncomfortable and don't know how to proceed because I am not sure if I can feel completely relaxed unless I get to indulge in this popping obsession or if he starts using some sort of skin care to prevent acne outbreaks.",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. \n\nSo here's a little background into my family.\n\nI moved to America with my two siblings and mom when I was 4 and my dad stayed in Asia because he had a business there. \n\nHe provided money for our family up until I turned 16, when his business started doing poorly which forced my mother to stop being a full-time mom and she began to work full time.\n\nBefore, he would fly and visit us every half a year, but as he became more financially unstable, he would visit less frequently, and the last time he's come and visit us was about three years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo four years ago, my dad asked me to loan him $5,000 which I lent him and I've never seen the money again. And then about a month ago, he asked me to loan him $2,000 again, and he told me he would return it back to me two weeks which I once again said yes to and have not seen the money again.\n\nThen two days ago he asked me for another $1,000 and I really don't want to give him any more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 22 year old full time musician, I make enough money for myself but I am quite frugal because I'd like to save up so I can buy a house in the future. My dad is now in his 60's and I really want to help him, but I don't want to give him anymore money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to give him money?

      "description": "**Introduction:** In 2011-2013 I was a member of a fairly large Minecraft server. Me and many others made a lot of good memories in our time there. Eventually the owner had to shut down the server. The owner was never popular among the players as he was rarely online and the volunteer moderators pretty much ran the show. The owner also had set up a webpage and forum for the server on Enjin.com, a social media platform intended for WoW guilds, Minecraft servers, gaming communities etc. The Enjin page for this particular Minecraft server had about 1500 members, including many friends that I haven't spoken to in years.\n\nFast forward to recently. The owner hasn't used his Minecraft or Enjin accounts in five years. A few friends and I, who met on this server in 2012, have a Discord group dedicated to bringing together the old playerbase and giving us a new place to talk.\n\n**This is where the drama starts.** One of the guys in the Discord has some experience in hacking and suggested that we try to access the owner's Enjin account. With admin account access, we could post the link to the Discord on the site homepage and send an announcement to all site members, giving them an email notification. This way we'd get many old friends to join our group. We figured the owner wouldn't even notice his account and his website were taken (liberated) from him, as the guy had been totally MIA for years and didn't respond to our messages, so we figured he just didn't care about his old server anymore.\n\nSo we go for it. My friend does most of the work, since he knows what to do, but I help him every step of the way. We try to uncover information about the owner: if we find an email, we can search it in a giant database of leaked info from website breaches and see the associated passwords. After one or two hours of trying, we find a password that works. We log in to the account. We add an update to the homepage, and send the mass message. We change the owner's account email and password.\n\nThe next day, the owner joins our Discord group and sends me a DM. He tells me he knows I was involved and demands his account back. He says he's uncomfortable that we were able to learn so much of his personal information, which included his real name and his email login. I didn't want to comply, I wanted to keep the account, so I lie. I claim I didn't participate in the hacking, I don't have access to his account, but I know who did it and I encouraged it to happen, so I'll talk to this unnamed person and ask him to give up the account details. I immediately forward the owner's messages to my friend. He thinks we should give the account back. He contacts the owner by himself and tells him the changed login info. The owner then logs in, deletes \"his\" post on the homepage, and deletes his account. I feel bad about what I did, mostly about not giving the account back when asked to. However, the owner was being stubborn for years and I just wanted to reunite the community.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.",

      "description": "Background: So many of you guys here are probably familiar with girl/guy code (which I’ll just call GC from now on). In case you aren’t  aware GC is the agreement between friends that if a friend has dated someone that someone is off limits. My group of friends decided one day that not only past relationships are covered by GC but also past major crushes. Me and another friend of mind have started calling it “fake girl code” (or FGC) since we both don’t necessarily agree with it. \n\nNow, my friend (I’ll call her A) had had an on and off crush on my other friend (I’ll call him B) for around two years and never had a romantic relationship with him. Just a few months ago she finally called it quits and claims to be completely over him. She has even rejected him multiple times since then. Recently B and I have been getting closer and ended up catching feelings for each other. Our only issue... FGC.   I was hoping to have a civil discussion with A about it to see if she would be comfortable with it, but history suggests that if I even mention having feelings for B she would cut me off immediately and take ALL of my friends with her. For the time being B and I have both agreed not to act on any feelings. \n\nWhere I am stuck is if I am in the wrong. On one hand I’ve always been a total believer that no guy is worth losing a friend. But on the other hand A has been a really bad friend lately (purposely not inviting me to things, blowing up on me the second i say something mildly wrong, etc.) and B makes me really happy. \n\nSo here’s where the question lies... am I the Asshole for wanting to have a relationship with B? \n\nTL;DR: AITA for wanting to date my friends ex-crush (never dated) ",

      "description": "Girlfriend and I had our daughter last August.  I did everything I could to make pregnancy easier for her even agreeing to some completely ridiculous requests such as sleeping on the couch and only using the bathroom on whichever floor she wasn’t on.  I was happy to try to make it even a little easier on her. \n\nAfter she gave birth I kept at it, giving 110%.  My schedule is basically get up, go to work, come home, then immediately take over on baby duty.   My girlfriend doesn’t work and for the foreseeable future has no intention of returning to work.  My job is one where I’m on my feet all day, lifting and moving things.  I’m worn out by the end of the day. \n\nI’ve tried bringing up just having an hour to put my feet up and recover when I get home and my girlfriend acted I was asking for a kidney or something.  Huge overreaction and bitching about all that she does.  I get it, she’s working too during the day, but come on there’s a slight difference between taking care of a baby and lifting and moving shit around for +8 hours a day.  She also said that my drive home should be all the rest I need and she doesn’t even get that.  I’m fairly certain the baby isn’t awake for the whole day and it’s definitely not like she’s cleaning here or anything.  That shit also falls on me for some reason. \n\nI don’t feel like an hour after to work is too much to ask. My girlfriend obviously disagrees.  I’d never tell this, but honestly I just think she got used to me kissing her ass and doing everything for her and it’s just become the new normal.  I’m not ok with it anymore. ",

      "description": "I’m not really one for nights out, so when my boyfriend invited me to a night out with his friends in a big city I’m not used to I was anxious. I talked to him about my concerns and he assured me that he would look out for me and make sure I was ok. \n\nThe night started great until we got to a huge night club, I am literally shorter than 5 foot, so being in a club like that means I spend my time getting shoved, elbowed and trodden on. I totally agree when my boyfriend said I looked miserable. I was feeling awful. I tried to make an effort to dance and have fun but my face probably let me down. \n\nI decided to go to the toilet, (this is important: we were in the basement) the only sign for toilets I had seen was upstairs. So I went upstairs and queued for ages for the bathroom. Then I walked back, as I was walking I noticed the upstairs bar didn’t have a queue so I decided to get a drink. While I was getting my drink he text and asked where I was. I told him I was getting a drink and would be back soon. \n\nThe guy stood next to me at the bar bashed into me and half my drink spilled over me. I decided to find some space to finish my drinks before going downstairs again (there was actually a queue to go downstairs) I end up standing at the entrance.\n\nBut somehow with it being busy, I end up on the wrong side of the rope. The bouncer won’t let me back in. \n\nBoy friend texts again and I say I am outside and can’t get in, he starts getting mad asking why am I outside. \n\nI talk to the bouncer and manage to get back inside.\n\nI go downstairs and my boyfriend is furious, shouting and swearing at me because he’s embarrassed that all his friends were asking where I was. And apparently I shouldn’t have even gone upstairs because their were toilets down stairs.\n\nI walked away from his shouting and swearing. I went back upstairs and text him to come up and talk. So we weren’t in front of his friends. He refused. I asked if he wanted me to leave and he said do what I want, I’ve made my bed and should lay in it.\n\nI went to try and get my coat but couldn’t because someone else had the cloak room ticket. \n\nI told him I was leaving and he told me to fuck off and I was being dramatic and embarrassing him and being selfish and manipulative.\n\nSo I left. I walked out into the city with no coat. No where to stay. No trains until tomorrow. I went and found a hotel, paid a ridiculous amount. \n\nI messaged his friend and said I was safe and apologised for the drama. I asked her to look after him. \n\nHe called me a while after asking where I was so I told him.\n\nHe’s furious, shouting swearing about how embarrassing I am, how selfish and miserable and manipulative I am. He says there is no way back from this and we are over.\n\nI am really struggling to see this from his point of view ? \n\nAm I the ass hole? I need advice. ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to replace my broken Rock Band drums with a new set?",
      "description": "I have Rock Band Drums for my Wii. Don't play as much these days, but I want to on my Twitch guitar stream. I tried, it was fun, my viewers liked it. \n\nThey are like new. When I wasn't using it, I put it back in the original box. I cut mouse pads into toppers. There is almost no wear on them.\n\nI loaned it to my COUSIN so her two girls (16 and 12) can play with it. They are good careful kids.\n\nCOUSIN's friend (the MOM) visited her with her two boys (4 and 7). Boys went upstairs to play, COUSIN hears \"Omg! Get duct tape!!!\" The MOM runs upstairs, says it was the drum set but she was able to duct tape it. Later COUSIN goes upstairs and sees:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/J6icT15\n\nThe kid must have been standing or jumping on it. Kids are all lying about what happened. No one saw anything. Duct tape didn't hold long enough for my COUSIN to go look at it (and now it's all sticky with duct tape).\n\nCOUSIN was annoyed MOM was casual about it. MOM not mad at the kid, just let him keep playing, and is like \"it still works, and there is eBay.\" It looks like a toy, but it's a $300 drum set. If it was an iPad she wouldn't be talking about duct tape and eBay, we would be at the Apple store.\n\nI told them I would take it home and try to fix it. It is not fixable. I can get a new set for $300 on Amazon. Used sets are available from $100 to $200, but not all complete with the dongles and all that. And I just don't want a used set. \n\nMeanwhile, MOM is now sending texts to my COUSIN with pics of $20 Guitar Hero Xbox drums on Craig's List and Ebay (wrong drums, wrong platform, and the pic looked like it was in terrible condition). I have hundreds of songs on my Wii for Rock Band 2-3. I finally sent a text to COUSIN saying \"Please don't let MOM buy some random thing on eBay. I will find a replacement.\"\n\nSo now I think I have the following options. I am leaning heavily towards Option B. But I feel like I am being the asshole. My main concern is putting my COUSIN in the middle, since my COUSIN is so good to me and I love her so much. My question is AITA for wanting to go with Option B.\n\n* **Option A:** I could simply demand the MOM pay the full $300. She broke it and I want a new one.\n* **Option B:** I could buy myself a new one for $300 and ask that the MOM pay half and give her the broken one to try and fix and sell herself. Mine was \"like new\" but it wasn't actually new. Maybe I'm not entitled to a new one without chipping in. This is where I am leaning.\n* **Option C:** I could buy myself a new one and just not say anything and be done with it.\n* **Option D:** I could buy a used one and be unhappy about it, but maybe get the MOM to pay the full cost.\n* **Option E:** I could borrow my friend's drums that she doesn't use much and hope she doesn't ever ask me to return them.\n* **Option F:** I could not play drums anymore.\n\n**TLDR:** Loaned Rock Band drums to COUSIN. COUSIN's friend's kids broke the drums. I kept them \"like new\". AITA for wanting to replace them with a new set. ",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my husband quitting his job… while I’m pregnant?",
      "description": "We’ve been together for 4 years and met while he (34M) and I (30F) were studying. We got married a few months ago and I recently found out I was pregnant. He is a nice, wonderful man and loves me and my crazy self. Now, husband only recently got his BSc degree in computer science and, while he immediately found a job, it is one he claims to dislike. His main issue is that the startup company he works at doesn’t fix coding problems, but only patches them (forgive my misuse of terminology) and expect a large amount of work for little pay. \n\nI have told him that as you are recently employed, with 0 experience in your field, you are going to have to suck it up and get experience before you can get a job of your dreams. Is this bitchy of me? Yes. But this is how it works in my field (you need a PhD to get a good job) and this is how I was raised: you think about the long-term goal and do what it takes to get you there. \n\nHowever, I also told him that he should apply for other positions, while still employed at this job. His excuses to not do so were a. We were going on a 1-month holiday to get married and he couldn’t do that to his new employer, b. He gets home too tired after work from a 45-minute commute, c. He needs to work on his portfolio. A and C were fair enough points, in my opinion. \n\nOkay. Fine. We get married and we come back. In the meantime I got pregnant! On Friday he goes to talk to his boss to ask for a raise, bossman says that he can’t do that because the startup company is not earning that much money yet and besides, “Are you even interested in this work?” So bossman encourages him to find a new job and quit. Supposedly bossman will pay him 2 months salary anyways. Husband comes home excited and I tell him we cannot do this because I am 14 weeks pregnant. And not only that, I have very early on been diagnosed with gestational diabetes (family history) and had just had to have CVS on short notice (where they shove a long needle in your abdomen to take a chunk of the placenta for genetic screening). Additionally, I am also at risk for pre-eclampsia - also due to family history. So, a healthy, stress-resistant pregnancy this is not. \n\nHe listened to my worries that no one would employ him if they knew he would need to take paternity leave (we’re in Scandinavia) for 6-7 months and that if he only had two months to find a job, he would probably end up in the same situation i.e. getting a job for the sake of getting one and not because he likes it. We came to the following solutions: 1. He would apply for jobs while still working at his current one, and if something would come through then great. 2. If not, he would apply while he was on paternity leave. \n\nSo, today he was supposed to talk to his boss. I quickly message him, asking how it went and he said “Don’t get mad. But I’m going to quit.” Despite everything we discussed. Despite my worries and (in my opinion, valid, concerns). He then complains that I don’t support him. I told him that to me, support meant keeping his current job while looking for a new one. For the (financial) sake of our family. In my anger, I said that I was disgusted that he did this, despite everything we discussed. He in turn said that I should stop talking and that he, in turn, is disgusted with the way I reacted to his news. My heart is racing right now. I am in complete shock at the turn in events and I am completely not sure about what to do. \n\nIs he right? Am I supposed to support this decision? Am I being irrational? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Husband quits job, despite us discussing other options while I’m pregnant. \n",

At this street market, vendors will come up to you very often if they see you have no food... probably every 2 or 3 minutes especially because we came well before dinner rush and their weren’t many other people for them to bother.\n\nAt first I was very nice in declining their solicitations to buy food, but they don’t take no for an answer and because their English isn’t very good, you need to often say no to them 3 or 4 times for them to go away.\n\nWe were waiting for my cousin to show up from work which took a while, and as a result, had to fend off a lot of street vendors - we cracked some beers while we waited.\n\nAfter getting tired of the vendors after probably the 10th time, as soon as they opened their mouth I would talk over them and say “No thank you no thank you no thank you” until they went away. \n\nThey were not being respectful of us just trying to enjoy a few beers (and already having said no), so I wanted respond in a way to get them to leave us alone as soon as possible.\n\nMy girlfriend thought my behavior was rude and that I should have continued to respond to them respectfully - AITA?

      "description": "A bit of context, I'm a 19 year old student at uni in England and this pub crawl happened over the Christmas period. I'm only asking now because I've been wondering what the etiquette for this is, but essentially here is what happened:\n\nI was invited by the Computing Society, who I'm a part of, to take part in a pub crawl which would be taking place around the local area starting from one pub and then heading, at the very least as they stated, to two or more afterwards.\n\nThere was supposed to be around 20 or so people going to on the crawl but in the end there was four of us, two of whom were on the society itself and another girl who I'd walked up with on my course. It was two for Tuesday's at the first pub and ended up going through 4 pints, so had committed to this being a big night out whereas the others were about one or two drinks in.\n\nAs we left for the second pub, it began to snow slightly and the society members suggested abandoning the crawl to go and get hot chocolate somewhere. At this point I was fairly annoyed because we'd not even really given the crawl a chance, so I decided to give my mate a call and see if he'd come along as he's always good fun down pub and I knew he'd fancy a night out.\n\nWhen I got back to the group, they had decided we'd be going to the next pub then back to campus afterwards. I told them my mate would be coming to join, and they seemed tentative about it but said it would be alright. When he turned up at the pub, him and I ended up getting into the drinking again and we were having more of a laugh but retrospectively I feel like it was maybe unfair of me to bring my mate along as we turned the mood away from Computing Society on to our own stuff, and as we'd drunk much more than they had we were being far louder and taking up the table with our own conversation.\n\nThey left afterwards and my mate and I went to the next pub, but I couldn't help thinking next day it might have been stupid of me to interrupt what was planned. But I feel like, in a way, if they were changing their plans then I could change mine as well.\n\nTL;DR Plans for pub crawl changed a lot, brought my mate along to bring the mood up but we interrupted what was left of their crawl.

      "description": "Throwaway because I'm pretty sure anyone under 20 in my family is on reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy little sister moved out a few years ago the summer after high school graduation to live with her boyfriend. Because of the politics surrounding their relationship, our parents basically disowned her and refuse to speak to her. Growing up, she and I were always a little competitive with each other and people drew their comparisons over many things like \"who's more fun, who's prettier, smarter, more healthy, etc\" particularly her circle of friends, but we always maintained a fairly decent relationship and I might've even said she was my closest friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year after her and the boyfriend moved into a house together , she started asking me to come visit her and stay there. It being about a 4 hour drive, I kept putting it off. I was extremely stressed and financially strained, so focused on finding an apartment because the situation at home was SUPER toxic, that I could barely stomach spending any offtime traveling even if it was to see her. Another year goes by and we've settled into this routine where she visits home instead, staying on a friend's couch or with any other relative since she's not allowed back in the house. This is because she doesn't work or go to school , so she has more free time. I became comfortable with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell finally I got my own apartment and as soon as she talked about coming down to visit, I offered her to stay with me for about a week. Well, the entirety of our stay, she was like a different person. I hadn't spent any prolonged amount of time with her since she left home, but she's become a spoiled brat. She insulted my place at every given opportunity, and after she and I found a dead roach in the kitchen one night, she put me on blast and told all her friends and boyfriend's family that I live like a pig. She also will not lift a finger for anything, asks you to bring her glasses of water, asks you to plug in a floor fan when she's hot, asks you to bring her a plate of food. Literally imagine Squidward in that one episode of Spongebob slowly turning nastier and nastier. She hated my bed, hated every room, hated the temperature of the rooms, hated the complex' parking. When a friend came to meet us before heading out for dinner they actually complimented my unit and she scoffed and said \"Please. This is nothing. You should see MY HOUSE.\" And I just, my blood boiled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I've completely sworn off visiting her. I don't wanna see this stupid house that she kept comparing my living space to. I just can't see myself putting time aside to drive down there in between a full-time job and school, for a person who was completely unpleasant during her time with me and made me wish I was literally anywhere else. Every time she asks me if I'm ever gonna come see her and \"stop being a bad sibling\" I just kinda change the subject. I know her, and I know if I try to tell her why I'm not coming, she's going to get belligerent. She is incredibly stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone about anything, arguing with her is like arguing with a wall, so I've resigned myself to just staying quiet. But being she doesn't have our mom and dad anymore and it's now just me, I feel guilty. But I feel like the tension between us growing up has finally formed a head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "(Apologies in advance for a ju y formatting issues. I'm on mobile.)\n\nTL;DR: My dad committed suicide and we hadn't spoken recently at all. I hate him for this.\n\n\n\nA little background info:\n\nMy parents have been divorced since I was 15, I'm 25 now. He cheated on my mother while stationed in South America and married her a year or so after the divorce. He then had a couple children with her, a son and daughter, a little later on. This was obviously upsetting for me, but did not ruin my relationship with him. I still loved him dearly. We didn't talk or see each other much since he got sent to Japan for the majority of the past decade, but he would come back once a year or so and we would spend a couple days together. He retired from the Air Force in late 2017 and began work as a civilian contractor back in the states in February of 2018.\n\nI don't know why, but we still rarely talked. The last time I spoke to him was January of 2017. This is now my absolutely deepest regret. I wish so much that I tried to reach out and tell him that I loved him more often...\n\nI got a call at 4 am on a Monday morning from his wife telling me that he had shot and killed himself. So I drove over 20 hours to be with her, my very young half siblings, and my grandparents. While there, I learned that my dad and stepmother had gotten into an argument due to him drinking excessively, so he was drunk when he did it. Apparently he would drink quite a bit almost every single night. It escalated into a very heated screaming match. She said she was going to call the cops. Apparently he told her, \"If you call the cops, then it's all over\". She ended up locking herself in the bathroom (not to call them, just to calm down) and while she was in there, she heard a gunshot come from the living room. My dad had shot himself in the head with an AK-47. \n\nNow to get to the point. \n\nI recently expressed to my sister that as much as I love my father and am still absolutely devastated, heartbroken and confused. I also *hate* him for what he's done. This upset my sister, she called me an asshole and was disappointed that I could hate my dad for it.\n\nI know mostly everyone would obviously be incredibly sad about this situation, but no one has ever brought up that you could be furiously angry with your loved one for killing themselves.\n\nI love him very much, but i undeniably hate him right now for killing himself.\n\nAm I an asshole for thinking this way? Am I an asshole for bringing these feelings up to my sister?",

      "description": "So, a bit of a backstory here: this buddy of mine (for the purposes of this post, let's call him Red) has had a thing for a girl at his department (let's call her Purple), and while they are friends, she's made it clear she doesn't like him the same way (declined an invitation to a date before). She didn't let it affect how she treats or sees him, and he seemed to have been cool with it. I work at a different department within the same corporate structure, so I'm not too close with Purple, but do hang out with her and a few others when I chill with Red and he invites them along. \n\nRecently, another friend from their department got married, and surprisingly, she had invited me too. I figured it was simply due to my association with Red. On the day of the event, some of the bridesmaids had found me and abducted me to where the bride was. She explained that she invited me not because of Red, but because of Purple. Apparently she had a thing for me, and they asked me to ask her to dance during the party. I told them my unease due to the whole situation with Red and her. They tried to explain how Purple and Red were pretty cool with just being friends already (it had been months since she 'rejected' him), and they even tried playing the \"For the Bride\" card with me.\n\nIn the end, I told them I'd think about it, and escaped the room without saying anything committal. I was very much conflicted about it, but during the reception party, invited that Purple was sitting alone when most of her friends had gone dancing. Red had gone to try to ask her for a dance, but from what I saw, another girl had dragged him away, (I don't know if she replied to him or not) but he was on the dance floor with another girl. It was then that Purple caught my gaze, and in that spur of the moment, (out of a bit of awkwardness) I went up and asked her to dance. We spent most of the rest of the night chatting, and really getting to know each other, but I still felt conflicted about things. \n\nAt the end of the night, another friend of mine came to tell me Red had left the event early, and were wondering what I was doing dancing with Purple and stuff. I didn't wanna tell him about what the bride had asked me to do, so I just dodged the question. He told me not to be an AH to Red. Purple has also started to message me privately, which she's never done before, even when we had each other's contact info from way before. I feel very confused and conflicted. So please, AITA? ",

This is due to him having questions about the dnd server, and when I answer them he thinks I'm being rude. Here are some is a snippet from 5 hours worth of arguments over the last week.\n\n&gt;Him: The other mod is making more sense\n\n&gt;Me: why\n\n&gt;Him: because she explained to me its not a survival game and is a game with survival elements instead\n\n&gt;Other mod: you're splitting hairs now\n\n&gt;Me: but it IS a survival game\n\n&gt;Him: its not\n\n&gt;Other mod: why are you splitting hairs over this?\n\n&gt;Him: So I understand how to play the game properly. I just want to know how to play\n\n&gt;Me: the rules are pinned in the chats.\n\n&gt;Him: I don't need the why I need the how. The roleplay\n\n&gt;Me: pinned in creation chat\n\nAfter this he pms me and calls me rude and says he wants to change his dnd character. This will be the third time he's changed his character within the week, and we had been trying to be very accomadating of all his homebrew he wanted to use and make his characters work, so when he decided the game was not survival-y enough for his ranger to work at all ever I was very frustrated. He repeatedly tells me our game isn't what we say it is before he's even played 1 session. \n\nAnyway he demands an apology and I don't want to give him one since I don't feel like what I said warrants an apology. I had spent 5 hours of my time that day answering his questions and he never believed me when I said it is in fact a survival game. I cant post everything I said cuz character limit, but imagine this conversation for 5 hours. AITA? Was I being rude here? Do I need to apologize?

      "description": "On November 19, 2 friends and I went on a one day ski trip. It wasn’t too expensive, only $49 for the tickets and another $10 for food, as well as gas. This isn’t an incredibly large sum, but we are in high school and my two friends do not have jobs. I drove, and as such filled up my car with gas twice, which equated to $60 since my parents wanted a full tank of gas when we returned. I told my friends that gas would be around 20-25 dollars before the trip, and both of my friends agreed that they would pay me be back for gas after the trip, though one, we’ll call him Bob, told me ahead of time that he would pay me back for gas by December 1. I agreed, as it is much for fun to go on a ski trip with friends. My other friend, we’ll call him Jake, agreed to pay me back at the end of the trip when I dropped him back off at his house. We go skiing, have a good time, and I go to drop Jake off at his house, but he doesn’t have the gas money. I say oh well, just pay me by the end of the week. He agrees to that, and says sorry that he doesn’t have the money. The end of the week comes, and he still doesn’t have the money. Meanwhile, Bob has payed me back, far ahead of his December 1 due date. I am starting to get a little angry at Jake, so I ask him when he will have the money by. He says he will pay me back by Wednesday the 12th. I say ok, and do nag him a little bit reminding him to please pay me back. Wednesday the 12th comes around and low and behold, he doesn’t have the money. Now I am getting pretty angry about it and pretty much say what the hell, when will you be able to get the money to me. He says he will Venmo me as soon as he can and that he has $75 in his bank account. I text him on Friday after school, reminding him of the Venmo. He responds that he’s having issues with Venmo, and that he will pay me on Monday. Monday rolls around and he STILL does not have the money. He avoids me at school, so I text him when I get home, asking him what the hell. He says that he’s on the phone with Venmo getting the issue worked out (I know that this is bullshit, but don’t say anything), and that he WILL have the money tomorrow. I ask him how can I trust you when you’ve lied to me before. He goes on a rant about he’s been going through personal issues, and how this shouldn’t be a big deal cause I have a job that makes $11 an hour and how him lying to me makes him hate himself more, etc. I just say that is all irrelevant to the issue, and just please have the money tomorrow. That is where we are at as of 10 minutes ago. \nSo, Am I the Asshole? I get that it’s only $20 but I feel as though I have done him a favor by taking him skiing, and giving him this much time to pay it back. I really don’t care about our “friendship” anymore as that got pretty much burned due to other issues, and really just want my $20. My other friends say that I should just let it go, but I don’t want to give him a “free pass” for all of this bullshit. ",

      "title": "AITA For leaving my SO while she's grieving a friend?",
      "description": "To be frank, we do *not* have a healthy relationship, and I'm sick of it.\n\nWe've been on/off for maybe a year and a half now. I do carry some of the blame, but a majority of the issues are caused by her anxiety and depression. She gets extremely jealous at the slightest provocation and has gotten hostile in the past, to the point of screaming and accusing me of cheating (I never have). She needs constant reassurance that I think she's the best thing in the world otherwise she spirals into crises where she may or may not resort to self-harm. Through this, she's been advancing her feelings way faster than I'm comfortable and expresses disinterest in me when I can't match it. \n\nLargely, I've been staying because of physical attraction, good interpersonal chemistry, and the fact that she does show a huge amount of dedication towards me when her issues aren't making things difficult. We've gotten into a cycle of helping each other through various financial/emotional crises, which happen often enough when you're in your early 20s and fresh out of college. I've just grown tired of the dysfunction. I'm not happy anymore.\n\nAnyway, the latest crisis that happened was the passing of one of her friends due to cancer. I was planning on breaking up with her yesterday before she got the call. Instead, I went to her place to console her as best as I could given my emotional checking-out. She eventually inferred that something was off about me and dragged it out of me that I was unhappy with our relationship. I didn't want to have this conversation while she was mourning her friend, but she forced it despite my protests. She demanded that I stay overnight in her bed, and I refused. I explained that, although I had forgiven her for many things, I couldn't invest further in our relationship and staying over would put me in a position I didn't want to be in. Given her emotional state, I was careful not to blame her for anything, only using \"I\" phrases and such. Nonetheless, she got angry and demanded I leave instead. On my way out she told me she was tired of being mistreated and accused me of gaslighting her. I'm back home right now and am thinking of just not going back.\n\n**For her side of the story:** she's had a traumatic upbringing, and has suffered emotional/physical abuse in her past relationships. She's had to learn from the ground up how a healthy relationship is supposed to work, with most of the trial-and-error happening with me. Lately, she's put in a lot more effort after I told her I was at the end of my rope following a particularly bad incident. My decision to want out of this relationship isn't following any huge fight, so I can see where she might feel blindsided, especially given that she's been \"improving\" as of recent. I don't know how close she was to this friend, so her emotional state might have instigated some behavior that would not have happened otherwise. I'm always careful not to hold things over her head, especially if I've told her it was forgiven, but past events do sometimes get brought up, which I guess she might have interpreted as me trying to gaslight her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBottom line: I was pretty solidly done with this relationship before, the way things went last night have only solidified that further. I would have still offered to be there for her to grieve, but the accusation of gaslighting is very serious to me. It's disrespectful and shows a complete distrust of my motives. I didn't get a chance to end things \"properly\", but now I'm considering just leaving things as they are and not looking back. Does that make me an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I’ll keep it short but about a month ago my wife’s mother said a great way to make a little extra is by opening our apartment to a friend of hers (who i later found out it was a friend of a friend). I myself am not 100% sold on this idea but my wife begrudgingly convinces me and last Sunday we got a roommate. A 60ish African dude (my wife and her family are from Africa and therefore know more Africans). When I first met him I thought he smelled kind of funky; couldn’t place the smell but brushed it off. That Sunday evening I come home and see him play the back smoking weed. This is a new fly zone for me as I have asthma and we also have a young 2 year old girl. So I tell my wife my wife tells her mum and her mum asks the friend if this guy smokes weed. He does. We then come to the agreement that he needs to go by the end of the month as this isn’t a good move. \nFast forward to Wednesday night after having to leave my child over her grandmothers for two nights in a row because the strong smell of weed fills the apartment. So Wednesday comes and all is well; I got to bed and my wife shortly follows and says he flashed me. I didn’t understand at first and asked her what happened. \nShe stated that he came out from his room in a red robe said hello and let go of the robe to expose my wife, walk to the kitchen get some food and go back to his room. My wife in shock turns her head and comes to bed. \nOnce I understand I am livid and knock on his door. He comes out somewhat dazed and confused with a ginormous comforter on him covering himself. I tell him he has to leave by Saturday. He brought weed into the house where an asthmatic and a child are and to top it off exposed himself to my wife. He tries to explain himself but I cut him off saying ‘that’s little kid shit bro I don’t care what you have to say. \nI tell him Saturday he needs to give me the key and get out I don’t care where he goes what he does but he needs to get out\n\nAm I the asshole for being this harsh?",

      "description": "Hey there! So this is my first post here, sorry if this is dumb or something, this is also kind of a half vent. I'm just feeling guilty right now and need the opinions of others who like...don't know me I guess.\n\nI'm a part of a program at my high school called Police Cadets. Basically it's a law enforcement program that was run by my advisor, who was subsequently my forensics teacher. We'd learn how to do police things and all that, such as how to deal with shoplifters, traffic stops, etc.\n\nWe were planning for regional competition about a couple of weeks ago. 8 of us were going, 5 of us for the CSI portion, and 3 of us for the Law Enforcement part. I was doing Law Enforcement, as well as two other people, a freshman we'll call A and a senior we'll call J. \n\nThree days ago, our advisor resigned from being a teacher due to personal issues. It was a detriment to all of us. Forensics would no longer have a good experienced teacher, and the fate of Police Cadets was super uncertain. We were all worried about what would happen to the club, and as a command officer (I'm a Sgt) I was in charge of trying to piece everything back together, as well as my captains, who will be G and L. \n\nCompetition was up in the air. Nobody could drive us, and the only teacher that could, can only fit 4 of us in her van. We had to split the group. We decided since CSI was our group scenario team, we'd pick three of them, and since Law Enforcement was an individual scenario, we would chose one person. \n\nSelf-transportation isn't an option since its a school event and the school would be liable for anything that happened. A was handed a permission slip as well as the group of freshmen (besides G. The freshman are M and S.)\n\nI was a bit nervous about the people chosen. The teacher who chose them was not a part of Police Cadets and basically only went off who was on the list (which half of the people on said list had been fired basically, the new people like me were supposed to replace them.) \n\nM, S, and A are all freshman. They are very new to the Cadet program and are not very well trained. M is not even technically a part of Police Cadets, and was only there so our advisor could fill spots because we thought we were all going. M and S were for the CSI team, as well as G, who was very adamant about not wanting to go with that group. M and S have been in the program for only about a week, S usually not even attending meetings either way.\n\nL's group was much more experienced, three years under each of their belts, and they are all incredibly hard workers. They processed two crime scenes within 2 hours for practice. We really wanted them to go and it was their last year at the school.\n\nA is probably the least worthy candidate to represent the Law Enforcement side of Police Cadets. J left the program (we would have chosen him, as he's a much higher rank than me) so he was not an option. A is one of my closer friends. She's in my Forensics class and is on my team in said class. She's rude, abrasive, loud mouthed, makes a lot of racist jokes, and is not very composed. She curses a lot in uniform and does not make very educated decisions 80% of the time. Not the demenor the competition requires an officer to have. She's young, a freshman, and a lower rank than me, being a private. \n\nShe will not leave our advisor alone either. Even since she left, she continuously emails her. We've asked her to leave her alone since she's going through a lot and she just refuses. She does not respect command staff, insulting us to our face and behind our backs. She believes she is better than us and more worthy of leadership despite how irresponsible and rude she is. She's not a leader, she is a tyrant.\n\nI've been there the same amount of time in, however I'm a junior, an officer, and have earned the trust of my advisor to be given a high rank so quickly. I work hard, and have a passion for law enforcement, since it's my dream career. I'm collected, have good command presence, and know how to make logical decisions even when under pressure. This is my last year as a school police cadet before I go and join the police department Cadets. \n\nAfter talking with my captains (higher ranks than me, so I wanted their advice) and all 3 of us agreed, even later getting agreement from L's group. The line up would be L's group for CSI and me to represent Law Enforcement. I was, however tasked with breaking the news to the freshmen. \n\nFirst, I talked to M and S. \n\nMe: Hey, so this isn't anything personal, but the command staff have decided we want the more experienced team to play for competition.\n\nS: *nods her head and gives a gentle, calm okay.*\n\nM: *suddenly raises her voice* No. I disagree. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, but since this is our last year we want to-\n\nM: That's not fair, I was specifically asked to be here for competition.\n\nMe: We didn't know we would have to pick and choose who was going. L's group has been waiting for competition and have been here longer than you.\n\nM: *unnecessarily dramatic* Fine then, fuck you, I don't need you then. I'm going home! *grabs her bag then pushes me away from her so she can leave. She stuck around anyways for some reason.*\n\nAt this point I was already on the verge of tears. On top of our advisor leaving, I had no clue what was going to happen to the program and was already stressed out. Being yelled at was not fun. I tried to stay professional though, and called A over.\n\nMe: Hey, so this entirely up to you since you're the one with the permission slip. I won't get mad if you say no, but...Could I go to competition instead?\n\nA: *silently staring at me*\n\nM: I'm a higher rank and have a bit more experience than you. This'll also be my last year and I wanted this to be what I leave on. \n\nA: I'm the only one doing what Ms. S wants us to do!\n\nMe: That's...not what I'm talking about. I'm just asking you a yes or no question, something you are more than welcome to deny. \n\nEveryone was sorta crowding around us now. \n\nG: We really don't think you're a good fit to represent us and you're also a bit...unproffesional? \n\nA: I'm doing what Ms. S told me to!\n\nG: Ms. S is not a part of this program now. You have to listen to me, L, and Dave (which is me by the way). We're the command staff. You also need to leave Ms. S alone, she's going through a lot and doesn't need any of us bothering her.\n\nA: Ms. S wants us to continue Police Cadets.\n\nMe: Nobody but you does.\n\nThe rest of us were either quitting or seniors who couldn't continue the program either way.\n\nMe: I'll ask you again. Can I go in your place?\n\nA: Do whatever. *she shoves the permission slip in my hand.* Nobody ever appreciates me! *stomps off and goes to grab her bag* I'm going home.\n\nMe: Okay, I think we should all go home as well, it's just about time to leave...\n\nA begins to scream at me when I enter the briefing room to grab my things. L stops us and intervenes. I just decide to go home.\n\nI still kinda feel like an asshole for doing that... I really wanted to go, and I feel selfish, but on the other hand, nobody else wanted either of the three to go? I want a freshman to experience a competition, but I just didn't think any of the freshmen would be good representatives of our program.\n\nSorry this was so all over the place, the story just kinda needed a lot of context. Thank you.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This all took place around finals season last year. We were both young little shits, and fought a lot. I had definitely felt less attraction towards her leading up to this, but she was infatuated with me. \nI had been pretty lenient with her leading up to this. She had admitted to having a crush on my best friend at one point, but I put up with it. The title basically says it all. It was the Monday of finals week, and I was heading overseas on Wednesday for around a month. She asked me for help with her studying, and we got into an argument over something stupid. I was fed up and straight up told her to “screw off and date someone else” and then proceeded to hang up. I was looking forward to leaving on my trip, and didn’t want her to make me feel all shitty before I left. We had been dating for nine months, and this was in high school. I’ve been kinda conflicted as of late, because I feel like a bit of a dick to screw her over before finals, but she was being a royal pain. AITA?  \nTLDR: Dump gf of 9 months over something stupid before final",

She wants to go for 3 days Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. I work m-f and have recently been missing a lot days of work due to the rain here in Southern California so I don’t wanna go and miss a day of work, that’s reason 1. I also don’t want to go because I can’t afford to go out right now since I am recovering funds in my savings account from all the rain reason number 2.  I was honest with her in telling her why I don’t want to join her. Now she is getting upset because the few friends that were invited don’t want to go for reasons I don’t know. She is definitely one of my best friends but I honestly feel like I just can’t right now. I over heard her sister calling us assholes for not going. So what do you guys think?",

      "description": "This problem has been plaguing me for months. I would really appreciate some feedback on my role in the situation as I am feeling deeply confused and sad. Sorry it's kind of long- I had to add a lot of details so the context could make sense. There is a TLDR at the bottom but it doesn't capture the nuance.\n\n**Background**\n\nMy (F 30) best (?) friend, June (F 31), and I have been great friends for about 11 or 12 years. She got engaged to her boyfriend in late-2016 and everything was going great until she started getting cold feet in mid-2017. Once that started, she became very distant to her friends, would bail on our plans, wouldn't reply to messages, etc. My husband, Chad, and I have been married since 2015. My husband has this friend from high school- let's call him Zach. Chad and Zach were the best of friends during and in the years after high school and then kind of fell off of communicating after about 2007 when they moved to different states. We aren't close with June's bf/fiancé at all. He's a fine person, but not part of our regular group of friends. \n\nWhile June is getting cold feet, she strikes up a friendship with Zach that grows into an affair. During that time Chad and I reconnected with Zach and we all got really close. We have a ton of common interests and he's a great, attentive friend. Zach was really into June- he has genuine feelings for her and it seemed like June reciprocated. I thought they were going to get together for awhile. Long story short- June decides to break it off with Zach in early-2018 and go through with getting married to her fiancé about 8 months later. (btw: her fiancé knew all about it and they worked through it on their own and they seem happy now.) But Chad and I keep hanging out with Zach. June comes back to her friends but she's still kind of distant. I can tell that she doesn't like me hanging out with Zach but him and my husband are best friends- I can't avoid him so she seems to accept that. She doesn't ever directly confront me about this, by the way. She's pretty passive about these messages that I've inferred. \n\n**Current events #1**\n\nZach was also high school friends with some of mine and June's other friends and since he reconnected with us, they've gotten to be friends again, too. Right before the wedding in summer 2018- Zach and some of these other friends decided they wanted to party and catch up. We all decide to meet at mine and Chad's house because it's convenient and a fun space for a party. Obviously we didn't invite June- not that we were hiding it from her, we just didn't think it was necessary to run it by her. Well, she found out and confronted us. She got drunk and texted me a lot of hurtful things that night. I didn't respond at all and she apologized the next morning saying that she was too drunk and didn't mean it. She was mostly mad at me- not so much anyone else. We kind of talked it out but more so swept it under the rug and moved on. Things got better- I thought we were all in a good place again. My group of girlfriends were back to seeing each other regularly (June not so much, she's still kind of in and out but she's not as distant as before). We all manage to have a really fun time when we're together. \n\n**Current events #2**\n\nLast weekend Zach invited me, Chad, and two of June's other friends to a concert and we all went. It was a really good time! But then June found out the next day and again got drunk and texted a bunch of confrontational messages to all of us. (Again, not trying to hide anything from her.) Some things she mentioned in the messages-- he was manipulative, he continues to be manipulative, he tried to ruin her relationship, he is trying to ruin her life. Now she isn't speaking to any of us. I texted her once asking to explain what she meant and to please talk to me. No word back yet- it's been about a day. \n\n**Am I the asshole?**\n\nJune seems to think so but I don't understand where she's coming from. I think she is being more of an asshole than anyone in this horrible situation. I don't expect her to *like* me or anyone else hanging out with Zach but I feel like she is 1) avoiding any personal responsibility she has in the situation, placing all of the onus on Zach, and 2) is being unreasonable by expecting me to drop Zach out of loyalty to her when she has been a fair-weather friend for the past couple of years. \n\nI've tried to keep this as objective as possible. If anyone wants additional info, just ask! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: friend cheated on her fiancé with another person who was accepted into the friend group during the cheating, expects everyone else to ostracize him since reconciling with her fiancé.

Near the end of everyone’s presentations the last person to go was this girl (who I have absolutely no problems with) that I think is trans or really strong LGBQ rights activist kinda person. \n\n  Her hero was actually quite cool, it was like the first openly trans black woman and how she started riots and fought for rights to be given to the LGBT community which is really badass. But then when she got to like the finale of it she started talking about her struggles and how she had been arrested numerous times and that she needed to have “survival sex” to live or maybe she meant prostitution? Either way I wasn’t really sure what she meant but I grinned at the word, I thought of like 2 people battling to the death in the sex situation and one of them surviving. She finished it up by saying that she didn’t understand why some of us were laughing ( a couple other people in the class thought survival sex was weird too ).\n\n  She then sat down asked me if I thought what she said was funny, and I was kinda stunned so I like said no right away, and then the class kinda got on her for being rude and yelling at me. She apologized and said she was really defensive about all of this stuff. \n\nI just wanna know if I was an asshole because by no means was I like laughing out loud l, but I grinned and maybe blew air hard out of my nose? I feel really bad about this and I feel like she thinks I hate LGBT people or something. \n\nThank you ",

      "description": "I am putting together a D&amp;D campaign where I going to be a first-time DM and more people have expressed interest than I am able to accommodate. I'm trying to keep it to 4 players but I could do 5, and there are two interested people whose schedules fit with the rest of the group: a coworker who has played D&amp;D with before, and someone from my meetup groups who hasn't played before.\n\nThe coworker really, *really* wants to join the campaign and has told me stuff like that she's already rolled a character and come up with a great backstory even though I've told her that I'm not sure if there is space for her yet. I wish there was some other legitimate reason I could not extend the invitation, but in actuality it all comes down to her nails.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to call it a phobia, but I have an extreme aversion/fear of any kind of damage or abnormality in fingernails. A friend made a comment about a certain type of injury and I literally couldn't get it out of my head for two days. Even typing this post is making me anxious. This coworker happens to have severe damage in that area and doesn't cover it at all. I don't see her much at work because our desks face away from each other but whenever I see her hands I feel queasy and it really gets to me. Currently I can't afford to go to therapy to address whatever this issue I have is.\n\nIt seems like a shallow reason to not invite someone because she is a really nice person and I know she would be a great player and it really just comes down to an aspect of her appearance, but I just don't know if I could stomach having her hands in full view for 3 hours a week. AITA if I don't extend the invitation? Am I off the hook since I told her from the start that I was just gauging interest and couldn't guaranty anyone a slot?",

      "description": "The title is fairly self explanatory. My (29M) fiancee (28F) is graduating from a history master's program soon. Her plan had always been to go on for a PhD afterward, which sounded great to me, I just want her to enjoy what she does. After finishing the masters though she feels like years more school will run her into the ground and might be too much misery for too little reward.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI have always paid for everything while she has been in school. We have a household checking account that I keep full that is used for groceries/gas/mortgage/doctor visits and things like that. The only thing she ever spends her money on is clothing or things like that if she is shopping and I'm not with her... I have been and am fine with this arrangement. She works ridiculously hard in school and I dont want her to have to work to pay bills too. She gets paid enough of a stipend to have pocket money for random shopping trips and such, and whenever she needs something bigger I buy it...\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo... I'm in SaaS sales and I do make really good money. We have a very nice house, the mortgage is only about 10% of what I take home after taxes, and we manage to put a good good chunk of money away in savings every month while still pretty much buying and doing what we want to. We were talking last night about what kind of jobs she might apply for now that she is thinking no PhD, and she casually brought up the notion of her maybe not working at all. After talking a bit more I could tell that she didnt feel as casual about it as she was acting and that she had been strongly considering that as her ideal option. Her main point was that since we dont need the money there is no reason for her to work.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI get where she is coming from since we really don't \"need\" the money, but for some reason the idea of her sitting around doing nothing all day just kind of bothers me, especially since she has always been super driven with an enormous work ethic in school. Also, since now she does make a small stipend, that would take her from having some money that was strictly hers to spend on whatever she pleases to only having money that she got from me, and I don't like the idea of her feeling like she doesn't have money of her own to spend and like she has to rely on me for everything. There is also the fact that if she doesn't work she will probably end up super bored and unhappy.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWe are planning to possibly have kids in a few years, and she also said that she couldn't really start a full career when she would be leaving to take care of kids before too long (which I would be fine with).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo she seems to think I am being an asshole for saying all that and trying to get her to work when we dont need the money. She says it doesn't really affect me either way, since I'd be doing the exact same thing whether she has a job or not, but it seems like it would end up affecting me in other ways to me...\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAm I being an asshole?",

      "description": "So I have a group of friends (around 9 of us in total) that I hang out with a lot. I was introduced to them by a really close friend(J) when I switched schools. It wasn't frosty and we had some good laughs and chats but I have felt like an extra wheel at times. \n\nSo the situation that brought me here is that X planned an outing for the whole group and they all went out and had a great time, and I was woefully ignorant of it all. So cut to a few days after the outing and we're all chilling together and they bring up their outing. I'm confused because I don't know what's going on so I just bit my tongue and kept silent. Afterwards, J pulled me aside and said he didn't know I hadn't been invited because X and Z told him I had been but I'd declined. They told I was busy with things coz my folks are getting a divorce and I couldn't make it so J just didn't press it. \n\n\nI didn't say anything because nobody had even asked me to come yet, and then a day later I heard about a concert they're all planning to go to. Cool. But here's the thing. When tickets came out for this concert I was the one who brought it up and said we should go. They call said it wasn't a good idea on our group chat and left it at that. So I didn't buy a ticket coz I didn't want to go to a concert on my own and my boyfriend had plans that weekend when I asked him. They're a favourite band of mine so I had really wanted to go with some company. Now I learned that my friends got tickets and didn't tell me so I'm left out again. So X and Z and P are saying that they changed their minds and brought it up again but I said I didn't want to come so it's not fair for me to be upset now. This convo they're talking about never happened. And J pulled me aside to give me another I didn't know talk but I was like really because how come you have a ticket? \n\nSo we'd been planning a gaming session at my house this coming weekend and I cancelled because I just feel upset and used, and I decided I'd rather have a gaming session with my brother and my boyfriend instead. But after I cancelled with friend group they started making me feel like shit and saying I'm petty and can't complain about being left out if I'm leaving them out of something as well. And now I'm conflicted because they're my friends and I'm upset but maybe I'm overreacting by not having them over this weekend? J said I'm behaving like a prat and that stung a bit because we've been friends since the sandbox. \n\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Last night, I had a birthday party that was a late dinner (9:30) and then karaoke for 15 people, and both places can't really hold more folks. One of them, I'll call him Mike, is one of my closer friends, but when he drinks, he can be a lot to deal with. \n\nEarlier in the day, Mike sent our group snaps of him getting wasted at a brunch, starting around noon. Closer to 6, he and his friend call me and are nearly incoherent. I'm trying to ask Mike where he is, what he's doing, if he's okay and he just keeps saying \"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know\". \n\nI eventually get his friend Sarah on the line, and tell her to come to my place with Mike. My goal here was to get him sobered up enough to not be an issue at my party, or to try and convince him to stay home. At this point, they get in a cab, and Mike has no idea where he's going, as evidenced by him asking the cab driver where he's taking them. \n\nWhen they arrive, they are still wasted. I give them a glass of water each, turn music on, and try to chat with them and get a feel for the situation. Mike basically refuses the water and says \"I'm gonna fuckin drink, bitch.\" I start to get the feeling that all is lost at this point. \n\nSarah is a bit more sober than Mike, but has no issue with him continuing to drink, so she does as well. I specifically pointed out that the beer in the fridge was not mine (roommates), but they drank it anyways. Whatever, I'll re up it later. \n\nI specifically told them that I was trying to sober them up because I might be able to add another to the reservations but didn't want it to be an issue. Mike continuously insists he's fine, but he's not listening and basically doing everything I tell him not to do. Once it came time for me to get to the restaurant, I pulled Mike aside and told him that, in his current state, I'm not cool with him coming to my party. He gets really angry and is basically like whatever fine I'll leave. \n\nAs they're leaving, I apologise to Sarah who says she totally understands and not to worry about it, but Mike tells me to fuck off. I felt bad about it being short notice, but I know how he can get, and honestly felt a bit slighted that he couldn't bother to be coherent for my party. \n\nAll that being said, AITA for uninviting him?",

It turned out good but this guy accidentally ruins it with ink or whatever the fuck I dunno he just asked me to redraw it. Oh wait, sorry, he didn't ask me to redraw it he demanded it. obviously the drawing took a lot of time the first time and it was exam week so I declined. He pestered me over and over again even during the exams. At that point I was of course, pissed. But during the exams I declined again and he told me that my art was shit and it wasn't even professional level. Now, my art ain't professional level that's for sure but my art ain't shit. Art is literally the only thing that made me want to continue living and not kill myself and him shitting on it really made me hate him. I just ignored him but he continued insulting  me and naturally I insulted him back. \n\nMy friend is friends with this guy. I wasn't originally part of this guy's class and I only got moved there due to our class being dissolved and divided put into different sections. Me and my friend were friends before we were in this guy's class. Since my friend became friends with this guy she knew what was happening. But she asked me why I was so mad at him when he's such a nice guy. She was also told many times by this guy to stop talking with me and everytime we were in a conversation he intervened. This guy was also dissing me to my friend. I was so obviously getting worked up by this guy's insults to the point that I wanted to cry but she still thought that he was a nice, funny guy. I kinda lashed out at her ignoring her and being a bitch.\n\nAITA for basically being a bitch towards my friend if the one I'm really mad at is her friend?",

      "description": "So long story,\n\nI've known this girl from a good friend, and at some point I started being very interrested in her. At that point we were pretty good friends. Then came the birthday of my good friend and me and the girl were flirting the whole evening, of course we both had already drank a lot so maybe the alcohol should be mentioned. Later that evening after a lot of flirting when we said goodbye we started making out. Next Day comes and we just discussed it and kind of just stopped it there. We both were ok with the situation and no one of us regretted that evening so far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonth later and its the birthday of the girl.\n\nThere are like 14 people and everyone is already pretty drunk and the evening so far is pretty funny. I still had interest in her but she started dating someone else and on that evening she flirted with some other guy. I didn't really care since I had other things in mind and I just didn't want to destroy the evening for myself. Later me and my good friend,best friend of the girl, go for a little walk (5-10 minutes), and she tells me that the girl told her that she wanted to make out with me again, so me who is interested in her goes like \"Yeah, I'm down.\" I have to mention that i'm pretty drunk at this point and when I look back now i'm kind of ashamed but me and my good friend walk back and she went in before me. As soon as I walk in my best friend told the girl something and the girl just comes out and we started making out for like 5 minutes straight until her brother started looking for her but I think he didn't see anything. Anyway next day we went to a \"Fasnachtsumzug\" (i really dont know how to explain it in english, look it up you will immeaditely get it. And there she sees her \"date\" making out with another girl so she was pretty devastated at first. On that evening i text her and ask why she so devastated since she has made out with 2 guys the evening before. The didn't remember making out with me because of the alcohol and i explain her what happened and again we just remained there. But a day later she texts me asking what the fuck is wrong with me and stuff like that and accuses me of using her to make out only because she was so drunk which I really didn't know since at the point where we made out I didn't see her for like 40 minutes and couldn't have known. Now she makes it look like I knew that she was drunk and I was too irresponsible to check on her before she literally ran me over to make out with me and flirted with me on the same evening two hours before. I actually apoligized that I should have been more responsible and stuff like that but she just spitted on that. And in between the 2 evenings we talked a lot and were pretty good friends. Am I wrong and should I have been more responsible or what went wrong?",

      "description": "I guess the title should really say \"are we the assholes\" since my wife made the decision with me.\n\nMy stepson has been a part of my life for the last 6 years, since he was 13. From a young age, he was resentful that my wife couldn't provide for him what he saw other children had. My wife busted her ass to keep him fed and housed and often went without food herself. She is a cosmetologist, so even when she went without food or sleep, she was always well groomed (important for later). Her ex is a total dead beat, in and out of his kid's life for years until he just up and left for good, and he never paid a cent to child support, but he would bring big gifts when he visited, like laptops and going systems, which my wife could never afford on her own.\n\nAnyway, after my wife and I got married, her and my stepson's lives obviously improved because 2 salaries are better than 1. My stepson finally got some of the things he'd never had, but instead of being grateful, it made him more resentful that he hadn't gotten these things sooner. We have sent him to multiple therapists for years, but it hasn't helped the extreme resentment he feels for my wife. It makes me so sad to witness, because she really did everything she reasonably could for him. \n\nHe's in college now but still lives with us and we have been fully funding him (aside from a part time student job) in an attempt to give him the best possible shot at excelling at school. We also have a three year old daughter.\n\nWe have been planning a family trip to Disney and I texted my stepson to ask him when he would be available to come with us. He texted back that there was no way he was coming. I was pretty shocked and just told him we'd discuss it when we got home.\n\nMy wife and I went to ask him why he didn't want to come, and he exploded at us. He called my wife a bitch and a whore for sleeping with a deadbeat and raising him with nothing when she clearly was spending all the money on herself, because she always had her hair done, etc. He called our daughter her \"do over child\" and said that she didn't deserve to go on nice trips and have nice toys when my wife never did that for him. He just went on and on, raging at my wife. \n\nOf course, we knew there had been resentment there for years, but previously he hadn't expressed it outright, or only did so in snarky comments. This was the first time he had unleashed it so directly and rudely. My wife cried for hours, and I was pissed as hell. So we decided he had to go. I gave him 30 days to get a better paying job and move out of our house. If he wants to come on trips for any reason, he'll have to pay his own way. No more cooking for him, buying the necessities, or paying for school. He gets nothing.\n\nNow that it's been a few days, I think we're both feeling a little guilty and wondering if we were too harsh, since he is so young. But at the same time, I wonder if 19 is too old to be acting this way, since he is an adult. AWTA?",

      "description": "Just come context: in my state, a landlord needs to give at least 24 hours written notice before entering a rental property. My partner and I are also very private people. I have issues with saying ‘no’ to people and setting boundaries.\n\nA few days ago my landlord turned up unannounced to the house my partner and I are renting. This isn’t the first time they have just turned up like this and while it doesn’t happen often, it is annoying. They are lovely people, and have been great to us.\n\nIt was early evening and as my partner works odd hours, they were asleep. I myself was in my pyjamas, watching tv and relaxing after work.\n\nAs soon as I saw them pull up I switched off the TV and went to the bedroom. There’s a chance they saw the TV was on as they pulled up. I really wasn’t in the mood for unannounced visitors, and definitely not my landlords.\n\n When my partner woke up I checked with them to see if they had known the landlords were coming over. They checked their phone and they had a missed call about 2hrs before they showed up and also a text asking if we were home as they wanted to wish us a merry Christmas.\n\nI kinda feel like an asshole/rude because they had good intentions, and did try to let us know. They also might have known we were home because of the tv, and probably know we were avoiding them. ",

Before the date friends told me that I probably wouldn't like her. The date went suprisingly well for never meeting in person and eventually it led to us going on a few more dates and hanging out with each other. After sometime I started to notice things that I didn't particularly like such as small things she would do, how she would act. These things were never anything major and to some people it may not bug them, she just did things that were my pet peeves or things that I found annoying. After sometime I slowly started to lose interest but never told her thinking that if I stuck it out it would get better. Well a couple of weeks ago I finally decided that I didn't want to talk to her, and after a long day at work she was wanting to hangout and she didn't understand that I was exhausted after a long day. This led to me not responding to her texts for three days, and on the third day I sent her a text telling her I was sorry for not texting, and that I didn't think things were going to work out. AITA for ghosting her for three days just to tell her I didn't like her out of the blue? \n\nAlso this was a 1 1/2 month 'fling'.",

(I say \"boyfriend\" because she's hardly ever with him because he doesnt want to chill. Its so obvious he either is not into her or gay). She constantly blows up my phone everyday and anytime I dont answer 5 times in a row, she gets upset and either days shes not going to hit me up anymore or shes going to lose my number or something to that effect. I am self employed as a Realtor and she knows that my schedule can be all over the place.  Hence, she should understand if i dont answer right away. Mind you, i call her back within the hour 85 percent of the time. Today she calls me 3 times in a row while I was showing a property. I left my cell phone in the car and come out 5 minutes later to this...\n\nHer:\nYOU GOT A PHONE FOR FUCKING WHAT?! DEAD ASS IM ABOUT TO DELETE YOUR NUMBER NO POINT ON CALLING SOMEONE WHO DOESNT EVER ANSWER \n\nMe:\nLiterally everyday you say your about to delete my number or stop hitting me up like damn obviously if i didnt answer 2 + times in a row im busy or don't got my phone. That dont mean im acting funny or dodging your calls. \n\nHer:\nNo problem Lex‼️💯\nYou don't ever got to worry about me hitting your phone again don't say I switched up later on I never said you was acting funny you never answer your phone literally I'm good I ain't begging nobody to hang out with me! Take care wish you the best ‼️💯🙌🏽💪🏽\n\nMe:\nI didnt mean it like that im just saying if you look through our texts, you say that all the time and i just think its corny how if i dont answer within 5 minutes your already talking about cutting me off. I was in a house with a client and i came out to see that yet again your saying your going to delete my number or stop hitting me up. And thats not you begging me to hang out its just like if you were at work and i called you 3 times in a row and you didnt answer. Im not going to say im boutta delete your number or stop hitting you up. I would assume your busy and ask wyd through text and wait for you to call or text back. Like 80 percent of the time you call and i dont answer i am doing something work related or something where i cant talk right then in there. Just bc i dont answer in a 10 minute time period doesnt mean im axting funny and you say you never said im acting funny but for you to say your gonna delete my number or stop hittng me up makes me think that you think im acting funny.  .....\n\nIts been about an hour and she hasnt responded. Now i kind of feel bad but should i? Am i the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "I am 20 years old and my SO is the same age as me. We’ve been together for about two and a half years now.\n\nI am disabled because of my severe mental illnesses, and I live with my parents. My major depression is treatment-resistant, meaning that nothing I’ve tried has ever made any improvement to my depression. The only two things that have stopped me from feeling constantly suicidal and self-harming were dropping out of college and quitting my job because both added massive amounts of stress to my life. I’m living with my parents until I either find something that helps or will move on to disability benefits if I exhaust my options for treatment without improving. My parents told me that they are willing to continue supporting me as I continue trying different forms of treatment.\n\nOne of the many rules I had to follow growing up was that I could only start dating when I turned 18. I respected their rule and never dated anyone. My current SO and I met in high school. We were friends for a while and then, right before my 18th birthday, I brought him over to my house and we asked my mom if she would be okay with us being romantically involved. She said yes, but I later found that there were exceptions.\n\nMy mom forbid me from having any kind of sexual relationship with him, and I have to keep my door open whenever he comes over. I thought this was a fair rule at first considering our age differences, but when my SO tuned 18 as well, it was clear that my parents were keeping their rules.\n\nI have no idea why they don’t want me having sexual relations with my SO. We are both consenting adults. I am on birth control (to stop my debilitating periods) and never want children. My SO had been tested for STD’s. I would be more than willing to get tested for STD’s. My SO and I are both responsible. My parents don’t dislike him. My parents don’t care about abstaining from sex before marriage. This is not a normal rule in my family; I have two cousins who are both my age and are allowed to have sexual relations with their partners. The only thing they have ever mentioned as to why they don’t want me having a sexual relationship is because it’s “their house, their rules.”\n\nHere’s where MY asshole part finally comes in: my SO and I have disrespected these rules many times. My SO and I have had sex both at his house (when his parents weren’t home, which is also a rule-breaker) and my house, and he’s even stayed the night once when my parents were out house hunting out of town.\n\nIn my defense for what I’ve done, I’ve never disobeyed my parents’ rules before. I feel like if my parents aren’t willing to give me any leniency, then I have no reason to continue to respect their rules. I think that if they don’t want me to have a sexual relationship then they should simply ban me from all romantic relationships whatsoever (which is still pretty ridiculous to ban an adult from IMO).",

      "description": "Recently, my brother has been bringing over his friends over the weekdays, and often they are sleeping over. Last week, one of his friends slept over for 4 days in a row. I was pretty pissed and I told him that is incosiderate and unacceptable when you remember how tiny our apartment is and that we have 3 cats that get really scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat pissed me off the most was that he would let his friend sleep at our place when no one is there. This infuriated me because I do not feel safe knowing someone is sleeping in my apartment without anyone else in my home. I never agreed to this when i moved in with home, and i truly think it is unacceptable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe claims that i am entitled since my girlfriend sleeps over on the weekdays occasionally, but I told him it was not the same because she never sleeps over or stays in our home unless i am here. Furthermore, we often stay in my room when she is over except when we are watching netflx in the living room. His friends, on the other hand, slept in the living room for days and I couldn't even go in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "  \n\nAITA for using my co-worker's microwave???\n\nOk so I recently had been using a microwave in a small little room where I tutor students. The microwave says \"employees only\". I just got hired as a temp tutor so I am an employee and so in my head cool, I can use. \n\nAnyways the first day of using it (March 7) I asked (we'll call her \"Nancy\" ) if I can use it. She asked if i was tutoring and I replied no not today, I just wanted to heat up my food real quick and eat for a bit. She said sure. So in my head, I'm thinking okay cool I got a place to heat up my food!!\n\nFrom then on though, things started to turn. Every time I knocked next door to get in, Nancy asked if i had tutoring. I'd reply with a mixture of either \"later today but just want to heat up my food\" or \"nope just want to heat up some food\". She didn't say anything. Then a couple of days ago, we'll call her \"Nancy # 2\", was in the room. I had food in the microwave when she opens it and says \"Oh....YOU'RE using the microwave.\" and leaves the room. I was turned around but the tone of her voice sounded so scornful. So I was thinking hmm, maybe she's just having a bad day. But I also felt uneasy and un-welcomed.\n\nYesterday (7 days after I first used the microwave), I was outside of my tutoring hours again to heat up some food. I had the door propped open, and saw Nancy opening her door and said \"Hey Nancy!\". She just looks at me without saying anything back and proceeds to entering her room. She comes in to where I'm eating moments later with a paper in hand and asks me \"So...\" \"When is your tutoring hours?\" . I tell her (Mon 5-7 and Th 6-8) while she writes it on the paper. She posts on the door. She then tells me I am not allowed to use the microwave outside of my tutoring hours. I started to slowly lose it. I couldn't understand why I couldn't.... 7 DAYS AFTER I INITIALLY USED IT. I replied \"well I am an employee, I don't see what the issue is\" and asked if she had a problem. She told me no, but talk to Nancy #2 since she \"paid for it\". She also told me I could use it during my tutoring hours to which I replied, \"what difference does that make?\". \n\nQuite heated and trying to understand what the problem was, I rushed to talked to Nancy #2. \"Apparently, there's an issue with me using the microwave?\". She replied with something like we don't want everybody using it. And that I use the space as my \"second home\" which prohibits their use for activities they have. I told her I'm an employee??? And the most I've stayed there is 30 minutes. Every time I heat up my food, I stay 15 minutes max on average. While talking to her, I could see that the issue was me using it so I told her I'll just stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nUsed a microwave labeled \"employees only\". Am an employee. I use for 7 days straight no problem. I get told I can't use. Only during my tutoring hours. \n\nAm i the asshole????\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So,my ex and I had what I thought to be an amazing relationship. We technically lived together in our college dorm, and we spent a lot of time together. We were both really happy with each other, and would constantly tell each other what we loved about the other and whatnot. She was a huge part of my life, but was having a hard time with the college environment and eventually left. I also had to take online classes at home for a semester, so we were really far apart.\n\nI thought that we'd be able to do a long distance relationship, and I thought it worked for a while. There weren't really any problems. But overtime we'd talk less and less. There were times where she's disappear for a week without any word, then suddenly come back. She told me she ignored all my messages because she wanted to be alone for a bit. That's perfectly fine, but I'd at least like to know that,so that I don't worry that she'd disappeared for a week. This happened a couple times, then this past Christmas she said I should try to look for another girlfriend.\n\nTo this day, I still don't really understand what happened. We had a great time, then suddenly it's all over. I haven't heard anything from her in a few months, she won't reply to me at all. I message her maybe once a week at most. Maybe only just a few times a month. I'd just like to know if I did something wrong, because if I did I'd like to fix it for next time. I also want to know how she's doing, because I know she's going through things, and I just want to make sure she's ok. I've heard absolutely nothing, and I feel bad for bothering her, but I just want to get some answers. So am I doing the wrong thing here? Should I just leave her alone?",

      "description": "First time posting because this blew up in my face with my parents so please bear with me. So tu set up things, my relationship with my parents has not been great since i was a teenager, i have always been very independent and started drifting away from catholicism (which my parents are, devoutly), i also have a very introvert personality and not very talkative. So that has always been a big difference between us that makes our relationship complicated. \n\nBack to present day, i am living in Europe while i do my masters and my bf lives in my hometown (america) while he does his phd. Of course LDRs suck and we have agreed to visit each other every two months if financially possible. I went to visit him mid February and stayed at my parents place, did all the obligatory family and extended family visits but it was only for a week so i wanted to spend as much time as possible with my bf. Now that it is his turn he tells me his budget will not let him travel which means 6 months without seeing each other. \n\nNow, i have a bit more money and it turns out that he has a holiday week which aligns to my exams and class schedule perfectly so i don’t miss anything. This also aligns to the week when my family will take a trip out of town. I decide to surprise him buying a plane ticket and booking a place near the university he works at knowing that my family locks the house down when leaving town.\n\nThis happened two weeks ago, i tell my bf after two days and my parents call at the 7th day and ask me about the charge in my account ( they have access to it, for reasons that don’t really matter for this situation). I proceed to tell them my plans and they take it as a major offense that i am going when they are not in town and that i decided to book a place to stay instead of staying in their place. They haven’t spoken to me in a week and now i get a long message from my mom saying she is disappointed and hurt and thinks i did it on purpose to hurt /avoid them.\n\nI want to know your opinion reddit, AITA?",

Today she told me to just leave her alone when i texted her that i loved her and asked how her new tattoo was doing. I know she is taking 2 university classes and works usually 2 times a week (her part time schedule varies greatly week to week) but i know she has at least 3 free days a week i could at least see her for even just a coffee date once a week but apparently its too much.

      "description": "I am 24 and have a 1 year old. I'm tired of being disappointed by them. They'll make plans to come over and never show. I made lunch plans on a tuesday and they rescheduled twice finally for a dinner they were going to bring something or we were all going out once my husband got home. Thirty minutes before they were going to show they called and said they werent coming . Because from where they were traffic was bad .[ traffic was also bad going home ] they were 20 minutes away at an appointment . It's an endless cycle of not showing up and guilt trips from my mother over everything. She was guilt tripping me when i was in labor over not wanting them to stay i just wanted my husband in the room. My dad took our wedding pictures over two years ago. Still haven't seen them. They don't follow through they dont show up. I don't want to have to explain to my crying daughter in the next year or so and for the rest of her life why my parents don't bother coming around or say they will and want to take her places and don't come. I hate going to their house. It reeks of cigarettes and weed from them smoking in the house when i get home after being at their house i need to shower give my daughter a bath and wash anything that goes in their house.\n\n\nI'm tired of guilt trips and being angry and sad when they can't be bothered to show up.

      "description": "Sorry for the poorly formatted wall of text, I've never done this before.\n\nAll names are replaced with fake ones for obvious reasons.\n\n\\-Background-\n\nSo about a year ago, I dated this girl named Jean who was a mutual friend of a number of my friends. She had previously been hooking up with two of my better friends, Steve and Dave. We dated for about three weeks before she broke it off with me. In retrospect, I definitely overreacted at the time, but that's not what I'm talking about right now. After we broke up, Steve asked me if I would feel alright with the two of them continuing to hook up. I struggled with this for a while, and eventually told him I was fine with it (I wasn't). Fortunately, being a great friend, Steve asked me the same question about a week later and I told him the truth, that I wasn't really alright with it and I would prefer if they didn't. Obviously that was the end of that and we continued on as best friends forever. \n\nUntil about 6 months later. In that time I moved in for my first year at college and most of my friends moved away as well. I still had a number of mutual friends with Jean, and wouldn't be able to avoid her forever, so I decided to apologize for, in general, being shitty and avoiding her for half a year. She accepted my apology and just like that, we were friends again. About a week after that we were sitting in her dorm when she literally broke down crying on my shoulder and told me, among other things, that she and Steve had hooked up around 4 times in the past few months. I wasn't exactly shocked, but it still hurt to know that my best friend went behind my back like that. I thought about it for a while and eventually decided to not confront him about it and pretend it never happened, because ultimately it was none of my business what two other people decided to do to/with each other. Obviously that was the end of that and we continued on as best friends forever.\n\nUntil about 2 months later. In the meantime, Jean had found herself a new boyfriend, whom she told all of her friends about. One night, I got a text from Steve asking if I knew if she and her boyfriend had broken up. I truly had no idea and I told him that. He followed that up with that he had confirmation that they did. He immediately followed that up with asking if I would be alright with them hooking up again. The next day I got dinner with Jean, and she and her boyfriend were very much still together, I texted another mutual friend (Denise) asking if she had told Steve that they were broken up, because Steve said she had told him. She told me that no, she had not. I pressed her a little harder, and then she admitted that yes, she did. She then asked my why I cared so much, and accused me of still having feelings for Jean, more than a year after we broke up. That, combined with the randomly lying to me really pissed me off, so I told her not to text me anymore, and that if she wanted to talk about it in person she could let me know. At the same time, I had returned Steve's text by saying that Jean was still very much in a relationship, along with a little bit of a barb along the lines of, \"Does my answer really matter? You'll do in anyway\". This triggered a such a heated exchange that it deserves its own paragraph.\n\nHe asked several times where I was getting my information from, and if I trusted them more than I trusted him. He also attempted to play it off like it had only been a quick kiss one time. When I called him out on this, he claimed it was only  a quick kiss, two times. When I called him out on this, he accused me of still having feelings for Jean. I told him that it had nothing to do with her and that I really only cared that he had gone behind my back and then lied to me about it repeatedly. He then told me what I assume is the whole story because it's consistent with everything else I know.\n\nAfter the fact, I found out that he had been texting Jean the entire time trying to figure out how much I knew about the situation. Jean had told him that she didn't tell me anything, and that he should lie to me as much as possible. I haven't had any exchanges with any of them since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the asshole part.\n\nDave (Remember Dave? From the beginning?) has been trying to get us all to make up for the past couple of weeks. Steve, Denise, and Jean have all made no attempt to contact me at all, so Dave is trying to get me to contact them and ask to talk. I, however, feel like they should contact me first. I really have nothing to say to any of them at this point, and if  the relationships are even worth salvaging at this point, I would think that they would contact me first.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole for not wanting to crawl back to these people and beg for them to be my friends again?\n\n(On the plus side, I can relate to a whole new genre of music now, so that's nice, I guess)",

      "description": "I’m naturally an introvert. I recharge best in my own space doing my hobbies. I get worn down when folks come to visit and stay. I always find myself happy they’re leaving after a week or so and feel a bit drained emotionally. \n\nI live with my girlfriend in Hawaii and her mom lives on a different island. Every two weeks since October she’s come and stayed 3-4 days sometimes more. She asks and pressures my girlfriend into saying yes and has never once asked me directly despite it being my house that I paid for. The first few times I let it slide but as it happened more and more I became more sensitive to her in particular. We’ve had other people come stay with us in this timeframe and while I felt my usual drained feeling I was never upset by them coming. She’s always found some excuse to come. For New Years it was that “I didn’t want to be left out” and invited herself for three days. For thanksgiving she didn’t eat what us but used it as a launching point for seeing her friends and eating with them. One time it was to see a concert and that time she did pay for our tickets. \n\nNow she’s back. She’s having foot surgery and is staying with her friend who happens to live in the next building over. As of now she isn’t planning on staying with us because I’ve more or less made it clear to her I’m not happy with her. She says she’s not gonna need anything for us but tonight is her first night here and she’s already called and asked us to bring her dinner so that’s not off to a great start. She initially asked if we wanted to go out but when we told her we had already eaten she then asked if she could have some of our dinner so we gave her a frozen pizza. She has a dramatic personality and despite it being a minor procedure im expecting her to milk it for attention and to play the victim. \n\nMy girlfriend is upset and feels like she’s being put in the middle of us but all I want is for her to leave us alone. I feel like she’s abused staying here and every two weeks for 4 months is too much. It doesn’t help she has a personality type I find grating but I feel like she’s objectively in the wrong. \n\nShe’s in her 60s and lives alone and hasn’t had a lot of friends on her island. I feel like she’s leaning on us to fill that void. The other point is that we’ve only lived here from the mainland since late September which means she’s been like this since the start. \n\nSo reddit. Am I the asshole? ",

I can sleep with people talking. Hearing this made me think that everyone* was mad at me.\n\nSo I thought to myself, “Obviously no one wants me here, so why should I have to deal with them?” So i called my parents, asking them to pick me up.

One of my friends told me she was very pissed about the comment and she got extremely defensive about it, saying she hasn't gained weight in 2 years and it was rude. I really didn't mean it in a bad way, I just thought she gained weight and it looks good on her. Was that rude of me?\n\nTL;DR told a girl she gained weight and it looks good on her. It pissed her off.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I think my husband knows my main.\n\nMy husband has been attending conventions for like 15 years, we’ve been together for 9. When he was in high school he went to a lot of conventions every year, now it’s usually 1 or 2 every year.  When we first met, he said “I’m not gonna be one of those lame 30 year olds that still go to conventions, that’s so weird. Now he’s a 31 year old still going to cons.\n\nWhen we first started dating I tried going with him to several and had a “meh” time at best. The parts that I did enjoy were only fun because I was completely wasted, and that’s no longer something I enjoy being.\n\nWe’ve been married for 4.5 years and have a 5 month old baby. Obviously it would not be appropriate to bring the baby to a con, although my husband floated the idea and I quickly pointed out how ridiculous it was. The car ride alone would be too much for him.\n\nMy husband has been saying for weeks that he won’t be going to Magfest, can’t afford it, doesn’t make sense, whatever. Then two days before he decides that he’s going Saturday morning and coming back Sunday. I had a feeling this would happen, and told him it was shitty to constantly play this game of “I’m not going” only to decide last minute that he is going, which he has done multiple times before. He admitted that this was shitty and apologized, but insisted that he never gets to see his friends and this was his chance. Most of his close friends live fairly close by to us, but he rarely invites them over, and they rarely take him up on it. His best friend lives an hour away and has no job or transportation, so my husband will occasionally drive an hour each way to pick him up and drop him off, which I think is kind of ridiculous.  Now he’s driven 5 hours away to the con to hang out with friends that don’t live that far away to begin with.\n\nHe also makes the case of wanting to see his “con friends” who I think are acquaintances at best. He has no interaction with them outside of cons other than liking their social media posts once in a while. He doesn’t know them on an intimate level at all, and if it weren’t for cons he would lose contact with them entirely.\n\nMy last gripe is the hotel. I’d be more open to going with him if we booked a room for ourselves, and I’d be happy to wander around the city with the baby while he’s at the con. But he’s throwing a friend $30 to sleep on the floor of a room that has a dozen people staying in it. I know that this is the norm at cons, but when you’re married with a kid? C’mon.\n\nI really wish that this is something I could enjoy with him but I’ve tried multiple times and have always had a bad time. My husband doesn’t attend these things so he can hang out with me the whole time, so I end up feeling ignored. I’m not the most outgoing person, and I have a hard time connecting with people when the only conversation topics revolve around fandoms. (I love The Office, but just because someone else loves The Office doesn’t automatically mean I want to be their friend).  I get super bored just hanging out drinking in hotel rooms with people I don’t know well or at all.\n\nMost of all, I’m annoyed because it feels like my husband is pretending to be 21 again while I’m managing our household and taking care of our kid. I work full time so I cherish the time with my baby, don’t get me wrong, but after I spend a 12 hour day at work my husband is eagerly waiting for me to come home and relieve him of dad duty for a little bit because it’s work, duh!  From other people’s social media I can tell that my husband was up until at least 6am, which means he’s not gonna head home before noon and he’ll get home after 5pm probably feeling like shit.\n\nI haven’t picked a fight because I don’t want to ruin his weekend, but I’m really fed up with this (what I perceive to be) juvenile nonsense. I haven’t texted him much but he also hasn’t texted me since 7pm last night so it’s not like I’m ignoring him.  I just wish that he would find more adult friends that we could both enjoy hanging out with, rather than reliving his past once or twice per year. AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account because some of my friends know about my main one.\nFor some context: Me and my brother used to be really close when we were younger but as time went by and me moving away for university we slowly drifted apart. I get to be home maybe once every 2 weeks for around two days and I try to spend as much time with him as I can. He is younger than me with 3 years, and pretty much just started stepping into adulthood. Lately he flat out ignored me or he was just too busy to chat. He just turned 18 and I'm beyond stoked for him. I came home earlier, I got his present and just wanted to be there with him.\nMy problem: I didn't get to spend the day of his birthday with him, because of class. I texted him that day, but he ignored my messages, when I got home I wanted to just sit and chat. I hid his present and jokingly said to him: \"come and let me hug you, it's your birthday after all\", he ignored me and said that it's not worth to get up for. I jokingly said again that at least I'll give him his present if he does. After this, he flat out told me that why should he even bother to do sth for my shitty present and that I should just give it to him. I stayed quiet and left. I feel so bad about it and I don't know if I did the right thing, I want for him to learn his lesson and at the same time I can understand that he might be like this because of his hormones.

I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing.

I told him in the beginning that i'm not in the market to have a relationship because my last one really didn't go well. A lot of stuff happened in the last one that almost cost me my life. So i'm not looking or even vaguely interested in dating people or entering relationships or becoming exclusive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet in the past few weeks he has been sending me good morning texts, good night texts, asking when i would come by and if i want to get dinner and a movie with him. Then he asks if i would consider becoming his girlfriend. I told him no, i'm not wanting a relationship and if he doesn't stop with this i would leave. He stopped for a while, we hung out and went crazy with each other. As i'm getting up to get dressed he grabs my arm and asks me to stay and cuddle. I say no and get my clothes on and leave. I then get a long text of him telling me how much i mean to him and how he would love it if i would become his girlfriend. I'm just now pissed off because to me it seems as if a good thing has been ruined because he let his feelings get in the way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will also point out yet again, i told him in the beginning before we even kissed that i came from a bad relationship. I was really messed up and in no mood to play heart games or even consider relationships. That what we did was going to be friends with benefits. He agreed and said he would love that. We would text throughout the month about random things that friends talk about. How his parents made him mad over the holidays, how i laughed because i hated holidays and didn't celebrate them, things like that. We basically talked like best friends. Then over the course of the last month the morning/night texts started and i started to get irritated. I reminded him that i wasn't interested in a relationship and he said \"i love you though\" and i didn't respond to any messages for a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow since he's said those forbidden words i am wanting to disappear. I warned him that i'm not doing relationships. I said i didn't want to become exclusive and he said the words. I didn't forbid the words but i figured it was implied. So WIBTA if i ghosted him for falling in love with me? ",

      "title": "AITA for hanging up on my mom after not talking to her for a month?",
      "description": "So some back ground information. At 18 my parents kicked me out and I had to go live with my aunt. We’ve had several spats over the past 10 or so years while I was growing up mainly because they tried to control my every move. \n\nGrowing up nearly anything I wanted to do was off limits. From cartoon shows to hanging out with friends. I was constantly in trouble and grounded a good portion of the time. I’ve never gotten along with my mom and in the past 8 or 9 months I’ve gotten very distant. \n\nMy mom is very controlling, manipulative person and tries to get me to do what she thinks is right rather than letting me make my own choices and mistakes. I have a brother and a sister still living with her that I don’t get to talk to very much because of my mom. Now my dad sees that what my mom is doing is wrong but he’s just choosing to ignore it. I guess hoping it will all go away. \n\nI finally broke down and texted my mom yesterday saying the normal “ I love you and I miss you” type of thing which is true. I mean they’re my family. She then send me this morning on my birthday(I’m now 19) a long drawn out message about how she thinks that I’m just  using them and that I don’t really want to have a relationship with them. \n\nSo I’ve been texting her all day trying to talk through a lot of the hurt and frustration of the past few years especially. But she keeps coming at me with the I think you’re just using me/us. While I was out at a restaurant with my boyfriend she called me. I had my phone in my purse at the time so I couldn’t hear it going off, I always keep my phone on vibrate. She got very upset when I texted her sorry I missed your call. I told her I’d call her back when we got into the car. So I eat and then go out to the car to call her. \n\nAs soon as she answered it was clear the neither of us were in the mindset to calmly talk through it all. There were several digs at each other and neither of us were really listening to the other person. Then she said something that triggered a panic attack and I asked if we could just put a pin in it and call it a day. She refused to hang up the phone. So I stayed on the line and tried to talk through it all. \n\nShe then decided to bash my boyfriend saying he wasn’t a good person and things of the nature. I just recently moved in with my boyfriend to get away from a very dangerous situation and place. He’s one of the best people I know. When she started to say all the things about my boyfriend I just snapped and hung up the phone. I texted her immediately afterwards apologizing and said I felt like I was being attacked. \n\nSo AITA for hanging up or is it a justified response? Any advice y’all have would be greatly appreciated too. I’m not sure what to do. ",

I have never gotten on with her and she always gets the sympathy because she's always sick and in and out of the hospital. \n\nNow, recently, I've been told this is real. She's in the hospital and there's a chance she won't come out. The sadness hasn't hit me and I don't think it will. Obviously I don't want her to die, I'm not a vile person. But everyone has to go sometimes and I'm just not as sad as I thought I would be. \n\nI've always been told that if I don't want to do something, I shouldn't be bullied into doing it. And I don't want to visit her. I just do not care. she made me miserable my whole life and always got away with it. the only person who's been outraged with her actions against me is my mother, but I think that's because she's not blood related.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like the asshole for sure, but is that feeling justified?",

      "description": "For context, I just had gotten home from a long day of school and then ‘work’ I do for the school. In school I already sat through the entire day of teachers explaining which understandably it wouldn’t really make me not want to hear explanations, just the fact after listening to play rehearsals for 2-3 hours while working around drained me.\n  I decided to call LO (Loved One) up since they wanted to call so they could continue what they were already focusing on which was just fine. Some time into the call they began explaining what they were working on since we disagreed on something related to it. All I said was “It’s not really fun listening to explanations after sitting through them all day, but hey, it’s whatever.” Which was replied with LO saying “Whenever you talk or complain about things I listen to you” which I understand all in all but said “You don’t have to if you don’t want to, I tell you that all the time” in which I do.\n  Which I think is just true since I usually ask if LO is sure they want to hear about what I’m gonna talk about if I know it can be complaining.\n\nTL;DR Got in a disagreement over something and LO(loves one) started explaining what they were doing; I said I wasn’t really in the mood to listen to explanations; they said they listen to me complain/talk; \n\nAITA for not wanting to listen to their explanation as well as refuse to see their point in the disagreement because I strongly believe it’s not right.\n\nFurther Context: We were at a disagreement with animation. I said animation with drawing frame by frame can take hours to months just like an animation using digital models.",

The people who also live next to her don't mind that they hear noise ( I talked to them) that late at night. I have literally knocked on her door 20 times through out the year and  called the RAs. Everytime i do this she turns it down to a reasonable volume. But literally 3-4 days later she forgets and puts it too loud again. I should also mention that my dorm has a 24/7quiet hour policy. This girl seems really nice, and I feel like an ass knocking on her door and telling her to shut up, especially when her other neighbors don't  seem to mind at all.

My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again.

      "description": "Throwaway because unfortunately now I’m worried about being banned from lesbian subs on here. \n\nUnsure if I should put “not a shit post”, because at this point I’m not sure if I’m not the asshole considering all the people calling me a “terf” and saying I’m not a “real lesbian” on facebook. I’ve already gotten called a “cocksucker” (?? for not wanting to suck a dick?) and told to that I’m helping to contribute to the violence against trans women. \n\nAnyways. I’m a lesbian, and my last relationship ended a little over a month ago, so I’ve redownloaded bumble (think tinder, but with more girls) again. Although there’s an option to only see women, sometimes guy profiles are marked as women and end up on my app. \n\nI was hanging out with a friend (not a lesbian, but bisexual) last night and she was swiping through my bumble while I watched, making jokes and stuff. A profile came up, all pictures of a stereotypical guy with a beard and short hair, dressed in shirts and jeans, with an obviously guy name (Jacob). I got annoyed and started talking about how bumble needs to stop showing me men, but my friend scrolled down to the person’s bio, which said they were a trans girl. I awkwardly stopped calling them a man and she asked if I wanted to swipe right on them, saying they had the same interests as me and we could be a good fit. \n\nWhat followed was a very awkward tense conversation where I tried to explain that I wasn’t attracted to them, and why I wasn’t attracted to them when prodded to explain. When asked if I was willing to ever date a trans woman, I had to admit that I only would if they not only fully passed as a girl, but also either didn’t mind that I wasn’t willing to engage with sex with a penis or if they had a sex change surgery. She called me a terf and left, but not before ranting about how I’m close minded and that a “real lesbian” wouldn’t care about things like that and wouldn’t see anything wrong with getting together with someone like “Jacob” because it’s the gender identity that matters and not the presentation. \n\nGuys. Am I crazy for thinking I didn’t do anything wrong?? I’m not transphobic, I’m just not attracted to men or people who look like men. I don’t even date butch girls unless they still look feminine in some way! I don’t see what’s wrong with that! But a lot of my lgbt friends are mad at me and calling me a terf and I’ve even been kicked out of our lgbt facebook group for it! I don’t even know this Jacob person personally, I just wanted to swipe left. \n\nPlease give me a reality check, even if it’s to tell me I actually am being an asshole because I’m starting to feel like I’ve crash landed into a different reality. \n\n**TL;DR: friends shocked and disgusted that local lesbian isn’t sexually attracted to people who look like bearded men, local lesbian starts to wonder if she truly is an asshole for not thinking there’s anything wrong for only being attracted to people who look like girls** ",

      "description": "So I'm having some problems with my roommate. I was put in the pool for a random roommate this year and I got a roommate that is honestly pretty cool. We have some similar interests and at first he didn't do anything annoying other than stay up till 3-4 AM on his iPad, but even then it's his room too and I sleep just fine with lights.\n\nAfter the first week though, it got bad. For the first month he refused to lock the door because he didn't understand how the lock works (found out after I solved this). I had to talk to him about locking the door when no one is in the dorm 3 times before he finally said he didn't know how to lock the door. It took him a month to learn to lock the door. Fortunately, he started locking it.\n\nOn top of that first incident, he sets 3 or 4 alarms every morning (depending on MWF or TR) and wakes up to all of them and crawls back in bed after turning them off, waking me up every 15 minutes. I've asked him if he can stop that cause it's waking me up and a bit irritating, but he simply responded \"It's how I wake up.\"\n\nHe also chews with his mouth open and extremely loudly. Like, I can hear it across the room with my headphones on with music playing loud. I can't hear my girlfriend talking to me if she's right next to me when I have my headphones on. I've asked him to stop because it makes me feel queesy and a bit ill and he stops for a bit, but the next day he'll be chewing gum or food super loud again. \n\nIn addition, he likes to play guitar in the tiny room, which I'm honestly fine with cause my headphones block it out... until it's quiet hours and he's still playing and we get people banging on the walls cause he's keeping them up and then the RA makes announcements about quiet hours cause of it. He still won't stop. We have a soundproofed room that is a \"study room\" but everyone uses it to play instruments instead, but he won't go there. \n\nLastly, he's extremely messy. I'm not the cleanest person ever, but he's scarily messy. Like, couple week old pizza boxes on the floor type messy. I told him it's fine so long as I can't smell it or it stays on his side of the room. He's usually good about that, but sometimes he slowly starts to annex my side of the room with his garbage and other stuff and I have to push it back so that my side can stay reasonably clean. \n\nHe also comes in drunk most Friday nights, which isn't an issue usually, but I've had to let him in the building late at night before because he loses his card to get in or he needs someone to help him get in without being caught.\n\nI don't know what to do about any of this because I actually genuinely get along with him, but he's difficult to live with because he wont listen when I ask him politely to stop. I'm thinking of going to the RA about it because I don't want to be aggressive and piss off the guy I'm gonna be living with for another semester. WIBTA if I go to the RA about my issues with him? (other than the drunk part cause I don't want him to get in any legal trouble or anything). If going to the RA is bad, does anyone have any advice for what else to do?",

      "description": "Sorry for this wordy post, I’m pretty upset right now and trying to vent. TLDR at bottom. \n\nI work in a cafe with these two girls, we’ll call them Ruby and Amanda. I’ve been friends with Ruby since the day I started working there, we just really seemed to click. I didn’t get scheduled to work much the first month of my job, so I didn’t actually even meet Amanda until I had been working there for about a month. Throughout this time, I heard from Ruby many different times all the reasons why she disliked Amanda, in the way only  a 19 year old girl can describe someone. She assured me many times that once I met her I wouldn’t like her. I fully believed her. \n\nBut here’s the thing... when I did meet her, I absolutely loved her. We have the same work ethic, we flow really well together when we’re working on the floor together, AND she’s also into all the same things I love. Instant friendship. We both mutually agreed that we loved working together. \n\nI should emphasize that I am also really good friends with Ruby. We aren’t as close as Amanda, but we have a good rapport, and all her friends who are our coworkers like me so we chat a lot. We don’t hang out outside of work, except one time when I had a party and invited her as well as some other coworkers (I didn’t invite Amanda because a lot of my coworkers who were coming don’t like her and I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable as she knows they don’t like her). \n\nI’ve now been working at the cafe for about four months. Me and Amanda have gotten pretty close (like, commenting on each other’s Instagram posts level of friendship. Like a couple friendship levels above coworkers kinda thing). She doesn’t have a lot of friends among our coworkers (there are a lot of us, something like 30 for a relatively small cafe, but it gets crazy busy) and so I feel pretty protective of her. A lot of our coworkers are younger as well, like under 20, so they can be particularly gossipy as well. Me and Amanda are both recent college graduates looking for jobs in our actual fields, so we’re a bit older (23 and 27). \n\nOk so now to the meat and potatoes of the story, sorry for all the buildup. A couple days ago, I was working with both Amanda and Ruby at the same time, which is always a recipe for disaster. Amanda was taking her break with one of our regulars, who tends to wait for her so they can eat together (he’s a construction worker who works nearby I think). I’ve seen her do this with him many times, as I’ve seen her do with a couple of our regulars. She really is a lovely person. Anyways, I was working on the bar when I overhear Ruby say, to the floor and our coworkers at large, “isn’t she married?” They all turned to look at her and laugh and make snide remarks in response. It did not sit well with me at all. \n\nAmanda finishes her break and comes back on the floor. I ushered her over, and under her breath told her exactly what I had just heard. Her face drops and I can tell she’s really upset. She mumbles something and walks away. I keep making drinks. \n\nAs the shift progresses, Amanda comes back to me a couple of times to express how upset she was by the comment. Ruby has since finished her shift and gone home, so we can talk about it pretty openly. Amanda decides she’d like to go to our manager about it. She asks me to write a statement of what was said, I do but leave it entirely anonymous, including who Ruby was (I was very uncomfortable with the idea of throwing her under the bus, but I wanted her to know what she had said wasn’t okay) and who I am. Amanda brings it to our manager, and I go home for the day. \n\nYesterday I had the day off, and I was sitting at home playing some Red Dead when I get a message from Ruby. It’s a group message addressing me and all of my coworkers who were on the floor yesterday. She says that someone had told Amanda what she said, and Ruby was messaging all of us to say that whoever it was that had said something to the manager had misheard her, and that she loves Amanda and has always thought of them as friends. She said she wished I had come to her first about the problem. She then went on to say I had ruined Amanda’s day and their friendship by telling her. (She of course said all of this to “whoever it was that said something”, not to me directly)\n\nSo lets dissect that: she’s messaging a group of four of us on our days off, telling them that one of us is a total douchebag for ruining Amanda’s day by misinterpreting her words and telling Amanda about it, and asking which one of us did it (she said she didn’t care to know but why else would she be messaging us ugh). Now my other two coworkers, who obviously know it was me, think I’m an asshole probably. \n\nI was so anxious all yesterday about this. I thought of all the different ways I could talk to Ruby about it when we work our shift today. I knew she knew it was me who talked to Amanda. I went into work just shaking like a leaf, and Amanda was right there to talk to me (she feels bad she’s been putting me through stress but she wants justice) and meets me at the door. She says that our manager is in the back and she would really appreciate it if I talked to him because he couldn’t do anything with the statement I wrote him. Her and I went into the back room together and I told my manager exactly what had happened, and that I wanted as absolutely little to do with all of this as possible, I wanted out from that point on (I actually started crying a bit because I was so nervous of what Ruby was going to think). My manager assured me that I did the right thing in telling him, and that I had nothing to worry about. \n\nI go out onto the floor and pass by Ruby. She is cold and unfriendly to me. I know she knows. Sure enough, she goes to the back to have a talk with our manager and Amanda. I get called back about ten minutes later to talk to them. They say they have figured it out between each other. Ruby is flushed and I can tell she’s trying not to cry when she says “just next time come to me first okay? I thought we were friends.” Absolutely cutting through me. \n\nI feel awful, but I stand by my decision. I was tired of hearing Ruby abuse Amanda behind her back and disrespect her to our coworkers, but this feels awful. Amanda is very grateful to me, but I can tell this has ruined Ruby and I’s friendship. The energy coming off of her towards me the rest of the shift was very negative. Amanda on her way out the door told me that she saw Ruby crying as she came out of the bathroom. I think she got written up at the most but probably not. Am I the asshole for telling Amanda what Ruby was saying behind her back, and inevitably ruining Ruby and I’s friendship?\n\nTLDR; I work in a cafe with two girls(R and A), who I am both friends with. I overheard one girl (R) say a mean comment about the other(A) during a shift, I told her(A) about the comment, and the fallout inevitably ended my friendship with the other girl(R)",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my depressed friend out of our band for an upcoming performance?",
      "description": "Here’s some background on the situation. About a week ago, my friends and I signed up  to perform at a Battle of the Bands competition.  The day of the competition is March 27(about 5 weeks from posting this) and we need to learn 5 songs for a 20 minute performance. Our band has performed twice before for small crowds but If we do win, we get to perform at an even bigger gig and would be the step in the direction our band wants to go in before we graduate.\n\nOur rhythm guitarist is one of my best friends and has been in the band since day one. But due to a head injury in his childhood and some shitty events in his recent life, he’s been depressed and anxious. I talked him into getting the band back together for battle of the bands and he agreed.\n\nBut then he texted me that night saying that he had an anxiety attack about the performance and said he wanted to get out of the band. The next day, I was able to convince him to stay.\n\nTwo days ago, I asked him if he was coming to practice and he couldn’t because he was working on a project for school but he would be able to come to the next practice.\n\nThen, the guitarist texts me that night essentially saying that he needs to quit because he’s been relapsing into a deeper depression and with all the stress in his life right now, he can’t handle doing this and that it’d be better to meet in person the next day to discuss it face to face.\n\nYesterday, we met up and he apologized for the long text saying that he has been bipolar recently due to his medications and that he is willing to go past that to perform with the band. I told him that I was sorry but we couldn’t let him come back. I told him that the reasons why:\n\n-He’s been known to get out of things last minute and make up excuses to not go to things. We can’t deal with that because every practice counts and we can’t trust if he is busy or lying.\n\n-Quitting the day before made everyone mad at him for a bit but we got over it. If he were to quit later on though, it would put even more stress on all of our friendships than if he just left now.\n\n-If he did end up quitting last minute, he would leave us unprepared and make us lose.\n\nAfter I told him that, he argued that most of my points rely on him not performing and that he swears that he will come to the all of next practices and that he needs this to get out of his rut. I said I just cannot trust him enough to put in the effort. He didn’t take too kindly to that and called me a “selfish prick” and got up and walked away.\n\nI informed the band of my decision and two of them thought that what I did was probably the right thing to do while the other guy said “That was a dick move man. We’ll work around it but cmon man, you didn’t have to do him like that.”\n\nI’m not sure if I did the right thing or if I was being selfish and inconsiderate. AITA?",

      "description": " Last week, I was in a meeting to address an upcoming deadline. \n \nThe meeting was supposed to be extremely short and to the point. We all had other meetings afterwards. Missed deadlines could cost us millions. \n\nAs luck would have it, our meeting ended up running late about fifteen minutes. \n\nWhen my manager asked if that was all, a coworker stood up and began talking about how his mosque was having an event to raise awareness about Islam. He even talked about post 9/11 harassment of Muslims at some point.\n\nNormally, we wouldn't have cared- but some of us had flights to catch. Also, HR made it clear we were to never discuss religion or politics in the work place. \n\nWe glanced to the manager, but she seemed reluctant to interrupt him. I had a client waiting and I was cutting it close. I cut him off. \"Thanks! We'll let you know\" \n\nAs we began rushing towards the door, he blocked me in. \n\n\"Will I see you there?\" \n\nI told him I couldn't go. I had plans for St. Patrick's day. He kept trying to get me to change my plans. I said no. As he was walking away, he said a racist comment. \"You're probably not even Irish, just drink like one.\" \n\nI am part Irish. Being mixed race, people making digs about my heritage has always been a sore spot for me. I shot him daggers and he cowered away. \n\nDue to his interruption, I was late to my next meeting. Thankfully, the client was very understanding.\n\nAfter the client left, my boss asked why the meeting ran late and why I looked so frazzled. I told him about the invitation and the comments to me after. This did not sit with him. He is 100% Irish. He told me he would take care of it. \n\nLater that day, people from the meeting started being called in to share their version of what took place. It turned out a coworker had missed their flight by just minutes. \n\nThe coworker eventually came by to apologize. He informed me he was worked up because he had family in New Zealand he hadn't been able to get in touch with. \n\nToday, he is in New Zealand. His family member was one of the victims. He doesn't know that he has a severance package waiting when he comes back. \n\nI feel terrible. He has a child on the way and his wife doesn't work. My boss is really well connected in the industry, so he is black listed in the state, if not the country. \n\nMy coworkers are glad he is gone, citing that they don't get special treatments when they have a death in the family, and he shouldn't either. They also brought up that he is kind of an asshole. He's had issues before. Trying to ban pork from the break room, trying to get female dress codes changed. \n\nHe certainly dug his own grave, but given the circumstances, I feel like his comments about the Irish is what ultimately did him in. My boss wouldn't have known if I hadn't told him. Am I the asshole? \n\nTL:DR coworker made me late to meeting in order to invite me to a religious event and began harassing me. I told my boss, and now he is effectively blacklisted from the industry.  ",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend have been together since last year, but have known each other for a few (very vaguely). We started talking briefly on snapchat about life and stuff and I found her quite interesting, but not as a romantic interest as I was with my ex-girlfriend at the time and she was with her ex-boyfriend. We spoke semi-often, but gradually more. As time went on we gained trust in each other and we confided in each other. At the time we were speaking, we had discussed a lot of personal things. Both of our previous relationships were 5+ years long, even though we were both 23 or under at the time, and both of us had been cheated on multiple times. We never once discussed it, but a week or two into us talking, we both broke up with our other halves at the same time because we were interested in each other. Nothing happened between us before that, but it took literally a few days after us finishing things with our ex's to go on our first date. The day after we found out we were both single, basically.\n\nWe were emotionally invested in each other before we were single, but both of our ex's had cheated on us multiple times, and we both broke it off without discussing it with each other prior. I think we did the right thing, and went by the 'if you could cheat on someone, just break up with them' and did. Did we? We live together now, treat each other right, and are both appreciating how in love we are and how pleasant it is that we have complete trust in each other, having previously experienced how much cheating hurts. I feel like the shit we went through has only made us stronger as a couple. We've been through some shit in our time but we're here for each other now, and I think we were justified in how this happened. Tough shit for our asshole exes... right?",

      "description": "So quick background here,\n\nI’ve (M25) been living with my GF (F26) and my roommate (M24) for about a year now. \n\nMy GF used to live in Pakistan where she states her and all the females in her family were treated like second class humans. \n\nMy roommate was born and raised in the states. \n\nSince we’ve been living together his GF (F22) comes over to hangout about 3-4 times a week. Although that number is closer to 0-2 times a week now. \n\nMy roommate frequently gets drunk, and when he gets drunk he likes to start arguments. Typically these arguments are with his GF. Last nights was a screaming match over what was better Deadpool or some random Netflix movie. \n\nInstead of being a regular human conversation it scaled to him screaming at his GF. Bringing out all his insecurities on her and eventually kicking her out. This happens in many ways shapes and forms multiple times a week. \n\nI was raised by a single mother, I guess I have an overly protective affinity towards women. As o threatened to put my roomate through the wall when he started screaming at my GF one time. \n\nAll in all his screaming is the closest you can get to violence without hitting a person. I think it’s vile and disgusting, I don’t plan on resigning the lease. My GF on the other hand thinks that I’m an asshole for even thinking such things. And is upset that I would talk shit about out “friend” by calling him a vile human being. \n\nI try to avoid their altercations all together and only once stuck my nose in their arguing. And that’s because I was stuck in a car with them. That ended with roommate drunk\nDriving to his moms house and sucking on the barrel of a shotgun threatening to kill him self. \n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole for thinking his behavior is barbaric. Is it normal and regular for men,,, no HUMANS. To scream people to tears and them to submission?\n\nTl:dr\nMy roommate screams his GF into tears multiple times a week. My GF thinks I’m a piece of shit for even voicing my opinion on how vile and wrong I think it is. ",

      "title": "AITA going after my BnB host?",
      "description": "I posted this in tales from the customer and AirBnB and I got some pretty toxic responses and PM's. I thought I was at least neutral, but a couple people called me crazy and more called me an asshole. So I'll post it here, this isn't for affirmation, I legitimately am worried I need to apologize. TLDR at the end.\n\n\nFTP, On mobile, I've never had a story worth posting before this.\n\n\nSet up of the story:\n\nThis was my first vacation without my parents.\n\nI reserved my spot at a 3 bed 2 bath home all to myself and my girlfriend 2 months in advance.\n\nMy mandatory must have filters for finding a suitable BnB: \n\nFree parking on premises, not on the street.\n\nKitchen fully stocked with cookware.\n\nA house to myself, no apartments no duplexes, no shared walls or other people's noises.\n\nWiFi\n\nAfter reserving my spot for 4 days; I ask the host to send more pictures of the place as the pictures posted are badly taken and do not show much. I get an excuse that he is redoing the landscaping so my request is impossible to accommodate.\n\n\nOnto the real story:\n\n\nI arrive at 1:45. Check in is at 2pm. I tell the host we are in town at a restaurant and we will arrive soon.\n\nI arrive and immediately realised why the pictures were the way they were. He would stand on top of the things he knew would be unacceptable and picture everything else.\n\nThe 3 bedroom house I rented is now a 3 apartment duplex that used to be a 3 bedroom house before the host renovated it himself. \n\nThere were 5 active spider webs.\n\nThe \"driveway\" is sand and rocks raked into a rectangle, smaller than my car was.\n\nThe WiFi never worked and the router was locked in a closet or another apartment I didn't have the key to, the host knew within minutes of my arrival, never fixed.\n\nThe kitchen had 1 plate, a microwave, 3 forks, 1 tea spoon, and a stove top made in the 1940s with 14 step instructions lamanated to the front of it. No cups, no bowls, no pots, no pans, no cooking utensils, not even a butter knife to be found. So as far as I'm concerned there was no kitchen.\n\nSo I search the house for cameras: Removing everything from bookcases and putting it back, Opening everything that was not locked and closing it again, moving all furniture, and analysing every light switch and outlet.\n\nThe bedroom door had a lock ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT that could not be manipulated from inside the room. I had a major problem with this my entire stay. It was a single sided deadbolt like you put on your front door.\n\nThe host then parked in my BnBs \"driveway\" for about 30% of my stay.\n\nAfter my search me and my girlfriend strip in the living room and make sure the bed frame was properly constructed. I then walk back out to the living room to find that a spider bigger than a quarter had given birth onto my shirt. There are hundreds, I sprayed with raid and left the shirt at my check out.\n\nI then find a mosquito I did not kill on the refrigerator, and a 4 month old cockroach husk near the complementary food.\n\nSo I give a 2 Star overall review (which I thought was generous) stating the truth. It was nicely renovated, but falsely advertised (1 bed, 1 bath, no kitchen) and not clean in the least.\n\nThe host then starts personally attacking me in his response to my review, and claims the place was dirty because of my early arrival. He then also said that I must be lieing as I posted no pictures in my review (I didn't know this was a thing) but neither of those are the catcher:\n\nHe then says,\" this man ransacked my home every day of his stay looking for cameras and microphones.\"\n\nNow let's pause for a second and think about that. I took pictures to make sure I placed all the books in the same order and orientation as when I found them. How did he know I did things like this every day I was there, without a camera.\n\nSo I reported it to BnB and sent all the pictures and screenshots i took. BnB then offered to and later refunded me 40% of my stay and the cleaning fee, I just hope I really am paranoid and there was no camera.\n\nHe lost his Super Host status, at least temporarily, but I've been told I shouldn't claim this as my doing.\n\nTldr: host buys a 3 bed 2 bath house and loads it on BnB then after 10 reviews he cut the house into 3 different Bnb's, making 2 new listings (all saying full house with kitchen and bedrooms) Never changed the listing. After I gave a accurate review the man insulted my honor and made a statement that pointed to a camera being in the apartment. I then got offered a hefty refund and he lost super host status. \n\nJust to say: I have proof in pictures. I will no longer send it to a random user, as it contains personal information. I'll send all proof to a mod of asked to, and only if asked to by a mod.\n",

      "description": "I am a high schooler, and this happened close to the beginning of the school year. There was a kid last year who graduated last year that I kind of knew. He and his family are British, and lived in the US for a couple of years. In one of my classes, there was another kid in the grade level below me that also had somewhat of a British accent. Now, at my school, this was probably the only other person that I knew that had a British accent, so I assumed that he might have been brother’s with the British high school graduate, especially considering that they had some similar features. Therefore, to solve my curiosity, I asked him one day if he was the brother of the student that graduated last year. He said yes. Then, I responded by saying “I kind of figured you were because of the accent”. Once I said that, he kind of had an annoyed/irked look on his face, and walked away. Maybe he didn’t like being noticed for his accent, or thought I was making a misguided judgement? I’m not exactly sure why he seemed a bit annoyed. So, AIMA for assuming a sibling connection based on an accent, and pointing it out?",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment?",
      "description": "posting this from a new account because I'm kind of trying to start over on reddit after the last week...\n\nMaybe a month ago I met this guy on Tinder. It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?",

      "description": "  For context this was a closing shift the day before thanksgiving. The store was already closed, but of course there were still a bunch of people being checked out. Also I'm not a cashier and I get to clock out as soon as I get my department clear of all customers. \n\n  Okay so, after an exhausting day of working in the grocery department the day before thanksgiving, me and my team member do our final walkthrough and declare grocery all clear and head up to clock out. I clock out, say bye to my girl and head towards the exit. \n\n  Im already pretty close to the door when i hear my name. I turn around not knowing who called it and do a quick scan to see who called my name. I couldn't tell who called me and visibly shrug (to show whoever said my name that I couldn't tell where they were). I take a couple more steps towards that glorious exit and Hear my name called out again, I turn around again to see who called me and see a cashier wave at me. \n\nConvo as follows: me- me, cashier-cw\n  We're like pretty far away from each other at this point, i wanna say like 6 registers and a selfcheckout area away. Im not good at guessing distance, also we have to kinda yell to hear each other. I was literally in front of the exit.\nCW: Hey! [My name]!\nMe: yes?\nCW: I need your help. Come here.\nI did not want to walk all the way over there, my legs were killing me.\nMe: Uh, but I'm clocked out. [Also were told that if we're ever asked for anything when clocked out to let the guest know we're off the clock. Her being a team member I thought she'd get the hint.]\nCW: I know.\nMe: Okay then, BYE! \nI then turned around and walked right out the exit. \n\n  In my head I thought to myself,  that I was tired and clocked out, and I really didn't care that this last minute shopper needed something that this cashier couldn't help with. Also she could've just paged someone on the clock to help her.\n\n  I worked today, 2 days after this happened and asked the gal in my department if she thought i was rude to the cashier. \n\n  She then told me that she happened to walk by the cashier who then stopped her as she was passing (she was already clocked too btw) to ask for her help. Turns out the cashier needed help because the  guest was actually a shopper I had helped earlier. \n  (I had pulled some side dish tins from the back for the guest and went to go give them to her. She was not in the aisle she'd said she would be. After circling the whole  department a few times I gave the item to my team member and told her to keep an eye out for the guest. I still had tasks to complete. And I did them, and never saw the guest again. )\n  The girl in my department then had the cashier page a clocked in team member so she could tell them where to get the tins. \n\nI feel kinda bad, I asked a few people if they thought I was rude. And one told me to see it from her perspective. What if I had needed help?  But, i would never bother a clocked out coworker, i always ask if they're clocked in, and if they are not I always apologize and find someone else. \n\nTldr: coworker asked for help, i told her I was clocked out. She said she knew that, so I said okay, bye,  and then left.",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom.\nSo, a good few years ago my younger brother had a daughter (I'll name her 'L'). My brother lives 4 doors down from my mother and took full advantage of the fact he basically had a baby sitter where he could take L and go run errands/work etc. My mother got a bit sick of this as she felt like she was taken advantage of.\nSo opted to start charging my bro a £5er (about $8/$9) each time he took L around and left her there.\n\nAs my Bro is a bit of a cheapskate, he stopped taking L around as often, opting to take his daughter with him on errands.\n\nFast forward 4 years, I have my first son in Jan 2018. For the first 5 months my amazing wife bends over backwards for him. During this time my mother in law visited constantly, helped my wife whilst I was at work. Including taking my son for a day or so, so that my wife could catch up on sleep and other odd jobs. My mother visited *twice*, which only happened due to me calling her and prompting her to come visit. (we live 3 miles away, about 10 minutes by car maximum). \n\n When my wife needs to return to work (I'm a full time chef, so work 5 x 12 days a week usually). We arrange childcare with our parents to save on childcare costs, as we're saving for our own house we cant afford to put my son in a nursery. \n\nMy mother in law is to have my son on Monday and Thursdays. I look after him Tuesdays and Wednesdays (my set days off from work) and my mother takes him the Friday. My wife has him on the weekend. \n(This is only whilst we're at work, my wife collects him when she finishes work. usually from 9am till 5pm, with the exception of Fridays which is 9am till 2pm)\nAfter a month I get a text requesting from my mother asking me to pay her. \nAfter a bit of a debate, I cave and just give her some money. \n\nFast forward a month or so, it's the six weeks school holidays. So my wife (a secondary school teacher) is off work for 6 weeks. During this time, the mother in law does her usual helping out. Takes my son for a day, comes around and supports my wife etc. \nMy mother doesn't see hkm at all. \n\nThe only time my mother sees my son, her only grandson. Is when I pay her to do it.\n\nI really don't want to pay her. To the point that I actually feel like cutting my mother out of his life. \n\nAITA? \n\n\nFYI, we pay for food/milk/activities that either mother/mother in law does. So this charge I have to pay my mother isn't to cover expenses such as that. \n\nMother in law works as a locum Dr on tues/weds other than that she's retired. My mother hasn't worked for approx 18 years.\n\nTL;DR\nMy mother in law sees her grandson all the time. My mother only sees her grandson, if I pay her to  do so, but I don't want to pay her to be part of his life. \n\nApologies for format, I'm on mobile. \n",

      "description": "Im 16 if thats somehow relevant.\nMy sister(18) wanted to borrow our switch for the day. Not a big deal, we got it as a shared christmas present a little less then 2 years ago.\n\nShe wanted to take it to work all day and then after work take it to a party for her and her friends to use.\n\nI wanted to use it during the day and have her pick it up after work sense she wasnt going to be playing it at work and i wanted to play stardew valley.\n\nShe said that she was going to diner with her friends right after work and because of that(woeking past a little when it starts) she would be late, and she would be extra late if she went back to our house and picked it up(15 min drive). Where they are eating is undecided. So if it was close to our house or something for easy pick up it is unknown.\n\nShe said since she doesnt use it as much as me she automactically gets it no arguement. I said that was dumb and that she doesnt automatically get it.\n\nMy parents said she gets it. I suggest that we drop it off at her work or she picks it up after the meal. \n\nMy parents said she gets it and i said that there is no compromise here, so to fight that i have spent over 100 dollars on controllers and around that same amount on games too. So she gets the shared part but neither the games i paid for(smash, splatoon, minecraft, 2 wired controllers and a pro controller) or the controllers.\n\n I say sense its a shared thing she can pay half for everything ive bought or not use what ive bought. In the end my dad said he would drive them to my sisters work 15 min away and drop them off. But right after he said get out of my room and glared at me. The way he said gave me the feeling he was gonna try to do everything in his ability to work agaisn't me so i just let my sister use the switch and my stuff\n\nTldr: sister wants to take our switch to work and not use it all day but after work use it at a party. Shes gonna be late to the dinner before the party and even later if she has to pick them up. I said she could pick it up after the before party dinner(at a restaurant)or after the meal. I wanted to use it while she was at work and she wouldent  be using it at work anyway. My parents sided with her, i said there is no compromise here. Then tried to take the stuff i bought with my own money (controllers and games) and then my dad gave me a threat that seemed like it would just end really bad in my favor. So i caved and she took everything to work even though i still think its bullshit. Im prob gonna give my dad the silent treatment because of this for a while. And he still seems mad at me.\n\n(Sorry for typos and anything else wrong my grammar and spelling is ass)\n\nSo reddit am i the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "To start, throwaway account for reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of a long story because I want all the details out there so I can know if I am wrong to think this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in an apartment complex with my roommate and a month ago (first week of December) I got off work at night and found a stray cat pressed up against our door. I brought it inside and it eventually warmed up to us after a few days. During this time, we were doing everything we could to find the owners. I was looking on pages on FaceBook for stray cats, we called multiple shelters asking about missing cats, and even went to our landlord to see if they had any missing cat reports. The landlord said there was one cat reported missing and gave us the number to call. We called the number and a lady and her husband came over and said the cat we found was not theirs. We then took the cat to the vet to get it checked for a chip and sure enough it was chipped. We were given information to contact the chip company and did so. They found two numbers attached to the chip and said they would get back into contact with us when they received word from the owner. We received a call back later that night and the chip company told us they tried both numbers and got no response. The first number they tried twice and both times it just kept ringing without going to a voicemail. The second number did go to a voicemail and they left a message and told us when the owners called back we would hear from the chip company. We waited at least a week (still trying to find anything about this missing cat) and never got a call back from the chip company (we gave them both of our phone numbers so it is not like they tried calling and it got missed). At this point we didn't want to keep the cat just yet so we called the humane league near us, explained the situation, and asked what we should do. We were told that at this point if no contact has been made the owners don't care about the cat and are not actively looking for it; it was ours to keep. We decided to keep it because we have been wanting to get a cat recently. We took care of and loved this animal for a month now, playing with it all day, taking it to the vet, paying the expenses to get shots for it, medicine to clean its ears out (it had earmites when we found it), and other household essentials for a cat. Today, though, I was leaving my apartment to go to work and when I opened my door my next door neighbor was going to their apartment. They saw the cat in my apartment as the door was closing and asked if I had found their cat (they called it by the original name that only the old owners would know). They showed me a FaceBook post of the cat they made about a month ago saying that it was missing. Obviously at this point I had no choice but to give the cat back because it was clearly theirs. I did so and now I just do not feel right having done so. For details, these neighbors have been nothing but loud and annoying since we moved in about 2 years ago. They are up at all hours of the night (we have heard them stomping around at the hours of 2-4 AM), they have 1 or 2 children that cry pretty much all the time (this mostly results with the parents screaming at the kids to shut up and doing nothing else to stop it. As I was writing this post I heard a child bawling its eyes out only to hear the mom start imitating its cry back to it and the dad screaming \"shut up!!\"), about once a week (or more) the adults engage in screaming fights at each other, and they play really loud EDM music at random times (like REALLY loud). I understand that children are going to cry but the way I hear them handle those situations just does not seem good. My roommate told me that he talked to the neighbor while I was at work and asked about how the cat got out and why they didn't contact anybody outside of making a FaceBook post. They told them that the cat probably got out from doors being opened and closed. They live in the upstairs apartment which has a stairwell that has two doors the cat would have had to have gone through to get out. I have always noticed that their front door is often cracked and never fully shut which explains how the cat got out. He also explained the earmites situation to them and was told they got it taken care of but did nothing when the earmites came back. This kind of reckless behavior is what makes me think they don't deserve the cat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me it does not seem like this is a good home for this loving, sweet cat and I am heartbroken to have had to give it back. My instinct tells me that I am the asshole in this situation because I could not imagine losing a pet and having someone else keep it. However, I feel that my roommate and I were taking (and would take) better care of that animal. I just cannot understand why someone who is missing a cat would only make a FaceBook post about it and then do nothing else. They didn't knock on any neighbor's doors, they didn't put up any flyers, they didn't go to any shelters to report it, and they didn't even go to the landlord about the cat. My roommate and I have been loving this cat to no end for the past month and I just don't feel right having given it back to people who don't even seem to care about it. Please set me straight if I am being an asshole here. ",

      "description": "Here’s the story, it happened two years ago but it’s on my mind constantly. I often wonder if there’s something I could have done differently. \n\nSo I was friends with a guy, known him for about 20 years. He’s with his partner for 10 years. We’re all very close at the time, text daily, see each other about once a week, vacations, etc. So they get engaged, I’m part of the proposal, and I’m asked to be in their wedding which I happily accepted. \n\nA few months after their engagement, I took a different job, one that paid me substantially less but provided me with more peace of mind. I was honest with them that I wasn’t sure that I would be able to afford everything that was entailed in being in the wedding party, and they said we could make it work. \n\nIn the beginning of the year, I asked multiple times if we were going dress shopping etc since I know how long it takes sometimes to get dresses in and altered. I get a text back from them, they would like to meet with me and talk about things. They come over, say that they don’t think I’m as enthused about the wedding as I was before, and they’re giving me this opportunity to bow out. All three of us cried during this discussion, I was super embarrassed about my finances since taking the new job, and when I went over my budget for their wedding, we all decided it was reasonable and could make it work. We go out dress shopping, buy the dress. \n\nWe threw them an elaborate and EXPENSIVE shower, way over budget but I was making do. During the shower, I got the distinct feeling I was being iced out by the bridal party and the grooms. Continued to have a good time, even went so far as to discuss possible ideas with them for a bachelor party so that we can have one last hurrah. We begin texting, everyone provided dates for weekend availability, and we decided on two weekends that were not good for any of us in June. We then all get a text from the MOH that the bachelor party is one of the weekends I’m 100% not available. But fine, I can do one night just not two as I was free Friday night but not Saturday. However then I got a summons for federal jury duty in City A...which was about 75 miles away from the bachelor party we were having in City B. By the time I would have been released from jury duty, I wouldn’t have been able to get to City B timely. I texted the MOH and told her I wouldn’t be able to make it but let me know details so I can contribute and I wanted to have a bottle sent over from me for dinner. No response. \n\nTwo months before the wedding, the groom asks me to meet him for dinner. We have a nice two hour meal, laughing, everything is fine. At the end of the meal, he says I want to talk to you about the wedding. I said ok, what do you need me to do! Not exaggerating, I was happy to help. He said “you’re making me stressed out, you’re not coming to the bachelor party, and I don’t want you to be in the wedding anymore ok thanks.” And I’m like shattered and shocked and I’m like why is this happening, because I 1) can’t physically get to the bachelor party for both nights, 2) can’t make it because of jury duty, and 3) can’t really afford it anyways but I was doing the best I could? He said I was being negative, and he then had no answer when I asked how or why. He stormed out of the restaurant, and I haven’t spoken to him since. I wasn’t invited to the wedding, and I know I was the topic of conversation there, and I know the grooms didn’t exactly tell the truth with the circumstances of my absence. \n\nSo I’m not sure what I could have done differently. I did reach out to him after the dinner and said I hope we can work past this, and after time goes by maybe we can be cool again. I did, however, ask him for the money for my dress since it was already paid for and non-refundable per the store, and to his credit, he wrote me a check after me asking twice. I miss his friendship obviously but I don’t think he’s the same person I became friends with, and I don’t really want to know the new guy who he’s become. So AITA in any way here? If I am...I want to make amends for this and put this all behind me. \n\nTL; DR - in a wedding party for a friend of 20+ years, and kicked out because I couldn’t afford nor attend the bachelor party \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for making a pregnant business owner cry with negative feedback?",
      "description": "\nThe title is super TLDR. But essentially: I started learning aerial silks in 2016 at a major circus school in my city. They have a production company too and they're very well-known. They had a small training space though and I could only do one class a week there due to the timing and types of classes they ran, so after two years there I searched for another studio to train at.\n\nSo this little studio. It was in the garage of the owner's parent's workplace where she paid no rent. The owner we shall call Jay. Some of the crash mats were mattresses, the rigging points were super close together (which meant you can touch other people while in the air which is the biggest no-no ever), the floor was concrete and such. The lessons were super unstructured and it was all very casual but I liked that because my other studio was so structured and I was skilled enough to know my limits and just learn new skills. After being there for about 6 months, Jay announced she was pregnant which was great. I asked her at the time if she would stop teaching at a certain point and she said yep when she was physically unable to. \n\nThere were a few other issues I had with this place but I had  o other choice but to go there because there was nothing else around - she didn't let us use any grip aids (even pro performers use liberal grip aids like chalk or rosin), she taught pekple things above their skill level and she constantly posted on the Facebook training page singling people out for doing things she didn't like but without naming them - but everyone would know who she was talking about. \n\nAfter two months of her pregnancy, she stopped being physically able to do the moves. She started teaching her classes as 'self-guided lessons\" - essentially her sitting on a beanbag on her phone while we \"taught ourselves\". I needed the extra training time as I had a show on soon so I kept going but I was getting increasingly frustrated as we paid the same amount as for any other class who had a teacher teaching them. One time Jay just chatted to one student who she was obviously friends with outside of the studio for the entire lesson. One time she turned up in a dress and just said she had had a hard day and wouldn't be teaching, then sat down and ate while us students just kind of fucked around on the silks.\n\nThen in November I started doing a move which I thought I would be able to do as she had taught it to people much less advanced than me. She saw me doing it and said \"good job\" and not much else. I then fell out of it, dropping the weight of my whole body into my wrist suddenly. I felt sick with the pain, then went and sat down for the rest of the lesson. I went overseas the next day so I had no choice but to wear a wrist brace for the whole time. She never told me the key point about keeping a certain portion of the silk close to me. I know I chose to do the move but it was her duty to guide me through it when she saw me doing it. Another time I did a move I had learnt from my primary studio and another girl expressed the desire to do it - Jay guided her through it and I watched as she did it completely wrong. I didn't say anything as it wasn't my place.\n\nRecently a few other students found themselves being asked to show other students certain moves in lieu of the teachers. This has become the norm here.\n\nOn the odd occasion, when people have broached the subject of issues with her, she came back at them with an excuse. When I told her I found her lack of instruction difficult due to talking to another girl the WHOLE lesson, she told me it was because she hadn't seen her in sooooo long. She always has a defensive excuse.\n\nIn December, my main studio announced they were moving to a bigger premises and would have way more classes on. I decided at that point that I would train there fulltime. In January, Jay posted saying she was raising the price of her studio up to $22 a class - at the main, well established one I go to, it's $15 a lesson. My main studio is run by ex-Cirque du Soleil performers who have been featured on TV many times and often have big news articles about them in my city. She is self-taught, immature and not running her classes well. My choice was clear - train with the pros. But after she announces her price increase, many of the students there started talking about how unaffordable and ridiculous it was. Many students boycotted her classes. Many cited (to each other, because nobody wanted to approach Jay about this) that it was difficult with a lack of grip aids, that the mats slipped out from underneath them, that they didn't like using one rigging point in particular because you can touch the rigging with your toes (terrible safety issue!) and so on. She even messaged one girl who had recently lost her father (in a single sentence) that she was sorry to hear about her dad and she hoped to see her back in class soon. Wtf! Jay took to the Facebook group to defend her decision to raise her prices so much, saying that her studio is \"inclusive\" (all circus spaces in my country are fucking female-dominant), that she would happily pay that much for her classes (well easy for you to say), that her prices are not much more expensive than any other studio in the city (not sure where she got that because you can view all her prices online and they do not match at all) and that we should be grateful for the space she has provided us. The main regular group of us probably broght her $600 a week that she suddenly wasn't getting. The post was clearly aimed at about 7 of us.\n\nI snapped. Another girl and I decided to write an email. I detailed all the reasons why people had left. I had already decided to leave at this point but I couldn't handle knowing that she honestly thought it was all price and not safety issues or teaching issues. I wrote a blunt email and made it anonymous cos I had a feeling she would rate about it and single me out. I didn't lie, I didn't swear. I was blunt and said things like \"you think it's all down to money, but it's not.\" I told her that her prices are ridiculous considering her lack of credentials and especially when you consider you could learn somewhere run by a professional couple who toured with Cirque du Soleil for years for $7 a class cheaper. \n\nHer boyfriend (who I had never met in my life) replied to me saying \"who the fuck is this?\" from his work email. That was all. I replied saying I wouldn't be saying my name as I didn't want to become a fucking punching back for him. He replied with a massive email, calling me a childish shit, telling me I was an anonymous keyboard warrior with a cruel approach, and that I had made a 29 week pregnant woman sad and that Jay couldn't possibly respond without me \"owning up\" to my email and to never bother emailing again. It was a horrifying swearing tirade. I shared the email with the other girl and she was so hurt by it all, as she had brought so much business to Jay and spent so much money there. I had never in my life received such an unprofessional email reply from any business owner, big or small. In my mind (as someone who is part of a family run and created business) the correct reply would have been something like \"I'm sorry you've had such a bad experience and thank you for the feedback.\" And that's that.\n\nThe kicker is, within a week I saw online that things had changed - Jay had bought grip aid for everyone to use, she had put velcro under the sliding mats and changed up the space to be a lot less 'concrete and filing boxes' and more airy and green - yeah the bitch took on some of my advice despite the fact that it apparently meant nothing as I had not put my name to it.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for sending her negative anonymous feedback? Should I have just turned my back on the studio and trained elsewhere and left her to think it was all money and not bothered to say anything? ",

      "description": "Here's the backstory. My girlfriend (23) (I'm 25) and I have been dating for 3 years now but due to life events we currently are living 5 hours apart so we don't get to see each other as often as we'd like but are willing to stick it out for another year. We had a pretty healthy sex life up until the point where we had to move apart. After the move, we would only see each other maybe 2-3 weekends a month which sometimes resulted in us not having sex. It's important to note that she isn't a  very sexually driven person, so on weekends where we wouldn't have sex she'd say something to the extent of she wasn't in the mood for that at the time. We would then both agree to stop and usually end up going  to bed or watching Netflix or something. Sometimes we'd go 2, 3, or even more than 4 weeks without being intimate with each other. It's also important to note I'm a pretty sexually driven person myself, so  sometimes she'd feel bad that it had been so long and we'd do it just to do it and both of us would feel soooooo much better and closer to each other.\n\nHowever these gaps started to become more and more common the longer we are apart and even asking for pictures would turn into a disagreement of some kind. She said from the start that if I ever needed to get it off she was more than okay with it, but asking for help instead of using porn seemed only to be causing more problems.\n\nSo to spice things up we decided to buy a vibrator and some other sex toys for the next time we were together, I sent them to her place so she could take a look at them before we used them as she was nervous about it and had never seen or used one before. We agreed that we'd use them together which is why we ended up buying the toys that we did.\n\nBefore this past weekend it had been 4 weeks since we've seen each other, nevermind each other naked. We had talked all week about the possibility of getting that Marvin Gaye sexual healing on,  which she admitted turned her on when we talked about it. The day before I arrived she decided that she was in the mood and couldn't resist trying out the vibrator. Without even mentioning it to me so  I could at least share and enjoy the moment with her  and get off myself too she just went ahead and used it. Even though we decided it was for both of us to enjoy.\n\nWhen I asked her if she was still in the mood this past weekend she admitted she used the vibrator and no longer wanted to have sex. I got quite upset saying it had been over a month for me, and that I held back from doing anything until we saw each other because we had agreed to use the toys together and get each other off once we finally were together again. It escalated into a larger fight and she ended up throwing my phone at me cutting open my forehead. I ended up packing my things right away and left to stay with a friend who lived close by before driving home in the morning.\n\nAITA for that?",

      "title": "AITA for interrupting HIIT?",
      "description": "So, this was at a YMCA and was not a group or with any trainer involvement, but as happened twice. \n\nFor starters I'm a somewhat petite dude, 5'9'' about 140 lbs and trying to put on some mass. This particular Y doesn't have sign-up sheets for any equipment, either.\n\nI use the TRX and plyo boxes for my exercise routine.  I also use the free weights, cardio, etc and always put everything away when I am done with it.\n\nSo I was going to use the plyo boxes, which were all stacked as if someone was using them.  After using the free weights for about ten minutes I go over to use them, and this (much larger) dude comes out of nowhere and says that he's in the middle of his workout regime.  I say fine and back off and do some other exercises.\n\nAfter he said that to me, he decided to do some bench pressing and never even went to the boxes.  So I went over and used them and he confronted me, and I said \"It looks like you were using the weights. If you aren't actively using this you don't get to do it.\"\nHe responded that he was using it for his high-intensity interval training, to which I said that you can only use one piece of equipment as a time, it's all shared.\nHe looked at me incredulously and stomped off.\nAbout halfway through my kettlebell-crunches (sorry, I don't know what the actual name of the exercises are) he comes up to me and says \"can't you do that on the bench? I just want to hop on quick\" and I told him he'd half to wait until I was done and he was being quite rude, he said that I messed up his whole routine and went over to the treadmill. \n\nPretty much the same thing happened later in the week, when again the boxes weren't being used and this guy said he was \"about to use it for his HIIT\"  By now I am pretty annoyed at these HIIT people because they leave their weights and everything out the whole time they are in the gym.  So I asked him how long it would take and he said until he was finished. I asked him if he was a trainer or with one, and he said \"No\" both times in a tone like he couldn't believe that someone was asking him about it.  So I said \"This is a shared space, you don't get to camp out on equipment until you're ready to use it\"  So I started my workout and he was staring at me so I said, \"Do you understand?\"  And he said, \"Yeah, conversation over!\"  and just turned away.\n\n\nI've started preferring to go to the gym in the morning, where the demographics are more the silver sneakers crowd than grunting muscleheads hogging the equipment.  It really infuriates me that they think they get to make everyone wait until they are all finished, even though they aren't even actively using the equipment!\n\n\nSo I feel like I'm not an asshole but also not well-versed enough on gym etiquette to know for sure.  Thank you.",

      "description": "I’m 24 and my brother “Sean” is 14. He came out to me around 4 months ago and I’m the only one he has told so far. I’ve always loved him no matter what and I really don’t care that he’s gay. We’ve gotten closer over the past 4 years, despite our ten year age gap. \n\nHe came to me yesterday asking me if I would come with him to tell our parents that he’s gay. Our parents have expressed some not so nice views about the lgbt community, such as they shouldn’t be able to marry, it’s a sickness, etc. He says he wants my support in case it goes bad and that he’s really nervous. \n\nWhat Sean doesn’t get though, is that my relationship with our parents is far from ideal, but because he was so young, he doesn’t understand how bad it actually was. \n\nI have a pretty serious history of bad behaviour and addiction. I don’t want to get into specifics but it was bad enough where my parents thought I was just dead for a couple months because I went completely off the grid for a long time on benders. I stole from a lot of people in the process and completely lost the trust of my parents. \n\nI only got clean when I was 22 and my parents still don’t trust me two years later. They accuse me of being manipulative and selfish and maybe I still am. But Sean wasn’t even 12 years old when all this happened and while he’s not completely in the dark, he doesn’t really understand just how many bridges were burned. \n\nSo now he has asked me to come to support him when he comes out to our parents, people who don’t trust me. \n\nSo I told him that I don’t think it would be a good idea if I was there because my presence might make everything worse and the focus might shift to me. \n\nHe got really upset and accused me of not being there for him. I tried my best to explain everything to him about why I wouldn’t come but he said that he has no one else to come with him because I’m the only one who knows. \n\nI offered the suggestion that maybe he goes and tells someone else first, like a friend or one of our aunts, and maybe they can come with him but he said that he chose me because he trusts me the most. This really hurt me but I stuck with my answer and he stormed off. \n\nI’ve tried texting him but he won’t respond to anything I say. It’s not that I don’t want to be there for him. I would like nothing more than to be there for him as his older brother. I just think that me being there in this situation would be a really really bad idea. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be there when he comes out? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "this is gonna be long but here goes\n\nmy best friend (21F) N, her boyfriend, and our other two best friends K and M (21F) took a trip to florida about a year ago (i know this is late but i’m still angry). we were all kind of annoyed by her bringing her boyfriend cus it was supposed to be our trip but we just kinda got over it.\n\nwe were staying at her grandmothers and the whole time and she kept kind of leaving us to ourselves to be with her boyfriend. this would’ve been fine, except we had all equally paid to rent a car (under her name) and she would either take it or ask us to drive them somewhere. but the catch was we weren’t allowed to go do anything fun without her while she was with her BF or she’d get mad at us. K, M, and i kind of agreed to just let it slide and have a conversation with N about how we felt when we got back home.\n\nour last two nights there we went to Universal. the original plan was to go to city walk after, which if you don’t know is a string of nightclubs and such that opens after universal closes. the first night i was to be the designated driver, and the second night K was supposed to be. the first night went ok, kind of boring. we were all exhausted because we’d been up since 6am for universal, so i said i was gonna go nap in the car and wait for everybody which i did. M and K left N and her boyfriend to go eat. M later told me that N was crying on the way home, but to this day i don’t know why. \n\nthe second day we told N in the morning that none of us wanted to go to city walk after, and she said “well i do” and shut the door in our faces. that night came and we made an agreement with her; we don’t want to drink, but you go enjoy yourself for a few hours.\n\nwe spent the next four hours talking about how we’d address N when we got back because we didn’t like her behavior. it was a very positive conversation, we were genuinely trying to approach the relationship positively in a way that wouldn’t make her feel like we were ganging up on her. at the end of this four hours we were fucking EXHAUSTED, so we texted her and said we wanted to go home. her boyfriend had been bragging the whole trip about how he makes so much money, so we said “hey were really tired, if you’re not ready to leave how about you and pawel take a cab back and we’ll drive home? or you drive and we take a cab.” she responded by saying “you don’t make the rules and you’re not taking that car anywhere without me.” a text fight ensued, and we left the keys to the car in the tire and called a cab (it’s a 2 hour drive).\n\nN comes home hours later and her grandmother was angry with her. she came outside our room and said “honestly, you can all go fuck yourselves.” so we left. we went to a hotel and got our flight the next day without her.\n\nwe haven’t spoken to this day but our mutual friends always tell us that she swears we fucked her over for leaving her possibly drunk with the key in a tire of a rental car. are we the assholes?",

Because I have a zero tolerance policy  on driving drunk. So I asked if we could stay over (she has the room for it). She said it would be okay so we setup an air mattress and stuff. Because there now longer is a time limit on the evening we keep drinking and hanging out smoking some weed. \n\nAt this moment I see signs that usually start when these two above mentioned friends do their thing. And me being drunk (although I'm quite sure I would've said this even when sober). Could you please keep it in your pants for one evening and let us all have some decent sleep. This because even though she has room for a the 4 of us her bedroom doesn't have a door (it's on a weird floor layout) and the apartment is quite noisy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich they didn't take too kindly and got mad at me the host telling me that it's her house and she'll do whatever she damn well pleases. The guy to drunk and high doesn't really say anything. This leads into a small argument where I tell her it's fine that you wanna fuck him I just don't wanna hear it when I'm trying to sleep. To which she responds then why did you stay. I \"tell\" her that she knows why and it's a stupid response. Eventually things kinda settle down due to another guy pooring new drinks and challenging me and the other guy to a chug contest, which kinda gets the party mood back on track. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all go to sleep and because the argument must've taken away some of the sexual tension I got a good night's sleep. The day after she texts me that she didn't like the way I acted and I reply that I just voiced my opinion and wanted to get some sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago but my family still gives me crap for it once in a while. It’s usually in a fun way but sometimes I get angry comments.\n\nFor Context, my family and I are Muslim, and according to Islam, when someone passes away, you’re supposed to bury them within 24 hours of their death, and hold memorial services 7 and 40 days after the funeral. Typically, the funeral is attended by close friends and family, then the memorials are attended by extended family and more distant friends. The funeral is all prayers and such, while the memorials are where you’re supposed deliver epitaphs/eulogies. \n\nBack in 2013, my grandmother passed. This woman was like a second mom to me. Loved her very dearly. So naturally, when she passed I wanted to speak at her memorial. No problem, right?\n\nNow typically these memorials last about an hour. 10 minutes for opening prayers, 20-30 minutes for a sermon, 10-20 minutes of family speaking, and 5-10 of closing prayers. No biggie, right? Well, this time the Sheikh (Cleric, Muslim analogue for a priest) spoke for way longer than he should have. Spoke for an hour. Naturally, I assumed people would’ve gotten antsy, since I was too. Well, he finally finished and introduced my dad to speak.\n\nBy this point people started getting up and milling about in the back, chit chatting. In my eyes, this was extremely rude. I can understand people wanting to go. That’s fine, get up and leave if you need to. But they’re talking in the back of the hall like it’s a party.\n\nDad speaks for about 2 minutes. Finally it’s my turn to speak. The chatter is getting louder. I stand up and recite a short prayer as a way to call for quiet. No dice. Mind you I’m on a microphone so there’s no way they didn’t hear me. So I started to speak more loudly. They responded by talking louder. I had it.\n\n“EXCUSE ME, BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE BACK, CHATTING? I UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE HAS RUN A BIT LONG, BUT PLEASE SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR THE DECEASED AND THOSE IN MOURNING BY TAKING YOUR CONVERSATION OUT OF THE MAIN HALL.”\n\nSome people ashamedly sat back down, some gave me dirty looks and left, some just talked more quietly. I finished my eulogy and walked off.\n\nMy family called my “display” disrespectful to the congregation. I maintain I was in the right, as it was a memorial service not a box social.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole here?",

She asked my husband to connect the two of them for a friendly meetup 8 months after meeting \"barguy\" and not seeing him again since. \"Barguy\" is dating someone else and said sorry, no. Weeks later my female friend invites my husband and I to casually stop by a public restauant/ bar near a store we shop at 30 min from home, she drinks at this bar with her coworkers whom we've never met. My husband's co-worker \"barguy\" was coincidentally a few miles away getting a tattoo and we asked him to stop by and show us. I overheard her whispering to her coworker that we're \"dirty\" for inviting \"barguyc to come to a bar she was at, even though we had to sit at a separate table from her because she didn't get a big enough table to accommodate even my husband and me, let alone barguy. I politely told her i overheard what she said and was sorry she took it that way,  but that nobody intended anthing dirty. She halfass apologized and then small talked. She is no longer speaking to me after she left the restaurant/bar. \n\n\n",

It's loud and disturbing to my sleep, and in my opinion it's also dangerous because this parking lot is directly connected to a public road and not separated by any sorts of sidewalks or buffers.\n\nA week or two ago I called the non-emergency number on them and I was forwarded to the dispatch number, which I felt bad about (I didn't think it was a serious enough issue to call the dispatch), and when I looked 30 minutes later they were gone. But today they're back, loud as ever, and all the roads are iced over right now which I think makes it even more dangerous (they could slip out of control and crash into a passing car). However, I don't want to be seen as a snitch or a killjoy, and I suppose the odds of somebody getting hit are relatively low. What say you?",

      "description": "This week is my school's musical, and I'm in the pit. I did audition, and I almost got cast in the lead role, but lost out to someone who the teachers liked more personally.\n\nMonday I posted to my Instagram story saying something to the effect of \"Other schools choose good musicals, we got a bad one, literally any other musical would be better (also I'm not blonde enough to get a role)\". I don't have any screencaps, so you'll have to trust me when I say that it was about the musical itself and not our production for it. A friend DMs me saying the post comes off as unnecessarily rude and may sound like undermining people's hard work. I do agree with her that my tone comes off as aggressive and write another post clarifying that my issue lies with the writing of the musical and not our take on it, and that I apologize if it came off as hurtful to anyone. I did delete the apology post after the original one disappeared, but now i realize that i should've either left it up or deleted the first post the first time someone DMd me about it.\n\nOn Wednesday, I get to school and my friend/stand partner (who doesn't have instagram) asked if I posted anything mean about the cast. Turns out someone saw the post and started this telephone game about how I don't like the cast/think they're doing a bad job or something like that, including allegedly telling one of the teachers. I know that whoever started talking about me doesn't know me well because my friends would never do that.\n\nMy plan is to wait for it to blow over and not say anything about it unless someone else does, but it's just eating me.\n\nTl;dr I said that the musical the teachers chose was bad (with a little bit of casting salt that I've been open about since the cast list went up; trust me, it was oof), my tone clearly came off as rude, now some unknown number of people think I hate the actors or something like that.",

      "description": "I started seeing this girl on tinder a couple weeks ago and she had a habit of going on tangents with no real topic in mind, which is cool with me. Around the third date she said something that had me pause for a moment. When I was driving her home one night she mentioned \"If I had a kid now I would keep it, I wouldn't have a couple years ago with school and everything but I am almost done so I could take care of it now.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't really think about it at the time because then she continued to talk about something else, but the next day I told my friend about it and they said I should call her and talk about it right away. I called her and explained that I don't think we will work out because she would want to keep a kid if she got pregnant and I am not ready for kids right now. She argued that I was being immature and that there is always a possibility of getting pregnant which I obviously understand, it was the whole not being on the same page and being a possible dad. She then said she would keep it and raise it on her own and not ask for any help from me, but I couldn't live like that knowing I had a kid out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really think I was being immature. I know that circumstances change, but I feel like, at the very least, its important to start off on the same page. She really argued that I wasn't ready for any serious relationships if I thought this way, which doesn't make sense because there are women who don't want kids and would get an abortion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to stay in this new relationship? Also we had just started discussing sex on the second and third date, had not done anything more than kissing on a bed at this point.\n\nAlso not sure if this matters but some possible red flags. She tried to contact me the next day at work by calling my main office which my coworker got and said I would call her back, then she sent an email to the office support email asking to speak to me. When I had a free moment to respond I texted her and asked what was up because I hadn't blocked her at this point so no idea why she tried my work first. I called her again and she started to say she wanted to make it work and would get an abortion for me if it came to it. I told her this doesn't sound like she wants this but is doing it for me. I said she shouldn't change who she is or what she wants for anyone.\n\n  \nTLDR: AITA for not wanting to continue dating after she stated she would keep a child? Am I being immature?",

      "title": "AITA for telling BILs wife that our in laws think she’s fat and stupid",
      "description": "When I moved to (European country) boyfriend and I lived with his parents for 8 months, along with our newborn baby. We did not pay rent during this time. We offered and they refused. \n\nMy in laws, though generous, are mean-spirited. His mom is truly unable to understand or care about other people’s needs, and values people only insofar as they boost her ego. His dad has severe anger issues and is openly racist. The only people able to tolerate them are each other and only sometimes (the dad is only home on weekends and they mostly avoid each other during those two days). \n\nI nodded politely for 8 months straight. As far as I figure it, you’re allowed to spew as much vicious hate from your mouth as you want in your own home. They had no idea I thought they were miserable people and obviously were thrilled to have an open ear for the many things/people they dislike.  \n\nOne of those people was my FBIL’s (half brother of my boyfriend) then girlfriend, now wife. I’ll call her SIL. \n\nNow, I’m of the firm belief that not everyone is this world is smart and beautiful (because those are relative concepts) and that’s okay. SIL is technically morbidly obese. She wouldn’t be attractive even if she were thin. She didn’t go to school past age 16 (normal in European country). These things aren’t cause to dislike someone, but in fact I do dislike her because she acts superior to me. I have an accent and make grammatical errors in her native language, and she might not understand that’s normal when it’s not your first language because it’s possible she has literally never spoken to another foreigner, or she might be racist (she has said racist things about other ethnic groups but not mine in particular). When I say things directly to her, she sometimes responds, sometimes stares at me expressionlessly for 20-30 seconds before moving on as though I said nothing, which is disconcerting. She might also have disliked me because BIL clearly had a crush on me (would stare at me from a distance and smile, blush when speaking to me) although I actively discouraged this. But it seems very likely to me that he’s on the spectrum and has difficultly controlling is reaction to other women and this is probably not an issue particular to me. So that sucks for her but i s not my problem. \n\nThe only time I think it is was fair to criticize her intelligence (or not?) was when their baby almost completely slept through the first 4-5 months of his life and they did not notice it was because she wasn’t producing milk and the baby was slowly starving. This was obvious to me as I was also breastfeeding and I gently mentioned it a few times (which I regret, but at the time I didn’t feel it was my place to be assertive about it). Eventually they took the baby to the hospital because they were sure he was constipated, and the hospital gave them a glycerine suppository and sent them home. It took more tests and another week because someone figured out the baby was malnourished. \n\nHowever, BIL was equally, dangerously stupid. Their misplaced self assurance nearly cost their child his life. But it’s clear the medical system also failed them - in European country, midwives visit you regularly after birth and someone should have noticed she wasn’t producing enough milk. \n\nIn any case, the in laws didn’t care much about this because they didn’t care much about the child from this union. They have relentlessly criticized her appearance and intelligence. They have repeatedly stated that they hope BIL leaves her. When he decided to propose to her instead, they were devastated. They couldn’t even manage a “congratulations” when he told them. They lamented that he was forced to propose due to pressure from her family/village culture where unplanned pregnancy = wedding. \n\nThey made repeated snide comments to her face about her weight and occupation (she previously worked as a butcher), like for example commenting that eating meat excessively causes weight gain, or making faces when she took a second helping, buying her fiction books and taking joy in the fact she is unlikely to read them, when they have seen her struggle to read her parenting book. \n\nSome time after we moved out, I went NC with the in laws. They drove our child without a car seat in their car (after lying and saying they would take a tram) and continue to insist that they did nothing wrong and it is totally fine to not use a car seat. Later when my boyfriend told them I was pregnant with my second child, his mom went on a tirade about how I needed to get an abortion, for literally hours. (I understand he’s also at fault for continuing to debate her and not just shutting this conversation down). \n\nAfter other smaller weird shit I just decided it was too much stress for my pregnancy and I was going to talk to them in January (a few months after the birth and after the holidays - since they also complain that everyone is greedy and just wants stuff from them - so I wanted to make sure we got exactly nothing in gifts from them that they can hold against us). \n\nDuring this time BIL and girlfriend got married. They now have the only grandchild that they have access to. The in laws have become much much nicer to SIL as a result. This seems to have gotten to her head. \n\nShe sends a message to my boyfriend that since they’re family now (I guess I’m not family because we’re not married) she feels like she can speak honestly with him. She tells him it is WRONG to keep the children from their grandparents! They NEED their grandparents!! Why has he not talked about this issue with tschuessischlampe and told me it’s not okay? This is CRUEL!! \n\nBoyfriend does not want to deal with this BS. I should have ignored her but did not. \n\nIn my response I told her that of all people, she should be the last person to defend the in laws. That they have endlessly criticized her weight and intelligence and said that they hoped BIL would leave her so they wouldn’t have to see her again. And even though they seem nicer now and are turning their hatred toward me, they can and probably will and probably still are continuing to speak badly of her.\n \nWas that out of line? If someone tells you shitty things in confidence, are you obligated to keep that to yourself? \n\n",

      "description": "My bf and I's weekends rarely match up.  Especially lately, he's been working more and now has been getting one day off a week.  That day this week is today.  I wanted to make the most out of today with him.  I wanted to spend time with my cousin (who bf is friends with) and his gf.  They are the only couple we hang out with.  I also wanted us to shop together and later on have dinner with my parents.\n\nI talked to him about it on Thursday and he said he didn't know, that he wanted to go drinking with a friend on Saturday night after work.  I tried to talk him out of it, but he said he needed to blow off some steam.  So I told him to just spend the night with me.  I figured there are a lot of ways to \"blow off steam\" lol and then he wouldn't have to drink to relax.  He went on about how no, he really just wants to get fucked up.  He very reluctantly invited me to go out with them, but said he didn't think I would have fun, so it was a total non-invite.\n\nI explained to him that I really wanted us to go to hang out with cousin and gf in the morning and he wouldn't want to if he was hung over.  He agreed and said that he really didn't want to hang out with.  Him and my cousin get along great and it's the only other couple we ever hang out with.\n\nWe argued back and forth for awhile and eventually the best he was willing to do was stay home with me and drink.  Totally missing the point.  I get that he works hard, but I got pissed at this point and called him out on getting drunk is more important than me.  He called me a hypocrite because I go out with my sister once a week and we do usually drink.  I told him it's not the same and if he ever asked me not to drink, I wouldn't.  That's completely true too.  All he said was \"bullshit\".\n\nI told him fine, do what he wants, but it's nice to know where his priorities are and that was the end of the fight.  Honestly after he had time to calm down I thought he would reconsider.  But sure enough last night he came home and immediately started getting ready to go out.  I was so upset I barely talked to him and he didn't seem to care at all.\n\nHe went out and throughout the night whenever I would text him he would take forever to respond and it was with just like one word answers.  He didn't come home until close to 3am.  I know because he woke me up stumbling into bed.  \n\nThe next day I waited until 10am to wake him up and ask him to get ready to go to my cousins and of course he was hungover and told me that, \"JESUS, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO YOUR FUCKING COUSIN'S\"  Shocker.   \n\nSo I waited until he woke up again.  It was almost 2pm.  He came out into the living room and apologized.  I told him we still have time to go shopping for the week and go to dinner with my parents.  He looked confused like this was the first time we were talking about it, when we had had this conversation on Thursday.  Now he didn't want to have dinner with my parents.  He just wants to stay in today.  It's 4:38 right now and hasn't even gotten dressed.  I knew this would happen if he went out.  Am I really such a huge asshole that the one day off we have together he isn't completely hung over? \n\n",

      "description": "Okay, so I (22M) picked up a microwave from some of my parents  acquaintances for my new place, her daughter (20F) answered the door and got her mom to sell me the microwave. Couple of days later I heard from my dad that the daughter fancies me and that I should get her number. So I'm like sure, I wasn't initially attracted to her but never know if something can still blossom right? I get her number and set up a date, we head out for a few drinks and the conversation was alright and the vibe was good. I pay and drop her off at her parents place and we kiss in the car, we decide right then and there to meet up for saturday evening. Fast forward to tonight; agreed to meet up at my place to cook together and watch a movie. Conversation a bit dry tonight and I realise that I'm just not that attracted to her physically.. We're sitting on the couch and she goes in for the kiss again, it gets a little hot and heavy and I make it clear I'm looking to score. This is where she tells me that she's a virgin and she wants to wait with having sex till being at the right point in a relationship. I am taken a little back by this as she had relationships in the past but she mentions they werent serious. I tell her I respect her choice and ask a little bit about what she's expecting her first time to be like etc.. after an hour or so I tell her I'm tired and if it's okay if I drop her off home. She kisses me again in the car before she gets out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter writing it down like this it kind of feels like I'm the asshole. I don't want to hurt her but I don't want to have a relationship with her either - It feels like i've already led her on by returning the kisses. \n\nI guess I should just tell her honestly that I don't fancy her after all?\n\nWhat's the verdict here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "tldr at the end.\n  \nI think it's usually etiquette to leave out the bad aspects of an employee when you are called as a reference anyways, but I left out so much this case I felt like I was misleading.\n  \nEssentially, the bad employee (BE) wanted to be an operations supervisor. The job essentially requires you to be a walking dictionary of the operations manual, and barring that, know where to find the guidance to any question. I knew BE wanted to do this role, so I had her shadow my staff in that role. My supervisor tells me every time in our 1:1 that BE sucks, doesn't take to any training, and should not be in this position since she doesn't follow instructions. I encountered this myself, when she used to come to me to ask \"how do I do this?\" My reply being \"if you want to be an ops supervisor, then why are you not looking this up yourself?\" And set the expectation that she she be fielding other staff's questions, instead of coming to me and my supervisor with (didn't say it but they were) stupid ones.\n  \nOne day, I get a call from my counterpart from another branch and asked me if I can answer some questions as BE applied to be an ops supervisor in his branch. I honestly didn't know what I can say, at that point, I didn't have a good opinion of BE. I just told him to ask me what he wants to know. I answered in very open terms like and withheld any very valid personal opinion like \"ya, BE knows how to do it (but not well at all)\" \"BE does have this responsibility (but the guy overhearing the guidance learnt how to do it and taught BE how to do it and is now more responsible for it over BE)\" and also, to be honest, maybe because the other Branch's manager was thinking I did not understand his question, was being kinda rude, but I mean... Not that guy's first reference call, so if he is hearing answers like that, I hope he got the subtext.\n  \nIn any case, BE went to do the interview, never knew how it went, but during lunch, someone mentioned (scarcastically) how BE must REALLY want the job to be going back and forth across the entire city every day. BE then said BE didn't even realized and ask me to help BE withdraw the application. I told BE, it's an HR thing, BE should just call HR directly (I could have, but was annoyed at that point). \n  \nThen at a company function later that year, the other manager had a chat and since BE quit to work for BE's father, I didn't feel the need to hide it and told the other manager he dodged a bullet. He was then kinda pissed off at me to say it was an asshole move to offload a bad employee on to him (as a joke but I can tell he meant it). I told him I'm sure his interview skills would have picked it up anyways, and we left it at that.\n  \nTldr: didn't tell the other manager why my employee sucked when he asked, was told I was an asshole for offloading to him even though he already had the interview with my employee",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to break up with my fiance because of his violent and destructive son?",
      "description": "I met my fiance 2 years ago and our love is like a fairy tale, everything seemed so perfect. I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had \"Josh and Dad\" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.\n\nJosh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said \"Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!\" And ripped the bill in half.\n\nJosh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. \n\nMy fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me \"I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings.\" Or \"It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies.\" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. \n\nI would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid. I think I need to leave, I don't think I have the emotional capacity to stay and deal with it. I want nice things again, I want my dog, I want to have kids someday. AITA?",

      "description": "My Ex left me about 7 years ago when our daughter (let's call her R) was 5. Since then we have shared 50/50 custody. I have re-married and have a 2 year old daughter with my wife and recently learned we have another child on the way. For the most part co-parenting with my Ex has gone well. We have always been able to work through the occasional conflicts. My Ex is a good person and loves R very much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR has been letting her grades slide. She gets excellent marks in all her classes. But lately she just hasn't been doing her homework. She says she forgets. Sometimes she has even done the work, but just doesn't turn it in. We have done EVERYTHING we can think of to help. Teacher conferences. Daily agendas signed by each teacher and reviewed at home. Daily homework checks. I work with her in the evenings (when needed) and take her to the library on the weekends she's with me to work on her assignments. We have taken her to Doctors and enrolled her in counseling to see if there is anything medically or psychologically that is contributing. So far the general consensus is that she my be suffering from mild anxiety. We have been working on this for a few months now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Ex and I have different parenting styles. In my house people are held accountable. We all have responsibilities and we count on each other to do their part. I am not talking about anything extreme here. On a typical week night I do the cooking, R does the dishes, and my wife bathes the toddler. One of R's responsibilities is to keep her grades up. When her grades dropped there were consequences. I \"grounded\" her. All her electronics where taken away until her grades improved. No TV, no Netflix, no phone. Analog hobbies, musical instruments, and TV in the evening with the family were all still allowed, if she was caught up on schoolwork. I told River that she would remain grounded until she had at least a 3.0 GPA. My Ex's approach to parenting is much more laid back. I'd describe it as the \"let's be best friends\" parenting style. There were no consequences for R's falling grades at her mom's house. Neither of us agrees with the other's approach and the conflict between us has been growing rapidly in the last couple of months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis weekend R was at my house and things just fell apart. Earlier in the morning I had asked her to clean her room. I walked in a bit later to check on her and she just started screaming at me. She was furious. It took several attempts to get her to calm down enough that I could understand what she was saying. That's when she told me that she hated being with me, and she wanted to live with her mother. No words have stung me worse. I was in total shock. But, I think she is old enough to have some input into her living arrangements. I reached out to her mother and explained the situation. Mom was more than happy to come to her rescue and I have not heard from either of them since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being too hard on my daughter?",

      "description": "I'm sorry if this is a little long, this all happened recently so I'm still sort of processing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm a college freshman. Not long being there, me, my roommate and another girl in our hall sort of formed a friend group. We would go to the dining hall together, go to plays, go out to eat, etc. I thought we were getting along well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I did notice that the other two were closer. It sort of made sense, since they were the same major and had a lot in common, and it didn't bother me too much at first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I noticed things were off. They would talk about things in front of me that I didn't know anything about, and be sort of vague so I couldn't really catch up. They would go out together (and occasionally with others) and wouldn't tell me, and I would either find out by their conversations or a social media post. It felt it was happening more and more, and even when we were together I felt like I was being excluded. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen last night, they went out to a fancy party without me. Again, they never explicitly mention they're going to a party without me, but its obvious when my roommate's getting ready, and when they post on social media. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just felt awful. I cried a lot through the night. I don't know why, but this one hurt more than most. So I called my parents to have someone to talk to, and they told me I should confront them. But at this point, it really isn't the first time this has happened and I just want to leave it behind me and move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were previously planning to all live together in a suite next year, but after that night I decided I didn't want to live with them because it would just be too awkward for me. I told them this, basically saying that they're super close and it would be weird for me to room with them as I would feel like a third wheel. They took it pretty well, respecting my decision but did seem sort of disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's where I need advice. After the conversation, I called my parents and caught them up. They seemed sort of surprised that I never confronted them about excluding me before deciding to move out. To them, there could be a perfectly good reason why they weren't including me. But I feel like the answer is pretty obvious (they don't want to hang out with me), and calling them out on it would only make things more awkward between us, especially since I still have to live with my roommate for the rest of the year. Plus, I don't want to make them feel bad; I don't want them to think that I feel like they're obligated to hang out with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA to confront them about them excluding me? I feel like its just an unnecessary conversation that would make things more tense between us and potentially cause unnecessary guilt; my parents think it could save our friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My friends began leaving me out so I decided to cancel our plans to live together next year, but my parents think I should confront them about their actions.",

About 2 hours in I told her I couldnt hang out for a long time, and that i was busy, and she got noticeably sad, since she saw my story about having a month off for friends. We sort of left it at that until she texted me that night asking me what had happened, and why I was upset with her, I honestly couldnt deal and I ignored it. \n\nThen she called me, I got really annoyed, noped the call and. blocked her number and her snap, I think FB too. Anyway a few mutual friends have asked me over messenger why i blocked her, since she is really torn up about it, but since i have time off I've just pretended to sleep or ive dodged the questions.\n\n AITA here?",

      "title": "AITA For Disliking My Brother?",
      "description": "For some context, my brother and I have had a history of a love-hate relationship. We are complete opposites, I am more of an enjoyable person to be around but he isn't. I made a post here a little while ago talking about this, but he generally just has this weird mindset. Early on, he didn't have many friends, so he says he developed this habit of being annoying to others for attention?\n\nHaving this mindset, it kind of got worse as he grew up and discovered new things. Our parents at some point didn't care that we cursed in front of them, so whenever he saw me he would call me random things like \"bitch\" or \"asshole\" ( I want to clarify that we BOTH cursed, we started saying things like that in our normal conversations). It was kind of annoying, but not anything really bad. However, he got to that age where he said sexual things. It progressed to slapping his ass when I was around, rubbing his dick, moaning, saying \"fuck me\", calling me \"thicc\", even smacking my ass one time. This went on for YEARS, and he would not stop when I asked him to. It got so bad that people at SCHOOL were asking me to get him to stop.\n\nMy general reaction to this was to try and distance myself from him, because my parents didn't know he would do this stuff. I started acting cold towards him, and almost bullying him to stay away. Under that \"habit\" or \"mindset\" (that he says he developed?), he still didn't have friends, so he wanted to be around me and play games with me. But because he was doing this shit, I did not. For a long time my parents only saw his side of the story, that I was being an asshole to HIM and not the other way around.\n\nAfter he finally stopped the sexual behavior (I told my parents), I still cannot get over the borderline sexual harassment he was doing towards me after all those years. Even if he stopped doing the sexual stuff he is still generally very annoying to me, going back to saying \"you're a bitch\", \"you're fat\", etc. So even now, I do not want to associate at all with him. I cannot see myself even having a future relationship with him in adulthood.\n\nToday we had an argument over why I do not want to be around him. It was more multiple reasons, but I just simply can't get over what he did. It doesn't matter if what he does isn't sexual anymore, I still just have a grudge against him.\n\nIn the argument, I mentioned how I think we are complete opposites. He can go weeks without showering, I shower everyday. He leaves others to clean up after him, I clean up after myself.  He is lazy, I try not to be. We just don't mix well together.\n\nI can see that he has feelings too, and that he just didn't know how to cope with being lonely so he wanted attention. But I just have a thought in the back of my mind that it isn't right if I just forgive him right then and there. I have been thinking about this for so long my thoughts are just tangled, I don't know what or who is right.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Hi there, I should probably start this post by telling you guys that I have mild autism, social anxiety and I’m 100% introverted. I have one extremely good friend, she’s very nice and we’ve been best friends for over two years now. I also sorta have another friend? That friendship is a bit more complicated. He used to be my crush, while we were also friends. A few months ago I found out he was gay, told him I had a crush on him, but that I could easily get over it and that I was happy for him for coming out. Ever since then, our friendship has been a bit complex, but that’s not the problem here.\n\nDue to my autism and introvertedness, I can’t hang out with others for too long. I’ll gte tired and extremely annoyed, even if I don’t mean it. I am fully aware of times when this occurs, but I don’t let anyone know, because I don’t want to hurt them. What I do is every now and then I’ll lie to my friends about having to be somewhere just so I can have some time alone. I feel kinda guilty for this, bu if I didn’t do it, I feel like my irritation would only get worse and I’d end up being a bitch or completely isolating myself and stop talking (this has happened multiple times already, was not fun). \n\nThe thing is, my male friend (the kinda strange friendship) has a ton of other people to hang out with, so it’s not that big of a deal to him. My best friend however, doesn’t have any other friends except for me, so when I go away she either has the other guy to hang out with, or no one. I feel bad for making my best friend so lonely half of the time, but I don’t want the situation to escalate. So, AITA for lying to my best friend about being busy, just so I don’t have to spend time with her?\n\nExtra info: my best friend is great, but both her and the other guy whine about everything they can. Sometimes it’s funny, but it mostly gets on my nerves, which causes the whole ordeal of ‘I’ve spent to much time with others’.",

      "description": "Dated ex for about two years starting 2013, and it was deep but rocky. We both were sort of bad to each other, mostly codependence and youthful insecurity i think. We first split in 2015, got back together in 2016 and split for good that summer. \n\nThe reason was- he sexually assaulted me. He was jealous and drunk and it was really bad. Needless to say I walked out on him. Less than a “i want revenge” thing more of a “im fucking done” thing. \n\nAdmittedly i didn’t call the police on him when i should have over fear of being believed or interrogated and because I was afraid of them cuz this was in a city where i knew no one. Mostly i just wanted to be done with him, not have him punished. I even forgave him, he had a rough life and you know it was bad to go through but a wake up call to not date people who do that. \n\nSo i moved across the country, and sent him an email saying basically “you hurt me, you are forgiven maybe go to therapy, just know we are done.” About a year and a half later, he moves to the small, random city i live in. then 3 months later reaches out to me wanting to clear the air. \n\nBasically its been 2 and a half years and some therapy for me later, so i reply to him basically saying “its cool shit happens i did care about you and did some bad stuff myself have a good life.” He replies to me a month later and says he misses me etc. so i basically told him, in a strongly worded email, do not speak to me again. \n\nAm i the asshole for giving him hope and then telling him to fuck off?

      "description": "So today i casually sent a friend a concerning post about someone she had \"warned\" me about assaulting his girlfriend, stealing her car/cards/money and nearly biting her finger off. Her response was \"oh well he's friends with Q (let's call her Q) they're both abusive\".\n\nQ is a girl my friend used to be friends with. They got into a dispute over 60 dollars (don't feel like going too into detail here), basically Q offered to pay for something from my friend and then changed her mind and my friend had a temper tantrum. I intervened and just purchased the item myself hoping to squash the issue. A month or two passes before my friend decides she's not going to give the other girl a concert ticket that the girl had paid her for a while back. In her mind, since that friend didn't pay her 60 dollars (though I did) she shouldn't get the concert ticket. Several bullshit exchanges occur before Q has enough and makes a Facebook post about the situation (obviously slanted in a way to favor her side) and my friend and a lot of people see it.\n\nI'm not saying that doesn't suck, but I honestly found it very self absorbed she turned a very serious conversation into one focused on something far less serious. She then blocked me accusing me of not caring about the \"abuse\" she went through. It was awful but I can't say losing 60 dollars and her reputation among people that didn't like her much to begin with is comparable to somebody having their actual life situation threatened. AITA?",

      "description": "this has been killing me lately. prepare for a very long story.\n\ni met my ex through my work and we got together and were together for about 9 months before she attempted suicide.\n\nthroughout the relationship, we'd have problems from time to time. did i say time to time? i meant all the time. she'd constantly threaten to break up with me or go on break (or she actually did, according to her). one of those problems was when she cut herself and i told my friend about it and my friend told our high school (we were 18 at the time). she got very mad at me and considered breaking up with me over it. we ended up not breaking up. seemingly hundreds of tiny arguments ensued.\n\nthen she left for school.\n\nthe arguments amplify. we're thousands of miles apart and she's wanting breaks. every week this would happen. some small argument happens and she would threaten to break up or go on break. perhaps the one that standed out the most to me was when she asked to call me and i said \"yeah sure\". she got really mad and told me nevermind, because i had said \"yeah sure\". i can see how that would mean something different to someone but it's ridiculous to call off the whole call and get mad at me for it, imo. i called her out (for once, keep in mind i never started any arguments) on it, and then of course she threatened to go on break.\n\nevery week there were tears and crying and begging. i loved this girl to death and i did not want to lose her. i felt on edge and terrible the whole time she was gone because it felt like anything i did would piss her off and cause her to break up with me.\n\nthere was one instance where i would get terrible anxiety whenever she partied. she would tell me every single detail and it just perpetuated my anxiety even more. after explaining to her that i couldn't control it and there was no real reason why (which sounds stupid and terrible but it's true. i could never figure out a reason why i felt the way i did. even to this day. it just happened.), she insisted on telling me and told me that i could slowly grow in to hearing about it. that was our biggest thing for a while. that was one of the worst times of my life. every day i suffered from extreme anxiety, worrying about what she was doing and where she was going over the weekend. i became crazy because of it because i just did not want to feel that way again. but i loved her, and i couldn't leave her.\n\none night, a huge argument happened (can't remember exactly what it was about) and it spiraled into us actually breaking up (but of course she told me that we would try again in the future). after gathering myself and talking to my friends about it, i realized how terrible of a relationship i was in. arguments almost daily, she's thousands of miles away, all the petty arguments she would cause and then threaten to break up with me over, all the pain she had caused me. i ended up telling her that i never wanted to be with her again. i listed all the things i wanted to say to her, all the things i couldn't in fear that she would break up with me. and that's when she decided to come back.\n\nwe were fine for a few weeks. keep in mind i had basically 0 friends before this next part. i finally find some new friends and we were hanging out every day and it made me realize how much i didn't want to be in a long distance relationship. but i still loved her so i was just stuck in a stalemate for a while. she noticed this and i told her exactly what i was feeling because i wanted to be 100% honest with her. i never lied to her and i never did. then she booked a flight a few weeks later to spend the whole day with me. it was really nice. it made me feel great about her again. in retrospect i just wanted to affection. i didn't want to be in a ldr with her. she goes back and things are fine, until one weekend where everything changed.\n\nit was and still is the craziest thing i have ever experienced. me and my friend visited my other friend at his university. it's all going very well and then suddenly, i start receiving weird texts from my ex (she is still with me). my friends told me to ignore my phone. 3 missed calls. 1 new voicemail. \"anon, i love you. you'll be ok. you'll be ok.\". i start crying, my friends notice, i call her, more tears, long story short that night she tried to kill herself. that was the point where i decided that this relationship wasn't good for me.\n\nshe calls me from the hospital two days later, telling me how she's doing ok and everything will be ok. she asked me if i felt the same way i did before (not being sure if i wanted to be with her) i said yes. again i wanted to be 100% completely honest with her. and then a week later, i break up with her.\n\nit wasn't a good breakup. she tried everything to get me back. she told me i used her, etc. but i did it for my own mental health and to grow as a human being.\n\nlately ive been feeling regrets. she said she's going to go to the same community college i was going to because she couldn't be so far away from home. but i just feel like it was such a bad relationship for me so idk. any time i see anything about her, something in me sets off and i get a little pit in my stomach. but i know that i had to do it for my own sake.\n\nam i the asshole for breaking up with her? that's what i really want to know. should i have stayed with her? she had such a great impact on my life, and i think i had a great impact on hers. sometimes i miss her, but other times i really don't. i just don't know if im the asshole. everyone i talk to about this says that im not but i want an outside opinion. thank you very much",

      "description": "I went to a bottomless brunch with two friends. Basically, it’s $32 for bottomless mimosas and tapas. The waiter generally comes by, takes your food order, and fills your drinks from a pitcher, then comes around from time to time to refill your drinks. The first time I went to this brunch the service was great. Sure the food took a while but we knew that the kitchen was busy so we didnt mind. We got filled up on drinks probably 7 or 8 times in 2 hours and we never had to ask for our waiter. \n\nSo this time, I make reservations ahead of time. We get there and they seat us kindof in the back near a birthday party, no big whoop. We go ahead and order and get our first round of drinks. This begins the hassle. Our food just doesnt come. It just doesnt. We sit for 30 minutes and our waiter passes our table countless times, never refilling our drinks. The whole time though, he is filling the drinks at the birthday party next to us, even though the birthday party already has 2 other waiters tending to them. Finally after almost an hour, I wave him down and ask him whats up. He says the kitchen is overwhelmed and they are out of mimosas. As he is saying this, i see a bartender mixing a pitcher of them, so I say, “It looks like they are making some right now. “ he looks over, rolls his eyes, goes and gets the pitcher and comes back. He fills each of our glasses half way then leaves to go tend to the birthday party where he completely fills the glass of a VERY inebriated woman and exchanges phone number with her. This is when I lost it. You literally deliver no food and one drink over an hour long period, lie to me, roll your eyes at me, and then get some girls phone number? Really? Finally a runner brings us food. Not our food. Just food. It’s not what we ordered, but our waiter is literally nowhere to be found. We reluctantly eat the food and as we are eating, our waiter appears out of nowhere and slams our check down on the table and walks away without a word. We didn’t ask for our check. He gave us 1.5 drinks and we didnt even get the food we ordered. \n\nI go to the front of the restaurant and ask for the manager he comes up and hes very apologetic and says he’ll find us another waiter to help out. The waiter never shows up. So we reluctantly pay our bill (I had to go to the register and ask a random waitress to help me out because our waiter had bailed) and we pay for our food. Total comes out to pretty much $100. I know waiters rely on tips, and I normally tip 15-18% minimum, but he literally didn’t do his job and blew us off to flirt with a drunk college girl. We didn’t even get the food we ordered. I tipped 5% on this bill. \n\nI told this story to someone later and they yelled at me and said it was an awful thing to do. But the way I see it if you didn’t do your job at all, let alone poorly,  why would I tip?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I asked my fiancee to give up his dog for my cat's sake?",
      "description": "I've moved into my fiancee's family's home with my cat. The family owns four dogs, but my fiancee owns the rowdiest of them, who would be coming with us when we do move out. I don't know if it's worth keeping both pets, but I don't want to give my cat up. WIBTA if I asked if he would/could give up his dog for my cat's sake?\n\n\nContext: I don't like dogs. I don't HATE them, but I've never really wanted one. My parents had Too Many Dogs (four to five at any given time) and hardly trained them, expecting my brother and I to clean up after them, so my dislike stems from that.\n\nMy fiancee's family also has Too Many Dogs. They're trained better, but they aren't socialized. Shortly before I moved in, a neighbor's dog had to go to the vet after two of them broke out of the backyard and attacked it. Thankfully everything turned out ok and no charges were pressed (family paid the vet bill), but one of those dogs was my fiancee's.\n\nMy fiancee's dog is some sort of Great Dane mix, almost fully grown as a one year old. Fiancee adopted her on a whim after picking her up off the road as a smaller pup. She listens to a degree, but she has tons of energy and likes to chew up misc items around the house (shoes, pillows, table legs, etc). My fiancee wants to start taking her on walks and socialize her with other dogs before socializing with my cat, but my fiancee is usually too tired to do so when he gets home (its physically demanding, so I don't blame him).\n\nAs for my cat, he's currently staying in our bedroom, which is about as big as the livingroom of my previous apartment. He's five years old and front paw declawed (not my choice, my friends adopted him for me from Petsmart as a gift). He's very friendly, but he'll overstimulate himself cuddling up to people and winds up biting pretty hard (likely a result of being declawed). My fiancee is allergic to cats, though it only flares up a little if mine does bite, and he has to hide his feet at night so he doesn't get nipped (he gets hot easily and likes having his feet exposed, so this is an issue).\n\nI have hope that if we can socialize them, they can balance out their negative quirks. I just don't have the drive to take initiative when I don't really love my fiancee's dog, and I don't think my fiancee has the drive to keep up with his dog either. It's been two months since I moved in, and we're haven't even started.\n\nAs a side note, it's probably weird that I would knowingly bring my cat into this housing situation, and not fair to my fiancee to have him give up his pet for a pet he probably doesn't love as much either. I don't want to give up my cat because A) he was a gift, and I feel more compelled to keep him, and B) I previously owned two cats before I went to college, in a similar situation as this one (Too Many Dogs), but when I left my parents abandoned them outdoors. I know it wasn't my fault (dorms wouldn't take cats) but I still feel like I abandoned them, and I feel like I'd be abandoning my current cat too, which I don't want to do.\n\nI'm not going to force my fiancee to abandon his dog either. If he wants to keep her, I'll work with him to make things happen. I'm just burnt out on dogs and scared he'd be offended if I asked.\n\nTldr: I want to ask my fiancee if, theoretically, he would/could give away his dog for my cat's sake, and I don't know if that's fair of me to ask w/o sounding like an asshole.",

      "description": "* Booked the hotel through Hotels.com for 2 nights/king bed\n* Thursday evening I book another night after speaking to clerk\n* Used Hotels.com app and, by mistake, made a new reservation for 2 queen beds. Didn't know how to fix it\n* Clerk told me it was no problem - she would change it in her system\n* Saturday evening did the same thing as before, including the hotels.com snafu.\n* Different clerk working. Explained what happened and what the other clerk did. Was told they had rooms and it would be OK\n* Sunday @ noon got a call from the manager reminding me I had to vacate the room. Went to talk in person. Points made:\n   * Hotel: All king beds are booked | Previous clerk had given me the best information available at the time (this was the only response; never wanted to address why the reservation was not fixed like before) | My reservation is for 2 queen beds | They will not cancel or change someone else's reservation even if made after mine | My issue is with Hotels.com\n   * Me: Same previous mistake had already been fixed and I was told this would be OK too |The hotel should assume responsibility for the wrong info I was given by their employee| Someone that was booked after me and not yet in the room (been in the same room from start) should be inconvenienced.\n* Logged on to Hotels.com app and made an additional reservation for a king bed room\n* Then this:\n   * Hotel: Hotels.com should not have made the reservation\n   * Me: I don't know how the system works. I now have a paid reservation for a king bed that says it's guaranteed\n   * Hotel: We are not Hotels.com and we do not have to honor their guarantees or their reservations\n   * Me: You entered into a business agreement with Hotels.com. Renegotiate/cancel/argue with them. I have a valid reservation now\n* She called Hotels.com, talking about them overbooking and passed the phone to me\n* Hotels.com rep told me my reservation was valid, guaranteed and the hotel should honor it\n* I told her I wouldn’t change rooms and she should call the police or her boss if she wanted me out\n* The police arrived, asked me to leave, I packed, left to another hotel\n\n**The \"soft/interpretative\" points:**\n\n* Price difference between rooms for me was $2. No $$ incentive to cheat them\n* The hotel gets up to 50% when booked through 3rd party vs. directly. $$ incentive to bump me\n* I 've stayed at that hotel many times. One membership perk is free room upgrade\n* If clerk told me he didn't know how to do the change in the system/if I thought he wouldn't do it, I could've fixed the reservation immediately with Hotels.com\n* Not impolite/rude, but the manager -from the start- blamed me entirely. Never tried to apologize for the other clerk or admit they had made any mistake/responsibility or ask/bargain/negotiate with me\n* She blamed Hotels.com for the valid king bed reservation",

Everyone else told me to let it go and I saw her insta post talking about how some men never realise women's problems the next day. I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was and that she is just giving excuses and expecting us to work more everyday for a week without any proof of her condition or if her periods are painful enough to take a week off.\n\nI personally found nothing wrong with it, but I received a strict hearing from my boss.\nI don't think she has given my boss any proof either.

      "description": "I've been trying to sketch more and more, because I'd like to as a hobby and because I have to complete a sketchbook for my art minor, due in a few days. Today I had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to head to one of the many hallways that have these open spaces with tables and chairs/benches where studentst tend to eat/work/chat.\n\nAnyway because I'm antisocial and embarrassed to draw in public, I head to an open space without anyone in it and get to work. I take out all my stuff and start sketchin negative drawings, so I need to do a lot of scribbling with my pencil, who's friction makes an audible sound. Now I wasn't scribbling away like a maniac, I had headphones with music at a low level for me to be able to hear it so that I could make sure it wasn't too loud.\n\nAnyway after maybe half an hour a student comes to sit at a table near mine. A short while after another comes to sit at a table diagonal to mine. After I don't know how long the first student to get here asks me if I could go draw somewhere else because I'm noisy. Now firstly I genuinely don't think I was being that noisy, yes it was audible, but wasn't excessive in anyway, I guess my rythm was sort of sporadic so maybe that was the problem? \n\nShe was pretty polite but then before I get to respond the guy diagonal to me chimes in, and he's a lot more agressive, telling me how annoying it is and that this isn't a place for drawing (said in a tone like what I was doing was for kids) and that I should go \"annoy people somewhere else\".\n\nI had to leave soon anyway, and I didn't want any trouble so I tried to apologize even though I thought that there wasn't any reason to be this angry and that I wasn't that annoying. I had a lot of stuff to put back in my bag and he kept loudly huffing/sighing and looked up at me and shaking his head until I left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR-**I was sketching in an open space, making audible but reasonable noise, when two students who arrived there after I did told me to leave for being abnoxious, one more aggressively than the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI totally see how this could be annoying, but it's not as if I was in one of the only work spaces, there's litterally a massive library and a bunch of rooms designed for working in a quiet setting. Also I was there first, and this was for a uni class.",

      "description": "Alright so here's the story. For a little bit of backstory I got to say that this dude has been my step dad's friend since way before I even knew him and I've known my stepdad for 6 years now. And it turns out he's always been like this but I don't really know him or care about him. He's the type of person who no matter how small the screw up he will make fun of you saying you're gay or something like that something insignificant things that don't even matter well on their own at least. But whenever you put them all together it's just too much I've known this garbage person for maybe three years now and every single time I see him he's always making fun of me always telling me I'm doing something wrong and I just hate it I don't like the dude I haven't since the moment I met him and I've seen him a lot in the past 3 years all right so as of recent he actually moved into our house while he's trying to get a new job. and he sleeping in my room meaning I have to hear his ridicule every single day it's annoying as hell. And I'm the type of person that it takes a lot to actually make mad and the other day he was making fun of me again like usual and I blew up on him I yelled at him but for some reason everyone in my house is telling me that I'm wrong . I'm the one in the wrong when he's been ridiculing me every single day for at least two weeks now and before that he ridiculed me for 3 years I don't understand and today he actually forgot his key to the house he lost it and he gets home at 6 a.m. and I was planning on locking the door and keeping him out of the house because no one leave the house until at least 8 a.m. so I think I'm in the right but everyone else thinks I'm wrong if you think this is a good idea please tell me cuz I hate this dude or if there's anything else I can do please tell me.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together a pretty long time now, over a year, getting closer to two. Since the beginning it's always felt like I'm playing second fiddle to everyone else, even people she's only recently met. For example, I'll make plans for us, and then at the last minute she'll decide that she'd rather change those plans so that she can go hang out with someone else. Sometimes she'll offer for us to reschedule it, which, the way she says it honestly feels more like bribery or trying to make it up to me, which bothers me even more. I've brought it up to her before, and she apologizes, but it doesn't change and she still expects me to drop any prior plans I had for just a chance at spending time with her. It didn't used to bother me as much, but it's constant. I'm away for work pretty often, and don't get to see her very much (once or twice every couple of weeks), so I'd hope that having plans for us to spend time and go out on a date or something would hold more importance. So, AITA for feeling that way and thinking that plans together should be treated more importantly? ",

      "description": "I'm probably gonna be the asshole.\n\nSo my (27F) step dad and I have a weird relationship. He was introduced to me at age 7, they got married and we moved away at 8. I had a traumatic meltdown during this point (even cried at their wedding) because I felt like I was being ripped away from my real home with my grandparents to live with my mom and a stranger. At this point in my life, I was probably more attached to my grandmother than to my mom, so the thought of leaving just broke my heart. \n\nMom was one of those people who pushed the step dad on me, like would point out every thing they did that was \"nice\" and shoved it in my face to prove they were great. Like \"hey Paul just said this about you isnt that nice\" or \"hey Paul got you this thing isnt that nice\" when she clearly is the one who bought it?? \n\nI also had issues with him because he would lose his temper and raise his voice over stupid stuff. Me, having previously had no father figure and my side of the family is pretty quiet, would get upset by this easily. So for example when eating supper and my mom overcooked the porkchops so much they were dry as sand, I was kind of picking at them. He loudly exclaimed that if I didnt finish them hed drag me to my room \"BY THE HAIR\". So...ya....scared shitless. He also broke our ps2 once out of rage of losing and threw the controller into the wall. \n\nANYWAY he kind of mellowed out after it seemed i had a career path I was sticking on and succeeding at etc. So the relationship isnt presently bad. \n\nI have 2 brothers (one is Paul's with his ex wife, one is a half brother from my mom and paul) and just a few weeks ago realized we all had the same experience. I thought Paul was only awful to me but turns out they got it bad too. The youngest half sibling is in gr 12 and it seems like Paul has turned to emotional abuse and makes comments about his weight and anxiety and basically mocks him all day. Mom just stands by, probably knows its wrong but also doesnt say anything. \n\nAfter hearing this my feelings for Paul have absolutely dropped, it brought back a lot of memories that are painful with him, and to see what hes doing to my sweet brother kills me because it's similar to him mocking my anxiety constantly. \n\nOk so that's the backstory- heres the issue\n\nPaul's brother died yesterday by euthanasia due to a long painful battle with cancer. I do feel terrible about it. Mom messaged me yesterday and was like \"say something nice to Paul about this\"  which A. Comes across as fake to me  and B. At the moment I'm not extremely comfortable talking to him right now. The dredging up of all these feelings makes it hard for me to communicate with him. \n\nShe wont stop messaging me about it and I keep ignoring those texts, so she called me an AH and that family just sucks it up to be there for eachother. \n\nAITA if I don't send a condolence message basically forced by my mom?",

      "description": "My husband has wanted to try anal for a very long time. All this time, I have just as strongly wanted not to try it. I even cited one of the reasons as him not knowing how it works, because he hasn’t done his research.\n\nAnyway about a week and a half ago I finally agreed to it. We tried but couldn’t get it in there, so he gave up and thanked me for trying. I was happy with that and willing to revisit the subject at some point in the future.\n\nThe next time we were about to have sex, I told him I didn’t want to do anal that time, and he agreed. Then he brought it up during and laid on the pressure and I gave in. I didn’t like the way it went, but it did just barely work. I panicked and told him to stop as soon as it happened, and he did. He asked if we were never going to do it again. I said I didn’t know, but we were definitely done for that day.\n\nBefore we had sex again, we went out of town for his cousin’s wedding. He mentioned that I should pack the lube for anal and I told him I didn’t want to do it that weekend. We got to the hotel, we’re having sex, and he started asking for it, putting the pressure on yet again. We had no lube even with us. I said no, and was annoyed that he couldn’t just have sex once without engaging in something that, for me, is a major turnoff now.\n\nHe started getting all dominant about it, putting a finger near my ass and then arguing with me when I told him to stop. Basically saying he’d do what he wanted and I’d like it, that I really did want it after all. He was saying this because I’m into some cnc (didn’t follow through with it), but that’s a not what it would have been at all, just straight nc! \n\nSo now I feel like I’m done with exploring anal completely. I wasn’t that excited about it in the first place, and his approach has become more anxiety-inducing than relaxing and encouraging. I know he’s just trying to weave it in with other acts we enjoy so I’ll come around to it, I know it’s important to him, and technically I did agree to do it and I haven’t officially, completely done it yet. I want to go back on that now and take it off the table completely. AITA?",

He's the type of person who will come to your home, ask for Coke, be offered Pepsi, accept it, and then spill it on your carpet just to be like *\"fuck Pepsi am I right hahahahahahaha\"*. He's the type of person who will delete your stuff on your Xbox One to make space for his shit. He's the type of person who eats everything with his hands and wipes his fingers on your couch. He's the type of person who will go to your bathroom, take a shit, and then **drop a full fucking roll of toilet paper into the toilet**. (I don't mean he used a lot of toilet paper. I mean he literally took a fresh roll from under the sink and splashed it right in. Still have no clue why he did this.)\n\nMike thinks all of this is acceptable. My roommate enables him. They know I'll always be cleaning it up, as I seem to be the only person with maturity.\n\nAfter the toilet paper incident I tried to talk to my roommate. I said it's fine if he wants to stay friends with Mike but please keep him out of our apartment. My roommate said no. Mike is \"a great guy\" and I cannot stop him from having whoever he wants in an apartment we share.\n\nThat's the background. Now the potential assholery:\n\nThey were having drinks and discussing guns. Mike mentions having his concealed carry handgun on him. I hear this conversation from another room and I realize, holy shit, he's drinking, I can get him arrested for that. So I excuse myself to \"go out for a walk\" and call 911 from my car.\n\nFast forward to now. My roommate is pissed at me for \"snitching.\" I've explained how dangerous it is someone under the influence of alcohol to have a deadly weapon. He says none of that matters, I only called the cops out of irrational hate against Mike.\n\nI'm thinking he might have a point. On that night, I was not really concerned about the gun. I only wanted Mike gone. I even ended up endangering the lives of some police officers.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory first time posting warning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past few years whenever I go to my maternal grandparents for Christmas or easter or whatever I notice things that my grandmother does that are making me dislike her more and more. However i can't stop feeling bad about it because she is my grandmother after all and she is wheelchair bound\n\nThe first main thing is the way she treats my mother (her daughter-in-law), her daughter, me and her husband. She constantly relies on my mothers kindness to buy her movies, as all she does is watch movies from the 90s, and organize most of her care and helpers. And while my mom does this she constantly criticizes her for being too slow, getting the wrong kind, not spending more money or not calling her more often. It seems like we talk to her she has something to complain about. But the way she treats her daughter is even worse.\n\nMy aunt has been going through some marriage troubles because her husband is an atheist while she is a catholic as my grandfather is a Irish immigrant and all of their kids are beginning to go into high school so she feels like she needs to be there for them. And because she is the closest to my grandmother she often takes the brunt of her complaining and my grandmother has started to laugh at her because of her marriage troubles.\n\nThe way she treats the men in our family isn't much better. My grandfather is a very nice man, he supports the things I am doing and still frequently talks to my father. He is in amazing shape for an 80 year old and still often runs and plays golf with his friends. But she often yells at him because his cooking is wrong, he bought the wrong things for her, he is too slow and he is gone too often. My father has cut ties with her as he doesn't want to deal with it but I share the same fate as my mother. I am a Sophomore in high school (grade 10 for those who are not from the US) and I am trying to become a pilot, I have already started private pilot training. But my grandmother criticizes me as being too dumb for a pilot even though I am a mostly straight A student and I am fluent in mandarin. And she also makes fun of my weight, I am a somewhat scrawny kid but I do have a small beer belly that I am quickly getting rid of by dieting and exercise. She also neglects her grandchildren as she never gives us anything for graduations, birthdays or christmas; my grandfather does all of that.\n\nAs I witness and experience all of these things I dislike her more and more but I still think I should at least tolerate her because she is my only living grandmother, disabled and is on the side of the family I most identify with.\n\nTLDR: I really dislike my grandmother for being a terrible person to everyone she knows but I think I should tolerate her because she is my grandmother and disabled.

Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?",

      "description": "My (F38) boyfriend (M42) has an 18 year old son I'll call Junior, who lives with him full time. From a distance, Junior comes across as sweet and innocent but he's spoiled rotten. He has his father wrapped around his finger and it's obvious that he knows this. \n\nThe thing is, my boyfriend is very affectionate by nature, so some of their interactions aren't very surprising to me. A lot of hugs and \"I love you's\" happen throughout the day, which I initially thought was great. Now I think it's a little creepy. Admittedly, I come from a home where my siblings and I weren't exposed to a lot of affection, especially as teenagers. To this day, it's awkward to say \"I love you\" to my parents. \n\nBut with my boyfriend, it's more than the affectionate gestures. He goes out of his way to cater to his son beyond what's normal. For example, the other day it rained while Junior was out. Boyfriend was in a near panic at the thought of his son driving in the rain. As soon as Junior pulled into the driveway, bf texted him to stay in his car while he opened an umbrella and met him at the door so he wouldn't get wet. Other examples include:\n\n*Sitting on the edge of Junior's bed and tucking him in from time to time.\n*Fussing over him being cold while we were watching a movie and getting him a blanket. \n*Vacuuming Junior's car out for him.\n*Using pet names for his son like \"buddy\" and \"babe\" \n\nThe list goes on and on. I reached my limit on NYE when Junior was going out for the night. Of course, my boyfriend was fussing over him, making sure Junior had enough money in his account and offering to give him money. I heard him call Junior one of his weird pet names and I cringed inside. \n\nAs soon as Junior was out the door, I tried to tactfully bring it up and he immediately got defensive. I got defensive too, but I worked hard to maintain my composure and just address the facts. Unfortunately it turned into a full blown argument and I ended up leaving. We texted afterward and have come to a cold place of agreement, but I'm starting to think that he still hasn't let it go.   \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering, did I overstep my boundaries and AITA here? \n\n",

      "description": "Bit of a weird situation, sorry for the long post but backstory required. myself and my now wife are living in the UK, she is American. \n\nWe were engaged to be married with a ceremony for family and all that good stuff planned for next year. \nHer visa runs out in January, and it just makes things a lot easier on us to be husband and wife, so we thought we’d just do a quick elope, get the documentation in place and then carry on as planned with family celebrations and all that white carriage nonsense in 2019. \n\nWe were going to be in the USA over thanksgiving anyway as we travel over there a lot, so decided to do it then. I spoke to this pastor I found online who said she’d do the officiating for $300, sounded good to me so I paid in full on my Amex and we had a date for 3 weeks later when we’d be in country. \n\nI spoke to the other half just after (who’s mother is also a pastor) who said that although we thought it wasn’t possible because of different state registrations, her mother could in fact marry us and she wanted to go for that. \n\nI then contacted pastor number 1 and told her id jumped the gun a bit paying, and that we actually wouldn’t require her services (this was a few hours after I’d paid) she then told me no problem, she would refund. \n\nNext day I see she’d actually charged my card twice so had taken $600, she emailed me to apologise and sent back $300.  She then said she was tight for money and had already used the original $300 to pay some bills and could i give her a bit of time to get the money together to refund me. \n\nNo problem, this was about 6 weeks ago now and she’s gone from emailing every week to say it’s in hand to just disappeared for the last two weeks. No contact. \n\nNow I spoke to Amex and they said I could pursue a refund action or whatever if I want but I haven’t actioned  anything yet. Now I’m not bill gates or anything but I’m not doing bad, certainly $300 is not going to make any difference to me here or there. One side of me thinks it’s Christmas, she’s struggling and I did agree on the phone to her doing the ceremony. But the other side then thinks on principle she’s trying to punk me, and the $300 was for the full price, no mention of deposit or anything, and given that I should just get Amex to deal with it and get the money back. \n\nThoughts? I don’t think I’m being an asshole, but I did pay for a service and then cancel on her, albeit a matter of hours later. \n\n",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nFor less background skip to “Fast Forward to December 21st” . Throwaway account, etc. This might be a long one but here it goes:\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a friend of 5 years who we met while he was stationed in the military in my city (referred to as John from here on). John is generally loud (Italian family from the east coast) and not great in the way of conversation once he has had a few drinks as he won’t stop speaking and has an opinion on anything and everything. He is a great person in other aspects, selfless, will buy everyone dinner and drinks, would basically be there for you in any situation. To add to John’s background, he is adopted and his adoptive mother estranged from him as soon as he was done with high school, I am not sure what the whole story is but basically he doesn’t have any close family members. \n\nWhile John lived here we would hang out a few times a month, go to dinner, drink together, etc and there was never any issues. Two years ago John was kicked out of the military and moved back to the east coast to go to school. During his first summer break he asked if he could stay over for about 5 days to visit, and seeing how I lived in a huge house I told him it was fine for him to stay (sharing my room). This 5 day stay ended up turning into a 10 day stay instead. At first it was ok, but John’s loudness and opinionated comments started getting on my nerves and I started seeing my food and toiletries disappear slowly as he overstayed his welcome. I am not exaggerating when I say that all other friends that have met him think he is too loud and annoying to be around for long periods of time.\n\nThen comes the following summer, when without a warning, John shows up at my boyfriend’s place (BF and I live separately) as a surprise on a Thursday and asks me if he can stay with me until Sunday. I had a bad experience with him before but seeing how it was only 4 days I say it is fine, I still love the guy even if he can be too much. Again this “weekend trip” turns into two weeks before he leaves.\n\nFast forward to December 21s, John again shows up at my doorstep without previous warning (which we suspected was going to happen from some social media posts he had made about being on a road trip). Thankfully this time he has somewhere else to stay so I am glad I get to see him but not every day. \n\nNow comes the dilemma; within 10 minutes of him showing up he asks what plans we have for New Years. My boyfriend and I had already planned a trip to Vegas with another friend (Rod), and we were staying at Rod’s parents’ house in Vegas so I let John know. John invites himself to Vegas with us will get a hotel for himself as he can’t stay with Rod. We already had a lot of things planned, already had tickets for New Year’s Eve drinks and for a brunch the day before. John buys tickets to join us in most of our plans except for New Year’s Eve dinner, because Rod’s parents were catering food for us at their house. Well, Rod HATES John as he had a bad experience the few times they met and told me and my boyfriend that we could not have John over for dinner. Queue the boyfriend who gets insulted that Rod won’t take John at his place since John has no family, and cancels our dinner plans with Rod so we can dine with John instead. This gets us in a fight as I think that John is inconsiderate and doesn’t need to be included in plans when he is not letting us know in advance that he will be visiting, and boyfriend thinks that Rod could just suck it up for a few hours so that we don’t have to change plans.\n\n**AITA for not wanting John to join us for dinner and just keep the plans as they are?** I honestly hate changing plans and think that Rod has the right to not want someone he doesn’t like over for an intimate dinner with close friends and family. John is impulsive and it bothers me that we are expected to include him on everything we do without proper notice. My boyfriend thinks I have no principals or morals for leaving our friend out when he doesn’t have many other people but I think John is the one pushing people out. Additionally, Rod’s parents had already paid for the dinner for everyone already joining.\n\nBTW, we ended up canceling dinner with Rod and eating with John because my boyfriend usually gets whatever he wants. \n\nTL, DR: John (friend) comes to visit unexpectedly and invites himself on already planned trip to Vegas for New Year’s. Rod (Friend 2) who is hosting dinner during trip HATES John and doesn’t want us to take him over for dinner. Boyfriend wants to cancel dinner plans with Rod so that we can eat with John as John doesn’t have any family. I want to tell John he can’t join us for dinner as we already had plans and Rod has a right to not want someone he doesn’t like over.",

      "description": "I feel incredibly guilty about this, but talking to my friends, they don’t think I’m entirely to blame for how things turned out so I guess I’m here for some unbiased judgement.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had been planning on going to this little concert for months. My boyfriend bought the tickets for both of us (£40 total) and surprised me with them, excited for us to have this event to go to. The artist performing rarely tours in London so this was also a rare opportunity. I was excited, he was excited. He said he really didn’t want to go alone because the artists songs are mostly romantic so it would be awkward, so I knew I HAD to go with him.\n\nSo the concert is at 7pm and we decide to leave his accommodation at 5:30pm so we can have some time to eat dinner beforehand. I was having trouble with both waking and sleeping due to minor jetlag (I had flown in from the US the day before) and so hadn’t managed to eat all day. I felt nauseated and very lightheaded. We even tried to have sex and I had to stop halfway through because I was seeing spots and my ears were ringing. He’s understanding and tells me to drink some water and rest.\n\nI try to sleep until its time for us to leave, hoping that would help, but when I wake up, I feel just as bad. I drink some more water, but everything in me is screaming to get back into bed, so I tell my boyfriend ‘5 more minutes’. He protests, saying we need to get ready to leave. I say ‘15 more minutes, and then I’ll get ready.’ I fall back asleep and wake up 2 hrs later to find his room empty. I assume he’s gone to the concert without me because his ticket is gone, and I feel terrible. I send texts apologizing for ruining the evening and promise to pay him back for the ticket he bought for me and that I’ll make it all up to him. I’m still incredibly lightheaded and hungry but can’t leave his flat because electronic doors + no keys = I’ll get locked out. \n\nHe responded to my messages after the concert to say he was pissed off with me and thought it would be best if I pack my overnight stuff (we don’t live together so, when I stay with him over the weekend, I pack my own overnight bag) and head back home. I asked if I’d get to say goodbye before I left and he said he was going to take a walk so I shouldn’t wait for him.\n\nWhen I got home, I sent a texts saying I made it back safely and he responded with the same, and that we’d chat tomorrow.\n\nI feel like an asshole for clinging to sleep when we had both been excited for this romantic date and made him go on his own when he didn’t want to. My lightheadedness was due to not eating and we were going out to dinner which would have solved the issue. I wasn’t thinking. I also have a habit of being sedentary so I also ruined the once-in-a-while dates where we go out and do an activity that he likes. I think I have full blame here.\n\nMy friends think my health should have come first and he shouldn’t have just left me to go to the concert anyway (although I don’t blame him for leaving me because of the explained rarity of this opportunity) and that he shouldn’t have been mad enough to kick me out of his place at 1am.\n\nAm I the (complete) asshole here?\n\ntl:dr; Felt ill so brushed off boyfriend a few hours before a pre-planned date out in order to sleep. Woke up to boyfriend gone and eventually got kicked out of his place cuz he was pissed at me.",

      "description": "Hi folks,\n\nNot English,  just emigrated to the other side of the world to explore and be with partner. Seeing how this goes. \n\nCan be NSFW \n\nI've had depression from 11 till 18 and now at the age of 22 again. \nThe big move really got to me and the symptoms are worse because I don't have a support system anymore. \nPartner is from Australia. \nMet him during an internship.\n\n\nSo I'm just going to be blunt about this. \nI'm the kind of girl that keeps on swallowing birthcontrol since my period comes with so much pain and other things it's not ok for me to function.\nBut yes every 4 months I let it happen as a check for myself. \n\nThat time is now and I feel shit. Like really.  Mood swings all over the place. I've seen a therapist again for the first time that was asking for my past, which is rough to say the least.  It sturled things up with my period. I miss home and thinking back on my traumas doesn't help. \n\nI cried and asked if to just sit on the bed and listen to me for a sec and support me.  He refused and kept pushing just say what you want to say.  I was sobbing and he walked off ignoring me. \nHe said I was annoying and demanding that he had to listen or he was the bad guy again. I could sence that he was very tired of 2 bad nights so I tried to drop it.\n\nI still got this very bad pain in my belly of disappointment and doubt.  I kept asking why can't you listen etc and he said can I have 1 day of off this? I'm not in the mood. \n\nSo I let it be and the next day he was happy and his normal self not asking how I was and if I wanted to talk or anything. \nI feel quite shit because it feels like I can only vent to him when it suits him.  Like he is in control when what .\n\nI'm doubting now. Normally he will act and react when I have a panic attack but again won't ask me anything or talk to me.  \nIn my eyes if you love some one you show by caring supporting and asking right?\n\n\nTL;DR AITA for expecting my bf to be there for me when I'm having a hard time? Even if he is feeling tired?",

      "description": "FTP, sorry if this is the wrong place to post.\n\nA little backstory. My father passed away in mid-September, and I am still grieving. My mom, brother, and I all agreed that we will not be exchanging Christmas gifts among ourselves. We are also part of a very large extended family, and usually, the people in my generation participate in Secret Santa. My dad was very close to a lot of my cousins, and so because of his death, we have also decided to change our Secret Santa into sponsoring gifts for families in need this year.\n\nHere's where I need advice. I am in no mood to celebrate Christmas this year. My dad's birthday also falls three days before Christmas, and I know I will be in a terrible state of mind. I have eight close cousins and friends with whom I usually exchange gifts outside of Secret Santa. A week ago, I decided that I would not like to receive gifts, and that I'd like to donate the money I would have used to buy gifts to a charity funding research for pancreatic cancer (disease that killed dad). I emailed my friends explaining that I will be making the donation in their honor as a gift and did not want to receive any gifts, but requested a Christmas card from them instead if they felt like it. I also said that if they were still intent on giving me a gift, I'd be happy if they donated as well. (I do intend on still writing them a nice card)\n\nI thought that my friends would be okay with this, but now I'm not sure. I sent the email a week ago, and I haven't heard back from anyone. I have communicated via text with at least two of the people, and neither of them mentioned the email or Christmas gifts. Was it rude of me to do this? Did I go about it the wrong way by using email instead of talking in person or on the phone? Should I have asked their opinions first?",

      "description": "Context; we're both just about 16, (our birthdays are in early December) so obviously neither of us can drive and he cant medically advocate for himself in our state (NY). We've been together for 3 years (4 in January), so this isnt a new family member. \n\nYesterday afternoon he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (the hereditary one, you're born with it but sometimes it only manifests later in life) and we spent 7 hours in total between travel and the hospital due to things moving slowly; 30 minutes being tossed around between the clinic and ER, 40 minutes until he could get a blood draw, an hour and a half for the results of said blood draw, 2 hours for the ambulance transport to arrive so he could be transferred to a bigger hospital, etc. He's being admitted for a couple days and hopefully will be released tomorrow after an educator comes in to teach him how to manage his condition, but the doctor said it could be up to a week if figuring out an insulin regimen doesnt go smoothly. \n\nHis mother is nearly illiterate, and he doesn't have a father in the picture or any other family member capable of staying with them for her sake. He's plenty smart enough to handle it himself, but information doesn't go to him much since he's a minor. Another concern is that they live below the $20k income line and if Medicaid/catastrophic health insurance doesn't cover something there's no way they'll be able to pay for it on their own. \n\nI want to go up and bring him his phone charger, own pajamas and the book we have to finish reading for a class. Plus I just see him for a bit to make sure everything is alright with his treatment. Problem is, I need someone to take me and my mother refuses until after dinner at noon. The hospital is a 1-2 hour ride and she isnt willing to drive that much for me or him because my college freshman brother is home for Thanksgiving and he's the golden child, which is what it is. \n\nIn the middle of writing this my grandma just showed up, just about told my mom to go fuck herself, and we're off like a prom dress. \nNow the issue is that my mom is going to be pissed once I get back for \"ruining her thanksgiving\", but I dont care.

Yesterday she came back from a trip to Miami and revealed she’d gotten a tattoo of the Hydra logo on her back (Like Madame Hydra’s but not so big). I got quite mad about this with her on account of Hydra being Neo-Nazis. I know Hydra isn’t real of course, but their logo is still a made up equivalent to the Nazi Swastika.\n\nMy friend probably didn’t think about the implications before getting the aforementioned tattoo but I can’t help feeling this is a deeply offensive and very permanent symbol of hate now on her body. My friend says I’m overreacting and maybe I am, but I’m still struggling to tell if my reaction has truly been too severe.\n\nAm I the Asshole? (Or even just overly sensitive?)",

Afterwards I asked him if he would consider going to couples therapy and he got pissed off real quick. \n\n\nI tried to explain that i thought it would be helpful to help us communicate, and I didn’t suggest it because I thought there was something really wrong with us. \n\n\nHe took it to mean that there’s something wrong with us, or I think in the future something will be really wrong with us, and he said if it comes to that then we should just spit up. I said eventually every couple gets to a hard place, and I wanted to try and prevent that by working on issues that COULD become bigger issues in the future. Lots of couples go to pre-marriage counseling to build a solid foundation in their relationship, and his response was they only go bc the church they want to marry in requires it. And what, I don’t think we have a good foundation? I don’t think we work well together?\n\nOur relationship is really good but there are definitely areas where it could be improved, on both sides. Since it’s a lot of misunderstanding I really think an unbiased 3rd party would be helpful. He refuses to even consider it because he doesn’t want to, there’s nothing wrong with him and he didn’t have a fucked up childhood (like me, I am in my own therapy). He said I’ve been going to therapy 2 weeks (actually 3 months) and now I just know everything and think I’m always right. He also thinks he’s always right. \n\n\nEven though we’ve been okay now, that doesn’t mean these things won’t build into something way bigger later on. I think we could try and be a better couple with a high chance of success but he thinks we’re fine and now this means something’s wrong but still won’t consider counciling because it makes him uncomfortable. He got mad at me for “pushing” it and I’m the asshole for trying to make him do something I want that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "TL;DR Boyfriend’s sister has Borderline Personality disorder and I can’t be around her constant negativity anymore.\n\nHi guys! My boyfriend (23) and I (22f) have been dating for almost two years now and for the most part, things have been great. However, about a year into our relationship his sister’s (21) mental health has declined and she’s now been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. \n\nFor most the ages of 13-20 I suffered pretty hard from depression and anxiety and at the age of 21 I got on meds which have helped me drastically from then till October of this year, which is when I stopped taking them and have been doing absolutely great.\n\nIn regards to his sister, I do try to do my best to understand that she is suffering from BDP but the shit she says is really starting to affect me. She’s constantly talking about how she wants to end her life (but speaks about it in such a happy way, laughing, etc) she’s constantly going off at her boyfriend for talking to another girl or even looking at one, she tells him that she’ll kill herself if he leaves her (once again laughing about it), she’s constantly having breakdowns (i know that she can’t help it) and overall she’s extremely negative towards everyone, even telling me from day 1 that if my relationship ends with my boyfriend it will because I cheat on him... WTF? What’s even worse is that I can’t get away from it; she’s not only my boyfriends sister, but she’s in my friendship group as well and she brings this behaviour to whatever plans that our friends organise and understandably, it brings the mood down for everyone. For example, the day 5 of us went out for lunch (boyfriend + me, sister + her boyfriend, and a mutual friend) and at the restaurant we were all talking and suddenly she (bf sister) interrupts the conversation saying that her boyfriend has to stop taking to us because she wants attention. \n\nI’ve been trying my best to seperate myself from her behaviour as I’m feeling it not only take a toll on my mental well-being, but it’s also taking a toll on my feelings toward her. I don’t want to hate my boyfriend’s sister, but at this point I’m starting to.\n\nMy feelings are making me snappy and I’ve started to unintentionally take it out on my boyfriend i.e my boyfriend wanted to go to the movies to see the new Spider-Man so I bought us tickets and 20 minutes before we were supposed to leave he texts me says that he probably won’t be able to make it because he’s sister is crying and punching walls (presumably because her boyfriend’s on a holiday). At the time, I ended up getting really upset over this as I felt that I had been pushed aside and it resulted in a fight with my boyfriend. Looking back now, I understand that I crossed a line and I had no right to go off at him for wanting to stay with his sister, but I still can’t help but feel disappointed. \n\nI’ve told my boyfriend how I feel and how her behaviour is affecting my mental state and the way that I feel towards her, but he keeps saying that it’s my problem for feeling this way in regards to her behaviour, not hers. It’s almost as if he has become desensitised to her behavioural issues and doesn’t see how bad it is. Because of this situation, I’ve started taking my meds again (two days in) because I just feel so distressed about all of it.  \n\nAt this point, I just can’t see myself dealing with this any longer. I’m either going to end up losing my shit at his sister when she says one more negative comment or it’s going to keep taking a toll on my relationship and eventually it’s going to crumble. \n\nAITA for wanting nothing to do with this anymore for the sake of my own mental health? \n\n",

      "description": "Please be aware that this might be a long read. For context i (m 30s) have been friends with this woman (also in her 30s) for a long time. Both of us have had our difficulties but it came to a head a couple of years ago. In the interests of full disclosure our friendship had become sexual for a short period prior to this but we were able to end it satisfactorily without resentment (at least that is how it seemed at the time). Conversations via text since then would also support this. \nThe issue was that she has a habit of calling me at odd times (1am on a saturday night for example) and trying to offload her problems. Both of us work difficult stressful jobs where we come into contact with people at their worst. Both of us are tired and stressed. Her more so because she has children. She can be quite intrusive and insistent with these calls and i have learned not to pick up. \nI asked her for the first time over 2 years ago to stop doing this. I trusted her at the time as we had been friends for a long time. However when i started standing my ground she leaves abusive messages on my voicemail or sends abusive texts or texts telling me about her mental health issues. Over time i stopped trying to reason with her and have now just flat out asked her to leave me alone and blocked her number. Despite numerous times where she has said she won't contact me she continues to do so. For the most part i do not respond but on the very infrequent occasions when i do I have tried to keep level (no insults,  keeping it to the point and respecting both mine and her boundaries) because i get the sense that what she really wants is a fight and i have better things to do. I know i am not innocent here because i probably was in a cycle of this behavior with her when we were younger (i have my own mental health issues namely bpd traits and depression) and i identified to her that i am equally responsible for contributing to how our friendship has panned out. I have also been persistent when wanting to talk to people in the past but have learned it is best to let go when it is clear my attention is unwanted and generally err on the side of caution because i hate imposing on people. \n\nIn short am i being a heartless asshole for not wanting to go through the fight she seems to be demanding from me or repair this friendship or am i respecting myself and my boundaries by not responding to the abuse and text barrage? Am i being manipulative at all? I just want her to leave me alone. \nThanks",

The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance?

      "description": "This might take a few paragraphs to get through, but here goes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother and father were not together when I was a child and I had no memories of my father from when I was small. There weren't any pictures of him and, as far as I was aware, he never asked to take us for a weekend or anything of that sort. There was one occasion, a foggy memory, where he apparently tried to buy me some candy when he ran into my mother with my (older) brother and I, but I can't speak to it. There's also a more vivid memory of going to a doctor's office, my brother being furious the whole time and us sitting across from some guy. Turns out that entire day was testing paternity. Child support and the like was apparently contentious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's fast forward to early adolescence. Apparently a plot is concocted to utilize my father's brother and my brother's love of Madden to get him to see his father. If my uncle beat him in a game then he'd have to see his father, if my brother won then he didn't have to. My brother demolished him. He was pretty good in Madden, so I think he really beat him here, but who knows. Regardless, my brother meets our father and I don't. They start a relationship which is pretty good til this day. I remember not wanting to go because I was too afraid to meet a stranger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout ten or twelve years after that I'm working as a garage attendant in my local neighborhood and someone pulls up to get out and it's my father. I'm twenty-five and this is the first conversation we've ever had. I start to see him around the way and he gives me his phone number, tells me about family events and says there's an open invitation. At one point his wife (not my mother) stops me in a supermarket because we look so much alike and invites me over for dinner. I say maybe, I never go. Quick note: I get stopped all the the time by people who mistake me for my father because everyone has been in the same neighborhood for fifty years. He has a son with his wife and in that regard I am the purest sense of asshole because I never gave the kid the time of day. I think it was some combination of envy, jealousy and anger that made me act the way I did. He's about ten years my junior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all came to a head this past July when my older brother and his wife had a baby shower. It was mostly my father's side of the family. I got there early, so when everyone walks in they turn their heads, see me and stare like deer in headlights. I spent most of the early part getting up and walking over to introduce myself to fight the awkwardness. I think they were afraid of how I was going to respond to them, but because it was my brother's day I was cordial to everyone. I smiled and I even stomached a picture with my father and siblings (there are actually four of us, we have a sister who's oldest). Uncles, aunts, cousins--I met them all and my grandmother on his side. This was particularly trying because I had lost the light of my life, my maternal grandmother, the previous year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't spoken to any of these people since the shower and honestly, I don't think I plan to. My father doesn't seem like a jerk and neither does anyone else. I know they all want it, but I don't think I do.",

The meeting was informal, just to touch base on how we deal with those, potential volumes and percentages and what can be done about them. One person, a step above me on the ladder but not my boss, said that it's no big deal, it's a 1% or 2% error margin out of huge volumes we get. He said they can never be eradicated, they will keep happening. That's where I disagreed. I have been working with this type of errors since 2010 and he has not. So I said 'No, maybe not eradicate them. But we can certainly look at trends and prevent most of them. Based on a small scale report, I have found that 80% are preventable errors. Coaching and education of staff is key.' I stayed polite the whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe looked very displeased with my disagreement and said again that it was not a lot.

      "description": "Context: I am in college with a friend group of 1 and a half years. At some point, my friend had been through alot, and I mean ALOT. So we did our best to comfort her and support her. Eventually she told us she \"didn't want to be alive anymore,\" one of the friends took action and had her go to the school's counselors office where she promptly went to a mental hospital. We sent her gifts and tried visiting her. She eventually gets out but not feeling particularly better. We get back together and try to enjoy ourselves, but she said something to me that got me real angry, so I left the building at night. I come back about 2 hours later and apparently they've been searching for me because they were concerned and I didn't have my phone. Okay, lesson learnt, sorry. Two days later, another heated argument with her and friend who took her to hospital. It was petty but it got her angry enough to decide to walk out of the car in the middle of the night to go back to her place which would be at least an hour walk. I wasn't even listening to the fight I was just sitting when she suddenly left. I thought it was unfair that she would leave in the middle of the night even though she was the main one lecturing me about leaving. I talk to friend who remained and turns out he was also suicidal. He said that the way she talked to him made him feel bad because she would say things like \"Fuck off\" or \"Shut up, bitch\" and we have never said those things to her. So we decide that the friendship seemed to be more of her getting nice words while the other depressed person gets insults along with the rest of us. Next day, we didn't expect an apology and she didn't give one. I tell her that we felt that the friendship was lopsided and that pretty much devestated her because she thought we were there to support her for her hard times, and yet we accused her of having a lopsided friendship. We were her best friends and I didn't mean to hurt her we were just very upset and confused and I feel like a complete asshole for it, but I just don't know because my other friend said he's glad he doesn't have someone telling him to fuck off in his life, but I made someone who was clinically depressed feel worse. I apologized, but it wasn't accepted. I want your unbiased opinions, please. Was I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have become fairly good friends with a girl that lives in my apartment complex. We have the same taste in music, video games, alcohol, we both are very into sports (watching), we have the same sense of humor, ect. you get the point. But she is also very unattractive, overweight, does not take good hygienic care of herself, and is pretty damn lazy. She virtually never leaves the house and is perfectly content with her shitty dead end job. So as fun as she can be to hang out with there is absolutely NOTHING there romantically for me.\n\nSo this past week as been pretty brutal for me. Me and my girlfriend had a pretty nasty fight/break up. I have been forced to work crazy long hours and have had to take some pretty gut wrenching kill a bottle just to try and forget type calls (I'm a cop). \n\nSo as you might imagine I have been on edge. So last night she texts me invites me over so I do. So we are hanging out, drinking scotch listening to music and just have a needed good time.\n\nThen she asks me out. I tell that I am sorry but I am not interested in dating anyone (probably should have been more direct for the first answer and just said no, lesson learned). She says she understands because me and my ex broke up and asks after my \"mourning\"period if we can date. I tell her I am not interested in her like that, that she is only a friend to me. She keeps pushing it and asking why over and over. So I snap and shout at her, \"Because you are a fat fucking slob that is going absolutely nowhere in life! That is fucking why!\"\n\nThis obviously caused her to start crying and telling me to GTFO. Obviously a very uncool thing to tell someone. But given that I was trying to be polite but she just kept pushing and not letting it go and all the shit I was dealing in my own life this past week am I still an asshole for snapping at her?",

      "description": "TL;DR: Mum reacts badly to me coming out to her. She's now trying to help, by suggesting jobs and volunteering which are trans-friendly, and is upset that I don't want her help.\n\n\nSo I'm transgender, and a few days ago I talked to my parents about starting Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). It went about as well as you'd expect when talking to Asian, Catholic parents about these things ...\n\n\nSome pretty hurtful things were said, including being told to go on antidepressants (I'm not depressed), and being told that I'm schizophrenic (I'm also not). My Mum also said that I wouldn't be able to go into engineering (what I'm studying at university) because there would be too much discrimination and no one would employ me.\n\n\nAfter a day or two, my Mum suggested I go into law instead of engineering as I \"have a niche in transgender rights which could be filled\". She also suggested that I start going to and volunteering at a more trans-friendly church (which is Protestant, not Catholic) because it \"would look good on a CV for the jobs you could go into\", implying that apparently I want to go into human rights law.\n\n\nI told her that I wasn't ready to forgive her for the things she said when I talked to her about HRT, and I don't want to change my career plans just because I'm transgender. She's started to act very hurt and won't talk to me about anything related to gender anymore.\n\n\nPart of me stands by what I said, as she wasn’t being supportive in the way I'd like to be supported, on the other hand, I know she's probably trying her best in a really uncomfortable situation, and I could have just accepted her help, even if it wasn't the best, because she is trying.\n\n\nSo what do you think Reddit, AITA?\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not immediately telling my aunt her sister died?",
      "description": "TL;DR: aunt was a bitch to my mom and other aunt. I waited weeks before telling my cousin that aunt died.\n\nBackground: We always heard how when my g’parents died, everything would be split equally between their three kids. Apparently the trust wasn’t written this way, because after my gma died mom and aunt D never got a penny. They did get some of the belongings but aunt E got the bulk of the $$$. D’s hub had a lawyer look at it but nothing could be done. Best guess is that E was beneficiary as well as trustee, and my g’parents trusted that E would honor their wishes and split equally.\n\nWhat I know for certain:\n\n- Mom and D waited a couple of hours after gma died before calling E (who lives across the country). They claim they were in denial and hoping she would start breathing again.\n\n- E kicked mom out of my gma’s house the night of the funeral and changed the locks. Mom was living there for weeks at that point, legally a tenant, but didn’t push things because she didn’t think my gma would want her to.\n\n- Mom and D filed for restraining orders vs E at some later date, and E vs them. There are no documents online. It says that none of them showed for the follow up court date so all orders were vacated.\n\nI have no other first-hand knowledge of anything. IMO there is not one thing mom could/would have done within hours of the funeral that would justify her being thrown out on the street. I further believe that this treatment should absolve her of quite a few sins that may have happened after the fact. Like, I would not condone outright assault, but mom would have been justified in verbally eviscerating E.\n\nAfter the dust settled, E told mom and D that she never wanted to see or speak to them or set foot in our state again.\n\nD died about five weeks ago and left a trust but no will. Mom and E are the beneficiaries of the assets outside D’s trust. D’s lawyer said he would get in contact with E so we wouldn’t have to. We gave him her number and address. 2 weeks passed and he told me he hadn’t been able to reach her. Not wanting to speak to E directly because of the falling out, I sent a fb message to E’s son W asking him to call me. I heard from W a week later and told him that D had died and the lawyer was having trouble reaching E. When I told him that mom didn’t want to contact E because of what happened after gma died, he replied, “you obviously don’t know what happened but we won’t get into that.” Our brief convo ended quickly after that. \n\nI am feeling guilty for waiting so long to contact E. On the one hand, she treated my mother awfully. OTOH I don’t know what mom might have done later, though there would be quite a bit of justifiable anger there. I would be pissed at someone who kicked me out of a house I had been living in with no notice. I also would want to know ASAP if one of my siblings died...but then again, we’ve never had any kind of blow up or falling out. So AITA?",

      "description": "So, there's this girl who joined Herbalife in order to hope for extra money at the end of the month on top of her wage. She was a very cautious person and also, a skinflint when she was in Europe. However, she earned enough money to start living abroad, in Australia. She was also a roommate for 6 months before she moved on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe seemed to have a nice life there, and it seemed that she had quit selling… stuff for Herbalife. We had some chat sometimes on FB, and were willing to meet as soon as possible.  \n\n\nThen she started travelling in the south-east of Asia: Indonesia, Cambodia, even India (yes, that's a large south-east), until she travels back to Cambodia where she started to work for a yoga center. Unfortunately, this place will close down by the end of March, and she reached me to deal with one major issue: money.  \n\n\nShe told me that she was seeing a personal coach who cost her $90 a month, and that she could pay this person because she joined MLMs like iMarketsLive. She tried to enroll me in several MLMs at once and command me to listen to several cult-like speechmen and watch 90 minutes slide decks on Youtube pretending these might fulfill my dreams one day. She insisted that my life could be better and could bring a lot in my personal development despite me having refused her MLM proposals from the go.  I told her I was horrified by what she said and tried to warn her about the dark sides of MLMs. She called me names, replied that my answers shocked her instead, her MLMs \"worked\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, she posted several stories on FB about how having a job is scam (People from /r/antiMLM may have seen the \"40-40-40\" thing) and how starting its own business is a far better choice. You named it: she became a hun, and one of the meanests, whose goal was simply to be \"the best\".  \n\n\nMy anger rose slowly as [a Slowpoke](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/7/70/079Slowpoke.png/250px-079Slowpoke.png)'s one, and after realizing that she belittled me as she never did before by becoming such a toxic person because of her MLMs, I decided to abruptly end (\\*) a close friendship that lasted for 8 years, by blocking her on FB. She didn't realize that immediately and she reached me by email. I replied her I would destroy all her emails she could send to me from now after having explained why I decided to take this extreme decision. All she could reply was thinking it was a \"fake\" friendship.  \n\n\nAITA?  \n\n\n(\\*) Yeah, that's the second thread in this subreddit where I brutally cut communication with people.",

      "description": "A few weeks ago I started deleting some of my wife's (32) facebook friends to try to make her happier. She gets into depressive moods often and I have been at a loss for ways to help. I did this because I was sure looking all day at her \"friends\" off on huge vacations was not helping the situation. Though, I am not saying this is the only cause for her bad mood. \n\nSome background details that may help. She has \\~2500 friends on facebook and I went through and removed only those that post the most \"instagram-influencer\" quality vacations photos. You know, the people who you wonder whether they even enjoy the vacation with how many pictures they must be taking. So, maybe 30 to 35 people removed. I did not want to go overboard so that she wouldn't notice a drop in friends. I feel like if I told her I did this, or told her beforehand it would lose its affect or not have had an affect. Overall, over the last 2 weeks, she seems a bit less mopey (though maybe that is just conformation bias).\n\nAlso, we are decently well off ourselves. We go on \\~3large vacations a year and many smaller trips. Also, she knows I have her fb login.",

      "description": "Throwaway because at least some of the involved parties know my main account.\n\nSo, I’ve been involved in a few D&amp;D games over Skype/Discord in the past few years, and one of the people in my current group is someone I’ve played with before (we’ll call her Beth). In a campaign I played with her a year or two back, there was some drama with another player (we’ll call him Ross) who got creepy/possessive/vaguely stalkerish toward Beth. She told the rest of the group, showed us screenshots, and he was kicked. Note that I had played with Ross in other games before this. \n\nRecently, I joined a newly started game with mostly new people (plus Beth, obviously). We were doing some out of character chat about D&amp;D and our previous experiences, and one of the players said some stuff that sounded familiar. I PMed him about it, and confirmed (with minimal prompting) that not only was it someone I’d played with before, but that it was Ross. He knew that Beth was in the group and wasn’t comfortable around him/playing with him, but felt that she was “being unfair” and that he’d “learned his lesson and deserved another chance to be her friend,” and thus used a new alias to join the game and had asked the person who’d invited him to introduce him as a different name. For what it’s worth, the person who invited Ross was told what happened by Ross, so I’m assuming he got a very different version of events than what actually happened. Ross’s “plan,” by his own admission, is to play with her for a while, then reveal that it’s him so that she can see he’s changed and give him another shot. Beth, for her part, has expressed in the past that she doesn’t want him in her life after how he treated her, and I know that she’d be uncomfortable/feel unsafe if she knew it was him. \n\nWIBTA if I told him his choices were to either tell her/the group who he is or have me do it? I’m not looking to dox the guy, but I think Beth has the right to know who she’s playing with and to feel safe while playing, and that the group has the right to know what kind of person they’re playing with.

      "description": "Sorry, on mobile.  Tldr; I called the police on a suspicious truck (creeping down the road,  parking in the dark without getting out) that turned out to be someone who lives in the neighborhood. \n\nThis happened a few weeks ago, but I think about it still.  I was coming home around 9pm and followed a truck into my neighborhood. The truck turned on my street and proceeded to go, like, 10mph or less. Speed limit is 25-30.  I figured he was visiting someone and just looking for street numbers. I pull into my driveway and watch the truck do only what I can describe as \"hover\" at the stop sign for several seconds longer than I'd expect.  He then turns. \n\nNow, our neighborhood is small and is not very confusing. There's a field across from my house,  so I watch this truck slowly go down the street, then stop in front of a dark house. The truck is not under a street light.  The truck doesn't turn off,  and no one approaches or leaves the truck for 10 or so minutes. The headlights turn off,  but again, the car does not,  and no one moves. \n\nOur neighborhood has had break ins before. At this point,  I figure this truck is casing for empty houses,  parking in the dark where it'll be less visible (the truck was black), and,  seeing that I haven't gone inside, is waiting for me to move. I post in the neighborhood book of faces and ask if anyone is \"missing a friend because this truck looks lost.\" No response. By this point 15 minutes have passed. \n\nSo I call the police.  I'm like,  \"look, I'm getting a weird feeling from this car, this person's been sitting here for like 15 minutes after creeping down the street, could you come look?\"\n\n10 more minutes pass (so we're looking at close to half an hour) and police show up, get behind the truck, turn on their lights,  and get on the intercom. I receive a call 5 minutes later that the person lives in the neighborhood but was on the phone and trying not to lose cell signal. I've never heard anyone on any carrier complain about signal,  and people complain about cable and internet, but ok.\n\nTwo days pass before this guy responds on FB that \"he was racing his wife and son home from a basketball game, but was going to let his son win,  so he pulled off so he could watch for the car to go down the main drag, and then come up behind. Apparently they passed right as the police turned on their lights and embarrassed him.\" I told him I was sorry,  but what else was I supposed to think about a truck creeping down the road and sitting in the dark? (Also,  that's totally not the story I was told by dispatch, but whatever.) Plus, this guy \"raced\" his kid, but managed to be half an hour ahead at 9pm, when the roads are quiet?\n\nAITA?",

Now mom2.0 isn’t actually my mom, she’s more like a close family friend, and like a mother to me. She is VERY extroverted, and I take after my mom who is VERY introverted.\n\nSo basically this all went down about 20 minutes ago.\n\nEvery Wednesday I go on a visit to my grandparents. So, when I get off the bus from school, to after dinner. Sometimes I stay longer. Well today I had a Personal Project to work on. It included stories from my grandpas life so I needed a video of my interviewing him. Luckily my very chatty gma and mom2.0 wanted to go the mall, so they went.  I had a very nice, but full, night discussing with my grandfather. I also have a French test tomorrow which I anxiously studied for. Mom2.0 and gma walk through the door at about 9:15. I had been there for 5 hours and I just wanted to go home.\n\nSo I got my shoes on and before leaving Mom2.0 said she’d give me a lift. I politely declined and she insisted again. At that moment, out of exhaustion and just wanting to go home I immediately opened the apartment door and ran down the stairs. I hid in the stairwell for about 5 minutes and texted my mom. She told me that it was ok, and she’s done it before and that she understood me.\n\nAfterwards, out of fear of getting caught by her I took a longer route home, about an extra 5 minutes to the 5 minute walk. When I got home she was outside waiting and told me my mom had been looking for me. I was keeping my mom updated but as my phone had died she got worried. I went into my room and locked myself in as I didn’t want to be yelled at.\n\nI heard the door to my house open up and heard Mom2.0 leave with her car. I went down to my mom and apologized for making her upset. Apparently Mom2.0 wanted to come in and yell and me but my mom explained the situation. My mom threw herself under the bus for me. Now, Mom2.0 thinks I hate her, which I don’t. I sent her a text apologizing, explaining the situation, that it was my fault, but she only thinks in a straight line and sees the facts and come to her own conclusion. It’s been twenty minutes since I texted her and im yet to get an answer. AITA?",

      "description": "So I was good friends with these two girls at work. They're really cool and our personalities just vibed. During the latter part of last year we became best of friends and I would really only hang out with them. All is good and well.\n\nRecently, one of them, let's call her Jane, and I get really close to the point that we share deep conversations and don't tell our other friend about things that we talked about (They were close between each other too). We basically get down to the couple level where we obviously flirt with each other but she doesn't realize it when everyone else in the room does. This eventually leads to me developing feelings for Jane. Only problem is that she already has a bf. Now I feel so wrong that she's being flirty but still calling me a friend when it's actually as if we're a couple. I explain my feelings to her and she ends up what could be considered friendzoning me. Now I get the fact that she has a bf and that's cool but she's almost leading me on and giving me hope that we have a future when she doesn't see me that way. It's like she's just using me for the attention and I wanted out. Just to get away so that the feelings can go away.\n\nFast forward to even more recent, I say I need a break from you both so that I can get over Jane. Jane is now upset that we can't be like it was before and basically hates me even if she says she doesn't. I'm just taking a week off from work so I can do whatever and get over it but I still wanna be friends and I think I can do it because I'm over her now. The thing is that they both dislike me for dropping them and the other friend thinks that I used her to get to Jane which isn't true. AITA?",

      "description": "SO, I recently broke up with my boyfriend and my friends thought it would be fun to make me a bumble account. Great. Whatever. \n\nThey were swiping for me and I ended up matching with this guy I’ll call Mark. We only exchanged about 4 messages back and forth at which point I decided to look at his social media. One of my friends was catfished once so I like to do my research. He used to play a sport in college and posted a pic wearing his jersey so that’s how i figured out his last name. Finding him on facebook was easy that way and his profile was public. \n\nOne of his more recent pics was with a girl and it was posted 3-4 months ago. No red flags there, but I went to her profile to see what’s up. I saw that she had made a post a few days ago with Mark announcing that they had moved across the country together (to my city). I took a screenshot of that post and sent it to him on bumble. He unmatched me immediately after. \n\nI took a screenshot of our conversation and sent it to his girlfriend(?) via facebook because my friends told me I should. I feel like I did the right thing by telling her because they apparently just moved across the country together for his job, but part of me also feels bad for sticking my nose in someone else’s relationship. \n\nSo, AITA?

      "description": "Background- \n\n16 (M) high-school student\n\nReally wanted to hang out with this friend-group a couple of months ago (was already good friends with 1 person in it). He asked If I was going to a school movie night and I said I would if I had a ride but my parents were out. He said he would drive me and afterwards I ended up hanging out with the whole group.  \n\n\nThey invited me to their discord server, and it had been active for months. Talked in a couple calls with them that week, everything seemed normal. Suddenly, the server went dead. I could see they were all playing together and online in discord still, but the previous server was dead. I wasn't invited to their new one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver a period of a couple months I invited them to a couple of games and was mostly ignored. Anytime they said yes, they would play for a bit then leave and never invite me to play with them again. I always said afterwards something like \"That was really fun, I'd love to hang out with you guys more!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, I asked if anyone wanted to play Minecraft (don't judge me) in the old server. A couple told me they couldn't do it and most just ignored me. Minutes later, I see in the sidebar they're all playing Minecraft together. I said I thought they couldn't play, and they said something like \"got it working now haha.\" I asked if I could join them and was ignored. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, that night I had a fever and was functioning on little sleep and basically drafted a long message to my good friend that originally invited me and communicated to him that it hurt to be ignored by people and didn't understand why they kept doing this. Basically just told him I was frustrated. He hasn't contacted me since (message was 2 days ago). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for sending this message and being frustrated with my friends? Is he angry, and if so is he rightfully so? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friends ignored me/ blew me off for months, switched discord servers to avoid me, lied about not being able to play with me. I sent a long, frustrated message to the one I was closest to in it. ",

      "description": "Quick backstory : my current GF of 7 months was previously cheated on in her last relationship. She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. ",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nRecently one of closest friends (let’s call her Jane), along with my roommate, sat me down for an intervention. Long story short, they gave me some **AWFUL** advice about my mental health (lots of pop psychology), and told me I shouldn’t be starting a new relationship (my new bf is nice, sweet, not creepy, smart, no major red flags). Apparently I need to learn to “love myself” and not use a partner as an emotional crutch. They want me to break up with him before we get too serious. In hindsight, I can assure you, they were extremely stepping out of line. They are not the experts on my mental health (I go to therapy, takes meds, I know how my brain works). The conversation got tense. In the end, I made it clear I disagreed and wanted them to drop it. But they kept needling me about it, and a day later I ended up having my first fight with my roommate because of it. Then a couple days later, Jane texted me to say she will have to distance herself more from situations where my bf is around, because my “unhealthy life choices” are affecting her own mental health. \n\nAnyways, at the time, I let it get to my head, and I started to worry that they were seeing something I wasn’t. They were so adamant. So I related the intervention story to our other friends. Who were absolutely appalled. After experiencing the intervention onslaught, it was amazing to having my opinion about my own mental health and dating life validated. I got caught up it in all, and whoever I talked to about it agreed with me wholeheartedly. I may have shit talked a little. I was angry and offended. But then, no surprise, because of me talking about the “intervention”, almost everyone was super turned off towards Jane (they don’t really know my roommate). I don’t think Jane has realized I confided in our friends. \n\nNow some of my friends don’t like Jane as much as they did before. We’re all still friendly, it just feels different. Maybe it will pass, maybe I’m just being anxious, but it feels like the situation has permanently altered their opinion on her (especially for one very good friend who lives far away). \n\nI’m starting to feel kind of guilty. It wasn’t my intention to make our friends upset, I just wanted to feel heard, not alienate a close friend who made a mistake. Should I have just kept it to myself and not dragged our friends into it? Did I make the situation too dramatic? AITA for throwing her under the bus? AITA for not telling her I “blabbed”? Or is she the asshole for giving me unsolicited, awful advice? \n\nTL;DR: friend gave me awful, forceful advice. I gossiped and told our mutual friends, and now they don’t like her as much ",

      "description": "I dated a girl for two years. We lived together one. We both exercised a lot and had many things in common. We talked about and agreed on marriage and kids and our future. I always had a great relationship with her family and especially her father. We are very similar and handy individuals. I would get a lot of housework and financial advice from him throughout the relationship. He owned the house we lived in and did not charge us rent. He is a great guy and I feel like I owe a lot of my success to him. \n\nI graduated with my bachelor's and started my first \"big boy\" job. With the commute I was gone anywhere from 10-13 hours a day. I would come home exhausted and plop on the couch. I gained 10-15 lbs in 10 months. Occasionally I would help with dinner but for the most part, that fell on her (one of her complaints during the breakup). She was training for a half iron man and was dedicating a lot of time to that (1-3 workouts 7 days a week). We both stopped putting effort into the relationship. When we realized it, I wanted to work things out, she did not want to put any effort into it (her words). A month prior I had asked her dads permission to marry his daughter (he gave his blessing and we both got a little emotional) and I started looking at rings. \n\nAfter the break up, I was so heartbroken I quit my job and moved everything from FL to IN back with my family. I really needed the love and support from friends and family. While I was moving out, her dad was visiting. He even helped me move my stuff into the Uhual. As I was leaving, he walked me out to my vehicle and we hugged and we both cried a little bit. We agreed to keep in touch. \n\nWe have emailed a few times and kept in touch like we agreed over the past couple months (breakup was in August '18). In the last email, he let me know he would be dog sitting for my ex during the week I will be visiting FL. I suggested we get dinner and he agreed. I texted my ex to ask her to give the clothes I forgot to her dad so he could bring them to dinner (we have texted periodically since the breakup about nothing important, sometimes she would initiate, sometime me). She went off on me and told me I am not allowed to be friends with her family or her dad. She said \"Maybe you should consider my feelings before you make plans that violate them\". She believes I will create a wedge between her and her dad (she also believes I created a wedge between her and her best friends because I talked to her best friends' husbands during the breakup, (whole other story)). I know she is extra stressed at this time with work, but am I the asshole for wanting to hang out with her dad? ",

      "description": "January 2018, a then-close friend godparent to my first child) was anticipating her upcoming engagement and asked me to be a bridesmaid. \n\nShortly after she got engaged, I became pregnant with my second child. Thanks to her busy work schedule and my stressful pregnancy (and postpartum/prenatal depression) we didn’t talk or see each other much the rest of the year.\n\nIn August 2018, before the baby came, my friend set the date for her wedding in May and invited me to meet to look at invitations. During this hangout, she said something to the effect of, “And of course I want to to be a bridesmaid, but I know you’ll be busy with the baby, so I have a special request to ask you: will you play a song at the wedding?”\n\nI thought I was being uninvited to be a bridesmaid because we weren’t as close as we used to be before I had kids (2017 and 2018 due dates) so I was surprised and hurt at the request, and said I’d think about it.\n\nAfter talking it over with a different friend, I convinced myself that maybe the bride-to-be genuinely thought I’d be too busy with the baby. I wrote her an email to say, if it’s really about the baby, that’s not a problem and I’d still love to be in the wedding. If it’s more that we’ve grown apart, I totally understand and will be happy to celebrate the wedding as a guest. \n\nShe wrote back that she was just worried I’d be overwhelmed and of course she’d love to have me in the wedding. \n\nAt first I was relieved! But we still haven’t hung out a lot, and any requests to hang out typically get turned down or cancelled last minute. Despite living 10 minutes away, she didn’t meet my newest baby until he was 4 months old. As I see her go through the wedding planning process and say yes to things she then tells the wedding party she does not want, I’m now worried she’s a secret people pleaser and was actually trying to dis -invite me to be in the wedding and my awkward email “forced” her to keep me.\n\nAITA? Or does it sound like a honest miscommunication between friends going through a busy time?",

      "description": "    So, back in April of 2018, my ex-girlfriend convinced me I could hypnotize her. Yeah, it sounds stupid but I was fairly convinced because she put up a good act and it convinced me because she had mental problems and I assumed my voice was soothing to where it could control her? Anyway, I had problems believing it myself so I was constantly asking her if it was real. One day, I got extra paranoid and I said, “ Are you lying to me? Promise to me you’re not lying, and I won’t get mad right here right now. If you tell me that you’re lying later, I’ll be mad and paranoid with you. “ Well she told me she wasn’t lying and then of course, A couple days  later she cut herself because she felt so bad about faking the hypnotism thing, and then she let me take the full blame for cutting herself. I thought I was responsible because I was putting a strain on her mind. She came out later to me that she was lying about it, and it wasn’t real and I just... I got so mad. I got so paranoid with her. I didn’t hate her, I still loved her but we made an agreement at that point we wouldn’t lie about anything big anymore because it would make us feel bad. \n\n    Now, what does she do again? She keeps things behind my back and lied about them, again! I became really paranoid towards her after that first lie, so I ask her if I can have access to her accounts and she, wanting to do anything she can to recover my trust, gave me access to her accounts. I scouted through them and low and behold, one of her messages sent to someone else was something about not telling me that she watched porn. I told her that she shouldn’t lie to me because it would make me irrationally angry and paranoid. I didn’t want to be like that, but it happened. We talked about how she lied about that too and she apologized and said sorry and didn’t think it was a big deal.  At this point, my paranoia just ramped up and I had constant thoughts of “did she hate me? was she using me? why does she do this?!”. I was always wondering if she was lying to me and it really screwed my brain up. At points, I would threaten to break up with her... as a test because if she cried then I thought it would give me a little closure on my paranoid brain. She did end up crying, and I ended up crying and apologizing to her and explaining it was to see if she loved me.  Also, her lying to me made me feel suicidal and betrayed at some points. I made it clear to her about that. \n\n    Anyway, she lied twice about two big things and my trust completely broke towards her and I became more harsh than ever and she broke off the relationship because she couldn’t handle how ill I was. Thing is, after she broke up and blocked me, she told her friends I was a psychopath. \n    So, reddit, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I got a tattoo the other day from a skilled artist. And while I am happy with the final result, the process of getting there was stressful. \n\nI am from Canada and am staying in Denmark for school. My best friend from Canada flew to Ireland with her school so I flew to Dublin to meet up with her for a day. We decided well before the travel date to get tattoos while we were there. \n\nThey only had a facebook page to communicate and book an appointment. So I was on facebook chat and I had an idea for a tattoo (floral collarbone) and I knew the artist I wanted to have tattoo me. But he wasn’t available for the day I was booking. They recommended a girl to do it instead and when I looked at her portfolio I didn’t like her style for my idea. So I spitballed a few different ideas (I have a lot of tattoos I want to get). We landed on four elephants linked trunk and tail on my arm. I booked the appointment with the girl and paid a deposit and all was well. \n\nCome the day for the tattoo and the artist walks up to me with a picture of the floral tattoo that I decided against. I was really frustrated by that. But I thought I would see how she draws it up (I had a photo for reference). When she came back with the drawing it wasn’t exactly what I wanted. She told me to stay and see how it looks on me when she transfers the ink. When it was placed and I looked in the mirror, I really liked what I saw. And she explained that because of the placement and size, I really couldn’t get any more details or shading (which is what I was looking for). So I trusted what she said and agreed to the tattoo. \n\nI’m really happy with the result. It’s dainty like what I wanted. But I’m upset about the big miscommunication and the fact that the tattoo was not what I expected (but I trust that I wouldn’t have been able to get what I wanted...). \n\nSo, I want to write a review saying that the artist was very skilled and did a great job, but the process was stressful and I ultimately did not get what I came in for. \n\nThey gave me free lotion for my tattoo in compensation. \n\nAITA? Should I just not write a review? Or am I justified to not give them a full 5 stars? ",

      "description": "I recently filed for contempt against my ex spouse for withholding of my parental visitation time. Upon consulting with my attorney, she recommended that I pursue full physical custody due to what the other party is doing and the \"egregious nature\" of the contempt action.\n\nI have had to use law enforcement to obtain some of my children since October (My oldest daughter never is denied contact with me). I know it terrifies them and I really hate that I've been forced into this predicament.\n\nThis has been used against me. My children have been told \"dad is in trouble with the police\" and that I only want to force them to see me. The parental alienation has been turned all the way up and when my ex spouse was served the message delivered was \"your dad is just trying to steal you to hurt me\". She told them immediately and I'm forced to change the subject when the kids are with me because I refuse to talk about adult matters with them. This leads the children to believe that Mom is right and they have to protect her.\n\nI've attempted to accomadate my ex spouse and I tried really hard to avoid the courts and conflicts. I dont want to negatively affect my children but I also know that I have to fight for this. The constant negativity is so tiring and as a child from a broken home myself, I wanted to avoid this at all costs.\n\nI feel awful about this. I wont stop but knowingly putting the stress on them is causing me to feel like an asshole.\n\n*Some additional information - I have documented every communication between me and their mom due to a history of bizarre allegations along with every instance of parenting time with the kids. \n\nI have three daughters and they are all under ten. I am divorced and have been upholding all ends of my obligations according to our parenting plan and the actions laid out in the divorce decree.\n\nMy children have an excellent relationship with my wife now and there is no heartburn with that relationship.\n",

I'm fine\" and then she just left and went to her room while throwing her door. \n\nNow I feel bad because I wasn't nice to her, but I was holding back tears because of my foot, I didn't want to give explanations at that moment and I believe that she didn't need to know what had happened in that instant, she could have waited.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

She than proceeded to say that i usually get it for her and that my friends live near the store that i get it from anyways. I said again to my sister im not going to spend anymore of my own hard earned money to get you anymore drink. She than procceeded to say that im a bad brother for not helping her in her time of need.

      "description": "Hello everyone,\nIn one of my classes, we have class work where a group of 5 people complete an assignment and if it is done before class ends, you get 3% extra credit.\n\nIn my group, we have a disabled student. I don't know what his disability is but he himself told me he is disabled. I don't want to say anything wrong but I'm going to try and describe in what way he is disabled just so I'm giving you both sides: he gets irritated when things don't go his way, he is very picky and his language (in terms of writing) isn't the best but it's also not the worst (we would have to edit his work) so it's not a severe disability from what I've seen (I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, please correct me if this isn't a good word to use).\n\nHe used to do his work in the beginning of the year (we edited it) but he has slowly slacked off and just stopped doing his work altogether. We still put his name on our assignments because we kinda just don't want to be mean. It's still very unfair that he gets credit for work we do and sometimes we don't get extra credit because we don't have an extra person also working on the assignment with us like most groups do. I'm thinking of telling the professor to not give him credit for the past assignments but I don't want to be an asshole. What do you guys think?",

It was definitely on purpose and she didn't show any regret whatsoever. Even though I got super mad and even insulted her she didn't even look sorry at all. She even assaulted me verbally for being mean to her and accused me of not holding my phone tight enough. In my mind that shows zero respect towards me.\n\nThis morning, when I woke up, I realised that she cracked my phone screen (Samsung Galaxy A5) and asked for compensation. The crack isn't that big, but it's visible and it's bothering me. She gave me 100€ some hours later despite not liking the idea of it.\n\nI feel guilty getting money from her. Am I the asshole?

      "description": "Soz in advance it’s a long one..\n\n\nTo set the scene, we’ve been best friend over 10 years. They have been through a lot in life (like us all) and last year hit rock bottom (anxiety and depression). I was like their on call therapist, I gave them all of my time with constant reassurance and compassion, literally every single day. \nMy life was miserable, my mother was worried about me, I was exhausted. I didn’t see our other friends because depressed friend couldn’t handle seeing them. When I would go out with the boy I was dating, depressed friend would text constantly asking ‘how long will you be’ and ‘where are you’. They even went as far to take all of their medications up the mountain to OD when I was unavailable (didn’t actually go through with it, but told me immediately afterwards).\n\nYes this was my choice to be their support, I was tying to be the friend that I have needed in such dark times. I was dealing with bankruptcy at the same time, and said friend would cry about their debts to me etc. and I felt it was insensitive. \n\nSaid friend is now fine and as if nothing had happened. Their behaviour towards me have changed over the past few months, with catty, passive aggressive comments which make me feel like shit. I’ve come to realise how devious and manipulative this person is, even my other friend has changed towards me.\n\nI’ve been unwell and in hospital, said friend is nowhere to be seen. Not even a 5 minute home visit (they live across the street). Friend have been going out with our other friends having a great time, knowing i was house bound.  \n\nI really resent them for this as I feel we’ve had a one sided friendship. I don’t expect my friends life to stop because I’m unwell, but I expected a little compassion at least. I feel like I’ve been the person to vent their bullshit to, but when it’s my turn to speak they cannot and will not listen. \n\nTherefore, I haven’t spoke to friend about this issue but have stopped contact. I feel guilty as I know they are having difficulties, but aren’t we all? My other friends think Im in the wrong for this and they have stopped talking to me. \n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday, my parents and I were discussing if I should get a locker or not. I have many books to carry and lockers cost money in my school, so I was telling them that I would need a locker because I have to move around a lot with my books. \n\nMy school said that most of the time, the teachers would come to us, but that unfortunately is not true in my situation. I tried to give an example not relating to my subjects (my fault) as to how I have to move most of the time. My father got angry and asked for an example, so I went to my room to find my schedule (I guess I looked a bit irritated), but I couldn't find it. \n\nI decided \"oh well, I don't want to argue, I won't get a locker.\" End of discussion right? Wrong.\n\nMy mom kept giving me reasons as to why I didn't need a locker for school. \n\nNow on Tuesday, I got in a car accident, and every now and then, sharp pains happen.\n\nI guess the stress and pain sort of made me burst into tears, so I went to excuse myself and try find my pain medicine in my room.\n\nWhile I was searching through my bag, I found my schedule and put it on the bed for later. I kept looking for my medicine, but I couldn't find it. \n\nMy dad suddenly came in and asked why I was so angry. I explained I wasn't angry but I was in pain and I was trying to find my medicine. My dad started yelling and asking why I was so angry and again I was trying to explain I couldn't find my medicine.\n\nMy dad suddenly saw my schedule on my bed and mockingly said \"Oh it just magically appeared out of nowhere\" and I screamed at him that I had just found it now and I told him to stop yelling.\n\nHe suddenly slammed the door, grabbed me by my shoulders, and shoved me onto my bed. I was shocked. He then told me to go out and apologise to my mom and my dad for screaming.\n\nI feel like I was being an asshole, but was I? \n\nI only questioned it when my dad later denied mocking me or yelling and justified physically shoving me, saying \"where are the cuts and bruises?\"\n\nAm I overreacting? Am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR: Couldn't find my schedule, suddenly found it, dad told me I faked not finding it, I yelled at him while being under stress and being in pain.",

      "description": "For 2 years of college I roomed with a guy from my high school. He and I got through a lot of tough things together (including the onset of my severe anxiety, including headaches/somatization, though i didn't tell him all the details with that). He introduced me to my first co-ed friend group (which was actually toxic but it was still an important milestone), I drank with him, helped him with homework, and we shared a lot of time together. We always had disagreements over politics (I am a Democrat and he is a Republican who likes Trump, but who also does not vote.) This included him expressing some problematic beliefs, making racist and sexist jokes, and especially expressing homophobia and transphobia, while also expressing and showing that he would not disrespect someone to their face for their identity.  I dismissed this and remained friends with him for two reasons. Number one, because his beliefs (especially on homosexuality) are similar to my parents, who are devout Catholics (although they wouldn't let some of his \"jokes\" fly), as well as to many of my high school classmates (white, upper middle class suburb with strong \"frat\" wannabe culture). And number two, because I have always struggled to make friends, and he was an extremely loyal friend who was also much more popular and well-liked by both girls and guys than I was. I was too insecure to stand up for my beliefs, so I tried to both express my beliefs to him (he knew I didn't like the way he thought) and also be loyal to a friend who had been loyal to me.\n\nI feel I was certainly was the asshole then, because I didn't stand up for what i 'believed' in (making it unclear how much I really believed in it at all,) and enabled his biases. My justification was that he would never disrespect someone to their face (indeed, I have never seen him do this). However, during our second year of living together, my views changed. I became more sure that he was bigoted, especially when he said he had left a bar after seeing a gay couple there. And my beliefs started to matter more to me as I became involved with a new group of friends, started going to therapy for my depression and anxiety, and became more secure in my identity. I deleted facebook and started going by a nickname in 2018. It was a big year. And I almost completely cut him off. However, a couple of my LGBT-accepting friends from high school still like him.\n\nNow I just rejoined Facebook because I felt like it was time to put myself back out there. He requested me, and I declined the request. (On my old FB, I would only decline people if I didn't know them at all or if we'd had a falling out. So I guess this is a full-on falling out.) Am I the asshole? (Additionally, how do I go about making sure I stand by my beliefs even when it's hard?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

(I was pretty mean about it, honestly) Cousin goes home, overdoses on pills, is rushed to the hospital, and while recovering tells the whole family it was my fault. \nI felt that those were serious bull crap  claims and dropped that side of the family (aunt, uncle, other cousins) entirely because they were mad at me and had no interest in hearing what I had to say. My brother is getting married and wants me to now make up with them so the reception is less awkward. I dont want to.\n\nHeres to full story. \nGirl cousin got upset that my brother's girlfriend shot a joke at my boy cousin about his speech impediment. She wanted to \"throw hands\" and called me to ask where my brother was. She came over to my house to vent about the situation. I told both my brother and my cousin that it was just a joke and that my male cousin wasnt even upset so they shouldnt worry about it. She told me that \"I just dont understand\" and I told her to stop acting like a child. We started cussing at each other then she wanted to fight me. I told her I'd call the cops and she needed to leave. I also told her I didnt want her in my life if she was going to solve family issues with fighting. She went home. I thought that was really the end of it. Nope. \nHer mom calls me the next day to tell me she tried to kill herself and she deserved an apology from me. This cousin has a history of doing things for attention when things dont go her way. (Faking injuries, claiming to be super sick, etc). \nI asked if she was okay and they said she was fine but I needed to go apologize. I told them I wasn't going to apologize because I didnt feel I did anything wrong. They hung up and that was pretty much the end of it. A year later the girl cousin calls me and asks if I would watch her baby so she could go to a Halloween event with her friends. I told her no, I havent even talked to her in over a year. She got upset, cussed me out, and hung up. I've made no contact for two years now, it's been great. \nMy brother is getting married and Insists that I need to make up with them so we can get along at the reception. I told him that I can be civil without making up with them. I can be polite and say hello and have no issues but he doesnt want that. Hes now mad at me. AITA? \n",

My entire life, she's shown up late to everything, shown zero disregard for other people's feelings or needs. She was the only family member who wouldn't help clean up after dinner, she would yell at her children in a foreign language, she lied to her Muslim au pair about a dish not containing pork and thus had that poor college student unknowingly violate her religion.

There's a lot more, but you get the idea.\n\nThe worst thing yet happened last fall. My grandmother, who lives out-of-state, fell very ill, and was in the hospital (she's actually doing quite well now); several of my family members went down to visit her on rotations to help my grandfather take care of her. At one point, this aunt went down for her turn. The first or second day there, she ended up in a screaming match with the oncologist, in the hospital, which then turned into an argument with my grandparents. It ended with her telling both of them \"f\\*\\*\\* you\" to their faces, and going straight to the airport and flying home. My parents, myself, my siblings -- we are FURIOUS. My uncle has been under her command their entire marriage, and as far as we know has just avoided the entire topic in the months since.\n\nI do not want to invite this woman to my wedding, though I love her husband and her children, my cousins, who are now 30/26/16. I think there is an acceptable limit in terms of a way you can act towards my family, and she crossed the line. Without what happened to my grandparents, it would have been 50/50 that she gets invited, but after that I had no interest in including her in any of it. My fiancée, who is amazing, is 100% behind me.\n\nMy parents agree with me, but are hesitant to deal with the situation. We have an engagement party that we've planned for a few weeks from now, that my uncle already knows about because my grandparents are coming to town, as well as a couple other family members. I’m aware that not inviting my aunt means that my uncle/cousins are also not likely to attend the wedding, but I’d rather that alternative than having my parents/grandparents extremely uncomfortable, and risking this woman blowing up and ruining the night.\n\nWIBTA for not inviting my aunt to the wedding?",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this brief. My grandfather is in the slow decline of lung cancer and dementia. My grandmother has been caring for him and it has been a lot of stress on her. My aunt and uncle help where they can as they live nearby, my mother and I live four hours away and visit around once a month to do what we can.\n\nMy grandfather has been in hospital for the last fortnight with a chest infection. Due to his immune system being extremely low the doctors want him out of the hospital ASAP. My aunt and uncle were determined to have him go back home, even though my grandmother wants him in a home. \n\nMy grandmother, aunt and uncle had a 'family meeting' today, without consulting my mother, and decided to have him put in a home because they found out that caring for him at home would involve literally wiping his ass.\n\nI got home from work to find my mother very upset, saying she hated them all and never wanted to speak to her siblings again. I tried to reassure her and be sympathetic but I'd had a shit day too and I ended up telling her she was overreacting, and now I feel really shitty for it. But she didn't know what she wanted for my grandfather anyway, but she did agree with me that at this stage the mental health of my grandmother should be of the most importance.\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Me (29F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together for just over a year now. I love him very much and feel that our relationship is very good overall. In the time we’ve been together we’ve had about 5 arguments and been able to resolve them each time.\nI fully admit that I did not deal with the first few arguments in a healthy manner. I have some issues expressing how I feel and tend to bottle up my emotions rather than saying how I feel as I usually get very upset. My boyfriend really didn’t like this as it appeared passive aggressive to him and he’s had similar issues with his brother his whole life. \nI recognized that my behavior was unhealthy and began to attend counseling to better learn how to express myself. I now feel much better equipped to deal with things. At the time my boyfriend said he just wanted me to tell him what was wrong that he wouldn’t care what I said as long as I didn’t stonewall him.\nLast weekend we had a small argument (he went to sleep while I was very worried about something, I said it was a dick move, which I would never usually say). I used what I had learned in counseling and told him how I felt outright. Now he’s saying that he thinks we have too many arguments and that I shouldn’t have so many issues with him. \nI think it’s normal to have a few arguments. He said his parents never argue so that’s what he’s used to which I understand. My parents argue sometimes but are still in a loving relationship. I feel as though he might be holding me to a very high standard that I can’t reach.\nSo am I the asshole for thinking that it’s ok to argue sometimes? And in doing so am I giving myself an excuse for bad behavior? ",

      "description": "A month ago, I had to leave my apartment and asked my sister to let me stay at her spare room until I found myself a new place. We decided I'd pay her $100 for what I thought would be a full month to help with the house bills, $50 at the beginning and then $50 at the end of the month. At that moment, I received my full monthly payment and had the money to pay, but I figured I'd be well off to pay at the end of the month given the low rent. We had problems with the internet too so I suggested to just get a new service and offered to pay for the first month.\n\nAfter a week, I wanted to just leave her place because she was messy, never cleaned, my room was dusty and it gave me allergies, and she would always stay up partying in the house. I talked to my dad to let me stay at his place instead, since I needed a quiet place since I was going through quite a stressful period. I told my sister I was leaving, and I told her I'd still pay her the $50 I owed her and the internet bill. That was my mistake.\n\nLast week, I was finally able to find a new place, and I had to spend a bunch of money to pay for the fees, the deposit and the first month's rent. My salary is not high, so I was left with around $200 for the rest of April after paying for everything.\n\nA few minutes ago, she talked to me, and asked me if I'll be able to pay the $50 and the internet. I answered I only had enough to pay the $50, and she could tell me when the internet bill was up and I'd pay then, because I didn't have for both at the current moment. After sending the $50, I ask her when the bill is due and that I have a tight budget this month so it's hard for me to give her the money for that too. I thought she would understand and say it was okay with what I had already sent, but she instead tells me I can just give her the money next month. I was shocked at her reply. I just asked her again when she needs to pay and how much, and I'll try to see if I can squeeze it in right now because next month is just going to be the same. She said she'd tell me later.\n\nI had every intention to give her the money initially, but right now, it's just not a reality for me without either cutting from my monthly budget or taking out money from my savings. I feel like I already paid my rent and the internet with the $100 I gave her, considering I only took showers, and used my room's light at most. I didn't even eat her food or used anything else too much to make her bills go up in a month, so it feels like overpaying. I know she needs the money, but I'm in a tight position too, and I feel like she doesn't see that and is only thinking about her own needs. I'm waiting for her to tell me when the bill is due, so I can tell her I really can't pay for the internet this month or ever, but I feel guilty and I'm scared she'll get mad and snap at me.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to pay her the ~$40 she is still asking for?\n\nConverted currency to USD btw.",

Some backstory: Recently my sister developed an eating disorder. She barely eats, granted she'll eat candy if she's asked. \n\nSince my sister developed a eating disorder (we'll call it ED) my parents have been really caught up in her, and that's totally understandable, but they constantly fight over it. My dad having grown up in a very strict household about food and such, he's saying that you have to finish everything on the plate before you can leave. My dad looks furious everytime my sister just sits and picks in her food. \n\nNow comes the AITA part; AITA for not feeling loved? They are caught up in her and everything and that's understandable, but it's like I'm a ghost. We just had dinner and I barely talked because I didn't wanna dirstub them or something. Sure they ask \"How are you?\" And such, but I just feel so lonely. I've gotten really depressed (not saying that as a fact because you shouldn't self-diagnose) and I'm scared to talk to them since I know my mom's going through a rough patch too with all these things going on with my sister. I don't know what to do. I'm honestly scared to talk to them. If you guys of this lovely reddit could give me some second opinions? I can hear them fighting downstairs now. None of them have even asked if I have any tests or something coming up. Anyway, thanks for listening.",

      "description": "I've been dating this girl for 5 months and it's been going great so far. We rarely even fight or argue. The biggest problem we're having has to do with a male friend of hers. This guy is one of her closest friends and she's known him for years. Normally this wouldn't really bother me but shortly before dating me she had a brief sexual relationship with him. It only ended because she wanted more and he didn't. They didn't talk as much for a while and during this time she met me and we started dating. Now, they have fixed their friendship and she's talking to him and hanging out with him again. This makes me really uncomfortable considering the past they have. I'm not saying she can't be friends with him but it bothers me when they have one on one time. When I tell her my concerns she says that I shouldn't be worried about anything and she only sees him as a friend now. She also says the only reasons she's so eager to hang out with him is because she missed him as a friend when they weren't talking. Another thing she does is tell me that she was just lonely when they had a thing and she couldn't see herself with him anymore. Nonetheless, she agreed to limit the amount of time she spends with him, but shortly after saying this she hangs out with him again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it wrong for this to make me upset? I feel like I should trust her, but at the same time she should know better than to put me in this situation in the first place. What do you guys think?",

      "description": "Hiya. I've been in a long distance relationship for a little over a year now. He lives on the West Coast and I live on the East Coast. We both applied to grad schools, and I was lucky enough to get a few acceptances. He, unfortunately, got none. After some discussion (though we have yet to have the big Here's What We're Doing one until I hear back from two other grad schools), we decided that the general plan is for us both to move to NYC in August/September, ending long distance. \n\nRecently, that has seemed less likely. He has since heard back from one of his schools, offering an alternate degree. . Now he's thinking of moving somewhere else on the West Coast instead, prolonging long distance for another 2 years minimum, though likely far longer.\n\nSomething about it just made me wilt. I could handle the thought just a few months ago, but now I really don't think I could do it. I love him, but the thought of this going on indefinitely makes me so tired. I can kind of feel this mentality affect my feelings for him, as though I'm already drawing away. \n\nI haven't told him this for fear of manipulating his decision. I want him to do what's best for him and don't want to make him do something just for me, but honestly, if he ends up staying on the west coast I'm thinking of calling it quits, or at least going on a break. \n\nWIBTA if I told him that?

But a group of my online friends wanted to play Monopoly on the computer, I went along with it. But two of these friends are a couple and some of their trades are pretty generous from the BF to the GF. For example giving like 150% of money that someone normally would for a trade. I think this is pretty annoying in a game that is suppose to be everyone versus everyone. I don't want him to be a ruthless dick to her, but obviously giving favorable stuff is pretty annoying. If this was a game more serious than Monopoly I would for sure be on his case about it. But since this is more casual and with people that don't play board games that often would I be an asshole speaking up and asking that everyone trades the same way they would for everyone? \n\n[I'm concerned I'm just being overly grumpy since I don't really like the game and the virtual version is designed very poorly.]",

      "description": "So, some background. My husband and I have been seeing a couples therapist for about a month now- once a week. The first day we went I mentioned that I was scared of couples therapy, because there were some big things that were bothering me but I didn't know how to say or talk about- things I worried would hurt just by saying them.  Before I could go into what they were- the therapist stopped me, and explained that we'd get to the big stuff later, and that I didn't have to say it all now.  I got the impression she was trying to build a rapport and foundation with us first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I was relieved, and since then I've been completely honest in therapy as we've worked through other things- but my husband didn't think anything was wrong with the relationship (he told the therapist on that first visit that things had been better and this was just a checkup more than anything else) and is now incredibly anxious about it. I've been trying to defuse, to tell him that he wasn't in trouble and that I wasn't mad at him, but he's been pushing at me to figure out what the big thing is outside of sessions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis cumulated in this morning. We have different sleep schedules, and he gets up before me, but when he got up he looked shaken and was obviously upset.  I asked him what was wrong (still half asleep because I don't brain well before coffee and this was about an hour before I would normally get up) and he told me he had figured out what the big bombshell was. It spawned a conversation where I told him that even if he was right, I didn't feel comfortable talking about it one-on-one- it was something I wanted to discuss with a therapist to guide us through it, and it was something he had agreed to wait on in therapy. He argued that he had suddenly discovered something big and it was eating him up inside and he couldn't just ignore it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm torn, am I the asshole for wanting to wait to discuss this in front of the therapist?    \n\n\nOther information: he had asked to go see the therapist, about six months ago, and only recently found someone and arranged for it. I'm paying for the visits, so I don't think it's a financial need that's driving the wanting to get it out sooner. ",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nI am a undergraduate planning to attend uni in the spring. I took a gap semester to find a job and make some money to help with post secondary. The thing is, I never found a job, even after 20+ applications. I have no work experience so that doesn't really help. My job searching became more and more exhausting. So, to pass time I played video games on my laptop, I didn't really have anything better to do.\n\nMy dad hates video games. He thinks they destroy your mind and make you unable to think and dumb you down. Although I agree with some of it, I personally enjoy gaming. It just takes away the boredom in my day. All my friends are in uni, attending classes and what-not, so I am just staying home and playing games. It sounds pathetic but I want to enjoy it until school starts.\n\nSo whenever I want to play games on my laptop, I have to hide it from my dad. Whether he's comes home from work or takes a nap, I usually hide the fact that I play 3-4 hours of video games a day. In addition to video games I have gotten involved with the twitch community and continually play with new online friends. I plan to restrict the gaming to the weekends and free time when school starts. I also intend to SLOWLY leave the gaming phase while looking for a part-time job. Because \"games are for little kids\" as my dad says.\n\nHere's where the AITA question lies: My father has begun to notice my gaming habits and has started to berate me for it. He has started saying that he had a feeling \"\\[I\\] wouldn't try hard in school\". He has told my whole family and some family friends this too. It makes me super embarrassed and angry because I have an excitement for school because I miss working my brain. On top of this, I recently purchased a gaming laptop for STUDYING and gaming. I tried to explain that this suits my needs as it is fast and can help me out for heavy duty stuff (video editing etc). I somewhat regret buying the laptop as it was expensive but I planned for it to last long. My dad made me return it and buy a cheaper laptop. My dad now has told me I will never play games again. That is impossible for me because I haven't left my love for games phase yet. He also said if he ever catches me playing games he will break my new laptop. I won't stop playing games, I'll just continue to hide and play until school begins.\n\n I know I probably have a gaming addiction but I don't intend for it to mess with my studies. I worked hard in highschool while playing games on the weekends and during free time. I ended up with mostly high A's. I played a wager match on my game and I ended up winning $5. That kind of boosted my morale and confidence in my skill at the the game. While it did make me a bit egotistic, it sprouted an idea in the back of my head of playing games for a living. I know it is super tough but that's my back up plan if my future career plan doesn't work out. Never telling my dad this though. I don't think my father will ever understand games.\n\ntl:dr I play games on a daily basis and my dad hates it. I am now banned from ever playing games again. I am going to keep playing games until my school starts in the spring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So bear with me, because this is kind of confusing. I was on my way to work this morning during rush hour. I was pulling off an interstate and turned right onto a 4 lane highway. The lane I was turning into is a “Keep Moving” lane meaning you are not supposed to yield while turning right. So I make my turn &amp; get about 50 feet down the road when a women sitting in the passenger seat of a red mustang starts to scream at me as the driver of that mustang aggressively begins to run me off the road. He got maybe a foot away from me before he swerved away from me. He did that 2 or 3 times. The woman was screaming “This is a fucking funeral procession. Get the fuck over!” \n\nI’m not sure how common funeral processions like this are outside of the southern United States, but I’ve grown up seeing them &amp; was taught by example from my parents to pull over when they pass. They’re usually escorted by 3 cops, one in the front leading the hearse, one somewhere in the middle and one in the back. This happens during a funeral after the service on the way to the burial site. \n\nI was stunned. I looked ahead of her and saw a line of maybe 10-12 lifted trucks ahead of them all with their caution lights flashing. All of these cars were spread apart enough to ensure no one could pass them. They were also going maybe 15 mph. There was no police escort and I saw no hearse. The only thing I eventually saw was a private van with a single red/blue light flashing on the roof. It had no writing on it to insinuate that it was the police. \n\nThe highway eventually changes from a 4 lane road to 2 lanes on both sides. So this procession rides in the middle for 5 or 6 miles going 15 mph. I ended up being 20 minutes late to work &amp; I’m pissed. I understand pulling over for funeral processions most of the time, especially when they have a police escort &amp; going a reasonable speed but this was ridiculous. It took a lot for me not to call the police for that mustang’s reckless driving, but I’m sure they are grieving/not thinking clearly and who wants to pull over someone on the way to a funeral? \n\nAITA for not wanting to pull over for a funeral procession?",

      "description": "First reddit post so lil nervous, and fully prepared to be ridiculed for this story.\n\nBackground: me and this dude dated years ago. Stuff happened, we broke up on horrible terms. Fast forward a year and a half, I get out of an emotionally abusive relationship, and me and person (we'll call him Sean) have started talking again. One night on Skype, Sean tells me he still loves me, and doesnt know what to do, because he doesnt want to date again. I say okay, we become a weird.. friends with benefits. Sean is long distance, he lives roughly 1000+ miles away, and a few weeks pass and Sean enters a new relationship.\n\nThis is where my regret comes in. Due to being a huge dumbass, I agree to continue the FWB without Seans girlfriend knowing, becoming \"The Other Woman\". I honestly hate it, and I end up ending it pretty quickly, again on bad terms. Anytime he sees I am sad though, whether through social media or friends, he'll come into my DMs and tell me that he loves me, he misses me, he'll drive me out to his state, we can do \"things\" together ect ect. I end up falling back for it, continuing being the other woman when I'm sad, and ending it again when I come to my senses and hate myself for falling back into it again.\n\nI recently got into my first stable relationship since Sean, with an amazing girl, we'll name her Jane. I went full disclosure with Jane, telling her everything Sean and I did, telling her my reasonings and she says I should tell his girlfriend, as they're still together and has no idea, while Sean is trying to add other women into his relationship.\n\nMe and Sean havent communicated in roughly 6 months, and I havent been The Other Woman in almost a year. WIBTA if I sent his girlfriend everything? I already know IATA for helping him cheat in the first place, but knowing she doesnt know hurts me, because I know I would want to know, but I also am scared of being the person to break that happiness.",

I knew this girl from high school. We had a class together. \nThe second was for a girl faking her pregnancy who managed to fake the full term. She took all of the attention away from my infant son at the time. \n\nAnd for the third-\nThis girl seems nice. They have been dating for... Maybe it’s been a year? \n\n\nI also don’t feel like going because I was pregnant- a week ahead of them and had a missed miscarriage and surgery. We were both due in April. I’m now pregnant again. \n\nI felt kinda of bad about not going but we can get them a gift after. We just found out we were flying out for my MIL major surgery and my young sister brain surgery. We are mainly there to support them \n\n\nAITA for not wanting to go. \n\n",

The recycling bin is really far away and they get really angry at me for throwing a plastic containers in the thrash instead of cleaning it and then throwing it in the recycle bin. I recycle everything else except that since they are so witty when I don't do it and even when I do it properly, (takes like 5 minutes) they say witty remarks by mocking me saying that finally I am able to do it. Last week I was in the bathroom stall and heard them thrash-talking about me for not doing it properly the first time saying things like i'm just a dumb kid and that they would love that I would get fired.

      "description": "Some background, I've been interested in EMS for awhile and have been devoting a good amount of time to studying things I think will be important for the course. I've fallen behind on schoolwork and try to stay on top of it, I just view the EMS stuff as being more important as it actually benefits me in the long run. For the past month or so, my mom has made it very clear she wants school to come first, which I can understand I guess. However as of late this has seriously caused a mark in our relationship. \n\nWe can't hold a conversation at all without her weaving school into it. Like today for example, I told her I was going to my dad's house to grab some stuff, \"Oh are you going down there to do schoolwork on his computer?\" I've had a computer for months now, she knows this and I know she only asked that to keep school fresh in my mind, which it almost always is unless I'm with my dad. I do equal amount schoolwork per day at each of my parents' house, I don't want you to think my dad doesn't care about my academic requirements. \n\nLast night I was shadowing a EMS call when I got a text saying if I didn't do more schoolwork, she would pull me from the class. I'll admit, this infuriated me, maybe I need perspective here. Probably. I was angry that she would jeopardize my future because I'm behind in schoolwork. Anyways I understand her concern, but every single interaction we have involves school, if it's an interaction that shouldn't, it will somehow.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told her to get off my back and that I am trying to balance things? I don't like yelling or confrontation at all but I'm not sure how else to approach this situation.",

      "description": "Me and two other women founded a club three years ago where we meet once a month to play games. (Board, card, dice ect) We have a private group on Facebook where we plan gatherings and once you've been invited to play, you can invite others as well. We have less than a dozen regular members. \n\nTwo of our members broke up. They are very on again, off again but the husband said it was final this time. He had rsvp to attend the next two gatherings and the wife said she wasn't going. We were relieved because we felt it would be awkward. \n\nShe messaged later and asked to come to our Dec gathering and asked if she could bring a boyfriend. We said no, maybe you shouldn't come to Dec gathering and just give it until the new year because your ex husband rsvp first. We we very diplomatic about it and chose our words carefully\n\n(They both stated they didn't care if the other one was there, but we all felt very awkward. Gatherings are pretty intimate and the wife is pretty sensitive. She gets passive aggressive.)\n\nThe wife was very angry, she told us never to contact her again, have a nice life, and deleted all of us off Facebook. We were glad to cut ties because we never liked her and the husband did say he was not getting back together with her. \n\nWell now the husband wants to get back together. He asked us to invite her to the group again. We deliberated for a long time. Finally we said no. We couldn't. Things did not end well between us and inviting her back wouldn't be genuine. He removed himself from the group and said they were a package deal. He didn't seem angry about it, just really focused on getting his wife back. \n\nAre we assholes for not letting the wife join our group again? I feel bad because we are always saying how all are welcome ect. Now an exception has been made and this one person is no longer welcome. We have three years of reasons to explain how we came to that decision, and it feels like it would have been a lose/lose scenario no matter what. Should we have let her back in though?",

      "description": "For context, my bf of 5 years has had a past of cybercheating. I've forgave him, but he's been on nwn2 (again after i asked him to delete it in year 3 of our relationship) with a lot of weird sex chatting posing as a girl every time. He used to act like a girl with cybercheating in the past too, and while I've already had a problem with the sex chat online thing to begin with, our relationship has just been on the rocks because of it. When I've asked him to stop doing it early in the relationship and he's stopped, he'll go right behind my back and do it again. Anytime I've brought it up for him to stop he's threatened to break up with me and has in the past, so in order to \"reconcile\"the relationship, I've felt that I needed to tell I'm ok with it as long as he isn't sending my nudes and receiving nudes again with other people (a lie, stupid I know). I was honest with him today and asked him to stop sex chatting on the game because it's gotten to the point of personal chatting about his life with people on discord and the game and sent red flags (same people he would sex chat with). He said he's pissed and annoyed I would ask that of him when I said it was ok, but I was honest and told him I only said it because I felt that I had to be ok with it for me to be with him. I was honest and explained that I'm still not comfortable just like in the beginning of our relationship. It creeps me out. He does it about every day. AITA for asking him to stop again? If he breaks up with me over this I have no where to go, but I guess I'd rather have no bf than one that values sex chatting with other people online over his gf when we already struggle to have a normal sex life. I just cant be ok with him jacking off and sex chatting. I know it was my bad for lying about it being ok, but honestly I didn't feel like I had a choice because he did it anyway when I told him I wasn't comfortable at all with it. I'm sorry if there's grammatical and spelling errors. I'm on mobile. ",

      "description": "My husband and I noticed a cat with no collar would occasionally be laying in our front porch rocker when we got home from work every other day or so, very friendly little guy.\n\nEven a little chip in his left ear like a cartoon. He looked a little on the thin side so I started putting out food and water for him which he graciously ate. \n\nAfter that he started coming around every day and would wait for us for hours by our door. I felt so bad thinking about him in the cold and wind so my husband and I decided we'd start letting him come in.\n\nHe made himself right at home, but would always want to leave in the morning. Hed be gone for the day, but be back waiting for us when we got off work, and the  cycle continues. \n\nWe've really grown to love this cat, he is a big cuddler and just wants to be in your lap 24/7. We named him Seymour.  \n\nUnfortunately the other day when we came home Seymour had a collar on and a note was attached that said \n\n\"Stop feeding my cat, he already has a home.\"\n\nMy heart ached to think that we were taking a pet away from another family this entire time, and wanted to apologise but I don't do well with confrontation (very shy). \n\nBut Seymour still comes to our house everyday, and I feel bad just closing the door on him now.. I don't want to mean any disrespect by continuing to feed him against the owners wishes but I struggle to say no when he comes around.\n\nI know it's selfish to ask to share and love the kitty both, and I know I just need to let him go.. Just wish I didn't have to. ",

      "description": "Last summer, after braking up with my ex,  I found a little house to rent. Adding utilities and other things it was barely in my budget, but I was able to afford it by cutting down on some other expenses.\n\n\nMy roommate, who I've been friends with for a few years now, was at that time living with her parents. Her relationship with them was pretty bad, so I knew that she would be interested in moving out. She's also still in college and has a pretty big student loan, and not making a lot with her part time job. So when I offered her the option to move in with me, I offered to split the rent one third for her and two thirds plus utilities for me.\n\n\nThe house has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room on the ground floor, and a third bedroom (the size of the other two combined), a small bathroom and a laundry room/storage room in the basement. I was already living in the master bedroom upstairs, so, when she moved in, she chose the basement bedroom. \n\n\nEverything was pretty good for white. Once we started getting some really cold weather I realized two things. Firstly, the basement area was not heating very well. I tried turning the heat up some, but it didn't help much, so she had to get a space heater. Secondly, I've underestimated how big some of the bills would be in the winter, especially with needing to have the heat turned up high.\n\n\nShe is sometimes gone all day and sometimes a few days at the time spending time at her boyfriend's place, and I've noticed that she never turns her space heater off! So I've started turning it off myself, and I've been doing it for almost a month now. She hasn't said anything yet, but I'm starting to second guess myself...so am I being an asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for breaking a friendship after a kid joked about sleeping with my sister?",
      "description": "In the summer break in HS (16 M), I traveled across the country with my friends for a summer camp.\n\nAbout a 2 weeks after arriving, I stayed there for about 5 weeks, I received a text from my friend (14 M). We had a normal friendly conversation, asking how it was here and that he wanted to hang out after I got back, blah, blah. He was also friends with my sister( 14 ). I'm pretty sure they liked each other at the time, but never did anything beyond talking and hanging out. After texting, I went back to doing my own stuff. A couple minutes later, he sends me a long paragraph saying that he came over to our house and \"took my sister's virginity\" . He said it happened so fast and that he loves her a lot. And said how their relationship became super close after I left. I forget what else he said but that was the main point. The text at that time sounded sincere, not like a prank or anything, he genuinely sounded serious. He put the effort in writing a long ass paragraph and said how much he loved my sister. He even apologized at the end for surprising me during my vacation.\n\nNow, I'm gullible at all, I question everything I see, but at this point, I'm flustered and kind of panicking. So I texted my sister, \"did \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ come over to our house recently?\".  She responded, \"what\". Than I text her \"Did \\_\\_\\_\\_ come over to our house\" again. She doesn't even respond and tries to avoid it. At this point, I'm actually mad and start yelling at my sister through text, using curse words, which I don't use often. I get a text from my friend saying \" YOOO DID YOU SEE THE CAMERA ITS A PRANK BROO.\" I fucking lose it and just stop texting. He then texts me again saying how hes sorry for the prank and that my sister was in on it. I reply \"ok\" and just go to sleep. The couple days after that, he texts me again, he probably knows I'm mad so he tries to cheer me up and tells me funny stories and shit, but I don't engage in the convo and he gets a little pissed and says \"are you still mad bro its just a joke\".\n\nFast forward, I come back home. He acts like it never happened and we never bring it up again. Our friendship is not that good as it once was. I don't ignore him completely, but I don't joke around or hang out with him, you know what friends do. I'm not mad or anything. I haven't even told anyone about the joke. I got over the \"prank\" along time ago, but I can't see him as friend, but just a immature child. I feel bad because he doesn't have much friends and tries to talk to me and stuff, but I can't force myself to be his friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: a once close friend texts me about him sleeping with my sister. I get pissed but get over it soon. I start seeing his flaws and differences and stop being good friends with him. I don't hate him, but I don't see him as a friend.",

      "description": "So basically, I found this old Saints jersey in my closet last week, that I had forgotten about. It originally belonged to my ex’s dad. \n\nHe took me and her to a Saints game one time and he gave me that jersey to wear, and at the end of the night he said “you can keep that one, I’ve got a newer one at home”. (It’s still in pretty good condition, Reggie Bush)\n\nThe things is; I have absolutely no interest in football, and no interest in the Saints. The jersey is basically worthless to me. And I think to some degree, he was aware of that at the time, but he was just making a nice gesture.\n\nAnyway my relationship with his daughter was kind of rocky, and we broke up within a few months of this. He ended up strongly disliking me (because of a misunderstanding) and now we are not on good terms by any means.\n\nSo now I’m not sure. My mom says that I should have at least offered to return the jersey, but I’m not sure if I agree with that.",

      "description": "About a couple months ago my niece, who is 5 years old, told her father (my brother) that my nephew (sisters kid) who is 12 years old, touched her. At first it started with my brother and my sister talking about what my nephew did. My brother asked my nephew if he did touch my niece but my nephew denies ever doing it. My brother took my niece to a school counselor who ended up calling child services. Child services came to talk to my niece about what happened and she told them. Child services then made a call to the police and police officers came to talk to my nephew about what he did or didn’t do. I told my brother that getting the cops involved was taking it too far because my nephew is only 12 years old and he couldn’t have understood what he was doing. In my opinion, my brother could have just talked to my nephew and explained to him what he did was wrong before things got out of hand. My brother told me that it’s his daughter and he’s going to do whatever needs to be done to make sure she’s okay. That’s the only time I ever said anything about this situation. My sister still believes that my nephew didn’t do anything because he keeps denying it to this day. My nephew has been seeing a therapist, just thought I needed to throw that in here. My mom wants me to say something to my brother so he can talk to my nephew so that my nephew knows my brother doesn’t hate him. I told my mom that my brother is not going to listen to me and there’s no point in me getting involved. My brother tried talking to me about how he doesn’t want my nephew around my niece ever and I told him that I can’t get involved because I love my niece and I love my nephew. Whatever is going on with my brother, my sister and my mom to keep me out of it. I don’t want to say the wrong thing and don’t want anyone to think I’m choosing sides. Oh I should add that we all live together. My parents, my two nephews, and myself in the front house and my brother, his baby mama, and my niece in the back house. My sister comes to visit her kids every now and then during the week but that’s whole other thing. Anyway, yesterday I had to get involved in an argument my brother and sister were having because my nephew went to grab his soccer ball from the backyard and my niece was back there playing. My brother yells at my nephew that he doesn’t want him back there with my niece and sends him to the front yard. My sister tells my brother not to yell at her kid and my brother, angrily, yells back and calls my nephew a rapist. I have to go outside to tell them to just get away from each other before the neighbors call the cops (again) (also, that’s a whole other thing). They both walk away from each other and I go inside. My mom comes up to me after and asks me to say something to my brother and my sister because now that Thanksgiving is coming up, she just wants the whole family together without any problems. Again I tell her that there’s nothing I can say to my brother or my sister to ease any tension. My brother doesn’t want to be there with the family for thanksgiving and my mom is really sad about that. I just want to stay out of it.",

      "description": "I was raised in an abusive home with a stepfather. He told everyone I was his biological child but I'm not. His whole family knows this.\n\nI decided to go \"no contact\" with my abuser at 16. I kept in contact with his family as I saw them as my own and didn't blame them for not knowing. \n\nI moved back to my hometown where the family was. My older child went to my \"grandmother\" sometimes and all seemed good. Then I got married and got pregnant with my second. Immediately my grandmother is lecturing me about how I cant have this baby and I was irresponsible to get pregnant again (I've been in my own house and financially independent for 6 years since I was 16) We were hurt, as it was a planned pregnancy and were shocked by the disappointment at our news.\n\nI had a c-section with my older child, which was no concern to any of the doctors in my second pregnancy. I was given the okay to have a natural birth and it was a normal pregnancy. \n\nThat's when my grandmother decided that my previous csection was because I was incapable of giving birth and was too small framed. I insisted that I was going to give birth natural. When she knew she couldn't convince me to do it her preferred way, she stopped sleeping and eating, told everyone that she was haunted by nightmares about my death. Because of this behavior, she got very sickly, and any excitement about my pregnancy in my family was gone. Everytime it was brought up, it was a horrible thing and I was going to die. I felt fine. \n\nFast forward to the birth, my husband and I wanted no one else in the room. So my grandmother decided to wait in the waiting room, much to my dismay. We let my mother in law peek in and say hello while I was in labor, which made my grandmother cry (even though I saw her while I was arriving) and I went out and tried to console her and apologize. While contracting. \n\nThe day we brought my younger child home from the hospital, my grandmother stopped by. I let her hold the baby and she begins screaming about how we lied about the condition of our vehicle. My husband asked her to hand him the baby and leave. She physically refused to let him or I take the baby. We eventually got the baby back and she left.\n\nA month later, I found out that they were contacting my mother, my mother in law, etc behind my back to try to make plans to see my children. They (grandmother and her husband) never replied or asked to make plans with me regarding my children. They didnt even try to ask to see the kids. My grandmother's husband blocked me. I tried to tell her that we needed to deal with the events before I would be comfortable with her taking them.\n\nShe told me that she was getting a lawyer for visitation. (Even though shes not any biological family) i havent contacted her since. The entire family hasn't talked to me since. I thought I was in the right but none of them do. \n\nSo am I actually the asshole?",

And as much as I love my mum, she's not well. She hoards and does really manic things. It used to be barrable because I used to go boarding school so I wouldn't have to spend to much time at home, but since ending my time at that school I've had to live at home full time and it's negatively impacted my mental health for the the past 1-2 years. \n\nHer hoarding got really bad when her dad (my granddad) died. And I really tried to be understanding but for years she's been filling our home with garbage, she's been hoarding pretty much since I was a child. She did it because we were very poor when I was a baby and she's would hold on to anything we had because she knew she probably wouldn't be able to afford new things so she would make do with old stuff. And for years she's used this excuse/reasoning to deflect any kind of criticism or concern I've ever tried to voice. \n\nShe's created this horrible toxic environment where I've been too afraid to say how I feel or how unhappy I am because she makes it out to always be some kind of personal attack on her and that I'm just mean. \n\nI started to develop depression around four years ago but since coming it's spiralled out of control. I have literally never been so unhappy ever in my life, I cry myself to sleep 3 times a week and some times I can go week at a time without feeling anything at all. But she always makes it out as my sadness is me criticising her. Whenever she catches me crying she always make out that I'm being uncompromising for not cutting her slack or something. But the worst thing her hoarding has done to my health is make me develop all these ticks about hygiene (I don't want to say OCD because I haven't gone to a doctor about it so I'm not officially diagnosed but when my psychology teacher taugted us about it at school it seemed to lined up with what I was experiencing) .\n\nAs you can imagine, been a hoarder leads to a lack of hygiene. She only washes maybe 4 out of the 7 days a week. She leaves large items of laundry in the bathtub to \"soak\" sometimes for weeks on end until they start to smell mouldy and refuses to deal with it and gets annoyed when I try to let the water out, pretty much demanding I have to shower with the mouldy laundry. She won't wash clothes in laundry detergent because she claims it breaks the machine and doesn't actually work (instead she uses vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, which she claims is superior but it leaves the clothes crunchy and smelling of pickled onions). The kitchen is an absolute state but should I leave on wrapper on the counter top IM the problem, and I'm not allowed to criticize her if I'm going to stuff like that (as if these too thing are on par) . But to cut to the chase all of this has leave to me to obsessively sanitise my hand, not touch certain things in the house, not want to be touched my her (she's not very good at washing her hands). It got to the point where my hands were so raw from washing them they would bleed if I tried to move them too much. But the worst part is she makes me feel awful about it. If she even sees me washing my hands \"for no reason\" she tuts and ATS like I'm insulting her and constantly calls me prissy and often uses the term OCD against me like it's an insult like idiot or something. \n\nAnyways I finally snapped on Monday when I found out she'd let a drug addict (crack I think) do drugs in our bathroom. The addict used to know my mum when they were in school (before she was an addict). She claims this woman is her friend but this woman, let's say \"Naomi\"  doesn't give a shit about her. She knocks at the door at all and any time of the day and my mother is foolidh enough to let her in, feed her and even give her money. Naomi even stole her credit card (but brought it back) and my mum's reaction was along the lines of \"lol your so funny hehehe\". \n\nSo as soon as I found out any my mum letting her do crack in our bathroom I went upstairs and wrote a letter saying that it was the final straw and I was going to leave at the end of the month. I explained how I felt and said she was the reason I had developed \"OCD\". \n\nShe now won't talk to me at all, she has my nan on her side so no I literally have no living relatives left who talk to me. She's constantly doing petty things to me like turning of the heating when she knows I'm in the shower and on my period, despite the fact that I said in the letter I was going to try my hardest not to be an inconvenience before I move out. \n\nShe makes me feel like a class A bitch for finally going after the one thing that will make me happy. Was I wrong?  Should I have been more patient with her? Should I not blame her for my lack of mental health and was it perhaps mean to tell her that?",

      "description": "Throaway cause, why not? My wife and I have been married for a couple years. It's just us so theres no kids or anything like that involved in our day to day life. We dated for a couple years before we got married and I think were pretty ok overall. \n\nHowever, my wife likes to make unhealthy decisions.\nNow, I'm not the healthiest of guys. I'm not a glistening, washboard abs, ripped as heck guy, but I like to think I healthy. I can run a 5k pretty easily, I can do any hike in our area, I go the gym, I drink atleast 2 liters of water a day M-F etc etc.\nAnd although I'm not as in shape as I'd like to, I try to be. Try, keyword.\n\nMy wife however, doesnt really seem like it. She seems unhappy with her health overall. I love my wife. And I care about. And in the past I've gently nudged her into the idea of being healthier.  Joining a gym, drinking more water(which she does do now according to her), doing yoga, eating less processed food etc. However her behaviors overall seem to stay the same. She complains of aches and pains, she has trouble sleeping sometimes, she complains of her weight and not being confident sometimes.\n\nLike I said, I've tried gently nudging her, but now sometimes it slips out into critiques. I now tell her, you shouldn't do/eat/try/drink that, you should X this. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my patience and sympathy.\nSometimes it leads to arguments.  \n\nI love my wife, I really do. I push the importance of being healthy or trying in our 20s ,so itll pay dividends when were older but she doesnt seem to care. I dont need her to be a super model or an athlete.  I just want her happy and healthy.  I think the two are important and theres a balance you need to have. I try to be healthier myself but it doesnt seem like she does. I dont wanna see my wife suffering from illness related to this in our future.\n\nSo,AITA for critiquing my wife and maybe coming  off as critical now over her health choices? Should I mind my own bussiness? ",

      "description": "I pulled into the Walmart parking lot yesterday with my eight year old daughter, and parked next to a pickup truck that was absolutely coated in mud. It was filthy. Looked like it had rolled in a pigpen. My daughter and I were in a happy mood doing a little light Christmas shopping alone together. When we got out of our car I said to her ‘watch this’. I wet my finger and proceeded to write WASH ME on the passenger side door. Daughter giggled, and we went shopping.\n\nCame back out 30 minutes later and there was a note on my windshield that read as follows:\n\n“Thanks a lot for scratching the paint on my truck writing your message. Think about that next time you touch someone else’s truck. Merry Christmas!”\n\n I rolled my eyes reading that. The truck in question was hardly pristine, even under the mud. And there was A LOT of mud. This little prank is older than, well, dirt. Yeah, I wrote it on the truck but I highly doubt I did any damage to the paint job (that he/she so obviously cared about judging by the filthy state of said truck).\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "To elaborate I am female living with a male friend of mine and a couple of months ago a friend of mine (also a female) had to move out of her place rather quickly and since we had a couple extra bedrooms we invited her to move in with us. I have known them both for years but I introduced them a few months ago and we all hit it off pretty well and I was excited to live with two of my friends and thought it would be a lot of fun. It was fun at first but they started flirting a lot and for the past few weeks I have really felt like a third wheel. They cuddle on the couch a lot while watching tv and they are constantly talking to just each other and sharing inside jokes and it’s really annoying me. Since I get home from work first I often cook dinner for the three of us and lately I figured out that they have intentionally been taking naps in the living room after dinner so they can sleep until I go to bed and then wake up and have fun and have secret sex after I go to bed. They are also using the spare bedroom for some reason as their special sex room so we can’t even use it as a spare bedroom anymore, like I had a friend over last weekend that had been drinking and wanted to spend the night but the spare bedroom sheets were dirty and there are dirty clothes all over and my male roommate had passed out on the couch and there was nowhere for her to stay. Anyway both roommates are still casually dating other people and they don’t think sleeping together will be a problem but I’m sick of feeling like a third wheel and I know someone is going to eventually get feelings and like the other person and I think it’s going to blow up in their faces. I know we will be moving out of this house in the summer and I’m supposed to be living with my female friend again in a new place but I’m starting to rethink that whole situation for a bunch of reasons (I just think she is inconsiderate and isn’t very good at cleaning up after herself). I know this is long winded and thanks for sticking with me but I just got one of them to admit that they are sleeping together tonight and it’s got me all worked up. I think it’s really rude to lie about it and sneak around and I’m pissed because I don’t want this to blow up and force me to chose sides or friends. So am I the asshole for being pissed that my roommates are having sex? ",

      "description": "So the title doesn’t really explain the full story, so I guess that’s why the body of text exists. So for some background: me and my friend (let’s call her G) are SUPER close. We have a lot of inside jokes and we’re always joking around and she’s really opened up my social world, I used to be a really shy person who talked to no one, but then she came around and changed it all. However... as of lately it seems that all she does is put herself down. She’s constantly calling herself fat, almost everyday. She goes on Instagram and vents about how fat she is. She’s always saying she’s annoying, ugly, gross, stupid, disgusting, etc. It’s almost everyday. Anytime I see her she’s going on and on about so many different things that’s wrong about her that no one even notices! Now I totally understand mental illness that makes stuff others don’t see and turn them into a huge problem for you, so I’m not angry at her, but I find myself being annoyed with it. I’m tired of constantly hearing her put herself down. It’s spread to me and my mindset is following her footsteps. I keep putting myself down and I’ve even developed an eating disorder because she’s always talking about starving herself or how fat she is because she ate one thing. Maybe I’m being insensitive and I need to put a better shield on, or I’m insecure but it’s really getting to me. \n\nI don’t want to feel this way at all. I feel like I can’t joke around with her the same anymore. I don’t want to hang out with her as much either, because she keeps doing this. I feel extremely bad. Not only that, but she’ll break rules like go on her phone in class when she’s not supposed to, gets yelled at, then goes on Instagram and calls her teachers really harsh names. She called a teacher obese and told her to die just because she broke a rule and got spoken to. I find it really annoying to see that, because in ways she brought it on herself. \n\nI totally understand self esteem issues and I’m totally willing to help, and I’ve tried, too. But in the past she’s said it makes her angrier when someone tells her she’s not ugly or fat. And she’s gotten mad at me for telling her she’s none of those things. \nI want to help her so bad, but a side of me is extremely frustrated and uncomfortable. \n\nI don’t want to feel this way anymore, I want to joke around with her and be close again, but I can’t handle her constantly putting herself down. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? If I am, can someone please help me figure out what I can do about this? I don’t want to start drama, I want to remain peaceful about it, but I need help. My first step is understanding if I’m the asshole for being upset with her. Second step is figuring out what to do about it next. I feel incredibly bad, but I’m not sure what to do...",

      "description": " \n\nAm I the asshole? I just found this subreddit and it's perfect for this event that just happened last night and I'm still processing it. Some background first; so, this story is about me and a guy (let's call him Perseus) who I've known for about two years. I met him through a mutual friend (no longer friends with that first friends), but became friends with Perseus and his room-mates. At the time I didn't have much of a social life (working weird hours, drifted apart from people) and these guys were really welcoming. I had no luck with dating lately and they were really enthusiastic about helping me with that. The guy called his group of friends a 'tribe' and hosted parties at their house, and then one night he invited me out to him meeting some friends at a library to attend a 'class' and Perseus told me on FB he wanted me to come. So I went and it was Perseus sitting at a table with some friends and reading some self-help book. I personally am not to into the self-help scene (I know this is a very diverse scene) but generally it was never my thing. I like seeking advice and stuff, and I'm all about improving myself in different ways, sure, but reading hundreds of pages -- no. I'd rather read something else, something on politics or some fiction.\n\n​\n\nSo, I politely listened to him and tried to get into it a bit, was considering reading the book, but really just wasn't interested. After we went out for beer and had a good time. So, I ended up going to the classes sometimes but it was mostly to have a social life. I did kind of enjoy the academic environment a bit, but overall wasn't really impressed with the self-help book. To me it mostly sounded like generic advice I can get anywhere. Again, not my thing. So, I go to some of their parties, have a great time. One of them is good at giving me constructive criticism, which I honestly appreciated, and I was getting some bonding with Perseus and some other of the group. At one point when we were in a car one of the guys told me I should really come to the classes because they \"level up\" at each class. I tell him I am busy with work.\n\n​\n\nAnyway, months go by, more parties, generally having a good time. I generally like the group, but a few things rub me the wrong way. Hard to explain (turns out one of them actually did have severe mental illness, but he left the house at a point), it was more the obsession that Perseus in particular had with self-help stuff; he had loads of books on it. The whole 'teaching a class' thing kind of weirded me out, and Perseus, who did have a University degree, instead of becoming an academic at an actual university would tell me plans of opening an online university himself to teach 'critical thinking', 'logic', and 'self-improvement'. One day I was visiting his house (the house was chill to hang out in because it was casual) and I was sitting in the living room and I heard him talking to someone on the phone saying something along the lines of \"oh, so-and-so is calling me a cult leader! Sure I'm a cult leader, but I'm an ethical cult leader, I would never get someone to drink poison!\"\n\n​\n\nRed flags? Or am I over-reacting?\n\n​\n\nTime goes on. I just brush off me hearing him say that; just figure he might've been semi-joking, or maybe he doesn't quite understand what cult means. Anyway, some more parties happen, generally cool. I help them move. He does things (Perseus) that kind of rub me the wrong way sometimes; like one time we were at a coffee shop and a good looking woman passes and he says to us other guys: \"Wow, look at her tits.\" And I'm like \"Okay\" and thing is, I'm not a prude or anything, I talk to friends about sex sometimes (when I have it) in some capacity; I just think that kind of talk is kinda trashy. I don't say anything because I have the feelings these guys (who are kind of bro- dude-like) will just tell me I'm overly PC or sensitive or something. If I see a nice looking woman pass by I might say \"wow, she's pretty\" to my buddy or something, sure, like, people do that. But really, he's just being vulgar and vulgarity is just one of my personal pet peeves, but I'm not going to ask him to change something like that for me right?\n\n​\n\nSo, during this whole time, almost every time, he is pushing me to read The Mystery Method and other Pick Up Artist material (we're getting to the drama now). I talk to him, he gives me advice, some of his advice generally isn't bad advice. I go through life and with all the people I befriend I take whatever advice I can get to help in general. In the summer I read maybe 20% of The Mystery Method and I think it's mostly stupid. It's pretty much telling me to go into bars and go bug every woman - like, no. I don't want to do that. That's just creepy. So, I stop reading it. Later on, he continually pokes me to start reading these books again. One time, at a coffee shop he says pretty loud \"Dude, don't you want your dick in a mouth?\" This rubs me the wrong way, but I whatever it again. Okay, you all with me still? So here's the drama.\n\n​\n\nOh, did I mention Perseus, almost every time I see him, is going on in front of the other tribe about his latest experience where he got a woman's attention in front of her boyfriend (the alpha) or one time when he danced with a woman (but didn't have sex with her because he timed the order in which he did things wrong). This really weirded me out.\n\nWe start having hang-outs where we'd chill, play some games, maybe cards, have a few beers, smoke something. I like these. So I go to one and its just a few of us. Half the people there (tribe) are in the kitchen cooking and it's just me, Perseus, and another guy who is new (young impressionable guy who likes Jordan Peterson). So, at one point I tell Perseus what's going on in my dating life. Although at the time I wasn't dating anyone, I had two prospects (one was long-distance and we were meaning to meet up but she flakes, and another woman I just started talking online, but we haven't met yet and only started but things were looking good generally). So I told him about this great new woman I was talking to. So Perseus starts going on about how I never 'seal the deal' (there's truth to that, sure). So I was hoping I could tell him more about this woman. Instead he reaches to his bookshelf and puts a PUA book in front of me, the one I started reading and quit. He tells me, for the dozenth time that this is the key. So here it starts;\n\n​\n\nI don't recall exactly everything that led to it getting more heated but I remember telling him I wasn't into the whole PUA self-help scene. He then reminded me that I was having no luck lately with women. I told him this is true, but told him things were generally getting better and that I was working on it. He then reminded me that I am not having luck and that this will help me. I bring up something along the lines of a lot of the self-help stuff being based around evolutionary psychology - which, while a legit field, is something I personally don't really trust. I feel that, and many critics do, much of evolutionary psychology is based on speculation. Or there are books written, I've found, that will support an agenda and use evolutionary psychology but will cherry pick facts to suit their agenda. He gets defensive about that not being true. Both of are voices are raised a bit by this point, but I feel he is being aggressive with me now. He asks me quickly: \"Do you believe in evolution? (yes) Do you believe in psychology? (Yes) Then how can you say that evolutionary psychology isn't a legit field. He then brings up that many people in some fields don't like people in other fields; which is true sure. So, this goes back and forth.\n\n​\n\nI tell him I feel he's pushing his beliefs on me. He asks me what 'pushing' means, asking me to define what I mean by 'pushing'. I tell him I'm not into self-help scene; what's wrong with helping oneself? Everyone wants to help themself! He also tells me I am pushing my views on him and the others by not listening to what he has to say. He tells me I am being irritating because I was asking for dating advice and now am refusing to listen when he's giving it. (I wanted friendly advice sure, not a book I have to read), so basically I need to read this book or I will never kiss a woman again &lt;-- he doesn't say that, but he seems to be implying it. Like, he never once asked me about this woman I am speaking with (her background, interests, what we talk about) to give me advice; he just gives me this book to read. I tell him I am not really interested in the general self help scene, he insists it's a diverse scene and you can't judge it (which is true, sure), but, since he's pushing me I tell him what I really think \"Honestly, I don't respect the whole self-help industry, I think most of them are scammers.\"\n\n​\n\nThis seems to trigger him. \"I'm taking that personally because you just insulted my profession. I have been writing a self-help book for years!\" I didn't know this and I tell him I didn't know this. The genie's out of the bottle. He tells me I haven't even read any of these books yet I judge them (I tried and it sucked). He continues to get aggressive. I tell him he's getting aggressive; he says \"No, you sound aggressive to me!\"\n\n​\n\nHe tells me he read all my short stories and was all upset that I never once went to his website! I didn't know he had one; and I'm not interested so what? I asked him straight up \"So to hang out with you I need to go to your website?\" Don't remember what he said. He keeps pressing me on why I wont read these books. I tell him I wont read them and he has to accept that. He keeps pressing me. I tell him straight up I think many of those books are misogynist. He then says \"Are you calling me a misogynist? Do you think my girlfriend thinks I am a misogynist? Misogyny means ",

      "description": "I know how it sounds, but bear with me. We work at a large factory that employs thousands of people on both day and night shifts. We both work nights on the same group, but different teams. Yes I know dating a co worker is a bad idea, I have made questionable decisions in my life. I'm 25 now, but 24 when dating and he's 29 now but 28 while dating. Side note: Ex has type 1 diabetes and was diagnosed at least 20 years ago. It comes up later.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, lets get into the why. So we began dating in early September of 18 and he broke up with me in mid october I think? We got back together a week later and broke up early November regardless. He began the break up, but I finalized it. I told him I gave him a second chance, he blew it and he would not get a third chance. We are now approaching February and he still is trying to get me back in a relationship with him. \n\nAnd this is where it gets complicated. Ex has a mental illness that has not been treated or even addressed by him. He went to a doctor to get medication for his ADHD and got told that he was also a narcissist. Also on that note, he lied about the severity of his ADHD to get the strongest medication he could because, in his own words, he \"loves drugs\", oxy, vyvanse and xanex mostly. This was a problem for me a bit, I'm not a drug user but as long as it didn't effect me I kept the mindset that he was a grown man that could make his own decisions. \n\nAnyways. So the symptoms of his illness are paranoia, dissociation, agitation, and \"fidgeting\". Fidgeting is in quotes because he would pace, and just not be still but I'm not sure what to properly call it. His paranoia was extreme. He once thought that I had been replaced while we were dating because \"my hair color looked different\" and \"my tattoos were more vivid\". He thought that there were people keeping me captive in my own home and forcing me to make drugs. Among other things. His dissociation was pretty bad too. He thought he was untouchable, and even told me to call him a God because in his mind he was. \n\nRecently, as in last week, he went missing. From Monday to late Tuesday no one knew where he was. In a dissociatiated state, he wandered around town near his apartment building before finding his way back to his apartment. We live in the mid-west and he claims the diesel fuel in his truck froze or something? So he had to walk and instead of walking home, he began wandering town. He claims that all of what he did was because he had \"low blood sugar\" and was so bad he couldn't even order a cup of coffee. \n\nHere's where it gets.... Not good. Very not good. He eventually found his way back to his apartment complex. And if I'm understanding correctly, he was shirtless and shoeless in the dead of mid-west winter at this point. This is what he told me over video call (for whatever reason he likes video calling). He took the license plate off a woman's car while she was still in it. When she asked what he was doing all he said was that he needed it, before sprinting away with it. He made it to the apartment complex's club house, and pulled a handicapped sign out of the ground then used it to break into the club house. Once inside the club house, still with the licence plate he stole, he called 911 on two different phones. The police show up to arrest him, duh, and he then resisted arrest. He showed me all the scrapes and bruises he has. They had to have multiple cops help put him into the back of the car. At some point his hand got twisted and badly hurt, he can not move his hand properly at this time. So because he wasn't (and possibly still isn't) in his right mind he thought that the police turning his head to try and force him into the car, was them trying to kill him to \"cover up\" .... Something? \n\nSo after arresting Ex, they took him to a mental hospital and not jail or anything like that. He is now out of the hospital as his parents took him out. Throughout our relationship and the \"friendship\"/coworker relationship after, I had been insisting he got professional mental help but his narcissism wouldn't have it. He is still showing signs of mental instability. Tomorrow will be his first day back at work and I'm concerned about working near him again. I've already decided to talk to associate resources about being uncomfortable and feeling unsafe working near him. Am I the asshole for hoping he gets either moved by associate resources or fired for having 2 no-call-no-shows?\n\nTL;DR - am I the asshole for wanting my mentally unstable ex boyfriend to get moved at our job so that I don't have to work with him as he makes me feel unsafe?",

      "description": "This happened after hearing loud smashes from the living room, before hearing a really loud one at which point he very solemnly asked me to come out and see something 'really funny', and he'd broken the front drawer off our tv stand. He quite frequently throws stuff when he's angry, including the game controllers, and has broken other things such as kitchen utensils too. It took him over a year to replace a ladle of mine he broke, and that was with a lot of prompting and I ended up having to order it myself and he paid for it.\n\nI waited until the next morning, and told him very clearly that he needed to either fix it or pay to replace it today. That I wasn't okay with him ignoring it, and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. \n\nHe responded by making fun of my voice, telling me I'm an idiot for getting upset about a cheap piece of furniture (we received it for free, but it costs about $100 from Ikea), called me rude names, and told me I'm making a big deal out of nothing. The tone of his voice ranged between being moderately angry to laughing. \n\nTo me it's not so much what he broke, but the fact that he broke it,  refused to deal with it, and then verbally berated me over being upset about it. If he'd just taken responsibility and fixed it or replaced it, I really wouldn't have cared. \n\nHis solution is to throw out the drawer as he wasn't able to fix it, and is telling me he made it better by breaking it.",

There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over.

Fair enough, I thought, and carried on trying to watch my own screen and eventually eat a meal with the fold out table pretty much touching my abdomen.  \n\nThe hours went by and it was time to try to sleep. I put away my table, got out the blanket and slowly reclined my seat like everyone else had at this point. Seconds later the guy behind me starts kicking my seat. He kicks harder and harder until I turn around and ask him to stop.\n\nI turn around and this tall guy in his 20s starts aggressively shouting at me, he is sat with his brother and father and keeps shouting “LONG LEGS! LONG LEGS! I HAVE NO SPACE” and tries to get me to put my seat back up.\n\nIn a panic I push my seat up but I feel so claustrophobic and uncomfortable in the dark with this seat in front of me reclined while I’m up straight that I start to feel panicky. (Probably doesn’t help that I’d just been screamed at by a stranger). I give in and recline my seat back again a little bit, which meant the entire way to our destination he kept kicking my chair and waking me up.\n\nAITA for reclining?

Mostly one popular spot where we split the hotel and pay roughly $100 each, soak in a hot tub and walk the sights.\n\nI enjoy planning and investing time and money into elaborate, crazy and extremely thoughtful gifts/events for my friends.. usually for a birthday. I have surprised friends with scavenger hunt birthdays, created thoughtful scrapbooks/memory slideshows, etc., or asked everyone to pitch in for a nice piece of jewelry for the birthday girl. We have gone on those weekend trips for each others birthdays, etc.\n\nI'm usually the creative and the planner, taking lead. My friends had reciprocated with similar sort of scavenger hunts, etc. for my birthday in the past, but Ella sad it was too much and from now on no more gifts or anything. She will attend a dinner if the birthday girl chooses a restaurant, but that's it. I was a bit bummed, but getting older meant less time and money for silly things or gifts and it made sense. We'd still do some local weekend getaways once in a while as a group. We even did one a year ago for Victoria's boyfriend's birthday where we surprised him and cooked him dinner, etc.\n\nAnyways, we're at that age where we're all getting married. And of course, we get to plan each other's surprise stagettes. So I'm excited about planning something amazing!! Like my birthday ideas on steroids! Or like a REAL trip where we leave the country. We're in our 30's and have always wanted to go on a big trip and have yet to do so, so my thought is this is a good excuse to do it! \n\nElla is the first bride. Victoria and I are on the same page but Ella's sister is maid of honour (aka: in charge) and says because she has a kid at home we're staying near home. So we went to the same old nearby destination we've been to since we were teens. Ok, so since it was out of our hands I took the lead in making decorations, hand-made games, buying games, etc. Victoria was happy to help. We made a penis cake by hand, we made themed cookies to decorate. I called the popular booked solid spa EVERYDAY for over a month to get a massage appointment for the bride and was finally successful. I also offered to help the bride and designed her invitations and did a ton of research into where to source the paper as well as bridesmaid gown materials and saved her TONS of money. She happily took my help and asked me to do the menu, programs and more. Yes, this is within my industry but I wouldn't dream of charging my best friend. I admit I was unemployed and used her wedding as a distraction from how badly job hunting was going. But I really cherish opportunities like this and I wanted to support my friend any way I could and my boyfriend (now husband) and I could spare even some money if the stagette was a real trip like I wanted all of us to have. Ella said she would definitely help me with my wedding planning when it was my turn.\n\n2 years later and I'm the bride-to-be. Ella is working on renovating her home and it's a big shitty experience so I didn't bother asking her for any wedding help. \n\nI did not choose a \"maid of honour\". I loved my sister and friends and just couldn't choose 1 person over the others. However the 3 of them bickered and fought about my stagette plans from the beginning and they couldn't agree on anything. They knew my dream stagette was a trip to New Orleans. I knew it was a tall order and was hoping for maybe Portland (5 hour drive).\n\nEveryone agreed my dream destination was too expensive. I said I understood, but I'd like something different and I really just didn't want to go to the nearby town where we just walk around. I mentioned a couple of destinations, like Portland, but I didn't realize a weekend there wasn't possible either. I just kept hearing that they were fighting so I asked them to include my then fiance to help guide them and they flat out refused. I said I could pay for myself. We could stay in town if we did something unique.\n\n In the end, my friends and sister fought too much, money was tight and there wasn't enough time during the stagette weekend to go very far. So they ended up just taking me to that same destination where we walked around. Exactly what I asked NOT to do. What made things worst is there were no stagette games planned, no penis cake, not much of anything. They decorated our hotel room with some New Orleans beads and masks. I saw cupcakes I guess we were going to decorate but no one initiated anything. They didn't even bring the games I bought or we handmade for the last stagette which my friend was in possession of. Apparently she BROUGHT the game, but it never happened. And one of the main reasons is because we were only there for ONE NIGHT. There was no time for anything to happen. Also, they wanted to go to the free club instead of the club I wanted to go to. At the club I kept saying I wanted to go to the other club but everyone literally just danced and ignored me. It was like $5 entry each person!!! They had more than 6 months to plan and instead bickered until they just went with the plan I didn't want. At that point, the spa we loved was booked and I got a massage at a hotel that my work covered with insurance and we hung out at their plunging pool with a bunch of kids splashing around.\n\nThe reasons they settled for the destination I didn't like was:   \n\n\\- Victoria had just graduated from University and wasn't going to apply to jobs until after summer so money was tight. But she went to Europe with her family and boyfriend, and Mexico with her boyfriend within about a year before graduating.  \n\n\\- The ONLY long weekend that could work, Victoria's parents wanted her in town to help decorate for July 1st. She always does what her parents demand and I'm upset that we could have had a long weekend if she only just told her parents no.  \n\n\\- Ella had been renovating her home for 2 years, so she went to Europe for a month as a break so she only had 1 week of vacation time left which she booked off to actually move into her new home. I felt like 1 day out of all of that time could have been doable. Maybe take 1 day from the moving week she booked? They lived rent-free at her parents house, I get the rush but I think it's doable.\n\n\\- Ella doesn't think it's appropriate to ask people to go on a big trip for your event. But she's currently planning to go to New York right now, and has been on big trips with some friends. I don't see how going for someone's stagette differs.   \n\n\\- My sister wasn't easy to work with because she chose things I wouldn't want like a cabin in the woods, and then when they settled on the usual destination she demanded we go to an expensive restaurant thinking I'd want that. Her heart was in the right place, but she doesn't know what I'd want like my friends do.  \n\nAfter my stagette, it was the end of summer and Victoria applied within her industry. She got 5 offers in a week, and got a great job. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Victoria and I were always on the same page from the beginning. We both like to go big, but she goes crazy. I wanted a normal trip with stagette themed stuff. She always said she wanted Las Vegas penthouse suite! We told her she's dreaming. Ella told me while planning for my stagette, Victoria decided she wants Thailand for her stagette!! Ha!\n\nNow I'm not sure what the plan is because Victoria is now engaged, Ella is probably still against big trips for stagettes, and Victoria is wanting a US city or something more doable I think. Victoria asked me if it would make me happy if she chose New Orleans for her stagette because I want to go there, or if that would step on my toes. I said both because I still want to go and we always talk about going, but it hurts to think we'd all go for her and for me it wasn't even possible to do something different than the usual.\n\nAlso, neither of my friends helped with wedding planning, decorating, etc. Now I just feel resentful and I feel like an asshole for expecting so much. Am I an asshole for expecting a real trip? They DID take me somewhere, so I feel like a spoiled brat to be upset. I think Victoria thinking we're going on a big trip for her is an asshole move, but ignoring that.. am I an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?",
      "description": "My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?",

      "title": "AITA for being mad at my sister for trying for disability?",
      "description": "Don’t judge a post by its title please. Long read ahead.\n\nHere’s the deal, I (20,F) have a sister (25) who has been trying to get disability for almost a year now. She has been clinically diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. She is on multiple medications and has been seeing a therapist once a week for the past 8+ months. I am completely understanding of her mental illnesses, and I completely get that she did not choose to have these and that she probably doesn’t want them. I still love her all the same.\n\nThe issue stems here. She has had jobs in the past, and previously (about 2 years ago) worked at Farm and Fleet part time for 2 years with no issues. The managers there were very understanding when she got overwhelmed due to her anxiety and provided ample accommodations to her when needed. They really liked her as a worker and she seemed to enjoy working there. Then, her department got a new manager who she didn’t like and she quit the next day just because she didn’t like that new manager. Since then, she has not worked any jobs for more than 1 day, and has recently stopped trying to get a job. She claims that she cannot get a job because her anxiety and her bipolar disorder prevent her from functioning in a work environment, yet that didn’t stop her at Farm and Fleet. She lives at home with myself, my parents, and her boyfriend. She has been supported financially by my parents and her boyfriend the past 2 years. She has been sitting around at home doing nothing but watching tv, playing video games, and doing arts and crafts things. She lives off of the people around her and constantly complains that she’s bored and begs our mom to entertain her when our mom is not working. Instead of trying to get a job or using a company that provides a job coach to help her, she decided that she needed disability. She applied, got denied, then she appealed the denial, got denied again, and now she has found a lawyer and is going to take it to court.\n\nI feel as if her trying to get disability is unreasonable. I completely understand that she has mental illnesses that can be debilitating at times, but she was doing so well at her old job. Her previous success with her old job makes me feel as if she doesn’t need disability as she is capable of working a job, she just doesn’t want to. It makes me angry that she is trying so hard to get disability. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way?",

      "description": "So for context, I don't make friends easily. Im awkward and struggle in ANY social situations, so when I make new friends I tend to slowly open up so that I dont overstep boundaries (aspergers makes this difficult, but Im getting better).\n\nNow this friend of mine is great. They accommodated for my awkwardness and even didnt run away when I developed a crush for them. With time the crush faded away and we were able to do things like hang out at parties and joke around, which really helped me develop socially.\n\nEventually it got to the point when they were going to move away (I had known them for about half a year at this point) so I started to reflect back at our friendship, trying to figure out if we were good enough friends for them to keep in touch, I really didn't want to lose them as a friend due to the distance.\n\nI began to realize that I didnt know that much about them, apart from what had happened over the last few months. I realized that they flaked on most of our plans, even ones they made. I discovered that they would often take party drugs (which I have no problem with) but let everyone know but me. A lot of our conversations were one sided, and would need to be initiated by me. I hardly got texts back, but everything was fine when we would hang out. \n\nWe only hung out together once without being invited as part of a bigger group. I found out that they were talking about the time I had a crush on them with the rest of the friendship group behind my back. I feel betrayed and like I've been made a fool of. \n\nWith my condition, I NEED to trust that people say what they mean, I struggle to read between the lines.\n\nSo while I was thinking about all of this, I decided to blank them. I didn't want to say anything I would regret later, and there were feelings I wasn't use to dealing with. This lasted right through the time they moved away, I think the most I said was goodbye.\n\nI decided to text them everything I was feeling in an objective way, hoping that I was being irrational and that they could say something to clear it ul, but I didn't get much from them.\n\nIts been a few weeks since then, and Im still depressed over the whole thing. Judging from the last time we had a conversation over text, they wont lose much sleep over me leaving their life. Why should I?\n\nTLDR: Good friend turns out to not be as good a friend as I thought, betrays my trust and makes a fool of me. So maybe I should just throw the whole thing away and forget about it.",

      "description": "Throwaway, mainly bc he knows my main user and I’d rather be safe than sorry. \n\nMe (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) are in a long distance relationship as of last November, dating for almost a year and a half. We video call daily and usually call until one of us says goodnight. During these calls, he often sends me memes he finds on instagram and I’ll send him reddit posts so we can laugh and talk together. \n\nDuring our call tonight, we were already on thin ice after getting into an argument over something trivial and irrelevant. Both of us were a little snippy, but nothing terrible. Things were still okay. That is, until he sent me a meme titled “when you see her leave her drink alone” with a rohypnol (roofie) drug photoshopped over a guy throwing a basketball. Obviously a rape joke, loud and clear. \n\nMy mother was raped a few years ago. Finding out wrecked me. She was roofie’d and assaulted in the presence of so called “friends,” but I never knew the identity of the attacker. Whatever. \n\nThat being said, I did not react well to the meme. First, I said something along the lines of “Why do you think that’s funny?!” I waited for him to explain, as calmly as I could, but when it was obvious he wasn’t actually paying attention (he kept going “I, uh— well...” and I could hear his thumb scrolling on his screen and him laughing, presumably at another meme he saw), I just snapped. I said, “Did you know my mom was drugged when she was raped, [BF’s name]? Did you? Yeah. Your joke isn’t *fucking* funny.” At that point, my voice was trembling with hurt and anger and, coincidentally, my mom (who I still live with) was entering the house after being out today. All I said was “My mom is home now, so I’m going to bed. I will talk to you in the morning. Goodnight.” Without waiting for any kind of response, I ended the call. \n\nHe’s pulled other shitty jokes before but we’ve talked through any issues and it has never been to this severity. He knew my mom had been raped, and he knows I have never ever tolerated any kind of rape joke or any sexist/racist (although he’s black)/homophobic/transphobic/bigoted joke in the past (which is what we’ve had slight issues with before). \n\nAm I the asshole here? Am I overreacting? I don’t know how to handle this, it’s really, really bothering me. Any advice or constructive criticism would be appreciated. ",

      "description": "So we have these weekly quizzes based on questions at the end of the chapters in our textbook. The first week, there was no mention of the format for said quizzes, so I did a number format; 1. , 2. , 3. , etc. I would type the question verbatim from the textbook, then put the answer below it in a newline. Mind you, these are multiple choice questions, so the answers have a letter associated with them; a. , b. , c. , etc. Instead of putting the letter, I just wrote out the answer (again, verbatim from the textbook). When I get the test back, he docked it -5% for “Need to put in the letter associated with the answer.”\n\nOkay... A heads up would’ve been nice. Nothing in the Syllabus talked about this, nor did he say anything about it himself.\n\nFast forward a month later to the 5th quiz I turned in. I accidentally answered a question with “a. False” when it was *supposed* to be “b. False.” My quiz was docked -5% but I knew the answer, it was just a tired college student typo. \n\nAnd this wasn’t the second instance. I’ve been docked on ALL my quizzes for the dumbest shit. He tried telling me I had answered a question incorrectly, but I pointed out that it was a question on semantics because the question was almost verbatim from the chapter, except that it had one word inserted to make the statement false. When I told him he said, “I will grant you that argument.”\n\nSo, I want to message him and call him out on petty grading. I also wonder if it’s even worth it. Basically, AITA, or would I be the asshole?",

      "description": "Me and my wife have been together for six years and we have two amazing sons, our youngest is three and we both said we would want a little girl even before we got married. This was a long time ago and we are now on the wrong side of mid thirties.\n\nThe last few weeks she had told me that wants to try for another baby in the hope of having a daughter, but I will make it clear that if it was another boy she would love him to death like his brothers. This is where I told her I have spent the last few months thinking about getting the snip and that I don't think we should be trying.\n\nI explained to her that we aren't getting any younger and we could be in our seventies of our sons had children roughly the same age as ourselves, there is no guarantee that any of our grandchildren will meet us. That would be so hard on our sons, I would imagine it would devastate our daughter if we had one.\n\nThe birth of our sons was not easy for their mother neither as she has a thin womb. On both occasions she was in labour for four days, five actually for son number 2 and they ended up being delivered by emergency cesarean. For son number 1 the local anaesthetic had little affect and it was terrible watching her, they chucked me out to put her under to finish the procedure.\n\nI said that the current situation with politics could put our jobs in jeapordy, with Brexit around the corner of finances could be hit hard and we need to support our family as best we can as it is.\n\nShe was very upset and we are at an impasse on this, she thinks all the risks are worth it and that we should have another child regardless of its gender. I admitted that I still do wish we could have the daughter we promised each other but I would probably look to book myself in within the next month.\n\nI do feel guilt but I think this way is best for all of us, am I being an asshole?

      "description": "About two weeks ago, I decided to try going vegan. I didn’t eat a lot of meat before so it wasn’t a hard change for me. I can’t tell you why I decided to go completely vegan all together. It’s just something I wanted to try so I did it. And I really enjoyed it. I’m having a lot of fun planning creative meals and buying interesting produce. I also like the way my body feels. I no longer feel heavy or bloated after meals. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both 25 and we have been together for six and a half years, and living together for five of those. He is a serious carnivore. When I chose to change my diet, I tried my best for it not to affect him. I made him steaks and chicken to “supplement” my dinners. I bought him regular cows milk and regular butter. If he doesn’t want to go vegan, I understand and I won’t make him.  \n\nLast night we went to dinner at one of our favorite bars and he wanted to stop for ice cream at his favorite place on the way home. I suggested that we stop at the grocery store instead (same parking lot) so that I could get some dairy-free ice cream instead. He did it, but it the most passive aggressive way possible. He glared at me and stormed off as I was trying to pick out what flavor I wanted. It was frustrating, but I just tried to brush it off. When we got home, he went to the garage to work on his boat and then went to bed without me. (Granted, he is exhausted from three weeks work with no breaks) \n\nThis morning I sensed he was still upset and I asked him about it. He said he couldn’t understand my diet change and it was upsetting him. He didn’t want me to do this forever and he would be embarrassed to tell his friends and family. He said it would be okay if I were just vegetarian but vegan is too much. \n\nI did do this without talking to him about it first, but if I had talked to him first I feel like he would have tried to talk me out of it. I also don’t know if I’m going to do this forever, but I also can’t give an end date... \n\nAITA for going vegan without consulting my boyfriend? \n\nTL;DR: I went vegan and I liked it. My carnivorous boyfriend is now embarrassed of me and gets upset when I eat. ",

      "description": "This goes a way back.\nThere’s a good friend of mine, we were there for each other in good and bad times, and we generaly enjoy each others company. \nOver 6 years ago i got together with a friend of hers, and even after the relationship ended, the three of us stayed close friends.\nI never really got over that relationship (or rather, it triggered what was years later diagnosed as chronic depression). About 2 years ago, i was under a lot of stress,i had a breakdown, explained the whole thing to my ex (i’m not fine, this is all too much, i’m not over “us”, sorry, yada yada), and asked her, aware that this isn’t heathy and we won’t get back together, if she is comfortable being on speaking terms with me, now aware of all the crap in my life, or if she rather take a step back from this mess, either is fine.\nWell, she basically told me she won’t comment on any of that and that i should seek help because she doesn’t want people to talk about her if i harmed myself.\nWell that was pretty much the last time i ever spoke to her. What i didn’t expect was that she did a preemptive strike and made sure all our common friends and aquaintances would avoid me from then on, spread lies, etc (she has BAD coping machanisms).\n\nSo, that’s been the situation for the past 3 years, and i honestly don’t miss the whole bunch of people. If all that it takes to drop me os one crazy chick rallying them up, i have wasted enough time on those folks.\n\nNow, my good friend, who has been the only one  not buying into my exes shit (but is still friends with her) is mad at me for, again, not attending her birthday party. I like parties as much as the next guy, and i always get her a present and congratulate, but i will not sit down with 30 something people who all got fed lies about me to make that bitch of an ex of mine look better.\nAITA here and should just suck it up and see it as an exercise in patience, have a few drinks and then go back to not talking to them for my friends sake? Because i can think of many things more fun than that i could do that evening.",

As I am on my way out of the back (I work in a restaurant and we run into homeless people waiting for us to leave so they can ask for change or leftover food from time to time) I am approached by a homeless woman on a bike. She asks if I have any spare change to which I reply no and she pedals off in the opposite direction around the corner of the restaurant. I thought it was a bit rude on her part since it was clear I was having some sort of medical issue with tissues jammed up my nose and blood around my mouth and in large spots on my shirt but I didn't say anthing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince it was such a bad nosebleed I had my girlfriend come and pick me up since I wasn't comfortable driving my car since I was feeling lightheaded. As I round the corner I see my girlfriend waiting for me in her car and I see the homeless woman pedaling over to her to ask her the same thing. The homeless woman clearly sees me walking to the car and waits for me to open the door before approching the driver side window and asking my girlfriend if she had any spare change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I lost my cool a bit and yelled at her with the gist basically being go the fuck away, we are clearly dealing with something here and that its inappropriate for you to come up and ask us for change at this particular moment in time. She gets offended and calls me an asshole and then pedals off to find someone else to beg from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to be clear I have no problem with beggars but in this particular incident I thought this lady was completley out of line.

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nMy sister (F 32) decided to divorce her husband and marry another guy 6 months ago. My parents tried to convince her to change her mind because the new guy didn't have a job (and my sister can't work too, because she has a 3 year old baby). But she still did it anyway. During the first 5 months, they were unable to pay the rent, the bills, health insurance etc., so my father always helped them, reminding my sister that this marriage will not last long if something doesn't change. She was also unsure about it, and she even came back to my parents' house and said she'd divorce him. However, she changed her mind and went back to her house. This made my parents even more frustrated and the relationship between them was not so good. A few weeks earlier she decided to divorce once again, and told my parents about it. They immediately rented a house in the apartment they live in, and prepared the house for my sister and her children. But after some time she changed her mind again and told my parents that she's not coming. My parents had gone mad and they decided to stop talking to her and sending her money. It is super hard for them to see their daughter struggle for a living, but they can't just continue to pay for the needs of an entire household. So today, my father asked me to call my sister and ask her about it, and maybe convince her to move to the new house and stay there at least for a while. And he said if she doesn't move tomorrow, she will cancel the rent and never allow her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I called her and it was something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOP-So what's your last decision?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister - I can't move there, OP. I love him, but there's another reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOP- What's that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister - He got some money from a guy who is \"kind of a loanshark\" and is unable to pay back. The guy used to talk to my husband only, but he also started to call me as well. He's yelling at me and demanding the money. So I went to the police and opened up a case for him. This made him even more angry and I'm not sure if he's going to do something bad. I can't tell this to my parents because they will be extremely concerned for me. And I don't wanna move there and get my parents into danger as well. Please don't tell them anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm super confused and I don't know what to do. If I don't tell this to my parents, they will cancel the rent tomorrow and she will not be able to move again, and she would be in danger. If I do, along with my sister and her children, me and my parents would be in danger. I didn't tell anything to anyone yet, and I think I'm not going to. So AITA and what do you suggest? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She was talking about how everyone thinks she’s a lesbian for some reason, and I cracked fun at her by saying something along the lines of “maybe it’s because the fucking jolly green giant looks up to you”. She’s mentioned in passing that she’s self conscious about her height (6 foot, which isn’t THAT tall to me).\n\n\nI normally wouldn’t do this, but she was making some generalizations about men, saying they’re “all idiots” and shit. She also drops the “f” word a lot (not fuck, the other more derogatory one), and as a gay guy it doesn’t really bother me, but in my opinion if you’re going to do some shoving, you should be able to get pushed back. \n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Peter, his girlfriend Maddie, and I have known each other for about 3 years. We’re all in the same major. Peter and I work for the same company as non-interns and Maddie works elsewhere. We met in a group where I also met my current boyfriend. Peter and Maddie got together around the same time and all of us have been with our partners since. We got along well and were all pretty friendly.\nAbout a year ago, I found out Peter and Maddie weren’t doing so well (from Peter and other friends)— Peter was pretty much neglecting their relationship and she had accused him of cheating on her with me. Peter and I’s friendship remained the same as it always had been. The last time he mentioned anything about Maddie was that they never wanted to talk about their problems. Maddie started getting more distant from me whenever we all hung out as a group. Although she never overtly mentioned anything to me, I always got a cold shoulder vibe from her since then.\nRecently, Peter mentioned that an internship position at our company had opened up that was related to our major because the current intern (Jerry) was moving. I didn’t even know the position existed until Peter told me about it.\nPeter is also quitting around the same time and mentioned that it would’ve been really cool if he was able to keep working here, with Maddie taking the internship position, so the three of us can all work together. He mentioned that Maddie hadn’t spoken to anyone at the company about it yet, but was going to ask about it. I didn’t say anything about it or think too much about the internship because my current job pays well and the workload isn’t heavy.\nLast week, Jerry and his boss (not my boss) approached me and asked if I wanted the internship when Jerry leaves. They specifically said they wanted to ask me because I was already working with the company and knew it was in my major, and that they were willing to work with my current boss so I could do both jobs. I knew Maddie was interested in the job, but wasn’t sure if she had reached out to them, so I asked if there was a public job posting or somewhere to apply. They just said no and that it was mine if I wanted it. After they went into more detail, I accepted their offer.\nA couple weeks later, Peter left the company and had recommended Maddie to my current boss for his position. She of course got the job, and then later asked about the internship position as well. My current boss and my internship’s boss (I guess I have two bosses now) both told her that I had already taken the position and it was the only position. Peter heard I got the internship but didn’t seem upset that I had gotten it.\nSince then, I got the impression that Maddie hasn’t been too happy about it. She periodically sends out emails to my current boss and I about some issues that she has offered to fix herself, with potential solutions. The fixes are things that fall into my internship description more than her job. To make matters worse, my internship got wind of some of the issues and asked me to work on them (after she had brought it up) and other issues she had brought up were pretty much ignored.\nAITA for taking the internship? By the time I accepted it, Maddie and I weren’t really speaking to each other, not ignoring each other, but just minimal conversation whenever we hung out as a group. After I took it, Maddie started bailing from group hang outs whenever I was invited to go—the pattern was so obvious that a lot of people pointed it out. I reduced hanging out with Peter because I didn’t want to ruin anything between them, even if I wasn’t involved. At one point I even apologized to Maddie for whatever I did and told her if she ever wanted to talk about it, I’d be willing to listen. Maddie has just given me the cold shoulder. It’s been eating me up for quite some time because we used to be friends and I don’t really know what happened.",

      "description": "I (39m) have two boys, ages 3 and 5. The older while was diagnosed with autism and is definitely on the spectrum while the younger had some developmental delays and because of older brother's diagnosis we were able to get him diagnosed too so we could qualify him for services. It's now apparent that the younger is catching up and although he has some issues, he's becoming pretty typical for his age. \n\nIt was brought to my attention by my wife that I totally favor the older child. I was doing so without realizing it and the more I thought about it it's true. I regard my eldest as my precious first born that I would do anything for. I dote on him and help him through any tantrums he may have over his inflexibilities. I play with him and smile and laugh and truly enjoy my time with him. \n\nAs for my younger child I love him as my child but oftentimes I treat him the way I would treat someone else's kid.  He's around, he's ok, but whatever.  I sometimes feel like playing with him is a chore and I definitely don't enjoy it as much as when I play with my older one.  I don't feel as close to him and when he tantrums over something dumb that a typical 3 yr old tantrums over I just let him tantrum and cry it out.  Sometimes I can't stand him and try to avoid him. \n\nI really feel like an asshole because I know I favor the eldest and I feel like I don't even want to try to like the younger one more.  I feel like I'm a good dad to both but the younger one is definitely getting the short end of the stick. To top it off everyone says the younger one has my personality and is totally like me while the eldest that I favor is very much like my wife. \n\nAny parents out there have any advice or thoughts?  How much of an asshole am I?",

      "description": "So in June I went on a solo backpacking trip through the balkins for two months . I've been exclusive and seeing my current girlfriend since August. I've been seeing here on and off since January last year. \n\nFrom January to June we had a friend's with benefits situation going on and I really saw her as a good friend who I like hooking up with but I didn't really see myself long term with her. To clarify we've spoken about this and have established boundaries and expectations. \n\nLeading up to the trip I started to develop emotions for her but I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to her before I left on a solo two month trip. I felt like if I wasn't a 100percent sure I would regret that decision so much. I told her this and how I was starting to feel about her but I wanted my freedom on this trip. \n\nSo when it came time for the trip we've gotten pretty close and she even drove with me and my dad to the airport to drop me off. During the two months we texted almost every day. During the course of my trip I met two girls and we ended up sleeping together. Near the end of my trip she was feeling down and insecure and asked me if I hooked up with anyone and I was honest with her. This led to her crying and a series of arguments saying I led her on, that I essentially cheated on her, and that she can't trust me. We eventually worked it out and I told her I'd commit to her that very moment and wouldn't see anyone else. \n\nNow it's April, it's been awhile and we've had wonderful times together but she uses this as leverage to every fight we've had. Shes having so much trouble letting go and I've apologized so many times and I've tried to comfort her but this just won't seem to stay in the past. Whenever we have any issues it's used as a dagger against me. She says that its not fair for me to tell her she needs to let it go and move on forward because she's the one dealing with the pain of it and that Im not carrying any emotional burdens from it. I feel that if we don't let go of this we can never heal from it. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for a year at this point. I am a senior in high school and she is a freshman in college. \n\nShe was diagnosed with lupus when she was 12 and recently had another flare up In November (kidney malfunction, severe swelling of her entire body, blood pressure issues, the whole 9 yards). She was in the hospital for 2 weeks and I stayed overnight with  her at the hospital every other day because she enjoys my company (According to her, her family never shuts up and is always hovering over her when they visit her). After being specifically told by the doctor that she was not allowed to leave her house for a week following her release she decided to go back to school the day after she was released anyway in order to take her finals (she is a nursing major at a private college and they would not allow her to take the finals online). Because she went back to school while her immune system was still recovering she ended up with endocarditis (a heart infection) and would’ve died in 24 hours if she didn’t go to the ER when she did. She was in the hospital for another week and has been home since around New Years. \n\nShe isn’t allowed to leave the house and she has to give herself an IV every morning at 5. \n\nShe is understandably going through a hard time in the past few weeks with everything from the emotional stress of having to medically withdraw for the spring semester at her college to the physical stress of moving around with an extra 60 pounds of weight in water from swelling. I’ve been staying overnight at her house with her every Friday.\n\nAll of this time that I spent in the hospital with her has added up and now my average for all my classes is a 91. I need a 93 to get the presidential scholarship at the University I want to go to, I’ve already been accepted there and I’ve already given their lacrosse coach a verbal commitment. I had no idea that something this drastic would happen. Tomorrow starts the first day of my midterm tests at school and I need to score extremely well to get my average where it needs to because the end of this quarter is the last time I can reapply for scholarships at the university I want to go to. I’ve been studying like crazy the past week because I also had to miss 4 days of review from a nasty respiratory infection the week before THAT. My girlfriend hasn’t seen me in 2 weeks due to me being sick and not wanting to compromise her immune system plus me studying all week last week. \n\nIt is starting to bother me because she will text me things like, “Do you think you can come over tomorrow?” or “Did I do something? You haven’t FaceTimed me or seen me as often as you usually do.” but when I tell her why I haven’t seen her or FaceTimed her as much she gets all defensive and tells me that she obviously knows that I’m busy with school and that she wants me to do well and that she just misses me, even though she asks me to see her and gets upset with me when I say when I told her for the past week that I couldn’t. \n\nI love this girl so much and I know that her life has been hell for the past few months but at some point I feel like I need to take a week and focus on myself (especially when a large scholarship could help us financially later in life). Should I have tried to make more time for her this past week? Is making her smile at a rough point in her life worth passing up a scholarship that would cover 75% of my college tuition? I’m really struggling on this one.\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend who has been fighting an autoimmune disease and a heart infection for 2 months is upset I didn’t see her for a week because I was studying for a chance at a scholarship worth 75% of my college tuition",

      "description": "I am posting this for my wife because I feel the need to get an outsider's perspective. \nRight. So my wife has a friend who she has been close with for 10 years, long before I met her. She was a good friend to her and even gave her the money for a deposit upon a flat, even brought her down south (we live in the north of England and wife's friend's family lives up north too) to spend her birthday with her. Fast forward to 2015 and I enter the picture I move in with her, I meet her friend and her husband and things go smoothly. Things go great for me and my then girlfriend. I hope I am not sounding too cocky or self important when I say when I met my wife she was living on 20pence noodles and carrot dip because she was that poor, but since meeting me she has been able to go abroad and now has a supportive family network around her that gives her more confidence. A family unit which she has been lacking for a long time. Some more time passes and we attend the wedding of her friend. Then it comes to 2017 and mine and my soon to be wife's wedding. This is where the problems arose I think and believe. Wife had asked this friend to be her bridesmaid, her only bridesmaid, just as she had been at her wedding. Friend agreed. They make arrangements to spend the day together the night before the wedding. Best friend offered her to either come for a meal with her and her family, because her mam wanted to go for a meal with her husbands family who were also travelling up for the wedding. Or they could stay in for a takeaway. My wife decided that they would meet at the flat and decide then. Come Friday, the day before the wedding, and the friend is nowhere to be seen. I have already gone to my parents to spend the night there. I get a call from my wife. She is upset. Friend has not turned up. I go over to support my wife and during that time the friend sends her a message that she had decided to go for a meal with her family instead and is already there having the meal. She then says my wife can come join her. She doesn't turn up until 9pm.\nThe next day, the day of the wedding, she puts in the minimum effort into being bridesmaid, basically walking with her up the aisle and then travelling with her to the reception. She did not adjust the veil when it slipped, did not accompany us for any of the traditional photos outside the reception. She was pretty miserable all that day. I later found out that she had had been quite negative (oh how can you afford this so soon) and complained about the dress she had to wear. Complained about having to go to the reception in a car by herself. Complained about having to sit at the head table and having to sit at the front at church and not with her family. \nMy wife decided to look past all this because she's that kind of person and this friend is her only real friend. \nOver the course of the rest of 2017 and toward Feb 2019 things progress naturally, but communication is at a bare minimum between them. Yes, she goes over for her friends husbands 30th and they meet up maybe a couple of times, but outside of this there is little interaction, though the friend does make an apology for being a bad friend. \nThe only issue happening between this is her cancelling a meet up because her step mom had a fight with her son, and then they all went to the comedy club on the night time, and the mam being more happy to see me and my wife than my wife's best friend. Wife would continually reach out to this friend between meet ups and even wrote a heartfelt letter to her which did not even earn a message to say I got the letter. \nI should mention that there were a few red flags during this time (to me at least) When trying to arrange something with my wife's friend we suggested going to a shopping centre. Wife's friend said no. We suggested me picking her up and her coming to mine and my wife's house. Wife's friend immediately said no let's go to the shopping centre instead. \nThere was a point where we were all going to meet up the four of us, but they changed it to a girly day instead so I did not go. Later I find out that my wife's friend had brought along her brother and husband. \nCome the end of 2018 and there is no communication. My wife maybe gets a message once to say she is coming up for Christmas and does she want to get together. Obviously, Christmas is a busy time and so we cannot meet before. We arrange boxing day, but because of travel disruption, she'll get back to us. We never hear from her again until feb of this year. Her mam sends a message to my wife congratulating us on our pregnancy and the daughter responds two days later. Apparently, she was jealous because she and her husband are basically separated and can't have children. She says that she forgot to message my wife back and thought my wife was mad at her for some reason. Things run smoothly as the friend says she is really hurt that my wife felt like she couldn't tell her the good news, and knows that she has neglected their friendship and admits to being jealous over her pregnancy. \nMy wife says that of course you can be Auntie \"\" and the reason I did not tell you was because I thought you wouldn't care.\" \nWife's friend blows her lid and tells my wife she's changed and not for the better and how could she think so little of her after 10 years of friendship. She doesn't want such a negative person in her life, and cuts all ties with my wife. This despite admitting in a previous text she knew that she had been a bad friend. She also blamed my wife for the lack of contact even though my wife had been the one sending heartfelt letters about their friendship.\nThis obviously upset my wife because it came out the blue. Also, my wife has her life together and no longer has to worry about making a choice between rent and food. She has grown immensely since I met her and is a lot more confident than when I first met her too. \nSo to sum up. \nWife and friend have been friends for 10 years. Friend has been in a relationship for 8. Friend and husband are splitting up. Wife has gone from being very poor to living comfortably with security for the first time in her life and having her first proper family unit since meeting me almost 4 years ago (Not being arrogant. Just facts) Friend seems semi oblivious to how she has acted toward my wife at her wedding and in the last couple of years.\nI should also mention that despite being on facebook constantly, my wife's friend never even noticed she had deleted her facebook account. \nWas my wife an asshole for saying she thought her friend wouldn't care?

      "description": "My parents paid for vacation for me (23F), my sisters (18F and 25F) to come down to Orlando to see our brother (20M). We planned on going to SeaWorld, spending a day in Epcot, and hanging out at our resort.\n\nOur brother had to have emergency surgery to get his appendix taken out on the first day we were here, which is totally fine. We spent a lot of time at the hospital making sure he was ok &amp; getting him set up back at home to recover. \n\nBackground on my siblings- all 3 of them are huge potheads &amp; can barely function sober. I'm the only one who doesn't smoke weed (I dont like how it makes me feel and I also get tested for my job. I do drink.)\n\nI moved out about 2 years ago. My younger sister and I used to be really close, but lately she is a huge bitch whenever she isn't high.  My older sister does all sorts of drugs (cocaine, mushrooms, acid) but vapes weed all day long just to keep her at her maintenance high.\n\nLast night me and my younger sister got into it verbally &amp; I told her I can't stand how she acts when shes sober anymore. She's just so uptight and mean. We haven't spoken since last night. This morning my older sister couldn't find her EOS chapstick &amp; started accusing me of stealing it. I'm allergic to that brand, it makes my lips blister up, but she still insists I stole it. \n\nSo after being accused of being a thief and already being on bad terms with my younger sister, I opted out of going to SeaWorld today. I feel bad because I know my parents spent a lot of money on this trip but I don't want to spend the whole day with people who are stressing me out. This is MY vacation too &amp; it just feels like a huge waste of days off work.\n\nI'm looking at booking the first flight out of here. Am I a jerk for opting out of what's turning out to be a shitty vacation for me??\n\nTl;dr- Parents paid to take their adult children on vacation. Fighting with my sisters &amp; my brother is staying across town. AITA for wanting to fly home and actually enjoy my time off work?",

      "description": "So my gf and I have been dating for 4 years. We both were in our early 20s trying to figure out what to do with our lives, trying to get our shit together. We both talked about it and decided to go back to school to get better jobs and live better lives. She quit her decently paying job to take a trip to Europe with her friend for a couple weeks, then would get a job and go to school. She did that, kinda. \n\nShe got a low paying cashiers job, and went to school 6 months later, changed her major because she didnt like it after 2 years. Then dropped out and had a couple odd jobs here and there. Just enough to scrape by. \n\nI went back to school and got my associate's, then said 'fuck it', went all out and did full time school and full time work and finished my bachelors in a year. I didnt have a life, went to class after work 3 nights a week and spent pretty much all my other free time doing school work. It sucked a lot, but it paid off. I got a couple promotions after that and was making really good money. \n\nMeanwhile, my gf still (to this day) hasn't finished school, cant get any jobs other than serving or cashier jobs (which she doesnt want to do) and is currently unemployed (I am too).  However, she keeps complaining that she wants to move out of our shit apt and says that I should just pay for us to live. Now, I'm unemployed, but I still have a bunch of money I saved. Enough for me not to work for a while. I told her years ago that I wont pay for her to support herself, as life is expensive and we both agreed we were going to get our lives together so we could move up in the world and live better lives. \n\nShes upset and depressed that we live slightly better than college students and wants a house with a yard and to take trips and go out to dinner. I keep telling her to go to school and get a better job if she wants all these things and she just loses it. I probably didnt help because I bought a new motorcycle and a truck (while I was employed) and some other fun stuff, but that's what I wanted to with my money. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to live the life I want and not paying for my gf to live the life she wants? I still take her on dates (not nearly as much now since I'm unemployed) and buy stuff we need, but I dont support her. I'm a firm believer that you should be able to support yourself and the hobbies you love. And if you cant, then you should work harder to get to that point. ",

      "description": "So this happened a while ago but sometimes I think about it and wonder if I shouldn’t have completely cut him off entirely.\n\nHere’s what happened\n\nI dated a guy in high school for about 3yrs but broke up with him about a year ago. He has a friend who we’ll call Wiley that we both were friends with for a while. So fast forward and I hadn’t seen Wiley since we graduated. He found me on a popular dating/meeting app and asked me about what happened with Ex, so I told him; Ex really needed therapy and refused to go and I couldn’t be his Emotional Support Girlfriend anymore.\n\nHe told me that I should’ve stayed and supported him because that’s what a gf is supposed to do and we were together for so long. Then he was like “Hold on, I think (Ex) wants to talk to you he’s unblocking you now”\n\nWhile the whole chat was happening, HE was messaging EX and told him that he was talking to me on the dating site and all that. I tried to gently turn down the offer of talking to my ex, but Wiley told me that I should talk to him and not to point fingers (typical argument advice), but I left him on read and didn’t even try to contact the ex (who I guess was expecting ME to message him first?).\n\nI was freaking out because, no, I did not want to talk to my ex because we’re over and there’s no going back because I’ve moved on. He knows the reason why I broke up with him so it’s not like there wasn’t closure. \n\nI told a few family members my story and they agree that Wiley should’ve minded his own business. I didn’t want any more conflict/confrontation so I blocked Wiley on everything I could think of including the dating site.\n\nMe being the bleeding hearted girl I am I kinda feel bad and have that thought that *maybe* Wiley was trying to do something good and didn’t deserve to be cut off? What do you think fellow Redditors, AITA?",

In addition to the dizz I can’t feel my face or neck they are numb. \nNow tomorrow is a work audit (I work at a daycare) I’ve spent several hours outside of work hours preparing my classroom to perfection. So my class (along with one other classroom I’ve cleaned) is in perfect shape. \nThis morning 45 minutes before my work opened I realize there is no way I can go. My boss then throws a tantrum saying it’s bull crap, and that it’s not okay to call out because of medication issues. Mind you she sits on the office every day making personal calls to her daughters and scrolling through Facebook. \nI plan on going to the doctors and figuring this all out today however I think my boss is overreacting.

      "description": "Right now I am in my first year of IGCSE (grade 10) and I am taking Arabic as one of my subjects. I thought it was all going to be nice and dandy since my first language is Arabic but my teacher is to say the least \"doesn't know what he is doing.\" \n\n I trying depending on myself for about 3 months and not take any sessions with other teachers ( I had never taken any session outside of school before) but last week I got news from one of my friends telling me that the curriculum had changed and that apparently my teacher didn't know about. I was shocked and finally decided to take classes outside of school with the best teacher in the city and he definitely guided me. \n\n But what shocked me even more was that the new teacher I am taking classes with outside of school told me that during a session organised to discuss the new curriculum, he saw my old teacher (teacher who teach IGCSE for the most part know each other) and told me that he knew about it since he attended that session. \n\n That meant that my school teacher knew about it and decided to use old books and old exams rather than trying to print newer one like my new teacher did and when I confronted him about it, he told me that he was planning to tell us the changes later. \n\n So now since I am taking outside sessions with my friends with a better teacher, alot of them are just going to stop attending his class and they even got approval from the school to do so. My point is, he looks like a teacher who doesn't have much going in his life and gets really sad when one of his students doesn't attend class so alot of us not attending class at once might really put him down and since I run in to him sometimes at school it might be awkward so WIBTA if I don't attend his classes\n\nTL;DR my teacher was teaching us the wrong curriculum and I knew about that and I attended classes with another teacher WIBTA if I skip his classes.",

      "description": "A bit of background: I am in my 30s and am decently in shape. I don't expect a partner to be in shape anymore than I am and even if they're a bit less that's fine too.\n\nSo now the story for AITA.\n\nI started dating a new partner a few weeks back. We've known each other about a month and our relationship is brand new. I haven't had a good relationship in awhile so when I met this person and they were kind, caring, accepting, into some of the things I am, and all around have a good personality. To top it off with clothing they looked incredible to me. I was extremely attracted to them. They had been overweight in their younger years, were up front about this and how they had lost weight years ago. I thought it was no big deal.\n\nWell, a few nights ago we get to the \"fun times\" and start eagerly exploring one another. I was disappointed when I saw that the clothing had been making their skin look tight but in reality it had been quite loose and there's no other way to say this but flabby. Everything from chest to rear droops.\n\nI kept up my excitement for them because I really liked them. We had our fun and at first I thought \"this stuff happens, it's okay, they're great, this isn't a big deal\". But no matter how I rationalize it in my head it's like my body is having a biological rejection. My attraction has faded and that fun \"puppy love\" phase of a new relationship evaporated with it. \n\nI am trying to rationalize all of this though. Part of me really wants this to work but I feel it would be unfair because for it to work I cannot imagine it working with things as they are.... Something would have to improve. I know they've worked hard to get this far but it's been a few years so I am afraid what's done is done. To make matters worse I would never want to bring this up to them and hurt them. They mentioned having a partner prior to me but after the \"fun times\" it all went south. I just thought it was a bad former lover but I was wrong. \n\nPart of me believes if I cannot accept them for who they are I should let them go, they deserve better than what I am capable of giving. The other part of me wants to bring it up in an effort to keep this alive but I feel I would do massive damage to their self-esteem.\n\nNo matter what I do I feel like I am in a situation where there's no good outcome. AITA for thinking like this?\n\nTL;DR: It's important for context to read but in short physical expectations and the reality did not overlap. Despite trying to rationalize that I like this person my body has shut off entirely. I feel my options are \"tell them and hope it can be fixed but hurt them\" or \"leave them, they deserve someone who can accept them\". ",

      "description": "Hey guys!\n\nMy friend is turning 18 next week and we all decided to go to a saloon for her birthday. We’ve been talking about it for a few days and were all pretty excited to go.\n\nToday she told us that her mom was paying and it was 50 dollars per person for their all you can eat loaded potato bar. I thought it was pretty funny that it was so expensive, so while we were walking to class I said “wow, all that for a few potatoes?” We talked normally until all parted ways and then during first period the group chat starts to blow up.\n\nShe asks who’s coming, saying that I already said I wasn’t going. That shocked everyone else because I never said I wasn’t going to go. She continues on, saying that I was complaining about the food this morning and that I shouldn’t go if it’s 50 dollars per person and if I’m not going to eat. But.. I really like potatoes?? Either way, if someone were to be paying that much for me, I would’ve just sucked it up and ate them anyways. I told her what I said was a joke and all she said was “it’s not on me, if you don’t want to go, i don’t want to waste money.”\n\nAnother friend sent a gif saying “everybody calm down”, and she responded with “I’ve always been calm I’m not in the mood to hear complaints about what I’m doing for my party. I’m paying for it, and I invited you guys so if you feel I’m being rude-I’m not, but I feel it’s rude to complain and be ungrateful to be invited. “ \n\nShe didn’t talk to me at lunch today and is basically pretending like I don’t exist.\n\nShe does have a history of overreacting, but I never thought that she would get so angry over a joke that I said once. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?

      "title": "AITA for responding to my SO’s dad with “Fine, I don’t want to talk about it,” when asked how I was?",
      "description": "My SO’s family celebrated birthdays this weekend with the extended family. They get together every few months with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins to do this. In general my SO, his brother, and the cousins find it rather boring and tend to complain about it, but they attend nonetheless. I’ve been going for a few years as well and share their opinion.\n\nI had an awful week leading up to this weekend. Work was hell, my mental health was hell, I had significant car troubles, and my SO and I have not really been getting along these last couple weeks either.\n\nAt the event, the typical questions are asked by extended family. How are you, how’s the job, how’s school, etc. In general, I responded with “Fine” and “Long” through the first few hours of the get-together. I’m not someone that likes to claim it’s sunshine and rainbows when it’s visibly snowing 10 inches.\n\nAs we are packing up to leave, and my SO’s mom and dad are always the very last to leave, his dad approaches me with, “Hey NotTheAvatar12, I feel like I didn’t see you at all today. How are you?” At this point no fewer than 6 other people have already asked me this exact question, and I’m just not in the mood to lie about it. So I respond with “Fine. I don’t want to talk about it,” and I proceed to go to the closet to grab my coat. I hear my SO saying to his dad after, “She had a bad week at work,” as I’m putting my coat on.\n\nAs soon as my SO and I got in the car I knew he was in a foul mood. He did not talk to me for the drive home, or the rest of the night. I tried to ask what was going on but he wouldn’t tell me, and I can only assume it’s because I was “rude” to his dad. \n\nSo, AITA for my response?\n",

      "title": "AITA for cutting my ex out of my life?",
      "description": "My ex and I had been talking for about a year before we made it official. I wanted to early on, but she didn’t. Reason being, she wasn’t ready and/or didn’t want to put a label to what we had. I really liked her so I was okay with this. Honestly, we were practically girlfriends, just without the label. One thing to note is that when we first started talking, we established that we could both talk to other girls since we weren’t official. I told her it was a personal choice of mine to exclusively be talking to her and I was okay with her talking to other girls if she wanted to. I only asked that she tell me, although I also mentioned that that was her choice. Well, fast forward about a year and out of the blue, she wanted to be exclusive. I was obviously ecstatic and didn’t think twice about it.\n\nOne day, a few months into our relationship, she hopped into the shower while I was watching a show on her laptop. Up until this moment in time, she would always want to know what I told my friends about her and vice versa. I usually either told her or showed her my conversations, but she always kept it vague or a secret. I trusted her enough though and didn’t think twice about it. But for whatever reason on this particular day, I was curious as to what she would tell her friends about me so I opened up her messages and searched my name. In hindsight, I probably should not have snooped. \n\nAnd cue the whole cliche of snooping and finding something bad. I found out that she had been talking to another girl (let’s call her Ashley) for the majority of the first year we were talking. In fact, I found out that she had also lied to me multiple times by saying she was going on a trip with her fraternity when she was actually going to see Ashley. When her friends asked if she was going to tell me, she said no.\n\nI was obviously sad about this and when she came out of the shower, I was honest about snooping and we talked about it for a while. Since I had told her from the beginning that I was okay with her talking to other girls, I accepted it and got over it quickly. The only thought that lingered though was: “did she only decide to become official with me because it didn’t work out with Ashley?” \n\nAnyway, we broke up a few months later for other reasons. A few more months later, I got invited to a party and Ashley was attending. We talked. \n\nTurns out, my ex had told Ashley about me prior, but wanted to become official with Ashley. When Ashley asked about me, my ex replied back saying that she would “drop me in a heartbeat” if Ashley wanted to take things further. After hearing this, I asked Ashley about the timeline and I realized that this had all happened a few weeks before my ex wanted to make it official with me. I was so sad/livid that I decided to cut my ex out of my life without telling her what I found out.\n\nAITA for suddenly cutting my ex out even though I said it was okay to be dating multiple people in the beginning?",

      "description": "Ive been dating my current girlfriend for seven months. We've been together long enough that she knows me and my personality.\n\nWhat she doesnt know, and what nobody outside of some anonymous people online know, is that I was raped as a boy by my cousin, multiple times, from 8 to 10. My cousin is now estranged and lives far away, but he tortured and abused me for years, and made me act like a girl, wearing womens clothes and putting on makeup before rapibg me. I was only a little kid at the time and couldnt defend myself.\n\nI am 27 now. Im strong, tall, and I lift weights regularly. I am very much a \"macho\" type of guy and no one would think that I was a rape victim. I am terrified of people finding out, but for the most part I live my life like everyone else but with a few quirks.\n\nFor one I dont allow people to touch me if I dont want them too. I have gotten into fistfights before about men putting their hands on my shoulder. It was just instinct but now ive got control over it and will simply just remove their hands from me and tell them to back off.\n\nMy girlfriend knows this about me and though i allow her to touch me I dont let her use her hands sometimes. She sort of leans on me and its fine. Other times I will have this strong urge to be alone. Like we will be watching a movie and ill get up and leave to be alone in my room. I just told her that I need space and she understands. She tells me i should consider seeing a therapist and I dont want too, nor do i have too. Its my decision and i dont want it.\n\nMy girlfriend has a gay brother who I cannot stand being around as hes very feminine and stereotypically gay. I feel very uncomfortable around him and avoid him whenever we talk. I also cannot tolerate him touching me and have pushed him away before when he touched my knee. It caused a ruckus but we got over it and I assured my gf that i dont hate gay people i just dont like being around feminine men.\n\nMy gfs brother is having a birthday at a gay pride parade and I refuse to go. My gf is upset by this and asks for a reason. I just say I dont want too and its not my scene yet shes been yelling at me about it. I dont feel like i have to provide the reason why i dont want to go if i dont want too and i think she should respect that. She has not though.\n\nThe truth is i am extremely uncomfortable looking at these parades, with scantily clad feminine men. Especially with all the stories about young boys dressing up like girls at these things i just think it would remind me of my cousin raping me while i was dressed like a girl. But i dont feel like i have to tell anyone that. AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry if I messed up anywhere, first time poster.\n\nSo, I (19M) have a friend (19FtoM,) who we’ll call Dan, that I’m really close with.  We met in junior year, a few years before his transition, and got super close really quickly.  We ended up living down the road from each other too which was cool.   He, before and after the transition, was strictly into women which was fine, I had just moved to town and wasn’t looking for a relationship.  I also wasn’t going to try and get with him or do anything that would make him uncomfortable.  Anyway, we became really close, coming to each other with all of our problems.  We hung out all the time, any chance we got, and it goes on like this until they get into any form of a relationship.  When he finds an SO, he basically drops me out of his life entirely.  Not seeing each other for months on end despite living a block down the road from each other, setting plans he knows will almost always fall through, maybe talking like once or twice every two weeks, and even canceling previously made plans to go hang out with or help his SO.  And it goes like this until he breaks up with them at which he acts like nothing happened and starts hanging with me a lot more again.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind taking the backseat.  I don’t want to come off as clingy and I get that there’s a more important person in their life, but I just feel the transition of best buds to nobody is a little jarring and unwarranted.  When I’m in a relationship, I try my best to juggle time with my SO and time with my friends.  It just seems like a proper thing to try and do.  Hell, right now, despite not being in a relationship, I go to college and work two jobs and still find time for my friends.  I don’t know though, I could be wrong and seem like a total dick right now.  I just wanted to get other people’s opinions on the matter.  Thanks for your time though.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my ex on the sidewalk after we broke up?",
      "description": "Recently I broke up with my girlfriend of about 4 months. I took her on a walk because we live fairly close together and she wanted to see me and walk the dog. I planned on ending it on her porch where she could just go inside, and I would know she was home safe, but when we got closer she saw her mom was outside smoking and she just turned around.\n\nSo we walk back further up the block and we sit down. I start explaining how I only have a three months or so before I have to leave because I’m enlisting in the Marines and she’s a year younger than me and on a completely separate path. I explained how we are delaying the inevitable and that we needed to break up. She starts freaking out. \n\nHer voice gets high pitched and nasally and she starts talking really fast. She seemed to not even think that it was even a possibility of we would end things. She starts talking about how “Oh, during WWII the men would leave and the women would stay behind and wait” and all this stuff. She wanted to do long distance and I just can’t. I explained I don’t do long distance because of trust issues I have since ex #1. She interrupts me and says “but you know I’m not like her” and all sorts of things. Anyways, I keep my ground and I’m still kind to her when we break up. \n\nThis is where things get messy.\n\nSo anyways, we get past the hard things and I ask if I can walk her and her dog home to make sure she’s okay. She said no, but I waited and let bad because she was still crying. She kept saying “I don’t understand why it has to be now” and such. I continued to keep my ground and be firm so that I wouldn’t be pressured into continuing the relationship. I ask again, and she starts throwing a tantrum. I stood up and literally begged her to let me walk her home. I said “it’s cold, your dog is shivering, please let me walk you home” and she got really upset and literally said “I’M NOT COLD. No, I’m not getting up, I’m not moving. I’m not leaving this spot.”\n\nSo after asking her multiple times and getting the same answer, I told her goodbye, “text me when you get home so I know you’re safe,”and walked home. Then I went to hang with some buddies who knew I was ending things. She ended up texting me later and told me she got home. I said “I’m glad to hear you’re home safe” and she said “it’s only because my dog was cold.” I told her I was sorry. \n\nThe next day I was gone from school for medical reasons. Anyways, while I was gone she would ask my friends about how I was doing etc, they would say good, he’s waiting for this stuff etc, and she would say “Well that’s good because his ass left me in the cold for 40 minutes.” \n\nI felt like I did everything I could in the situation except physically pick her up and carry her which would have been completely inappropriate given the context. \n\nTLDR: AITA for leaving my ex on the sidewalk because she refused to handle the breakup maturely and threw a tantrum?",

      "description": "So I have to/don't have to but it would really help you keep your promotion attend a course.\n\nThat's fine. I'm really excited for this course and it's a two day session of the one day season I had to miss out on.\n\nNow I'm in public sector and am spoilt. These types of courses can run from $150 to $2000 depending on the readings of the entrails of birds, the cost of the establishment and how swanky you want to look when the microphone inevitably breaks down to however the person running it feels like that day but I've always got the same quality for free because government.\n\nI have also personally organised a lot of training both having guest speakers in as well as attending stuff myself.\n\nAlmost all courses I have attended have been very easy to apply for, bar the high level multi month long ones, three minutes tops. They want your name and a way to contact you.\n\nThis one was very different. I had to give them my suburb, three ways to contact me as well my work history while trying to disagree a mass email list. Urgh. Worst, I had to do this multiple times as while the site looked professional it kept losing my info or forgetting that it had it or that it would ever offer to take it. I seriously had to start again via my email link because I made the mistake of pressing the back button at one stage and the site refused to acknowledge I had ever done and business with them. It didn't like my passwords and looking back on it I wonder if it was a phishing scam. Luckily at the time I was getting too frustrated at the fact that it turned a three minute process into 20+ minutes. It even wanted me to give a password when I would literally never use the account again and did some variations of Abc123 and Password1. \n\nI *finally* finished registering and was salty at the website design as well as the dietary preferences being either \"vegetarian\" or \"gluten free\" (anyone who is vegan, follows religious diets or has any non-gluten allergy or intolerance or medically needed diet can apparently go hang).\n\nI'm finally done!\n\n...and now it's asking for my back details!?\n\nThis had been labelled as free, both on the flyer and the website. No mention of cash. Great, one more intrusive question? Oh, it says \"$0\". Maybe I gave to register this way because some people will be paying? Cool, I'm gonna fudge it. Bugger them.\n\nNo, wait! Down below there's a \"$5.00\" fee! No, sorry, a donation.\n\nI don't want to pay it. Everything up unto this point says that this was free. I click delete. If it makes sense this course isn't set up like a normal course but like a store where you collect the course and the donation into your cart.\n\nFine! I'll pay! I'm so upset. I'm very much struggling for money at the moment and the donation has a mandatory minimum of $5.00. I only have $5.49 left in my overdraft.\n\nFinally, after some Voodoo magic on the next page, get out of it as it tries to send me off to PayPal. I'm guessing they're legally required to offer you an out if they say it's free but can make it difficult to opt out?\n\nKnowing the background I ask you if I'm the arsehole or not?\n\nOn one hand they are providing me a course that could cost $$$$ and yet for me is basically free. They're also providing a free meal to the majority of us. It isn't their problem that our family is struggling at the moment. They're human beings who have to eat. It isn't a mandatory training session either. And they're not asking for full price but a token amount that seems insulting not to give.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't like been forced and tricked into something that pretends to be voluntary and the way they asked for money really got up my nose. And I believe that something is either free or not. I've declined to seek scholarships when I haven't needed them to make sure others have access to education they may not have otherwise and have walked out of a store with an item and walked in again to pay for it (we had such a big shop moving into the new place so that I had so much stuff in the five minute conversation with the check out chick all three of us forgot the massive broom under my arm) and paying for something is not the issue. If it were upfront about the money I probably would have either paid it, waited for pay day, worked something out with my husband, gone to the savings jar and paid my friend in cash to buy the donation or called up my friend that owes me some money to wire it to me or fessed up about my finance troubles to my boss. Not proud but not ashamed either. Just stressed. But it wasn't upfront.\n\nThe fact that the website was dodgy and invasive, the fact that I don't actually know where the donation was going to (the people running it or a side charity or some extra for their slush fund to help clients?) and the fact that five dollars is a token amount and will unlikely stop people from paying rent are contributing factors but not the main reasons for not paying.\n\nThank you for the long read. I often go through after I've posted and edit my spelling because I'm on a mobile that loves its auto-correct even if you tell it off and it's easier for me to read if it's not in a tiny box. I won't do that here though because I think there are rules for editing so please forgive my typos.\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "About 5 years ago my sister broker up with her boyfriend and I moved into her flat with her, since then we have both paid equal rent and shared all the bills. However I’ve never felt comfortable at home as she questions everything I do and I can never relax. For example she came in my room screaming at me because she didn’t feel like the amount of items I had in the dryer warranted enough to use it. This is just a tiny example that extends to anything I do.  \n\nI feel like the problems stems from her thinking it’s her flat rather than ours. \n\nAnyway I let her know that I was moving out and have her roughly a month and a half notice and my entire family has come down on me calling me selfish and made me feel like shit. \n\nJust for some context, the city we rent in is 3 miles from her work and 40 miles from mine. It isn’t even my home town as my parents live a further 50 miles in the opposite direction so it feels like the only reason I’m here is to appease her. \n\nTo add to this she told me she wanted to move out on her own around 6 months ago and all my family backed her just as I did.. until that fell through and I agreed to further our tenancy. Now the shoe is on the other foot I’m the monster because she can’t afford that place on her own and I’m forcing her to find a new place to live. \n\nSo AITA for wanting to put myself first? ",

      "description": "So to preface this, I'm pretty new to my school, I've been here about a year and a half. During this time, I have not been well liked and it never really went as far as it has now with the rumors and gossip, just normal high school drama. My boyfriend is a good guy, and is well liked, at least more than me. He is my first boyfriend too and we've been together about a month officially, but we've known eachother since I came to the school.\n\nWe were on a school bus back from a school club and I get tired pretty easily. We both take our coats off, use them as blankets, and he puts his arm around me. Later I take the coats put them on his lap and rest my head on his lap with the coats on top. The bus ride ends and we go our separate ways. The the next day and days after, his friends, some of which weren't even in our grade, teased him about that night, but neither of us really knew why, until yesterday. \n\nI was texting with a friend when she tells me that she defended me after something came up about that bus ride. Apparently the some of the kids who don't know us very well thought I was blowing him. She even told me there was a video that was circling around with the rumor. I don't know how someone got to that conclusion, but that has been going around for a week. \n\nHe and I hung out last night and I told him about it. He told me he knew about a rumor, but not the extent that the rumor had been. I was clearly very upset and he put his arm around me to comfort me. This isn't the first time I've had to deal with rumors in my school. I told him how sorry I was because I knew that this was more focused on me than him, to which he agreed. I still do feel bad because I got him involved, and I still feel like it's my fault. All he said was not to worry about it since there's nothing we can do, but let it pass. After I was more composed, he seems annoyed and I asked him why. He said that rumors in general don't really bother him, but this one did because it questioned his integrity. He didn't seem bothered at all at the fact that I was the other one involved in the rumor. He just told me to ignore it and when I did, he started mentioning his integrity and how much that bothered him. I've never seen him this upset at something before because he isn't one that cares about being liked or about rumors. \n\nI know his integrity matters to him a lot, but I can't help but feel upset because he didn't defend me at all. I feel guilty about feeling upset at him. Maybe I'm reading into things too much since this is my first relationship, but I would have liked to be defended by my boyfriend, instead of just my friends. \n\nAm I the asshole for being for being upset?",

      "description": "The life of my now ex-wife \\[F, 28\\] and me \\[M, 27\\] has been very challenging in the past few years.\n\nWe married quite early, when we were 18 &amp; 19, and moved into a our own apartment and started studying.\n\nAfter a while she started to lose the social connection within her fellow students. She faked going to courses and eventually openly didn't go anymore. We shared some mutual friends, mainly people that came from my study program (some of those are still my (best) friends today). She started to evade these social contacts too.\n\nI always found excuses for her, and this lasted for years.\n\nI knew this solution was not perfect, but what should I do? However, we had an argument about this and she made me feel bad for living my life without her. After our argument I started staying home too (except for drinking in university), played pc all day and isolated myself from my friends and family and study program. Didn't handle necessary things and soon we had rent debt of about 2k and I had to work alot to get this out oft he way which stopped my own studying for 16 months.\n\nAfter working, I finished my Bachelor thesis, and got my degree and started my Master!\n\nI started to tell friends and people around me about the situation (my mental ill wife and how I had to take care of it alone) and invited my parents and finally she/we actively started looking for a therapis. Since then, she is actively in therapy and making great progress. \n\nPart of one therapy session was to think about our relationship. She brought the topic 4 months ago and we decided that she will never be free and independent with me and that we have different life goals, so we split up consensual. It took me a bit of time to tell my friends, and despite being clear that this is the right decision, it took me my own traumatic event to reflect this and realize, how all this afflicted me all those years and how it nearly killed my personality and restricted my happiness / life. \n\nSince that moment I started to avoid home (so she has freedom and because I want freedom, too). I made a to-do list which includes telling my parents, organizing money (for \\*both\\* of us so she will be able to afford the apartment and moving out as fast as I can. I work really hard to get my list done and can't wait to finally move out. She dislikes that I am so fast and enthusiastic about it and feels betrayed by me and that she needs more time. Her dog (living at her mother which she didn't visit for years, too) died last year, but she just heard about it a few weeks ago, and she starts to attempt a measure to get back in work life right now, which is really tough for her. But despite moving out, I will totally support her and help her when she needs me - she just has to \"come to me\" and I will not try to solve her problems anymore by default. \n\nAm I the asshole for the timing and the fact, that is want it all and I want it now?",

      "description": "Hey there, this is a throw away account because i know the guys involved frequent reddit and have occasionally referenced this subreddit.\n\nI am currently in university and myself and my group of friends were all pretty interested in starting a DnD campaign, none of them have any kind of experience, and i only have 2 campaigns under my belt, so i volunteered to be the DM because no one else had any idea of what to do. After some initial plans we all got excited to give it a try.\n\nAfter a week or so of planning a couple of our other friends heard of our plans and also became interested, one of them (We will call Fred)  it turns out was an experienced DnD player and was a frequent DM before university and was very keen on running this campaign, and since i only took the position out of necessity people were fine with this change, but this is where the issue is.\n\nThe only issue is Fred's girlfriend, they are both living together at the time but she has a host of mental health issues and is basically dependant on him, she frequently has break downs and requires him to be with her. I'm not here to comment on the relationship or her,  but to portray how serious it can be, he usually misses 30-50% of all of his lectures at the university because she needs him to stay at the house. 9 times out of 10 any social plans he has been invited to will usually result in a message on the chat that he 'can't make it'.\n\nThe plans for this campaign were to have a weekly session lasting 4-5 hours, but i knew that would be extremely problematic, with how erratic his girlfriend can be, there was simply no conceivable way we could possibly plan a day in advance and there were a very strong chance any agreed upon days would have the DM unable to come, let alone remain the entire time.\n\nEventually i talk to my friends (and not Fred at this time) and simply said, because of his personal life, there will NOT be a campaign if he is the one DMing it, reluctantly the others agreed and i was put in the DM position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually he found out and when we ran into each other on campus he stopped me and said that i was being quite rude to him and that ''if i wanted to DM that badly i should have just said'' unfortunately i couldn't really give an honest answer because he can be extremely touchy about his girlfriend, and all i could say was that it'd be really difficult to schedule things and this is how it turned out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sort of just shook his head at me and left, and he has been quite silent on the group chat since.\n\nSo reddit, am i an asshole?",

      "description": "So for context: I am 25 years old male and live in Germany. I met my friend (24, male (let's call him Brian)) at school in 2010 and we've been hanging out together regularly ever since. I would pretty much consider myself as a very emotional, caring person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, everything was great until we got our A-Levels. We would still hang out a lot but it wasn't like the time we've been hanging out at school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into lots of arguments, as most of people in friendships do, which is very normal to me. I always approached him with what I didn't like and vice versa. The problem here is that I was always trying my best to not hurt him and avoid the things that would annoy him. He wouldn't do the same for me. He would try to provoke me every now and then even though he knew that certain things hurt me. I confronted him with this and he said that he's sorry and that he would stop it. He didn't. I learned to ignore it so it was fine after a while.  \n\n\nHe told me, that he really wanted to try weed at one point. I said that it's his decision but I advised him to thoroughly consider trying it in first place but also be careful where to get it from. So, one day he would invite 2 friends he met on the internet via online gaming to a sleepover LAN party. I got invited but I didn't really want to go at that point. So at the day, I was with another friend and he said 'How's Brian doing and I said that he was fine. He really wanted to see Brian so we called and asked if it was fine when we joined and he said he'd love us to come over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrive there and he's wasted af. The other 2 guys are listening to music VERY loudly while he is there lying on the couch looking really horrible. I'm concerned about him and ask what happened. He tells me that he tried weed and he feels miserable. After finding out that he hadn't eaten anything that day I decide to go to the kitchen and cook something for him as the other guys seemingly don't care. After that, I tell him to rest and the other guys to be quieter so that he can rest. We haven't talked about this day ever since, he didn't even say thanks for being there for me or anything like that.  \n\n\nOne day, I asked him about doing sports together. He is a good looking, athletic guy while I am overweight and have anxiety issues. I told him that it would boost my motivation if he went to the gym with me. He said that he didn't like gyms that much and didn't want to go. That was completely fine by me as I can't force anyone into anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, we would meet with 2 other guys (also met via online gaming) and have a nice time together. One of them proceeds to ask Brian if he wanted to join them doing sports at the gym and Brian immediately says yes. I'm obviously a little confused because our conversation about gyms was not that long ago. He looks me in the eye while agreeing and doesn't even ask me if I wanted to join as well. I'm really hurt but manage to forget it.  \n\n\nRecently, I asked him about something I wanted to buy and he told me that he knows someone who would get discounts and that he could ask them if I want. I agree. After one week of messaging him and him leaving my messages on read but not answering I decide to tell him that I don't want the discount anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really pissed because of the fact that all the time it was me trying to keep the friendship alive and to maintain contact. He would never message me on his own. All the times I confronted him with things that go wrong he would always reply with the same things, almost like a playback. I felt replaced.  \n\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I decided that I would act like him and not contact him anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole because I can't take this shit anymore and don't want to be hurt anymore?",

      "description": "Happened earlier today. So this weekend has been a shit show. My (21M) sister (18F)  and her abusive boyfriend (21M) broke up on Saturday, they lived together at his house. She is extremely fragile and last time this guy broke up with her, she had a complete mental breakdown and was admitted to the hospital for a suicide attempt. \n\nI got everything sorted and she's moving back in with our parents right now, which is the best for everyone. Thing is, they live in a different country 1700 miles away. This is a HUGE logistical problem but not unsolvable.\n\nQue my situation. In the middle of all this I get a couple hours off at my place. My friend and roommate is headed over to our buddies place to shower (renos, water is shut off). He drives us over (a 2min drive, he's super close). I mention may need a ride home early as my sister is a huge, unstable, and potentially dangerous situation. He's totally cool and I even mention if it's a hassle I can walk back. \n\nAnyways, after barely seeing them as Im on the phone constantly, I need to head back. He drives me back, but on the way starts to mention that if my sister needs to store stuff at our house I need to clear it with our other three roommates (and friends). I say look, I get it but right now we aren't even there yet, and I have MUCH bigger fish to fry right now. \n\nMy sister was at an extremely unstable state and at any moment could dissociate from reality and become suicidal. I hadnt slept in 36 hours because I had to make sure my sister didnt leave my sight while sleeping (has happened before). I am immediately responsible for her safety and every word I say to her could potentially send her spiralling. In these past few days, every time I say goodbye to my sister it may be the last time I see her if I dont catch the panic attack in time. Oh, and I had to rack up $800 on my CC to make this whole rescue happen.  So, Im tense. And he knows the situation. \n\nHe keeps insisting. I say look, at the absolute worst it's stuff that stays in my room for a few days and maybe a car parked down the street. No one is inconvenienced, and look Ive had the second worst couple days of my life and right now I cant be thinking of that right now. He keeps saying the same thing over and over. \n\n\"Look man, Im doing you a favour driving you home you need to listen to me.\"\n\nI get progressively more angry before I tell him to shut the fuck up after about the 5th time he's said the same thing and ignoring my request to drop the topic for just the time being. He puts the car in park, kicks me out and makes me walk the half block to our place. \n\nAITA here?? I wasnt angry at all in tone initially, only that I just dont have the capacity to deal with that right now given the situation. And if you're wondering, I absolutely agree in that if I needed to store stuff say in common areas, I would ask everyone if they were okay. Hell, HE was okay with it but so insistent on confirming with everyone else on a hypothetical that didnt even end up happening, and even if it did wouldn't affect anybody. \n\nTL;DR Good friend and roommate ignored my request to drop a topic in the middle of an absolute hell of a day dealing with a suicidal (and freshly homeless) younger sister. After he wouldn't stop, I lost my cool and told him to STFU. AITA?",

      "description": "So long story short. I hired a mutual friend for a job at a place that I worked. She was a mutual friend of my sister in law. So six of us would hang out (me, my SO, my SO brother, his wife , friend A and her husband (friend B)\n\nI hired friend A for a job where I worked as the manager. After I quit I still did some side accounting work for the company. I starting seeing that Friend A was giving out things like free rent when it benefited her.  I brought this up to the owner and he had a talk with her. She deleted the free rent so we let it go as a mistake. A few weeks later I notice the free rent back on the account. I then asked her personally about it and she blamed the other girl that worked there, even though the other girl didn’t work on the days this was done.\n\nFast forward a few months and my brother gets hired. She started telling people my brother was selling drugs (completely not true) and when the owner heard this he called a meeting and no one backed her claim of this. So the owner fired her.\n\nSo now the Sister in law has a grudge against me because her friend got fired. The problem is my SO and his brothers household live so close to each other where everyone walks to each others house through our backyards\n\nAt family gatherings sister in law treats me like shit by getting mad when people sit next to me, won’t\nLet her husband text me back even if it’s family related blah blah.\n\n\nSo today mother in law and father In law are In town. Brother and sister In law, friend A and husband walk over to mine and my SO house.  I ask brother in law “why are you guys fucking here when none of you like me?” He says we are only saying hi and then we are leaving. I say “ say your hellos and go”. Then my SO tells everyone to go. No one really listens and they keep talking. So he gets upset and starts yelling. Friend B walks into my garage after my SO and I tell him “you said your hellos and now you all need to leave”\n\nAITA for even starting all of this? Should I have let these people just come to my house even when it’s been clear we aren’t on good terms and they’ve sided with friend A and her bullshit lies? I mean when friend A got fired her husband even came to the work and yelled in my face.  Should I have just let it go and allowed them to say their hellos and not had a problem with it?",

However last year my family was taking a trip to Disney for a weekend. It was the first time my nephews were going and in an attempt to be a good uncle I obviously went and I can’t say it was all terrible. The kids had a great time and even though I was too nervous for most of the rides there was still plenty to see since I hadn’t been since I was a child and Harry Potter stuff was really cool as someone who grew up on it but it was so crowded I had to leave several times just to calm down. \n\nNow recently they decided to go again just barely more than a year after and this time they want to go for almost 10 whole days. I told them I didn’t think I could do that again so soon especially for that long. Maybe in a few years I could do it again when I’m in a better spot financially or found a more effective medication for me. \n\nThis leads to the current issue of my mother just spending weeks telling me I should go and trying to make me feel terrible for not wanting to spend time with my nephews and just recently my brother has begun messaging me constantly and even after me trying to explain why I don’t want to go he started saying he was buying my a plane ticket and going to force me to go to the point where I disabled notifications from him. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to go on a family trip?",

      "description": "I have been with my boyfriend (30M) almost for 2 years. He has 2 children  (9 &amp;11) from his previous marriage. He recently moved out of his apartment and lives in a camper which causes him to see his kids less often, at least twice a week. I love his kids, even though I have no desire to have any of my own. I have taken them out and do crafts and interact with them when I see them. My birthday is in a few days and I turn 21. They are all coming to by birthday party this weekend and I plan on not drinking because of it. I had scheduled a dinner for me and my boyfriend  at Benihaha during the week. He and his kids have never been there. I told him about it and said he will have his kids that day and to add them so I did. I didn't see the harm in asking my boyfriend once again today if it could just be me and him because thats what I want to do for my birthday. There was no ill intent on my behalf in asking the question. He then proceeded to tell me that he feels that I don't care about his children, that I'm being inconsiderate, he feels like I'm trying to get him to abandon the kids and it's making him rethink us. He called me and asked for an apology. I honestly don't know what I'm apologizing for. I called and asked if he wanted me to apologize for asking a question or for hurting his feelings, which I know is immature on my end but I'm genuinely at a loss. Everyone I have asked so far has told me not to apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- I asked my boyfriend if it was okay if me and him, not the kids, got dinner for my birthday.",

      "description": "So, to start things off, I have ASD, which makes feelings hard to grasp for me. Also, I am considered fairly attractive by many people, including platonic friends, though I don't really get how myself, and as such I get a fair amount of looks from girls. \n\nEnough humblebragging though, my problem with girls has always been that I never pursue them, even when there is mutual attraction, or even feelings for each other. I don't know why I do this, though if I'd guess, it would be laziness mixed with depression and some deep seated insecurities. \n\nIt's always the same thing, I meet a girl, we hang out, things develop, and then I either pull away, or just give up. I feel like an asshole, because I can never give them a decent answer, since I'm terrible with expressing myself, and I don't even know why myself, really. My friends have had to call me out, because when I get nervous I stop putting in any effort, and usually let things die off.\n\nI don't want this to happen, especially when there is mutual feelings/attraction, but I always end up doing this, and in some cases, I've stringed girls along for months, in one case a full year because I don't know how to go any further than flirting. To everyone else, I'm either seen as callous, or just like having girls around for my ego, and I'm starting to wonder if they're right.\n\nAm I the asshole for not putting in the effort with girls, which usually ends up with us cutting contact, or me leading them on.

      "description": "Hi all. \n\nI’m 21F. My neighbors are in their 40s. \n\nThey went away for 8 days, and have asked me to take care of their dogs. It’s day 3, and so far I’ve been feeding them morning and night, letting them out twice a day for about half an hour (they’re unable to go for walks for various reasons), and changing the sick dog’s diaper three times a day.  I have to stop by at 8:30 am, sometime between 1-3 pm, another between 5-6 , and then again before I go to sleep. \n\nTo put it bluntly, their house smells like urine. The dogs don’t pee in the house so idk what it is. But it’s so bad that when I left there and went to get lunch with my friend, she said I smelled. It makes me sick but I still try to spend at least 45 minutes there a day besides just quick drop ins so the dogs aren’t lonely. \n\n. I also have a job and I don’t currently drive (car trouble), so I bus there and back to get to them, get to work, get to the gym, get back to them, etc. I’m also taking out their trash, taking in their mail, and have been cleaning the dog’s dishes and the Tupperware their premade food is in. \n\nMy mother, who is moderately close with them, told me today that if they offer me money for this I need to decline it. She said she will be ENRAGED if I accept money and it will be inappropriate, rude, etc. \n\nI feel like I did a constant service for them, and should be paid for it. Obviously if they try to give me a ridiculous amount of money I’ll say no, but I’m watching the dogs for 8 days. I’m structuring over a week of my life around them. I should also note that I’ve worked as a “professional” dog walker/sitter before. I know what those rates are, and I’m fine with accepting $75 and calling it a night. \n\nMy mom says it’s not okay, and that if we ever needed anything from them they wouldn’t charge us. I get the sentiment. But there’s doing favors and then getting taken advantage of. If they needed me for a day or two it would be different. Our neighbors are very nice and once they drove me to work once last year, and they always say they’re here if we neeed anything. I totally get it and it’s nice. But tbh, if we asked this of them and didn’t pay them, I’d consider it really unfair. \n\nI just don’t know what to do and now I feel guilty. \n\nAITA: I want to accept payment for a service I’m providing to a neighbor.

The main issue up to this point was that he was untrustworthy and everytime I had a crush, he would tell them, and get upset when I was angry.\n\nPartway through the year, he suddenly became extremely clingy, only letting me talk to some people and telling me that I had to end friendships that he didn't approve of. This was the first thing that made me super mad.\n\nLater in the year, he came out as pansexual, and everything was fine for awhile, but soon enough,he started causing trouble in the friend group, and soon enough, most of them (there were 5 of us) started disliking him and avoiding him.\n\nThen, things got awkward and he started getting worse. He was obviously hitting on me even when I told him to stop. He wouldn't give up, and even made me go to the school counselor to force me to have a sleepover with him. The entire sleepover, he kept rubbing up against me and I kept telling him to stop but he wouldn't. He finally stopped when he forced me to put on Cars to watch though.\n\nAlso throughout the year, he kept threatening me to do things and I stopped responding to texts. At one point, I told him that I couldn't talk because I was at a family party, and he sent 5 texts that just said \"f**k you\" (except uncensored).\n\nEveryone from the friend group was telling me to get away from him, so in the summer I stopped talking to him and blocked him. When school started in 9th grade, he tried talking to me the first week and then gave up.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\ntl;dr: Middle school friend became clingy and started hitting on me despite telling him not to (because I wasn't homosexual), along with other toxic actions so I stopped our friendship and cut him off.",

I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough.

      "description": "This is kind of an ‘are we the asshole’ since my fiancé and I are in total agreement about wanting to elope, neither one of us had to push or persuade the other into this.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I got engaged a year ago. We’ve been together since meeting at university abroad, and now live in a completely different country to either of our home countries, or where we went to school. It was never our initial plan to elope, but it became very clear quite quickly that having the wedding in either one of our home countries completely excluded whichever family who weren’t ‘home’ from the whole experience for a number of factors (low incomes, large family units, flights either with young kids or hours in a car either way). We’re not rich by any means, meaning that we couldn’t afford to fly/transport and put up parents, siblings, aunts and uncles and whoever else would be coming. Neither one of us wanted to try and rank who (we’re not traditionalists by any means, so weren’t going to go with the whole ‘bride’s family pays for everything’ trope common in both our home nations), but we knew that if push came to shove we’d have to decide soon which country to go with. Another thing to factor in was that we had many friends in our university country, which is in a completely different continent to where we are now, and expensive to get from and to at the best of times.\n\nOnto money again, and since the proposal we’ve been worrying about the cost of the wedding day itself. Again, neither of us are traditional in the slightest, so we didn’t need or want a big white wedding in a church followed by an evening with a silver service meal and a big cake. This is however, the ‘done thing’, so started scrimping and saving to prepare for wherever we’d end up. Ever since the engagement announcement, we’d both been getting ‘advice’ from our families about what to do and not do, and how many seats we’d need for family alone - it got up to 100 seats each side before we started to think that this might not be possible in the next few years at least. We obviously don’t have 100 people each in our close families - we both come from a nuclear family of mother, father and siblings, so this included cousins and their families, the families of random step-uncles/aunts who we’d never even met, and the people who were ‘basically family’ and their real families.\n\nWe spent an extended break in my fiancé’s home city in November, and had to explain when asked numerous times about the wedding and ‘save the date’ that we were not even sure which country we were going to end up having the wedding in. My fiancé’s brother suggested that, if we wanted to, we get married in our current country whenever we wanted in the near future, and then just celebrate the marriage whenever we were next in our home countries, or our university country. This is something that appealed to us greatly - we live in our current country firstly because we love the country before anything else; if we were honest with ourselves from the start, we’d be happy to just go to our favourite national park with a witness and an officiant, say ‘I do’, and sign on the dotted line. The only reason we’d been talking about getting married elsewhere was solely in the interests of our families. \n\nWe started dropping hints to both sides of the family that we wouldn’t be against scheduling our time around a period when both sets of parents and as many siblings as possible (I have a brother, my fiancé has two brothers and a sister) could get out to us, and then we could just go to the equivalent of a registry office, become married on paper, then go up into the hills and celebrate. Our only rule was an ‘all or nothing’ regarding our parents (our siblings are all adults who live away from home, with many having their own partners and kids, so we’d understand if they couldn’t come from the get go) - we weren’t going to have a situation where my fiancé’s parents watched him get married but my parents couldn’t watch me, or vice versa. This is something that was initially accepted by everyone, with a couple of grumbles about *‘what will I say when \\[Great Aunt/Uncle/Cousin\\]* *asks about the wedding?’* thrown in.\n\nWe didn’t impose a cut-off, but everyone knows we want to get married sooner rather than later, preferably within the next year. It’s now become clear that it’ll be very unlikely for both sides of the immediate family to be able to get to us at the same time for a reasonable cost. Both sets of parents have of course said that they’d spend whatever to get to us, but on one weekend when my fiancé’s parents can make it for a reasonable price my mother is working on the Saturday morning and Sunday evening and the cost of flights is in the high hundreds, and another when my parents could make it it’s Fiancé’s Great Auntie’s 95th birthday and so his parents are occupied. Basically, it’s not easy. The more we talk, the more we just want to get married, family or no family.\n\nOf course we get that our families might be hurt by not being there on the day itself, whenever it might be, but no one on either side will cut anyone off or go loco. As previously said, we’d be happy to have a set of parties or celebrations in our home countries when we had the chance, so it’s not something we’re doing out of spite. Are we asses for just wanting to get married as soon as we can?",

      "description": "Throwaway because I don't want to risk getting identified by people i know who use reddit. Last year my dad discovered that mom had been cheating on him with one of his close friends. The only reason he found out is because his friend's wife snooped through her husband's phone and found old convos between him and my mom. my dad was hurt and devastated like i'd never seen before and that affected me deeply. she had been cheating for almost a year apparently and in the months leading up to them being found out my dad's friend was trying to break the affair off. This explained a lot of things that were going on at home. My mom had been acting very aggressive and was extremely unpleasant to be around during this time. she said some very hurtful things to me due to my appearance (i am overweight), me going to community college because i couldn't get into a decent uni and my lack of friends/social life. \n\nMy dad kicked her out of the house not long after the initial shitstorm. Mom went to live with my aunt and she's been there ever since, but yesterday she called dad and told him that she needed a place to stay because her sister was going to move and wants mom to get her own place. She said that she can't afford an apartment right now and that she wanted to come live with us again. My dad told me right off the bat that he had no desire to live with mom again but that he wouldn't keep us separated if i wanted her with us again. \n\nI haven't spoken to my mom since the day she moved out. She sends me texts every now and then but they're always ridiculously long and I rarely read them and I've only replied a few times. To be honest I am still very hurt due to how she treated dad and how much she hurt him by betraying his trust. I am still very angry at how she took it out on me and dad when her affair was going sour. I am still very angry at how depressed and anxious i felt because i thought that there was something wrong with me, that i was making her unhappy and that's why she was constantly attacking me and putting me down. i don't think i can ever forgive her for the way she treated us because the man she was fucking  wanted to end things and she didn't.\n\ni told dad right away that i didn't want her anywhere near the house again. that i wasn't ready to be around her again. \n\nbut last night i had a lot of trouble sleeping. i feel guilty and petty for saying no, and it makes me fucking angry that i even feel this way because i truly do not want to see her again. i hate feeling responsible for what happens to her. I am dreading having to work today while feeling like this. \n\ndo you think i am taking things too far by telling dad not to let her live here again?",

      "description": "This probably happened about a month ago.\n\nI am a 17 year old male working minimum wage at a fast food place. About a month ago I had a severe pain coming from my lower back on both sides of my body. I am not very physically fit. Probably 210 Lbs and 6ft with - i admit- a poor diet that has soda involved. My mind instantly went to some form of kidney failure or other serious problem.\n\nNormally I would tough them out. The pain wasn’t crippling. However, they lasted for well over 4 hours.\n\nNearing the fourth hour was when I decided I should go to the hospital. Before I did, however, I called my father. I wanted to make sure it was ok with him. I am old enough to know the hospital is expensive and I didn’t know if we had enough money to pay for it. We are middle class, maybe middle upper but both of my parents have debt from school. I didn’t want to add on if the bill was going to be astronomical.\n\nSo I called my father to make sure it was ok to go. He answered even though it was so late because he was taking care of my infant brother since he had woken up in the middle of the night. I told him the situation and he was rather indifferent if I went to the hospital or not.\n\nI went, found out I had an infection in my kidneys and they sent me home with a prescription for some medicine.\n\nNow this part of the story happened tonight. I had just got off of work and my father told me that the bill for the trip had come. Both my father and my stepmother have been talking about the bill for the past month. About how it’s going to be expensive and how they both feel it was unnecessary to go to the hospital. It made me feel guilty because i didn’t want them to have to pay for something so expensive because of me. This is where my father had now informed me that the cost of the bill was going to roughly cost $2100.\n\nHe also informed me that I had to pay it.\n\nI was taken aback. While I fully understand my parents aren’t rich, neither am I. I have $1450 saved for a car (per my parents request) that i save money to buy one. I make roughly $200 a check and put $150 of it away each check.\n\nHere’s the question\nAITA For feeling like I shouldn’t be the one paying this check? Or should I feel like I should pay it?",

      "description": "More like Are We TA.  My husband and I are not in the habit of exchanging gifts for birthdays or holidays so it didn't even occur to us to send gifts until we received gifts.\n\nHusband and I welcomed our first child last year.  We didn't reveal the baby's sex until after she was born.  About 2 months later we receive a box in the mail from my husband's brother and wife containing gifts for our daughter. Although the gift box was marked as from their family, my husband said it's most likely something the wife/our SIL took the initiative on.  Nothing unusual there.  My husband thanked his brother over text and we moved on.\n\nTwo months after Christmas we get another box in the mail, again from husband's brother and his wife with more gifts for our daughter along with a holiday photocard thing of their youngest child.  Husband thanked his brother again and at that point I asked if we should be sending reciprocate gifts for their kids. He didn't say yes or no one way or the other.  I think at most he just shrugged and said, \"Dunno.\"  I asked him the same thing again a few weeks later and he responded the same way.  There is a history of gift-grabby and highly materialistic behavior from SIL (like planning multiple baby showers for each of her kids).  Since my husband knows his brother's wife better than me I'm inclined to let him take the lead on the gift giving front.\n\nAre we the assholes here for not sending something back?  We didn't send anything for their youngest kid, either, after he was born.  BIL and SIL have 6 kids aged ranging from toddler to teenaged.  I've only met them (BIL, SIL, and the kids) once at our wedding and have no idea what the kids' tastes are.  They live almost clear across the country so the chances of us getting to know each other to any meaningful degree is pretty low.  If we send anything, I'd rather send a check -- maybe $50-100??? -- written out to each of them individually because I think that's just way more practical.  Especially for the older kids since something I pick out may not even be to their taste.  Plus, SIL is very particular about how her kids dress and the interests they partake in and money--if we do choose to send something--seems to be the least likely to offend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We are in a communication loop about an issue with his new female friends. This was supposed to be temporary living situation until he’s able to move closer.. he took a job at a restaurant and immediately started hanging with all of the 20-23 year old girls that work there and is out almost every night. He insists it’s normal to have friends that are girls and would care if I was out with guys. Some nights he crashes on couches and his phone is dead. He thinks that when I get upset it’s out of insecurity and that I’m projecting it onto the situation. When he’s visited me, his phone is going off with texts from them all.. To me it’s really more about seeing red flags in a partner than it is about trusting him.. I’m over having a bf that’s at the bar every night and I feel it’s normal to express that it’s frustrating me, but all he hears is me getting upset when he’s out with “friends”. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting because of his constant shutting down my feelings. I don’t like how we are communicating about it. ",

A lot of my classmates have been asking for rides but when I inquire about gas money they feel as if I’m being greedy since I don’t make payments or pay for insurance paying a bit extra for gas shouldn’t be a problem. Now I sympathize with them because due to budget constraints the school no longer provides transportation for students who live within 3 miles of the school. This means that some kids will walk this distance sometimes in single digit temperatures. That being said I’m often asked to go to someone’s house that is in the complete opposite direction of where I’m going and expected to do so without compensation. I’m taking time and using gas so I feel as if I should be compensated. If this was a friend then it’d be a different story but it’s usually complete strangers asking.

      "description": "My husband is very ambitious. He works hard at his job and always has a side project or 5. He's also an introvert and is most fulfilled when he is plugging away at little projects by himself. Right now, his big undertaking is starting a business with a friend of his. They generally meet 3 times a week before work (he'll leave at like 5:30) and have a code jam like one Saturday a month (they stay up real late).\n\nHere's the thing: we have two children under two years old. I'm a stay at home parent and I'm starting to feel burnt out and alone. In my mind, if he can wake up early to go to those meetings, he can wake up early and do the dishes or just go to work early so he can be home to help with dinner. I tried telling him this before, but he said he needs that time to feel human because he's an introvert and it's only ~4.5 hours a week anyhow. \n\nI don't want to be insensitive to his needs, but I don't know if he realizes how much I'm drowning. I would *love* 4.5 hours a week to work on fulfilling projects, but even if I got 4.5 hours away from the kids, it would have to be spent catching up on stuff around the house. Either way, I don't get that time. Every weekend, he claims I'll get it or I can take it any time I want, but it just never happens. He has also offered to hire a part time nanny or housecleaning service. I guess that might make things easier, but I don't know, I just want him. I don't want to further remove myself from my family. \n\nAnyway, would I be the asshole if I asked my husband to put a pause on the morning meetings (or lessen them to once a week) until our younger daughter is sleeping 6 hours straight or 3 months, whichever comes first?

      "description": "Background info: I'll be referring to the friend as James (fake name), though in all honesty, he isn't really a friend. He's in my social circle but he's a lot closer to my other friends than me. James is a pretty cocky and arrogant guy. For this reason, he talks about sex a lot even when it's not relevant. Could be because he's taking a high dose of testosterone. He also puffs up around our other male friends with bro talk and shit. I suspect this is because he wants to be seen as \"one of the guys\". It's lowkey annoying because I'm a girl and he objectifies women a lot while trying to appear masculine.\n\nThe other day, I was talking about one of my depressive episodes and he interjected.\n\nJames: \"Yeah I get where you're coming from, whenever I think about not having a cis dick I feel like killing myself.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah that sucks...\"\n\nJames: \"I literally can't wait to get a phalloplasty so I can piss with all the other guys. Oh and the fun stuff obviously. I'm gonna make mine 8 inches.\"\n\nHe continued in this vein and just completely derailed what I was talking about in the first place. It really pissed me off.\n\nLater on James started talking about his girlfriend. At first it was normal relationship talk but then it degraded to how he likes her to \"choke on his dick\" and how he wished he could feel it (he wears a dildo basically) and how there's a possibility that he'll be able to cum in his gf's mouth after his phalloplasty (I don't know how, I wasn't paying attention really) and I just snapped. I told him to please stop talking about his dick for two fucking seconds. Anyway things got really cold between us after that and another friend told me I was being a transphobic asshole because James has bad gender dysphoria and talking about his future dick alleviates it. \n\nI do feel bad for James for constantly having to deal with a body he hates. I'm bisexual so I know what it's like for people who have no idea what you're going through to tell you to stop talking about your personal struggles. But I think James was going overboard with his constant dick-talk. I mean, I don't talk about how I want a pretty girl to rail me unless someone asks. Still feel bad. Am I the asshole?",

This summer we broke up for a couple of months. We got back together towards the end of July. Not long after we had got back together I visited a 2 very good friends of mine (I had known the guy since I was 13) and they gave me a wedding invitation for next summer in Ibiza (we live in the UK). I took it back home and my girlfriend noticed it didn't have a +1 on it. I assumed it was just because we weren't together when they had been planning venues/making the invitiations and they had already made it before we got back together and they gave it me. Later on when I asked them about the +1 they said \"Sorry, we had to turn down a lot of partners – It's only a small venue and costs were a concern. When we were planning and making the invitations you weren't with anyone. What a lot of people are doing, are making a holiday out of it and going to Ibiza for a few days with their partners, and coming to the wedding without them for the day while their partners do whatever.\" \n\n  \nMy girlfriend was very upset/angry and said that if one of her best friends had a wedding and didn't invite me then she'd be very upset with them, and that she wouldn't go to the wedding herself. She has since said that she's asked a lot of people and that every one has said that my friends are out of order and that I shouldn't go to their wedding myself because of it.\n\n  \nAITA for wanting to go to the wedding without her? I said we could make a holiday out of it like a lot of the other couples are, but she doesn't want to do that.\n\n  \nIf there are any other details/information you think is important to decide, just let me know. \n\n  \nThanks.

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING: obviously theres going to be some nsfw here.\n\nF: Freind\nB: friends boyfriend\nHR: me \n\nTL/DR: My friend told me her boyfriend and her age play. When I learned this I physically gagged, and she looked hurt. On a side note, my dad is in jail for sexually assaulting a 16 year old and she knows it's a sensitive subject for me.\n\nLong story:\n\nBackstory: back in 2013 my real dad was arrested for sexual assaulting a minor (also my third cousin). He is going on parole in late 2019 and I've told my close friends this (including F) and they understand it's a sensitive matter for me.\n\nMe and F have been friends for years, and with us both being 16 (sophomores in high school) we have a decent amount of classes together. We are very close and open with eachother. During some classes we able to just sit down and talk, and lunch also. She often tells me about her and her boyfriend, but she kind of talks about her sex life too often. She talks about it constantly, and in explicit detail, but normally it's normal stuff, like bdsm or her daddy kink. I kind of found this weird, but I just figured it was her teenage hormones and stuff. It never really bothered me. \n\nMe and B are also good friends, hes not AS open as F but you can tell it's there, B is kind of an r/neckbeard without a neck beard (bad BO, uwu anime xd, waifus, and so many bad things in his search history). Overall good and he doesnt bother me much either.\n\nWell, one day in gym we were talking while exercising. She was, of course, telling me about her sex life. She then casually mentioned to me she was into ageplay.\n\nF: \"yeah, me and my boyfriend are doing this new thing where, basically, my mental age is low and I have to obey him and be punished if I dont\"\n\nHR: *visibly disgusted* \"...um, that sounds a lot like age play.\"\n\nF: \"oh, yeah! It IS!\" \n\nThat's when I gag. I tried to hold it in, but it slipped. F looked visibly hurt, and retaliated, trying to say things like \"but OTHER girls like calling their bfs daddy!\" And stuff like that. I felt guilty for gagging, but she knows about my situation. I even tried to explain to her \"dude, you know what my dad did. I'm sorry, but I dont like it when people roleplay as kids for sexual pleasure.\" Me and her got into an argument about it and she refused to talk to me until gym was over. I kind of feel guilty about at it but at the same time I just cant fathom the idea of roleplaying as children, even if it's supposed to be a way to bond with your partner, after i saw how traumatized my cousin was. F seems ok with it now and we've dropped the argument but, again, I still kind of feel guilty. So AITA?",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. It’s been about a month since it happened and I’ve thought about it and I do feel guilty a bit, but don’t at the same time.\n\nSo me and my brother live about a 5 min walk (2 blocks at most) from a Walgreens that we usually buy things from because it’s cheap. We ran low on water, and since I bought a 24 pack last time, he went there to do the same thing. When he comes back, he hands me the receipt and as I begin to pay my half for it he tells me he took an Uber back to where we live and asked if I could also pay for part of it too. I tell him I just carry it back because of how close we are and that taking the Uber was his choice. He says that I’m basically in the wrong for this because we split everything when it comes to important stuff like this, yet if I had known he would have taken that Uber in advance then maybe I would’ve agreed to it but still argue that he wasn’t going that far away to justify it.\n\nThe conversation ends with him saying something along the lines of the next time I/we go anywhere for shopping that requires one that he wouldn’t pay his half for it. I brush it off like it’s nothing, but I feel some sort of guilt over it. I understand a 24 pack of water bottles isn’t easy to carry, but with how close we live to where we go for it I believe my argument is justified in that taking the Uber wasn’t necessary.\n\nSide note: I have no information about whether or not he has back issues or anything like this. I however do, but I have no trouble with something like this. \n\nAITA for not helping my brother out here and paying for what is suppose to be my half of this ride?",

      "description": "So it’s thanksgiving. I’m a 21 year old guy. I have an hour drive up to my families house. I was drinking a big iced coffee and had to pee. I figured I could hold it but it soon became apparent that I really couldn’t. So I pull over at the next exit and go into a gas station. The gas station has two single person bathrooms (I know this because they had the “occupied” lock thing on the door” and the men’s is occupied. So I wait. I’m standing there waiting for 5 minutes and in absolute agony. The whole time. The women’s is vacant and not a single woman was even near the part of the gas station with the bathrooms. So I figure that this is an emergency. They’re single use so I won’t run into a woman in there and be accused of anything. And I won’t be long. So i look around. The coast is clear and I just go in. Flip the occupied lock and pee. Wash my hands and leave. I was in there for maybe 90 seconds. But when I step out. THREE WOMEN are standing there waiting for the bathroom. They all look at me in surprise and then disgust. I get embarrassed and mumble out an apology and jump back in my car and get the hell out of there. But it’s been bothering me. I asked two of my friends and one said I did the right thing under the circumstances. But the other said it was wrong and I probably looked like a creep or a sleazeball. What do you think? ",

      "description": "We stopped dating about 4 months ago. Amicable. We took some time apart to figure ourselves out. We're now trying dating to figure out what we are, and if we're getting back together. For background: I work with our mutual friends, one of which is Frank, a very good friend of mine. Frank is a bit of a manwhore, but our swords have never crossed. One night out all together at the beginning of the breakup, he sent me a long winded text saying he has and always will put our friendship first. And, as our friend circles are so on top of each other, my Ex and I promised to keep our sex lives away from our close friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, where she gets a text at 4am from Frank. I didn't read it, but I stared at the notification for way too long. It just left a lingering feeling. Working this weekend, every small comment, every in cheek remark between my friends at work seemed like they all knew something I didn't. They would leave the room to talk, something I really didn't pay attention to before. I started prodding, and they all said they weren't aware of anything. One comment going for the \"If I did, it wouldn't be my place to say.\" Finally to Frank, who let out a \"gosh no\". I asked my ex, and she said I was going crazy. I was. I started to feel alone. I couldn't trust my coworkers and my work was starting to be effected. I was losing sleep. I was losing my mind. The past eight days had been a blur. So it mattered. It mattered because everyone was lying and thinking it was the best thing for me. People I trust for my livelihood I couldn't talk to correctly anymore. People I spend 8 hours a day with are keeping me in the dark. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo she stayed over last night, and when she fell asleep, I read their texts. I don't do this. I don't feel good about it, but I just needed an answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey did. I'm just happy to have an answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I am a teaching assistant (TA) at a division I public university. I am one of several TAs in a group where each of us lead a lab of ~30 students in a course. In November, as one of the TAs led a lab section, a student hesitantly approached him to let him know that when she used the bathroom, she saw a bomb threat scrawled on the wall. They were about halfway through class. \nThe TA chose to continue class and asked the student to please let the front desk of the building know about the bomb threat. Within minutes, police and a bomb squad swarmed the building. The threat said the bomb would explode on Veteran’s Day which was a few days away. The TA told the story to the head TA and I, the senior TA, as one big joke. He said he was annoyed with the problem when it was brought to his attention, and did not want to deal with it. \nThe entire school received an email detailing the threat, which was deemed not credible after Veteran’s Day. \nI think the TA did not handle this situation pragmatically. There were no consequences, punishments, or anything along those lines for that TA but we are now developing a protocol for how our TAs should handle potential emergencies so this doesn’t happen again. \n\nTL;DR a co-worker who is a teaching assistant was made aware of a bomb threat in the building he was teaching in and told the student who read the threat (written on a bathroom wall) to handle it and continued class. The bomb threat was eventually deemed not credible. I think he handled that irresponsibly. ",

      "description": "I took my two-year-old son to the park, and was pushing him in a swing. Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.",

      "description": "Some info: he’s fucking horrible with money. He’s worked okay jobs for 8 years now, shares an apartment with our dad which means his rent is low but he uses all his money on unhealthy foods and goods and technology and games. He has no savings, has had a wreck of a credit score once or twice plus an addiction or two. For the past year though he’s been on a path for better life style and priorities. \n\nI have worked more than 3 years a minimum wage job and have roughly 3000 in savings, I manage my expenses well and even have the money to have some fun yet these days I can manage to save up to 400euros a month. \n\nNow the situation: to get a promotion he would need a drivers license. Getting one here would mount up to 1050-1500euros all together and as I said he has no savings. He asked if I could lend him the money and he’d pay back all of it plus 300euros interest, each a month in 150euro payments. \n\nI’ve loaned him money before (last time was end of last month) and sometimes he comes through with the promised repayment schedule, sometimes he attempts to get around it claiming he’d already paid me all he owes me which leads to arguments and threats of me telling everyone what he did. \n\nA thousand euros is a lot of money. Along with all that I might leave for university in autumn which means I would like to have savings as a fallback should I not find a part time job along with studies and just to feel safe.  A part of me wants to help him and if he doesn’t pay my mom is prepared to give him hell for it but I’m scared. \n\nI told him I would think about it but I fear he will become emotionally abusive (he’s been like it before) if I don’t help him because “I’m doing so much better than him”. Fyi, he gets paid more than I do, he’s just stupid and doesn’t save money. \n\nI love him but I have very big trust issues even with myself when it comes to money. I fear that his payments will slow down or stop and for my future’s sake I can’t afford it. But 3000euros is already a lot of money considering I have a steady income, and he could really use this in order to boost his income and status at work. ",

      "description": "**Context/necessary background info**: 12th-grade English class. We sit at tables comprised of multiple desks, with five to a table. Missouri, USA. My class is overcrowded and every desk is taken, so  much as that some people have to use the computer desks built into the wall. In short, there’s no empty seats I could move to.\n\nAt my table, I sit next to M. M has some issues; I believe they have severe autism/Aspergers, but I can’t definitively confirm this. As a result, M is prone to frequent meltdowns/outbursts of crying, slamming objects on their desk, etc. Normally, I would be able to tolerate this; however, M has several other habits that have led me to being completely fed up with the situation. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n*Picking their nose, and eating it.\n\n*Picking at or chewing on their nails (which are also quite dirty)\n\n*Eating. This is made bad by the fact that they chew incredibly loud (gum-smacking, for example), which for one reason or another makes me incredibly nauseous. \n\n*Moving the contents of their desk onto others’ desks, including mine. This includes class materials, pencils, food, etc.\n\n*Noticeable BO, which also makes me quite nauseous.\n\nWhile I can’t take bearing direct witness almost every day to habits that quite honestly make me sick anymore, I do understand that they can’t really control a lot of these habits and behaviors due to their problems, which makes me feel bad for in a way calling them out on it by moving. Adding to my moral conundrum, due to the overcrowding I would have to switch seats with someone else, in effect forcing them to have to deal with this instead. \n\nReddit, WIBTA if I requested a seat change away from M?\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for two months, over which we've been sleeping either at her place or mine.\nHer parents have left on vacation for a couple of weeks so they left their cat with my GF, thus we have to spend the nights in her apartment. \nFirst night with the cat, we go to sleep but the cat is restless, jumping into the bed, walking over us. We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?",

      "description": "So I called an Uber pool to take me to a bar this evening and it said “you are sharing a ride with Andrew”. When I entered the car, I saw that the co-rider was a very young girl (about 5, probably not named Andrew). I went through the ride in silence wondering what the hell to do (if anything) until the driver dropped her off (I noted the address of her drop-off for later). I asked the driver to wait while she went inside, and she opened the screen door of the house and knocked on the door and someone let her in. I asked the driver if it was normal to pick up children and he said no this was his second time picking up a kid. I got dropped off at the bar, called Uber’s emergency and safety line and told someone what happened, then I called the city’s non-911 line and told them what happened. I got an email from Uber a short while later and they said it was against their policy for a driver to pick up a child without an adult and this could lead to the driver’s termination. I am afraid I overreacted but think this was ultimately the right thing to do because I do not believe a very young child should be in an Uber alone. I never received follow up from the police, and everything was probably fine it was just a situation which felt uncomfortable. I probably should have asked the child something to see if this was an issue but I did not say a single word to the kid. AITA for calling this in and potentially making the driver lose his job?",

      "description": "My best friend needs to find a  place to live because her lease is going to expire and  none of her current roommates are going renew or be in the area. She's an awesome person and fellow  LGBT+ and is one of the few people I would trust with my life (in fact,  she has my power of medical attorney and I'm hers so, in a sense, that  is a very literal statement).\n\nWhen she got the news we spent most of the  night concluding that the best solution  might be for her and I to split a place given my decent  income and housing aid from my University.\n\nBut the next day someone who I used to be good friends  with but am now on mixed terms with suggested that they get a place and she had tentatively accepted. This guy has no income and has shown no drive to  improve his situation.  I have tried to help him for over a year by sending him jobs and arranging interviews,  trying to get him back into school, and helping cover his expenses... With no results.\n\nHe  is currently living on someone's couch and working a minimum  wage job one day a week plus handouts. And  when he has money he generally spends it on weed, smoking three or more times a day, or on things  like a tattoo that he paid several hundred dollars for instead of paying off dept or for his driver's license to be reinstated  (he is now being sued for that dept and thinks that he does nothing then it will be fine). He  also sleeps constantly including through job interviews...\n\nHe  claims that a higher paying job is right around the corner but he's also said that in the past... Right  before he decided that he couldn't handle working more than a day and give up his apartment  in town in favor of a friend's couch (kinda screwing his former roommate). \n\nHe also regularly ignores requests to avoid topics, basically I had a traumatic experience that left me with mental scars and while I am actively in treatment some topics still trigger a panic/anxiety, and at this  point I just don't want to be around him. So having my friend live with  him would mean that I could not visit her.\n\nMy friend has issues with depression and keeping a steady work  schedule but has been on a good trajectory recently and I would hate for her to derail that. I'm worried that living with this guy would do that since even if he could pay the rent he doesn't encourage good behavior.\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to dissuade her from  this course of action and am I being selfish? I just want her to  have a stable place to live that will help her. She wants to give him a chance since she knows he wouldn't be able to get a place on his own... But neither could I.\n\nShe's my best friend and I would do  anything for her, she saved my life after I fell into depression after my girlfriend and I separated, and I hate to see her throw away a secure future for one  with someone just because she feels like he needs a chance (she's much  more of a bleeding heart than I am).",

      "description": "I work nights at my place of employment so I’m pretty much here by myself. Tonight I noticed nail clippings on the floor near my station. A coworker, who just left for the night, and I had a discussion about people abusing Slack. Slack is the main form of communication we use for office matters, so I don’t treat it like a Facebook wall. However, when we saw these clippings, and realized the gross implication of someone clipping their nails here in the office, I thought it would be funny to post the picture of the nails on Slack and pretty much say “PSA. Don’t clip your toe or finger nails in the office.” Sort of ironically “abusing” Slack in the process. It was funny at first, but now I have some regrets about publicly calling this person out. I don’t know who did it, it’s gross and definitely not something people should be doing here in an office, but at the same time I don’t like conflict and calling people out in front of everyone. One of those moments when I’m like “yeah I should’ve thought about this before I did it”. I could’ve just picked the nails up, discarded them, and leave it be. ",

      "description": "Backstory,  me and my friends arranged a game night to be the day after we arranged it.  Fast forward, the next day we were supposed to meet at night and during the day, another friend of mine reminded me about a certain school event.  I've always wanted to attend  to one but I never did because I'm shy,  but this time deep down I knew I really wanted to go and I knew i was going to regret it if I didn't go.  So, in the end, I decided  to go to the event just for a few hours, and go just before the time I was supposed  to meet my friends.  The event ended up being longer than I expected it. I lost track of time and I had really bad reception, I did not tell all of my friends I was going  to the event,  but a couple  of them knew.  In the end they were upset because I was a few hours late.  Their argument was that we did arranged our game night with a day in anticipation and they thought  I stood them up because I had other better plans.  That wasn't  the case for me, I was going to go with them but the event took longer than i expected  it,  and I was planning to meet them after. Maybe my mistake was not to tell everyone  that I was going to the event for a couple  of hours. To be honest  I was having fun,  but when I noticed they  were upset,  I felt guilty for having fun.  I already apologize to them,  but I wanna know your opinions. Am I missing something, AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Alright so I now this one is light but, I don't really have a lot of stories that would fit on here but I wanted to try this subreddit out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a few years ago I was a in my first or second year of junior high school. I'm autistic and because of that being on my IEP I had to go to a special class once a week or month to practice building my social skills and picking up non-verbal cues which used to be impossible for me to understand, with the IEP specialist.  The school is pretty old so the hallways can fit about three adults standing shoulder to shoulder before they are touching lockers. One day I'm walking down the halls to the classroom when I see three teachers standing around talking to each other. I'm a big dude standing at around 5'8\"-5'10\" at age 13. I see the teachers and I kind of tower over them and due to my autism I get a bit nervous about walking up and saying excuse me so I can go by without being rude, I even go so far as to consider walking around another hallway route which would have trippled my walk distance and made me late for class with the specialist. Then I see one of the teachers glance over at me and step back away from the as she turned her attention back on them.\n\nI take this as a sign that she is stepping back to let me pass in between them since her back is inches away from the wall and there is a spacial gap between the teachers that I can walk through without having to twist my body around to go in between them. So I walk in between them to get to my class on time which is only about 5 feet behind the teachers. As I do so and reach the door the teacher who stepped back goes \"Hey. That was rude what you did don't you think?\"\n\nMe being put on the spot like this made me extremely anxious and I went from being thankful for this person's apparent kindness to scared of accidentally misreading a social cue and upsetting someone. I panic and just go inside for my class. I'm left unbothered by the group of teachers but that moment has stuck with for the past decade. I am often told it doesn't matter when I told other people about it and I know it doesn't. I'm just curious, AITA in this instance from roughly ten years ago?",

      "title": "WIBTA for telling people that my suitemate is probably making up her illnesses for attention?",
      "description": " \n\nLet me tell you backstory about this roommate, before you jump on my case.\n\nThis suitemate, we'll call her Anne, has attention issues. She constantly needs to be the center of attention. She'll pause whenever she enters the room and waits for people to acknowledge her. She'll stand uncomfortably close to people until they acknowledge her, and will whine if people don't do as she wants. Like, physically whine. Like a dog whimpers or like some hentai ear-rape meme.\n\nShe lies, manipulates, demands attention, makes up crises, throws tantrums, has breakdowns where she claims she'll change just to get more attention then refuses later to change. She throws things when she's angry, slams doors, and locks people out. She cries loudly enough for people to hear her when she's in her bedroom, but pauses to make sure we're paying attention (I've faked leaving the living-room by letting the front door slam and then heard her go completely silent).\n\nAt one point, after another suite-mate was talking about seeking counselling for her anxiety and experience of sexual abuse by her stepdad, Anne suddenly claimed she was self-harming and abused by her family. Her family isn't abusive, (I've stayed at their house, and I know abusive parents) but rather, she's an entitled brat and claims that whenever they refuse to give her money, it's abuse. She couldn't state any specific incidents, and anything she's ever said has been a direct mirror of what other people have told in their own stories. Trust me, if they were abusive, she wouldn't be calling them every night to scream about how horrible we all are. And we've all changed in front of each-other (we've all seen her naked) so we all know she isn't actually self-harming in the areas she claimed to have done \"lots and lots of Self harm with my knife.\"\n\nAt another point, last semester, her roommate, \"Willow,\" had enough of Anne throwing things at her and locking her out when she was mad, and asked to move into the other empty bed in a different bedroom (same suite set of our 4 bedrooms and a living room). This set Anne off on a rampage, culminating in Anne literally \"accidentally\" crashing into Willow's car We say accident, but the appraisal guys for the repairs documented 3 separate points of impact and it was coincidentally on the same day that Willow had asked to move out. Also the cameras were disabled \\[which is easy to do, they can literally be unplugged\\]. She tried to use that car crash as a means to get Willow to feel sorry for her and not move out.\n\nNow, fast forward to today, and she is pulling the same crap. She's been claiming to have breathing issues, exactly like \"Liz,\" our other suitemate. Liz had contracted some sort of viral bronchitis last year that had triggered Asthmatic symptoms, and is only just now recovering. Liz has to have an inhaler, and her lungs are still not functioning at full capacity. Anne's case is conveniently happening while Liz is celebrating her steps of recovery (singing for short periods in the suite, excitedly announcing that she didn't need her inhaler on the walk to class, expressing joy at being able to jog for a bit again, etc). Liz is in no way infectious, so there's no way Anne caught it.\n\nIt also doesn't seem legitimate, because Anne exaggerates loud sighs around us, but breathes perfectly normally when everyone has their earphones in or she's affixed on a movie. She uses loud sighs to draw our attention (but if her breathing was bad, she wouldn't be able to breathe in like that). She makes dramatic motions to her chest, and yawns really loudly, and makes annoyed huffs. She doesn't show any signs of breathing badly in class, either.\n\nShe even convinced someone to drive her to the hospital, who was not in our suite. Even the doctors thought she was making it up, but they've done several tests. Anne has, of course forced her parents to pay for all of this, and the Doctors still have even said nothing was wrong and that she shouldn't need to go back. (She told us for some reason, but then said, \"They don't know anything and I need to go back.) She's stormed out in the middle of talking about it with us, because not everyone has been paying attention (even though she had told the story to everyone in the room twice. She constantly brings the issue up to gain attention.\n\nLater today, she started to claim loudly to Willow (who is, thankfully moved into the other bedroom) that her \"kidneys were hurting\" and she'll probably \"need medication and maybe surgery.\" Willow had only just last month recovered from some sort of a kidney infection that had started as a UTI.\n\nI'm personally really against people who claim that illnesses are \"fake\" or \"attention seeking.\" Several of my closest friend have chronic pain or invisible illnesses, and it infuriates me to no end when people invalidate their experiences. But she just doesn't have a good reputation for this sort of thing, and she's manipulating others with this. \n\nI would specifically be telling our Resident Director, because she's aware of the incidents in the past and is usually doing something to prevent Anne's bullshit. I'm worried if we don't say anything, it's going to culminate in another one of her explosions. \n\nShould I say anything? Am I making assumptions? ",

We are both still teens but shes close to being an adult. We share a room and sometimes talk about things at night. We both got into a fight during one of these talks about a really stupid thing. She ended up saying im \"either deaf or stupid\". This went on with a few \"are you sure about that\"s before I said \"im not the one in a recovery school\". I was talking about how she had to be moved to a \"special school\" because of her grades. Next year we'll be in the same grade despite her being a few years older than me. She said its not okay for me to make fun of her but im pretty sure she shouldnt of called me stupid. Am I the asshole here or is she in the wrong?",

      "title": "AITA Cutting my brother and mom out of my life over money....",
      "description": " \n\nMy brother and I started mining bitcoin in the extra bedroom of the home I was renting from my mom. We kept a spreadsheet of what was purchased for materials and other costs. Split everything 50/50. We attempted to get free electricity by setting the bill to the \"average of your last year\" and was only paying $143 a month for what was a monthly $900 electric bill. The plan was to stay there for a year, then switch electricity into someone elses name. My mom was worried about this because if i didn't pay the electricity if this did not work then she would be liable. Brother and I agreed to pay it if it came to that.\n\nFast forward 8 months. I am buying a house, time to move. I call the electric company and they say I owe them $6,200. My brother says he is not paying his half of that because I did not stay in the house for a year in an attempt to get free electricity. After I actually look at previous power bills you can see the amount due adding up and rolling over every month. He still holds to \"you didn't stay for a year, so now it's your problem\".\n\nI am now suing my brother for half of that electricity cost and the amount I paid over the 50/50 split for materials. I have already decided to cut my brother out of my life for doing this to me. However, my mom has quite a bit of information that could help me as my brother and I both spoke to her about what was going on, it was after all her home we were setting up bitcoin miners in. She refused to help or even speak on my behalf to my brother, for what I assume is the fear of backlash and she believes if she remains neutral that she will keep good relationships with us both.\n\nI have now given her the ultimatum of either helping me, or losing me forever. This includes ever seeing her granddaughter, my child who lives in Virginia with her mom, during the times I have her for school breaks. I said my mom may pay to fly my child out and see her, or set up something with my ex, but I would not be involved in anyway. My feelings towards people in general are lacking, and cutting someone out of my life over money they owe me would be easier than cutting out taco bell, so time will not heal all for me, only my money back.\n\nIs this too harsh and is there another avenue to take possibly?",

      "description": "My (23f) parents have been separated now for 7-8 months. I won't go into the reasons why except to say it's been around 20 years of issues and not communicating well. No cheating or spousal abuse occurred. I think both of them have valid reasons to be upset with the other and I think they have both been in the wrong. They've never really kept their arguments private. All growing up I remember them arguing in earshot of us kids. I've had both parents come to me separately for years to vent about the other spouse. It all came to a head when I was home on break in the summer and that's when they separated. That break was one of the worst breaks of my life. I'm in a very demanding graduate program and I only get 3 weeks off in the summer. It was so stressful and emotionally draining dealing with their issues. When I got back to school I really noticed how much of a toll it took on me. I was very depressed, emotionally drained, and completely not ready to jump back into my coursework. For years I've lent an ear to both of them if they needed to talk. I've always felt that they can't go to other people because no one understands our family like we do. However, after returning to school, I started really feeling frustrated with the whole situation. My mom would call and say don't tell your father about x,y,z and then my dad would call and do the same thing. It's just been really difficult for me to handle all of their issues when I am very stretched already with what's going on in my life. \n\nRecently, my mom called me to tell my about this thing that my dad had approached her about doing. My mom was very upset and told him no. She told me not to tell my dad she told me. My dad then calls and tells me about this thing and asks my opinion. He tells me not to tell my mom. My dad did the thing after my mom said no. My mom texted me telling me what my dad did. I asked her if she was upset. She replied \"would you be?\". This is when I texted her back saying that being upset is a reasonable reaction but I don't like it when she asks me to put myself in their shoes. It's not my relationship and I don't want to be put in the middle or forced to choose sides. I told her that's not just directed at her, it's the same with my dad. \n\nShe has been extremely cold to me ever since and is obviously very upset with me. I want to be supportive but I just can't deal with their issues on top of my stressful life already and I refuse to pick sides. I love them both. I suggested that they need to work out their issues between the 2 of them and possibly a qualified 3rd party which can never be one of us kids. So, AITA for not being supportive to my parents while they go through a separation? I really feel like it sometimes. ",

      "description": "There are two schools involved in the story. I'm going to call the school I go to A and the other school B. I am also going to call my friend J.\n      J is my best friend. He also said I'm his best friend but...I don't really know anymore. I go to school A, and our rival school is B. I couldn't give less of a fuck about the rivalry and it isn't why I'm mad. \n     At school A and B, there is a program that let's you earn college credits in high school. Only 5 schools in our city have it. \n      He asked me about a week ago what school he should go to. I told him he should come to my school A. This is a biased answer but there is also some \"evidence\" behind it. School B is a really hard school. I know a girl had massive amounts of stress and anxiety because of it. Why would you work harder at that school when you get more easier work at school A and still get the same thing? \n     He told me he wanted to go to school A. I was so excited that he was coming and I got my hopes up. I helped him complete the application for the program (I would have done this regardless of him wanting to go to the other school). \n     For the application, you need to choose three schools in order from the one you want to go to the most and then the one you want to go to the least.\n     I asked him what schools he chose (expecting school A as his top choice, just like he told me). He told me he chose school B for his top choice and then school A.\n     I was devastated and I just started crying. I should also mention I have a huge crush on him affecting me negatively a lot, so any small thing he does just makes me really sad. \n     I got my hopes up for once in my life and they came crashing down. I said \"....ok,\" and ended the conversation there until I got out of school and told him \"Why did you choose school B?\" and he responded back with \"because it's a good school.\" I then wanted to tell him that he was going to regret the decision later but I didnt because I wanted to respect his decision. I deleted what I said and that was that. He didn't respond for the whole day even though I apologized about three times just to get a message at 11:30 that night saying he just had Instagram muted and he wasnt mad at me. Everything was ok between us until today. \n     When I was having my nightly overthinking session, I wondered about why he didnt tell me he changed his mind. I couldn't fathom why he didnt tell me. It couldnt be because I would get mad at him, as he never knows my true feelings towards him. I kept wondering this until today.\n     I asked him if he had to write an essay for the application as I had to last year. He said no and that none of his friends did either.\n     That's when it hit me. It was because all his friends were going to school B. I was kind of salty but it was one of the reasons I considered in my overthinking session.\n     He's my best friend and I would follow him wherever he goes, but I dont want to repeat the process of a new school all over again and I already planted my roots in this school. I dont consider me being his best friend because he doesnt so that. I know that he isnt me but....still.\n     AITA? If you need more info dont hesitate to ask...",

The friend in question is K.\n\nI met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating.\n\nThey saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals.\n\nBreakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours.\n\nOne of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing.\n\nAbout 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out.\n\nI had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y.\n\nI see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week).\n\nI think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway).\n\nA couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns. \n\nI'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care... And me).\n\nReddit, AITA for not wanting to get together? Am I being self-righteous? Should I care this much?",

      "description": "I've been dating this guy for about half a year. Although we're not exclusive (yet), we still care about each other deeply. \n\nA few weeks ago, i brought this guy over for the second time. The first time, I had asked my roommate if she'd approve. She said yes. However, this time, I didn't ask for her permission. I know, I realized that I was at fault for not informing my roommate but I felt like a child having to ask for her parent's permission to have someone over. Anyways, she confronted me about this and told me that hearing a man's voice in the middle of the night terrified her. I admit, I was definitely the arse in this situation, and I apologized to her over and over again and that I'll inform her next time. But then she told me that she prefers him to not stay overnight because it invaded her privacy. \n\nNow, I haven't seen my guy for about a month now, and want to see him soon. I brought up the discussion again with her and asked if my guy can stay overnight for one night a week. (I would be completely fine staying over at his place, but he lives with his parents). She was really hesitant in answering and suggested that I should consider other options before asking her, such as camping outside, airbnb, and a motel. Her reasons for being uncomfortable with my guy staying at our place overnight constitutes: \n\n1. **Noise level:** she mentioned that she can hear our conversations, and it felt to her that she was forced to be involved in our relationship, because she knows what we're talking about.\n2. **Her privacy**: Having him over = invasion to her privacy. She does not want to run into him in the middle of the night. She wants him to only come during the day. \n3. **My privacy**: This is her main reason. She claims that she's concerned about me and wanting me to progress my relationship with this guy. By booking a hotel room/airbnb to perform FACs,, I can have the most privacy I can possibly get without having to worry about my roommate hear what is going.. \n\nIs it honestly too much for me to ask of my roommate to allow my guy to stay over for one night a week? He comes around midnight anyways, so we'll only spend at the most 8/9 hours together (11am non)  (half of which will be spent just sleeping). \n\nPlease note that my roommate does not have a car, so she's always going to be home. She has not yet offered to leave the apartment to give me some privacy. She said that if I had told her before that he was coming overnight, she would be more compliant to agree.. Please help! Any would be greatly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Posting from an alt because these people know my handle and I would prefer to hear from other's opinions.\n\nI recently got banned from a discord chat. The moderator's reasoning? \"We will not tolerate Homophobes.\"\n\nNow, I am banned. I don't have the chat logs to pull up, and this was a semi-private discord, so I don't have a valid key to take an alt into to get them. Sucks, right? Here's what I remember saying, since I do have word opened with my reply and research.\n\n---\n\nBasically, this kid in this server started complaining about the fact that their parents weren't letting them get hormone therapy for being trans. This kid has talked about it before on the server, and from my understanding they have never actually seen a psychologist in regards to this. They just \"felt\" they were trans.\n\nSo, I called them out. I started asking questions. \"How old are you?\" (15 she said) \"Why do you want this?\" (Coz itll make me feel better!) \"Have you seen a psychologist?\" (No, but I've heard what it's like and I feel the same way!)\n\nBy the time I actually managed to get them to say that last one, the rest of the server was butting in, basically saying that I was a \"complete fucking asshole for asking stuff like that\" and that \"You don't need to have a slip of paper to be valid!\"\n\nFinally, I just wrote up one big reply (because at this point I was getting bombarded with people harassing me) which expressed my view. It went as follows:\n\n---\n\nAre you guys serious?\n\nLess than 1% of the population experiences Gender Dysphoria, according to the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The highest I've read is an estimated 0.5% of the population according to a 2014 study (1), however, most estimates point to the “real number” being FAR lower than that, often less than 0.1%.\n\nOf those, research shows that most (I've read lower estimates of 60-70%, but The American Collage of Pediatricians states this is closer to 80-90% (2)) will not experience Gender Dysphoria after Puberty. (3) Of the remaining minority, most will have another kind of mental illness alongside Dysphoria.\n\nAs I've mentioned here before, I have a mental illness that encompasses 2% of the world population. I have met one other person with my own condition outside of forums, servers, and communities built for people with that condition. So for Gender Dysphoria – and therefore Trans people – to have such a high vocal presence online... It's absolutely staggering. To be honest, to me this means that *most* people who say they are trans, simply are not. It also means that many people, like Hush, are simply going to falsely self diagnose.\n\nFrom my experience, I feel something else is at work, that some people are lying, or that there are other forces at play – and many researchers seem to agree, often stating that many people seem to confuse other illnesses, simple anxiety, or puberty as dysphoria.\n\nThis is exactly why y'all shouldn't be so eager to support &lt;TRANS KID&gt;! This is why I'm asking questions! Because in all likelihood, from what she's told us, &lt;TRANSKID&gt; LIKELY ISN'T TRANS.\n\nStop linking me to tumblr pages ffs. Read some actual god damn articles and crap on this. Believe it or not, some teenagers online are not the be-all-end-all of how the world works.\n\n(1) Transgender Demographics: A Household Probability Sample of US Adults, 2014.\nCrissman HP, Berger MB, Graham LF, Dalton VK\nAm J Public Health. 2017 Feb; 107(2):213-215.\n\n(2) https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children\n\n(3) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981931/\n\n---\n\nIt got a few middle finger emotes, then it was deleted, I got the message from a mod, and then I was banned before I could reply.\n\nAm I the asshole? Was I right to be banned for this? Am I seriously a homophobe for calling someone out on what is likely nothing more than prepubescent bullshit?",

Does NOT mean I will treat you less.  \n\nSo I posted this on r/raisedbynarcissists about a trans person not being accepted by their parents \n\"Okay, I don't support the transgenderism, but you get support from your parents no matter what and noone should judge you for your choices.

I made a clarification to it all and I thought it was all over and decided not to care. \n\n\nApparentely a Mod thought I was disrespectful and temp banned me for a week for being Transphobic and disrespectful.

      "description": "We started dating 2 years ago, we had somewhat different political views when it came to sex and relationships, but I didn't care about it.Anyway, after a couple of months, I ended up asking her if she ever had a partner before, in which she said \"Yes, 6 actually\",  I was a bit annoyed by that, since I am very trad. guy I would prefer a lower to zero body count, but I was also aware that she had her own life before me, so I just explained to her how I felt about sex, that I was a virgin. She was a bit annoyed by that actually, but in the end, accepted my views.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of months past and I was still insecure about her body count, but I always reminded myself that in the end, she loved me and that I had to get over my insecurity in order to love her to the fullest. Eventually, after some talking, she convinced me to have sex with her (she actually forced me, but whatever), and even though the sex was great I still felt insecure about it from time to time, but I kept pushing myself as best as I could, I even talked to her about my problem, and she was somewhat understanding at the time, but she said something that really stuck with me back then, that I should stop being insecure and act like a man .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, one day we were just watching some RuPaul and she was texting her friend on the phone and eventually, they ended up having an argument about body count, her friend mentioned something about some people having too many sexual partners throughout their lives. Now me being me I wasn't really giving much of a fuck about the whole argument until I saw her texting something about ME agreeing with her (my ex) and that even a traditionalist guy was more open-minded than her friend. That really annoyed me, so I asked her why she felt the need to use me as an example, and she told me that because I was okay with the 12 guys she has been with before. Don't have to explain that I was pretty pissed at her lie. So I started to approach this subject in a really respectful way, I reminded her about my problem and insecurity and asked her if she lied about her number. She acted really angry and told me to chill out, but I kept pushing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the argument got heated and she told me that I was still being a naive insecure bitch and that I should act like an adult. Needless to say, I got pissed, so I raised my voice at her (probably more than what I should have), she answered me with a somewhat heavy push to the chest and I told her to get out of my place, so she grabbed her purse and said that she couldn't believe she dated an insecure closeminded asshole, I answered by saying that I couldn't believe I dated a lying whore. She bashed me in the head with the purse and I demanded her to get out, and thank god she did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is not about if my behavior was correct or not. It's about my reasons for breaking up with her. Was I being an asshole for breaking up with her because of her past? ",

      "description": "Hi, so. My boyfriend and I have been together for quiet some time, and we live together. I trust him completely not to cheat, and we’re both legal adults. We have a group of online friends that we sometimes hang out with, and it’s all fun and stuff. Recently, a kid joined our friend group (of caries ages) he’s about 11-14, and at first I really liked him. He joined our games, and we all hung out, at one point my boyfriend and I suggested we “adopt” him. \n\nBut then he started demanding things. He would join a game we were in, and would just say “invite me.” I didn’t mind this much, but I started to realize, he was joining games only my boyfriend was in. So, naturally, I thought he was more drawn to him since they’re both males, but that didn’t make sense since I’m one of the few females in our group. Maybe he just had fun with him? I brushed it aside, until he made comments to me. “He doesn’t love you.” “He loves me more than you.” “You should break up with him, he doesn’t deserve you.” \n\nI brought this up with my boyfriend, who was confused. He said the kid did nothing but support our relationship to him. About a week ago, the kid announced to my boyfriend alone he was bi, and he liked his best friend. Then started calling him, his best friend. I simply said “He has a crush on you!” Then my boyfriend said I was kind of delusional. But, yesterday, he asked for a dick pic, and that drew the line. I took it as a joke at first, we were all laughing, but then he got quiet and private messaged my boyfriend “Send me pictures, please.” “I’m thirsty for you.” My boyfriend refuses to tell the kid to stop, because he’s a kid, but I’m growing irritated more and more everyday. He lies to my boyfriend, and makes me look like a bad guy. A CHILD is asking my ADULT boyfriend for dick pictures, and I’m starting to get upset. AITA for being upset about this? I want the kid to stop, that’s all. \n\n(I have tried messaging him privately to stop, and he says the stuff about my bf not loving me as a reply.) ",

      "description": "Trigger alert: *This may come across strongly as an Incel rant. Let's be honest, people aren't born incels, they develop into terrible people because they don't understand how to deal with the real world. Sometimes they are niceguys and their Incel future is inevitable unless they get lucky early. Sometimes they are just stupid (like me) and can't figure anything out and lash out because the world is a dark and lonely place*.\n\nThe coworker (referred to as \"she\" and \"her\" hereafter) had been in a long term committed relationship since she was in high school. Not several, the same one. She broke up with her boyfriend for a period when he failed to meet her ultimatum to ask her to marry; and then they got back together almost six months later where he finally proposed a year after that. So to say that she's invested in that relationship is seriously paraphrasing things. Last week she found out that he had been cheating on her, and being the self-respecting woman that she is, she broke off the engagement and moved out. She's been taking it how any reasonable person would: some days it's a relief to have dodged a bullet and other days it's hugely sad. I've tried to be as supportive as I can without assuming getting involved in her personal life. When she's comfortable talking about things, I listen; and when she needs to be alone, I'll make up an excuse to leave my desk.\n\nLast week I decided to buy myself flowers and a gift basket for Valentine's day so I wouldn't be the only person to not get anything. It's not a huge deal, but I wanted to pretend that this year was going to be different even if I had to fake it before I could make it (it's a saying). Then we find out that she broke up with her fiance and I just feel terrible knowing that I'm going to receive a gaudy present that's going to remind her that she's ended her relationship.\n\nToday seems like one of the sad days, so I offer to get lunch for us at one of the take-out restaurants nearby. While I'm out, the package arrives. I find out when I come back and the door to our shared office is locked (I told her she could close the door any time she needed privacy, i.e. crying). I leave the food at a nearby table and tell her that it's available whenever she's ready to have it, and that I'll be eating in the break room. She recovers and day goes by as normal.\n\nThat's all context, here's the conflict:\n\nWe both use Kik and there's a chat room that (coincidentally) we both joined. Later in the day, the people in chat keep going on with Valentine's memes. I comment that I can't wait for the holiday to be over and for it to be the next holiday already. One of the guys, we'll call him Adam, suggests that I find another single person to spend my Valentine's day as a solution to my hating the holiday. I reply that I don't want to be an asshole, but I'm not single for a lack of trying. That's when she adds to chat \"lol Adam\".\n\nLike, excuse me? You were just bawling your eyes out an hour ago because you recently ended your relationship. Do you really need to laugh at me for finding it hard to cope with being single? We've talked about the topic of dating through the past couple years working together, so I understand that she read my complaint as \"I'm lazy and I don't want to learn how to find love\" but I don't think that excuses her dismissive attitude. Particularly because she knows my perspective on that exact topic: \"I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and if anyone could tell me then I would proactively fix myself.\" I feel double slighted because I'm going out of my way to be supportive through her hardship (not in some niceguy \"you owe me now\" sort of way though, I've meant it in a mutual respect sort of way).\n\nI don't know man. I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole for a lot of things, but I don't feel like this is one of them. Valentine's day is a celebration of romantic relationships and I've never felt it was helpful to be exhibitionists about how happy people are like it's some kind of dick measuring contest. I'm just trying to express that I don't appreciate all the Valentine's day memes in a non-confrontational way in what's normally a safe space. I seriously don't feel right being laughed at for it.\n\nAm I the asshole for expressing how much I hate Valentine's day, when my coworker has a much more pressing reason to be upset today; and now I'm upset that she's laughing at me about it?\n\nDisclaimer: I am great with constructive criticism. I am terrible with insults masquerading as criticism. Since this is Reddit, I know I'm going to have to sift through a ton of the latter before finding the former. And because Rule2 demands I not call you a piece of shit for ignoring all but two sentences out of context, I'm disabling automatic notifications. I'll check back in before 18 hours and reply to anyone who seems like they need more relevant facts to give a fair judgement.",

      "description": "Throwaway to avoid exposing info.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have discussed moving in together in the near-ish future. Let’s call him Jake. Jake’s parents were drug addicted and passed away when he was about 18 and he successfully obtained custody of his brother. He lives in a house about 30 min from me and I have a roommate and live in a fairly nice house. We are late 20s/early 30s. His brother is almost 19. After a natural disaster in his area, a few of his brother’s friends moved in to my boyfriend’s house, too. (With his permission). Those boys and Jake work in the city I’m in. Jake’s work is mere blocks from my home. \n\nJake is constantly getting calls and texts by the boys, especially at night, being asked to be driven back to the house (since it’s a drive- it means he can’t always come back to my house if it’s late since I get up early). He has to shop for them on the weekends and I can’t really stay at his place due to the crowding, meaning he can only stay with me a couple nights a week. \n\nHe is kind of like a dad to these boys and it is VERY sweet and kind, but I’m worried this is slowly becoming permanent. Jake’s brother doesn’t work or go to school, and while I like a couple of the boys, they definitely act like adolescent boys and have stopped looking into other housing options. I’ve seen messages from the boys asking if he’s with “thot”, making sexually suggestive remarks and complaining about him spending time with me/not always being available to give them rides. I know Jake’s brother is NOT happy about him having a girlfriend. \n\nI’m always understanding about the rides, as there is not public transportation late at night here and I don’t want the “kids” on the streets. However, as we build our future I certainly don’t want to be the girl putting anyone out- but I’m not prepared to live with these young guys, especially with what they call me. If there were any sign of these guys moving forward, I wouldn’t worry, but Jake doesn’t really push for that. \n\nAm I an asshole for getting frustrated? ",

She developed feelings for him, after I saw this coming and warned him. He said: 'Calm down, you are exaggerating'. Then after he promised me that it was nothing, nothing changed. And then he kissed her then told her he didn't like her or something and that they should break contact which they did.\n\nHe told me 2 weeks after it had happened, she wanted to tell me but had a deal that my best friend would be the one that would tell it.  I received the news quite calmly because I didn't knew how to react. Told him it would be okay and we would work this out.  He said he regretted it so much he would do anything for me. \n\nNext day I spoke to him and said that for now he shouldn't contact me and that he needed to fix his shit.

Strictly plutonic and it even started some small talk. Since then we have talked once more in passing. We occasionally catch glances with each other and smile.\n\nWell today I was finishing my lift and saw her leaving the gym. I caught up to her and asked if she wanted to grab coffee later this week. She replied with that she was married (I had no idea, she didn’t wear a ring, which I completely understand). She then followed by saying that she preferred me to stop talking to her. I told her that we have spoken twice before and just caught eyes occasionally. And she replied with just please stop. It made me feel like I was being super creepy and now I nervous to go in the gym. Am I the asshole for approaching her this third time?\n\nTLDR: approached a cute girl a few times in my gym, she told me to stop, and now I feel like I’m a creepy asshole.",

I decided to be the bigger man and let the others participate, as they all had family members either buried there and/or serving at the time, and I just wanted to honor fallen soldiers. Also, I have been in Boy Scouts for 5 years and am a full-time honor guard with professional training. \n\n\nThe story: \n\nDuring the ceremony, I was annoyed that they had completely disregarded all of my tips on upright standing, when to salute, and how to walk at “attention” stature. \nI decided that I should talk to them about it after wards, and to try to soften the mood, I divided to start with a joke, so I plainly called it “sloppy,” and preceded to critique a large section of the ceremony using my knowledge of flag ceremonies and honor guard. \nAfterwards, these friends were pissed and would avoid me, and then told me that I should not critique there performance, and that just doing it alone was enough for them, and now I kinda feel like a really big asshole. \n\nAm I the asshole?

      "title": "AITA for ruining family dinner because I didn't want to talk about my ex and suggested we talk about everyone's exes?",
      "description": "Had a family dinner this past weekend. It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.\n\nAt dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).\n\nBack then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.\n\nI'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like \"Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet for what seemed like an eternity until I was told I was wildly inappropriate. I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.\n\nGot some texts afterwards about how I ruined dinner and I should apologize but I don't think I'm the one who should be apologizing. I see this as a 'you can serve it but not take it' situation so I don't feel I owe anyone an apology. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for insisting on an apology from my boyfriend’s sister (a single mother)?",
      "description": "I’ve (21) been frustrated by my boyfriend’s (23) sister Lauren (name changed, will call her L). She makes reckless decisions without regard for consequences. L has never really done anything for herself, she is now 30 years old but has never pursued a particular career or paid her own rent, she has been supported by my bf’s family. Recently she fell pregnant to man she had only briefly dated and decided to have the baby. After this the relationship broke down and she moved back in with my bf’s family (he lives at home so I often spend time there).\n\nShe was consistently rude and bratty to bf and his family. She would leave food scraps and rubbish everywhere and would send rude messages to anyone if they annoyed her slightly. L also adopted a dog a few years ago which she failed to walk or take proper care of and that responsibility now also falls on my bf’s parents. \n\nI will occasionally make comments to my boyfriend as it makes me angry seeing L treat everyone this way. An example: in order to help L her parents recently bought an apartment for her to live in rent-free. L constantly comments on how ‘dark and depressing’ the place is (It’s honestly very nice). I told my boyfriend that I found this ungrateful and immature. \n\nI’d never criticise L to her face as I don’t believe it’s my place. However, recently my bf and I had a fight about an unrelated issue and he got really upset. Afterwards, he told L that I’ve been critical of her. L took this really badly. She blocked me on social media and did nothing but vent anger to her family. A week or so later my bf and I patched things up and I wanted to try and make amends to L. He told me that L had been messaging him about the situation, and at this point I was confused about why she was so upset so I asked if I could see some of the messages she’d sent to try and understand where she was coming from. The messages were really aggressive and including things like ‘OP is a nasty bitch’, ‘OP needs regular therapy’ and ‘OP is emotionally abusive’. \n\nAfter reading this I was really angry, I typed out an apology to Lauren but it was badly worded and this escalated the situation even further. She called my boyfriend’s parents screaming that she was a victim and that I was being hurtful. After giving the situation some time, I wrote another more careful apology which she finally responded to. At this point she is still unaware that I have seen her hurtful messages. \n\nMy bf wants to try and forget this situation but I’m feeling hurt and think I deserve an apology. However, this would involve telling her that I’d read the messages, which would no doubt stir up more drama. Part of the issue is that Lauren had a rough childhood with issues like bulimia, and is having a hard time being a single mother. AITA for insisting that she should apologise? I realise that she has had a hard time but I still believe L should be accountable for her actions. ",

      "description": "So I just got my license but I'm 17 and about to turn 18. The reason I got it so late is because my parents didn't want me to get it earlier. So anyways naturally I want car insurance so I can start driving. I live in a city where it's impossible to get anywhere without driving and it's basically a necessity. However my parents are refusing to buy me car insurance. They got both of my older brothers insurance the day after they got their liscences, yet it's been 5 weeks for me and they won't budge. \n\nI understand that this is coming off as sort of entitled but I know for a fact that they can afford it. I just think it's messed up that they got it for my brothers but won't get it for me. Their reasoning is that my brothers ended up going to the local community college so they needed to drive but I'm going to a 4 year University and therefore don't need to drive. \n\nDo they just expect me not to drive for the next 4 years? This has become a daily argument at my house and I was just wondering if I'm being the asshole because I keep on bringing it up. Also, we have an extra car that I could drive if they got me insurance. ",

(I will be referring the Husband as X and the Wife as Y)\n\nIt almost feels like every year that passes, they get a new dog. As of now they have 8 dogs (previously 9) and they had to get rid of one to Y's father. I feel like this animal hoarding is getting out of control and is effecting the household.\n\nThe house constantly reeks of urine and the dogs like to drink the green pool water in the backyard. Their house has scattered clothes around the livingroom and hallways and I feel like if maybe if they had less dogs that they would actually put effort into cleaning their house. I've started to hate visiting because it just smells so bad and there's dog hair everywhere.\n\nI'll be honest, I dont WANT to call anyone to take the dogs away, the dogs are cute, but I cant confront them about this issue without X and Y taking it personally. They have a tendency to have a \"us against them\" mentality with family when any of us try to offer advice.\n\nShould I just let them be and wait for the dogs to just kick the bucket or should I do something about it???",

      "description": "A few days ago my brother and I went out to eat at a restaurant. We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? ",

Also he's very homophobic (I'm gay) and loves to use every slur. He refuses to let me go anywhere or do anything. I'm allowed to go to school and work and home. Nothing else. Im also 17 and still dont have my drivers permit. I have everything, and took the online course, he just won't let me get it. My only reason for asking is my mom.

      "description": "Hi everyone- throwaway for reasons. \n\nMy ex boyfriend and I have had joint custody over our dog for 2 years now here in California. I legally own her on paper , and have paid for all of her vaccinations. We did break up last year, but since we still lived so close to each other I figured why not let him keep seeing the dog since they love each other so much. We then bought our own food/toys and would take turns having her every 2 weeks or so. This has went on for a year. \n\nI ended up moving to New York City, and we had a verbal agreement that she would move here with me once I was settled in and discuss an arrangement later on how we would split the time with both of us and the dog.\n\nOnce I was settled in and ready to have her flown over here he told me she would not be coming to NYC. He wasnt willing to compromise with me at all, and I felt he trapped me. All because the dogs quality of life would be better in California because she has a backyard, another dog companion, beach, etc there and she would be unhappy in a “ concrete jungle “ in NYC. \n\nAfter countless arguments on why my dog would be absolutely fine in NYC,  my only option was to give-in to him. All my friends said he was manipulating me and just trying to control me and I realized after they were right. So I decided to fly to California and take her without him knowing. He did hand her to me\nbut only knowing I was just visiting her and would give her back. \n\nWhen I got to the airport I sent him an email. He called me 5 times and I never answered them. Haven’t heard from him since and it’s been 5 days. I feel horrible and heartbroken that I split them apart but I feel I was left with no choice because at the end of the day she’s still legally MY dog.. I’m sure he’s plotting to take me to court now. \nAm I the Asshole?",

All 4 of us signed the lease (two roommates in particular owning pets, I did not own any), and we moved in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe a couple weeks into living there, the discussion of the pet deposit came up and it turned out to be very expensive, and so none of the roommates that owned the pets paid their deposits.

TL:DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Grandparents and Parents are Portuguese. they came from Portugal to Canada to give my brother and i a better life.\n\nwe have lived with my Grandparents since i was 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngrowing up as a kid was usually different from how my friends always told me how their family's did things, but i always knew my household as normal, my mom is a narcissist, i of course as a kid had no idea what that was, i am now 30 and have come to realize how she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhen we were younger she used to go mental, if my brother wanted to go out somewhere and she didn't want him to go, he would nag her and push her buttons and she would just lose it, she would kick and scream like a child pull her hair and lock herself in the bathroom screaming, she would scare the fucking shit out of me and my brother, i was a lot younger so i only remember some of the traumatic events.\n\nmy dad would end up yelling at us, telling us to leave her alone let her cool down and go to our rooms, they were never physical with us, but this happened many many times, where she would just go insane and make us feel terrible. we had a few times where she took it too far and would down a bottle of pills, and had to go to the hospital to pump her stomach. i was always told growing up from my parents that is just how Portuguese people deal with things and we do things differently from other family's\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis probably happened up until i was around 18. at that point she kind of calmed down, me and my brother had more freedom and we have moved out of her house. since this time we have kept in pretty good contact with her, things were decent. she kept up her narcissist ways and me and my brother would brush it off and go back with our lives like nothing ever happened. that seems to be how most of our fights went. she would have a problem, yell at us, get mad at us if we talked back to her, she would never apologize and would blame us even if it was clearly her fault. my wife started to have enough of her shit and slowly started to drift away from seeing her as often. that also started a shit ton of fights because my mother hated that my wife didn't put up with her shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow me and my brother are in our 30's we both Have Children. My brother has a son who is 3 with his girlfriend, and i have 2 sons with my wife, one of them is 3 and the other is 9 months old. My mom has been going through a few things in her life, My Grandpa (her Dad) passed away about a year and a half ago from cancer, he was diagnosed with a year and when we found out my wife, kids, and i were there all the time. he died 8 months after his diagnosis, it was a sad day and the family mourned. but my mom changed that day, she has gone back to her shitty sour moods and her instant blaming of everything else is everyone else's fault and never her, she was the victim, her dad died and that she was the only one cared. she started to push her family away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Within the time from my grandpa passing away and up until now i have been keeping track of how shitty she has been to us, i could probably go on for hours but i'll just give some examples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-she will talk shit about my brother and his girlfriend to my wife and i\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-hates the way me and my brother raise our children, and will go behind our backs to do whatever she wants even if we said no and say it's grandmas right to do what she wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-will compare our children and act like its a competition on who is learning things faster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-pits me and my brother against each other so we start figthing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-my mom has tried to go on disability once my grandpa passed away and hasn't got paid since, my dad has an out of town job and he is never home, she has started to say that i dont come over as often because she doesn't have money anymore and that i used to come over more before to use her for her money. i tell her many times to stop spending money on my kids because she constantly complains how expensive things were and how she has no money and she can't keep affording and somehow make it seem like its my fault she's spending money on my kids.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-acts like she knows what goes on in our homes while she's not around and make up insane stories\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-thinks everyone is against her and is using her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso all that comes down to this, My brother went to drop off his kid last night, he has made plans to go to a party, he ended up not feeling well and text her to say that he isn't going to the party anymore and that if she still wants to be with her grandson for the sleepover, as he can stay in with him as well no bother either way, but she turned it around where she was doing him a favor and now he still needs to bring him because she cancelled all her plans to do this for him. now leading up to this point my nephew has been having an issue with sleeping, my brother has had a pretty strict bedtime going on with him for 8pm out in his bed. we had been visiting one day when my nephew was there and my mother was watching him, 9pm rolls around and my dad points at his watch and tells my mother that he thinks its time to put him to bed, she scoffed and ignored him. we ended up leaving around 10 and he was still up. my brother the next day ended up asking me what time he went to bed knowing i was there. i told him the truth and he didn't say a word to my mother for a bit.(i have been slowly opening my brother eyes to my moms narcissist ways and he has been starting to realize). so this night he went there hoping to get an apology from her. he told her he knew that she put him to bed late and explained why it was important for him to sleep on his scheduled time and she just side stepped, and blamed my wife, my dad and i. she told him that we were the ones who told her to keep him up later that he is having fun, full well trying to escape from saying sorry by telling another lie. and my brother was done with it(i was not there for this) he told me he yelled and screamed and he had enough of how she is. she managed to say sorry and reverse it and make it somehow his fault and try and make him apologize. they fought for a big and she ended up going mental again she ran upstairs screaming kicking pulling her hair and sat in her bed, my brother waited a few minutes and went up stairs, she was sitting there with an empty bottle and a handful of pills in her hand and as soon as he walked in she started to try and shove it in her mouth, my brother ran to her and smacked her hand and pills flew everywhere, she screamed and yelled and told him to go away. My brother called me and told me to come over that my mother just attempted suicide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell my wife everything, so she knows what my mother just did, she offered to drive me over there and take my our nephew back with her to keep him away from the shit storm that was about to go down. i showed up there and it was just an instant fight about how she has been treating us, we tried to show her how she has been, trying to make her realize how terrible she has been to us lately and that we have been patient with her bullshit, we told her at this point forward with how she attempted suicide and went mental that we could not bring our children over there for a while, especially after my wife knowing what happened she will also tell my brothers girlfriend regardless and we wont have a say. we told her what she did wasn't right and that we need to go to family counseling before we could let her see our children again.\n\nshe freaked out saying that it was my brother fault for pushing her over the edge and forcing her to fake an attempt at suicide to make him leave, i told her that she was trying to manipulate my brother and she will cause serious emotional abuse doing something like that, she smirked and laughed said it doesn't matter anyway nobody loves her, and that we just came there to attack her, she said she was sorry and that her door is always open when we are ready to come back\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso am i the asshole from keeping my kids away from my mom?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR my mom is nuts, attempted suicide, blames her children for her attempt, and refuses to see that what she did is wrong. i told her we are not coming back until she agrees to family counseling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I ordered pizza and since I was going to be paying with cash, I was going to give the driver a 20 dollar bill and let him keep the change as a tip (~13%). When I ordered the pizza, it was raining, so I decided I wouldn't take part of the tip off if he was a bit late, as I normally take a dollar off for every 5 minutes past the estimated time. After about 20 minutes, the rain stopped, and the driver finally arrived after about 45 minutes. I thanked him for the pizza, and handed him the $20 and said he could keep the change. He looked at the bill and said \"Just 2 bucks? I had to drive in the rain for an hour\". I was pretty upset that he would say this, so I told him to give me the 2 dollars back as change, and I would get him a $5 bill. He hands me the 2 dollars and I close the door on him. Obviously I don't return with a larger tip and he leaves after a minute or two at the door.",

      "title": "AITA For not giving money to a \"Homeless Person\"",
      "description": "   This took place last night. For starters I live in a small city where there is a larger homeless population than avg. Me and my girlfriend were out getting ice cream after we finished our late night classes was around 9 pm.  We were sitting at a table inside the restaurant  and this \"Homeless Man\", going to call him HM, came up to us and asked me for some money. \n\n   I am use to Homeless people asking for money especially around where I live and normally I don't have a problem giving what ever change that I have or buy them something that they need. But this HM did not seem like a homeless person. What I mean is that his hair looked like it was well kept what he was wearing looked cleaner and nicer than what I was wearing, so he did not really seem to much like a homeless person. Normally the people that do ask for change from me look like they actually do need it so I was put off by this guy. A conversation followed:\n\nHM: \"Yo man I ain't got no where to live can you spare some change\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry not today\"\n\nHM: \"I know you got some money brother, you should spare me some\"\n\nMe: I kinda replied with \"No\" without looking at him\n\nHM: \"Come on man just give me some money\"\n\nMe \"Not. Today. \"\n\nHM:\"Oh I see it's because I'm black ain't it\"\n\n   Me and my girlfriend are both Caucasian and the HM is prob around the same age I am (early 20s) and African American \n\nMe: \"No sir\"\n\nHM: \"So why wont you give me money\"\n\nMe: I was somewhat mad at this point so I did have a snappy tone \"I said No . So Just leave me alone now I want to enjoy me Ice cream\"\n\nHM: \"Man fuck y'all racist mofos. this is why I hate white people, no not white, fucking Crackers. yall see a fucking black man and wont even help him \"\n\nHe went to leave the store but knocked the entire thing of Straws all over the floor. Few mins pass and a worker around my and HM same age came out to clean up the straws. Was also the same worker the we ordered from. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry about that.\"\n\nWorker:\"Maybe if you wern't such fucking assholes to him and have him some of that money I saw you had I wouldn't have to spend my time cleaning this shit up. I you actually cared you would be cleaning this shit up. \"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry miss\"\n\n   For reference I have prob 7 dollars in ones total in a new wallet I got for V Day, and if you don't know anything about new wallets its hard to stuff bills into a new wallet so a good bit was sticking out making it seem more then it really is. \n\nAfter that Me and the girlfriend just got up and left without saying another word to the worker.\n\n   Now I don't want to assume anything but if I were to guess the Worker and the \"HM\" somehow knew each other, but I don't want to create and false situations in my head.  \n\ntl:dr : I didn't give some money to a \"homeless\" man so someone called me an asshole",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my housemate’s girlfriend to leave – even though he’s only just come back from abroad?",
      "description": "\nBasically – I (f24) live with 1 guy and 2 girls, we’re all in our early-mid 20s. My guy housemate has been studying abroad for 3 months and has recently returned home. His girlfriend has been staying with us for two weeks, 1 week before he got back and I don’t think she plans on leaving any time soon.\n \nI’ve known both of them for 7 years, and I lived with both of them last year, before the girlfriend moved out of town to get her PHD. When my housemate left he gave his girlfriend his keys to our flat without consulting us.\n \nMy relationship with his girlfriend is not great. She was pretty shitty to me for a few months. It got to the point where one of the girls we live with, who has also been friends with them for a long time, had to have a conversation asking why she was being so mean.\n \nWhile my housemate was away his girlfriend would come and stay at our flat without giving much notice, often expecting us to drop our plans to host her.\n \nThis is where I think it gets a bit complicated. My housemate continued to pay rent while he was abroad – so I do think that she had a right to use his room while he was away – and now he’s back obviously he can have whoever he wants over. But we subsidise his rent because he has a very large room and we have no lounge. In return we use half his room as communal space.\n\nEver since he got back from abroad, I feel like a guest in my own house. Suddenly if we left anything in the communal part of his room it would be moved into the hall or the kitchen – shoved into drawers with no conversation or explanation. I feel that it is very unlikely that it is my housemate doing this. His girlfriend however is a control freak. \n \nShe also passive aggressively cleans our kitchen – commenting on how dirty and untidy my two other housemates are to me, blaming the one housemate we didn’t go to school with for attracting mice even though it was definitely not her fault. Moving my appliances from where I like to keep them, like my rice cooker for no apparent reason.\n \nLast night they used my rice cooker without really asking me and broke it. When I went into the kitchen they were just like “your rice cooker is broken” and were really techy about elaborating. I asked them to try and fix it and when they couldn’t I bought myself a new one and asked my housemate to pay me back. I don’t care about them using it, or even breaking it. Just the complete lack of respect – no apology or anything. \n \nWe never set proper boundaries or had a conversation with our housemate about this so perhaps it’s not surprising that they think it’s ok since we’ve been friends for so long and have lived together in the past.\n \nI also feel like I could be the asshole because to be fair they haven’t seen each other in 3 months so it’s normal that they’d want to spend time together.\n \n\n  ",

      "description": "This was during Senior year of high school. I was in National Honor Society along with some other people and as a part of NHS we are required to do volunteer hours in order to get the NHS gold tassel to wear at graduation our senior year. I have one friend (whom I'll refer to as Laura) That was also in NHS. She decided to volunteer her time at a church helping set up stuff for various church activities. She thought it was the best way to volunteer. I had the forethought to sign up to be a TA my senior year of high school because my thought process was, if I can use up one class period that I could have used for something else, I'll be volunteering an hour every day to help kids out with their chemistry work. To add to that I wanted to be a high school TA, which meant I did not get paid. One benefit was that I enjoy chemistry and I love to help with it. I also got added benefits of getting to play with chemicals doing anything that I thought would be safe and fun. I  didn't think it was that big of an issue to be volunteering while having fun doing chemistry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the conflict came in. Laura was volunteering at a Church and spending lots of time there. She thought what she was doing was more helpful and that being a TA didn't count as actually volunteering because I got to goof off. While I did get to have fun I spent a lot of my time organizing stuff in the Chem lab and helping out students with work, but I got to have fun in the additional time that I wasn't doing anything. My chemistry teacher didn't mind signing my volunteer sheet, but he's pretty lax with the rules so I don't know if I should take his word that that counts. My question is am I the asshole for wanting to volunteer my time as a chemistry TA? My friend volunteered at a church which she thought counted more. I can kind of see how but in my opinion I was still volunteering my time but I got to do it during the school day doing it for something I love and I got to goof off and enjoy myself more that any other volunteering job.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my best friend's boyfriend what she does behind his back?",
      "description": "To preface: I've known Jess, my roommate/best friend for about 15 years. Jess and Chris have been dating for about a year and a half.\n\nJess went on a trip with another friend in the beginning of their relationship, got ridiculously drunk, and went down on a random girl. Chris was livid when she came back because she kissed him before she told him, and he was worried about an STD. They almost broke up, but Jesa started telling Chris that she was forced to do it and that she'd rather forget about the whole thing - she said Chris should stop rubbing her mistakes in her face. Miraculously they stayed together.\n\n\n\nChris moved ~8hrs away for work, and while he was gone, I overheard Jess say \"yeah my boyfriend's a n*gger\" to one of her friends. I told Jess that she was horrible for saying such a slur behind her boyfriend's back - but I (regrettably) didn't tell him about it at the time. \n\n\n\nChris came back for the holidays, they were lovey dovey, and then he moved back out for work again. This time she started relying on her ex bf to hang out with her while he was gone. I don't have anything against her ex, but I also don't think it's normal to want to spend so much time with someone you've slept with.\n\n\n\nAnyway - fast forward to this week. At the beginning of the week, Jess came home from a party from the night before, said she got \"sooo drunk\" and then asked me if she should tell Chris that she cuddled with a random guy the whole night. I asked her why she didn't just use the sleeping bag she brought, she said they used it as a blanket. I said \"I don't know, but given your history when you drink I don't think its a good idea to keep it from him\" - Jess got extremely defensive, saying that \"everyone flirts when they drink! It's not an issue, I don't do anything bad when I drink\" ...\n\n\n\nI work with Chris's sister, lets call her Beth, and occasionally Beth asks how they're still together when they're complete opposites. We got to chatting about how crazy Jess is when she drinks, and I told her she's untrustworthy. Beth (obviously) told her brother, and shortly after he asked me to call him in private. \n\n\n\nHe asked me to be completely honest about Jess, and I told him that while she has no ill intentions, she doesn't have a lot of common sense, and I told him what happened at the party. Chris is my friend too, and I'd feel horrible if I we're dishonest with him. \n\n\n\nAfter chatting, he told me he didn't know how to bring it up with Jess. He said he didn't want to throw me under the bus because I'm the only one who could have told him. I said that if she gets mad at me, so be it. She shouldn't have cuddled with a stranger if she didn't want it to come back and bite her.\n\n\n\nThey got off the phone a few minutes ago, and Jess started yelling at me, saying I'm everyone's friend but hers, and that it's my fault for initially saying \"I don't know\" when she asked if she should tell him. She said she was going to tell him but she was waiting to do it in person. \n\n\n\nPart of me feels really bad for breaking her trust. Maybe I shouldn't have taken matters into my own hands - but now Beth and Chris are thanking me for my honesty.\n\n\n\n**TLDR; my friend of 15 years/roommate shared a bed and cuddled with a random guy at a party. She's done some shady things in the past, so when her boyfriend asked me to be honest with him, I called him and told him what happened. Now She's blaming me for their possible breakup, saying she was \"waiting to tell him in person\" - he lives 8hrs away and won't be home for a few months. AITA for telling him? I don't really believe that she had any intentions to otherwise**",

      "description": "I love dogs.  I would really love to have a dog.  But I live in an apartment in a big city, and I'm gone a minimum of 10hrs a day, sometimes more like 14.  My wife is also gone anywhere from 10-14 hours a day.  \n\nI would do a dog Walker, but my wife wouldn't put up with that expense.\n\nYet, somehow, when she says \"cant we get a dog?\" And I point out all of these roadblocks, I'm the asshole.  Like, no, we can not get a dog.  You know why the fuck we cannot get a dog.  I would pay for a dog walker, I would get a cat, but we cannot leave a dog in this apartment all day.  We wouldn't have the time to initially train a small dog to use indoor potty training stuff, and the occasional accidents would he a disaster in my wife's eyes, not mine.  \n\nAnd it's my wife who wants to live in the city.  I'd love to be in a house in the burbs, closer to work and with a yard for a dog.  \n\nI'm not upset that we cant have a dog.  I'm upset for two reasons - first, I dont like having to say \"no\" all the time.  I really want a dog, and everytime she asks me its like a little roller coaster and part of me is like \"what if!?!\" But then it gets crushed by reality, and I force myself to be reasonable and say \"no\". Second, once I say no, she acts like I'm the reason we dont have a dog! Like, fucking hell I want a dog more than she does, I am NOT the obstacle here.\n\nI've expressed my frustration with this recurring pattern, and she seems to understand, but if the conversation comes up around other people she'll still try to frame it as \"he wont let me get a dog.\" \n\nPisses me right the fuck off.  I feel very strongly that I'm not in the wrong here, but like it makes me very angry.  What I'm wondering is if I'm the asshole for being so upset by this pattern.  I feel confident I have some right to be upset, but I sometimes try to check myself and say I'm making too much of it.  \n\nAITA for being upset?\nAITA for telling her to stop framing the conversation that way?

      "description": "I went on a “date” with a guy from tinder. I went to his place to Netflix and chill. It was his first time meeting up with someone from tinder and he was a little nervous. We hung out and talked for a while before we actually did anything hookup-y, and I liked him and we got along well. I was on the fence about whether or not I was attracted to him or if I just liked him in a “you’re kinda cool” kind of way. I didn’t want to decide until we kissed because that’s the easiest way for me to figure out how I feel about someone, if I’m attracted to them or not.  \n\nEventually when we started kissing he kissed really hard and used a lot of tongue and I thought it was gross. I tried to get him to move his mouth to, erm, someplace other than my mouth but he was like a leech that wanted to suck my saliva! I didn’t want to offend him and we were only hooking up once and I know some girls like that kind of kissing, so I didn’t want to say anything about it. We kept going and things got a bit heavier but I was getting turned off by him. After a few minutes of making out (maybe 10-15?) and my shirt was off, I just wanted to stop and leave. So I pretended like I was getting a phone call and I told him that I needed to go pick my friend up because her car wouldn’t start and she needed to get to the airport.  I am not a super good liar but I tried to make it convincing because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. But, I think he suspected that I was being a bit sketchy and he started questioning me about my fiend, asking me what time her flight was and where she was going and how far away did she live and stuff like that. Again, I didn’t want to tell him that I felt like I just wanted to get out of there because I really wasn’t attracted to him, so I just pretended like I was in a big frantic hurry and made up answers to his questions while I put my shirt back on and then left really quick.  On my way out he said “We should hang out again, hopefully another friend won’t need a ride next time.” And I agreed because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. \n\nSince then he texted me twice and I just ignored him but he got the message and he hasn’t tried to get in touch with me recently. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for lying about why I needed to leave instead of just telling him that I wasn’t attracted to him and hurting his feelings? Am I the asshole for other reasons? Is no one an asshole? Are we both assholes? Is he the asshole? I’m so confused. What is the etiquette in these situations? Would it change if we were both girls or both guys?\n\nP.S. I wanted to clarify that I didn’t feel threatened by him at all. ",

      "description": "Hey guys!\n\nTLDR: I tripped a guy in my grade that I strongly dislike after he pushed someone else and thought no one would do anything. \n\n\nFirst off, this all happened about three months ago. There’s this kid in my grade who can really frustrate me. He’s not always annoying, but he is more than he isn’t. He has a very high ego, and he makes his feelings very clear by complaining to teachers about ‘boring/easy material’ or will call people ‘dumb/idiotic’ when they don’t agree with him. He refuses to acknowledge that someone else might have a more informed perspective than his on any topic. He acts quite entitled and will argue over things that are really straightforward if he thinks he can. He seems to believe that he can do whatever he wants, and his sophomore classmates are holding him back from achieving his true potential. \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are times where he can be tolerable. We both do an extracurricular together in a small group and he tends to act normally then. We actually dated two years ago (middle school was a weird time) and at the time he still generally acted like a decent person. Because of this, I know that he can be a really genuine and caring person, but he does a lot to cover this up, and he is also very picky about who he is genuine to. He still had moments where he was not great, but these didn’t happen often. The following school year (we had broken up) he started to struggle socially and lost a lot, if not all, of his close friends. \n\n\nI do feel bad because it must suck to not have someone you are close to in school. But at the same time, he lost his friends because he began to act worse and worse to people around him. \n\n\n\nQuick examples that bothered me: \n\n\n\n- Telling our gym softball team that we should have a ‘good-bad rotation’ for who bats, then labeling all the guys as good and girls as bad. there were some girls who were clearly capable of performing to the standards of ‘good’.  this really frustrated me. \n- Using a ‘kahoot hacker’ to spam our class kahoot with bots and make it unplayable.\n- Seriously saying I was  ‘just an idiot’ for asking about the rules of handball (in front of our whole gym class)\n- Arguing with our math teacher about getting a better grade until she cried\n- Helping the other team score points while playing a basketball warmup, by throwing them the ball and yelling “OOPS!!!!”. the coach asked him to stop and he told her “sorry I just have terrible aim”. he plays basketball on a competitive team. \n- Making it very clear that he is better than the rest of us at basketball by saying we are shit or babies ect. \n\n\n\nI’ll call him PT. \n\n\n\nThose were a few! Anyways. As I said above, he plays basketball competitively so he is quite good at it. We were playing a 3v3 game one day, and I was playing with two tall guys on my team. We were against PT’s team. I was shorter than my teammates, so I was defending the shortest  player on the other team, which was not PT. \n\n\nPT was bothering me the entire game, making small comments and being a douche. Of the six people that were playing, only two of them play basketball on a team. The rest of us know the rules but it’s just a general understanding. PT liked to accentuate this fact by yelling out “FOUL!” every other second. I would have let this be; however he only addressed it at our team. Anytime their team did something obviously wrong he would shrug and say “ref didn’t see it”....... There was no ref. \n\n\nAs one of my teammates is dribbling the ball up the side of the court, PT saunters over and pushes him with both hands. It wasn’t strong enough to make the guy fall over, but he dropped the ball as he caught himself. PT now had the ball. Having seen the whole thing and being very frustrated with everything he does, I yelled “FOUL!” to see if he would do anything. He stopped, asked me “what are you gonna do about it?” And then continued moving. \n\n\nWhat did I do? I did something about it! Being a 5’5 unskilled at basketball girl, and him being a 6 foot something basketball playing male, I didn’t have many options. So as he dribbled past me, I simply stuck out my foot and tripped him. He fell, and completely sprawled onto the floor. The perfect, ideal trip. The one you see in movies. I was completely satisfied with what I had done. It created a loud noise and people stopped to look. Some laughed. He just stayed there for a solid ten seconds. He got up and stopped talking after that. \n\n\nA week or so later, I found out his grandma had died some days I had tripped him. I didn’t realize that this had happened and I started to feel really bad. Maybe he had been acting out because he was mourning? It also wasn’t exactly my place to do anything to him at the time. He hadn’t pushed me, so I’m not sure I had the right to trip him. Him pushing this guy was only a two second thing but tripping him may have been to extreme. \n\n\n\nTell me:\n\n\n\nAm I a petty asshole for acting out like that? \n\n\n\nThanks :)",

While I am friends with all of them, the relationships they have with each other is extremely toxic. Our lease is ending in august and all of use do not want to live here again for another year, however since my roommates relationships are so toxic we were planning to all split off and find different living spaces. A 2 of my other roommates and I decided that we still wanted to live together, and since one of them hates my other roommates, lets call him Tim, they absolutely do not want to room with him next year.\n\nI am still good friends with Tim, however once he heard of our plan he completely stopped talking to me. We haven't said a word to each other for a couple of days. I know he probably feels betrayed, by me especially, and I do feel guilty for leaving him out, but I really need to go with the living option that is most affordable. If it were just him and I it would be much more expensive and plus he has a lot of annoying habits that really make it hard to live with him sometimes.\n\nStill, I am not sure if I made the right call, I really do feel bad for leaving him out like that but I really don't think I could handle living with him by myself.\n\nThank you for your judgement",

I talk on occasion with people that come through. Near end of the day sometime last week, one girl comes through. We start talking music festivals and other stuff. I enjoyed her company and thought she was cute. I don't flirt on the job (ok, ok haven't at this post nor most of the time) nor did I with her. But then I got her laughing and it sounded like teenage Mordred from the Excalibur film. I still smiled and chatted with her but was instantly not interested.

      "title": "AITA for staying out extra late on purpose to avoid my bf?",
      "description": "The title alone makes me sound like an asshole but here I go anyway;\n\nSome prior knowledge to the  situation:\nMy bf have been dating for roughly 1 1/2 years and have known each other for 4 total (all long distance), but have met before. When we first started dating, I had recently moved and lost contact with my friends so I was pretty lonely. Since I didn't have any friends, my schedule was pretty open ended so we spent a majority of our time Skyping and talking. We are generally able to talk out our issues.\n\nFast forward to now. I'm in college and I have a great friend group. My schedule is now full of classes, work, and friends. Doesn't sound like a lot but it's pretty time consuming. After this move he has had a really hard time adjusting to my busier schedule and has become increasingly clingy. This behavior has pushed me away because besides being clingy he has started to be controlling in minor ways; check-in texts (where he sometimes spams if I don't respond), gets mad when I come home later than 10:30pm (given I get out of classes around 6 most days), acts upset overcall but won't tell me why or even hints, wanting me to conform more to his schedule (despite time difference), etc. I've tried talking to him about it. In out conversation he seems to understand but is reluctant about it and continues the behavior a few days later. This kind of makes me feel like shit and I've been pushing away and staying out later and later some nights to not deal with the mention I feel talking.\n\nFor more insite the most recent incident which truly lead me to question our relationship is when I broke my jaw two days before Christmas break started. I had just come home around 11:30pm and called him on Skype. He was upset and so I talked with him and we moved on (luckily we're both good at bouncing back our moods for the most part). Eventually we go to sleep; we keep the Skype call running on our phones and essentially sleep together. I wasn't tired and wanted to spend time with my friends before break started and we all split. So I left my phone on my bed (call still running) and went out boarding with my friends intending to return later and sleep. It was all going well until I took a hill too steep for me and ate shit direction on to my chin breaking my jaw. Of course i had to go to the hospital around 2am and since I had left my phone on my bed, I couldn't contact him. I ended up needing surgery to wire my jaw shut which would happen the next day. In the early morning my friends were able to bring me my stuff (phone, clothes, etc.) And at this point I still haven't gone through surgery so my face was still all fucked, and it was kinda difficult to talk. I call my bf on Skype around 11:00am.\n\nThis is a paraphrasing of the conversation that insued (two of my friend we're in the room with me able to hear both sides):\n\nMe:\"Hey hun..\"\nHim:\"Hey why didn't you answer this morning?\"\nMe:\"I'm in the hospital\"\nHim:\"Oh my God why?\"\nMe:\"I broke my jaw last night\"\nHim:\"How? Wtf? Where were you\"\nMe:\"I was out skating with friends, I'm safe though\"\nHim:\"I..I'm so mad. I'm so angry wtf. Why were you with them?! I thought we were sleeping!\"\nMe:\"I wasn't tired.. I'm sorry\"\nHim:\"I'm so fucking angry right now.\"\nMe:\"I'm sorry\"\n\nRince and repeat those last two lines for about 10 minutes until my friends leave the room for a smoke break. We get into an argument and then I start to cry and just hang up and refused to message him because he just keep yelling and arguing. I got very overwhelmed and angry. My friends came back in a told me that \"I shouldn't ever let someone speak to me like that.\" He didn't once ask me if I was ok or even seemed to care except for the fact that I had a snuck out without him knowing at first which really poured some lemon juice on to my cuts. He kind of apologized later but it felt more defensive than genuine. We've since \"moved on\" from that situation but I can't really say I have. I really hurts to think about and he still continues to be this this way sometimes and I don't know what to do. \n\nTL;DR I feel like I'm stuck chosing between my long distance boyfriend, my friends, and my own personal time. I've explained this and we've talked about it but he hasn't really done anything on his side to work towards the improvement of our relationship. I've been pushing away and staying out later since then.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "I live in a resort town with my forever- partner, let's call them Ted. There are several resort locations within our area. There's quite literally something for everyone. None are quite as *upscale* and highly rated as THE resort. \n\nTed works front desk at THE all-inclusive resort. It's flashy, instagrammable, and Ted gets a generous discount on the whole package. Ted and I have been to this resort before, when he first started working there, and although we had a great time, I wasn't impressed. \n\nThe day we requested full housekeeping, and specifically asked for a vacuum, they didnt vaccum, and left visable dust and gravel on our floors. The housekeepers left a open water bottle in our welcome basket. Their assumingly high dining standards, the $40 salmon plate was ...mediocre at best. The other food options weren't better. One night we ordered a certain game-themed pizza chain instead of eating the onsite food. \n\nI took it all in stride, and of course, told Ted I had a wonderful time, but next vacation I might want us to check out something new. My birthday rolls around, and Ted wants to take me on a getaway. He suggests the resort he works at. I  eventually say \"yeah we can do it one more time.\" \n\nSo Ted books the vacation. He wants to try a spa day, a chef's dinner. I love Ted, and it was all my birthday gift, so I don't want to say anything, but I didn't have a good time at all. The spa day was amazing, but the chef's dinner turned into a $100/hour, 3 hour torture session, where the food was... lackluster, and pairings were nauseating. I realize how hoity-toity that sounds, but I have an IRON stomach, and I had it mild compared to Ted. Ted had to go splash his face halfway through dinner. It was bad. \n\nThe other.... odd thing about the vacation was that it was TED'S WORKPLACE. And Ted was non-chalant about it, but it really started to bother me. His supervisor checked us in. Ted continually called/stopped by the front desk for seemingly endless possibilities. Our spa day, he asked them to *tuck his jacket behind the counter*, despite the spa actually having lockers *for this purpose*. Everyone knew us. Someone saw us kissing and jokingly called across the lobby for us to get a room. It didn't feel like a \"just us\" time, alone, at a destination. It felt like \"Ted shows off\" or \"Ted hangs with friends\". It felt like that both times. And I don't want to return.\n\nHOWEVER upon our return, hell even during our stay, Ted has expressed his desire to do it again, for his birthday. \n\nWIBTA if I refused to do this again? I LOVE to travel and go new places. I just don't want to revisit this place a THIRD time.",

I went to go get coffee from Tim Horton’s drive through and I was in the middle of ordering when I noticed someone as walking towards my car. I quickly rolled up my window and locked my car door (still in the middle of ordering) when this guy (mid/late teens) knocks on my window. \n\nNow I’m kinda scared because the drive through area is off a busy street but it’s hidden by bushes so it’s kinda dark and really no one could really see me. \n\nAnyways I roll down my wind a crack to see what he wants and he starts asking me for a dollar or even 50cents. I told him I didn’t have anything one me and he kept on asking for anything and I kept saying no. I knew that I had at least $5 of singles in my bag but honestly I was really freaked out. \n\nAs soon as he left I was able to finish my order and get my stuff without a problem.

She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around.

      "description": "Idk I feel a bit shitty about this one because I've never done it  before, but I'd prefer to get an opinion on this to alleviate my guilt or confirm that I'm the asshole I think I am.\n\nSo the guy accidentally gave my meal and drink to the car in front of me, believing that my order was for them. An honest mistake, all good in this hood.\n\nI could deal with the food being handed back to me - I think it would be pretty obvious if someone had taken a bite out of my burger or something before noticing the error, so no issue there. I do take issue with someone else getting my drink  by mistake and then having that same drink handed back to me. Again, I'm not sure if this a totally unreasonable thing because I've never had this situation happen to me before.\n\nAfter confirming with the guy that the dribk was the same one he just handed to the car in front, I asked REALLY nicely if the guy could remake the drink. I didn't give him a reason but I kind of figured that the reason would be implied? I mean how could I possibly tell if the guy who had previously gotten my drink had taken a massive dirty swig of my otherwise pristine beverage? Fuck, I cannot begin to explain  the quandry that I was in there. \n\nThe Mcdonalds employee gave me a pretty dirty look and made me a fresh drink. He gave me the fresh drink, I said thanks and drove off. The dirty look, coupled with a generally angsty vibe I got from the guy am making me reconsider my life choices at this stage tbh:/ . I've worked in food service before and definitely know that customers who don't just take the food and fuck off can be a pain in the ass; I just thought I had a solid argument to ask for a new drink?\n\n\nTL;DR: Mcdonalds employee gave a drink I ordered to the car in front of me in a drive-through and proceeded to dish out some angsty vibes when I asked for a new drink.",

Now, earlier that very day my gf had already been ticketed for having weed on campus after someone snitched on her. So she was upset, she started ranting and then after a few moments she said \"the moment i smell weed on my floor, im ratting those [n-words] out.\" \nThe entire room just went completely silent in shock. One of my very good friends, a Nigerian, tapped my shoulder to make sure i heard it. Then he confronted her about it in a sort-of-joking way that seemed like he was just giving her a hard time. She was obviously very uncomfortable afterwards, and apologized immediately. \nOnce we were alone, however, I leaned into her pretty hard about what she said and how she should be more careful about what she says and how it can be interpreted by other people. Well, she started crying and yelling saying that I am a control freak for trying to monitor her language, and that was the end of that night. The next morning she called me and was talking like nothing had happened...\n\nTDLR : gf said n-word around my friends, I yelled at her, she cried and called me a control freak.",

This was supposed to be my birthday gift.\n\nThe main show cancelled and so the date was cancelled. I thought he might get me flowers or take me to see a movie but nothing happened.\n\nA month later we were sitting at the kitchen table and I told him that I was bothered that he made this big sweet promise and then didn't do anything at all for my birthday.\n\nRight then and there he bought tickets to a different show on a weekday that I can't go to. So now we're having to give those tickets away.\n\nI honestly didn't want a gift I had to ask for anyway.\n\nWe had a fight about it last night.\n\nNow we're in this catch22 that sucks really bad. If he tries to make up for not keeping his word, it's because I asked him to do it which doesn't (in my book) count for as much. I was raised that having to asking for apologies, good deeds, and affection takes away from their meaning. OR, if he does nothing he's kind of not admitting that he fucked up.\n\nFrom my perspective I just feel like shit about the whole thing. I don't want my husband to think it's okay to promise me things and not follow through, I feel taken for granted because I had to basically ask for an apology. Last night he did apologize. It still stings pretty bad that he hasn't actually DONE anything to show me he loves me and messed this one up.\n\nI told him I'm just going to forget the whole thing happened and not equate his lack of gift or apology with him not caring for me because I know we both just want to move on and not be upset about this anymore.\n\nAITA for trying to make him see that what he didn't do is the problem or what?",

      "description": "So here is some background. This is right before winter break. My mom and dad are divorced, and dad is supposed to get half of every break. The thing is, I hate going and never feel safe. Dad is a toxic person. Same situation with my little sister. She is 13 and I am 15. I need to mentally prepare myself for trips, as going there stresses me out.\n\nThen, the night before, which was Christmas Day, I learned it was not a week (which I expected it to be so), but instead it was 12 days. I quite literally broke down crying on the spot. So that night, I talked to my mom and my counselor about this, where both came to the conclusion that I should not go. So I did. Mom sent a text to dad saying they needed to talk, but he didn't answer, so she just told him to not come to my house and pick me and my sister up.\n\nI then go to bed. And it becomes the next day.\n\nMom gets a call, I get some texts. It is a lot of anger from my dad and his girlfriend. I wake up to my sister at my door with her tablet, and dads girlfriend telling my sister off. Later he comes on the line as well. The gist of what happened is that I am a terrible person for doing this to my father. His grandma died last year, and his family dropped him. My sister and I are the only family dad have left. And I will be an adult soon so I won't have to go anymore. So I should just go one more time for Dad.\n\nThis went on all day, including other guilt tripping and a LOT of yelling.\n\nI stood my ground.\n\nAt one point my dad called me, yelled at me about the things he knew would make me hurt, then kept on going as he heard me crying.\n\nI have not talked to him since, and I dunno if I should. I think he deleted my number.\n\nA hearing is going on soon because dad either wants mom to make my sister and I go to his house, or he wants to no longer be our parent legally. Moms offer of him being in contact, but staying overnight or going out of state being optional AND all past child support being waived was refused.\n\nWas I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: I refuse to go to dads house for Christmas break and stand my ground, rather than going for him even though he knows I am miserable there. He gets really mad.",

And get tired hat standing up sometimes.) and I was standing in a circle wth some of  my friends and I want dancing because I needed the break and this one girl I don't know that well. We'll call her Jen* for this. Anyway Jen* looks over to me and goes \"you're not gonna dance, [infinity]\"\nMe: no. \nAnd she insist on it. So I get sick of her shy so I just leave and go sit down with a couple of my friends that were sitting down in chairs pushed up against the wall.\nI eventually decide to go rejoin the circle and dance a little bit. \nAnd Jen* decides to get kinda in my face again about my dancing or not and goes \"oh good you're dancing now.\"\nSo I'm fed up with this shit because she's like the third person to insist that my taking a break is being a buzzkill type thing and I just snap on this girl and go \"by the way, I have a heart condition that means I need to take breaks.\" \nShe doesn't hear me the first time over the music so I repeat myself and then she just goes \"you didn't have to be rude.\" And walked off to go grab food. \n\n\nNot sure if I was an asshole in this situation or if I was well warranted in being a bit fed up?

So I just messaged her that I had it done and she'll see it the next time she's over,so like in 2 days.\n\nApparently I was being selfish for not sending her a picture of myself?

In all our years of arguing he never once said that he was sorry or the one in the wrong, on the contrary he usually doubles down. Now I don't want to make it seem like it's all argument all the time, there are good times we've had, but I feel it's overshadowed by his anger problems. He gets into verbal arguments with our single mother, calling her dumb, a bitch, and how he will never visit her when she gets older. She's (65) and works full time and trys to support our education as she knows it will be good for us. Now, she is no saint and comes with her own problems as we all do but I feel he crosses the line, being a 24 year old man dependent on his mother yet still calling her these names. I honestly can't do anything to stop it as he just turns the yelling toward me.\n\nWhile there is more to write on I guess I'll just get to what compeld me to write this today. So today I got home from school, my brother comes back a couple minutes after me. As soon as I greet him he says \"you know, your a pretty fukin awful trash man\" it my job to take out the trash and it had gotten full last night, to be fair I hadn't taken it out and was waiting for tomorrow. I tell him I'll take it out but what he said was uncalled for, he said \"well you never help me with the fukin lawn now, so you're the trash man and you can't even do that right\". I used to help him with the lawn until he yelled at me for \"not doing it right\" and to never help him again. I tell him you told me not to help you with the lawn, he says \"yeah, because that's my job and you're the trash man, now get to it jeevs\" then he clapped his hands as you would do to a Butler or something. \n\nI've always contemplated cutting him out of my life and just never having a relationship with him, but my mother made me promise to stick with him because\"brothers need to stick together\". But I don't know anymore. I'm not trying to make him seem awful, and I'm far from perfect and come with may a fault. But I really can't take it anymore. aita for wanting to cut my only blood relative out of my life? Is it selfish? \n",

      "description": "It's a bit weird but I have myself in a dilemma. \n\nSo my family has this bird, we have two and he's my favorite pet out of all of them. Don't get me wrong. He does nothing most of the time. But I love him to death for it. I've always wanted to take care of a pet while actually just co existing together. He was abused by the last house (he screams whenever a person or a hand is close, his middle toe was broken and never fixed so it's healed in a strange way) he was in but he's definitely in much better care now. My mom feeds him and changes his waterbowl everyday. \n\nMy family can tolerate him which I can accept. Sometimes he sings very loudly in the hours of the morning and my family is a very night owl family. I am not, I'd already be up ready in the morning to start the day. So sort of like a second alarm. It's just another thing I love about him. \n\nOf course being a bird he makes a lot of mess. And I know my dad hates messes but there's nothing he can do about it. If I remove the bird it would just be one less mess to stare at. \n\nMy mom doesn't clean his cage all that often and doesn't spend the time to actually know him like my other bird (who was not abused and very cheerful). It saddens me to see him only allow to exist in a cage. He's a beautiful blue ringneck and he loves to come outside of his cage. One week my mom was out on vacation and I let him out of his cage everytime I was near him he would come out, sit on the door and sing a tune just for fun. It's was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen a creature do and I didn't need to congratulate him because he would've gotten scared. He allowed me to just enjoy his singing. \n\nI would clean the cage myself but just last week my dad tried to clean the bathroom, which was not much he took out the trash and wiped the tiles and sink. She went ballistic. She has a weird thing where she wont clean but she wont let anybody else clean. \n\nI'm almost old enough to independently move out and get a place of my own and it would always be a scene just like my moms vacation for the bird but with a cleaner cage. A much happier state of mind than the house currently. And my whole family wouldn't need to care for him anymore. But he is also the family bird and scared that my mom will call theft on me and go crazy on my dad and brother who I will have to leave behind. I just want the bird to have a better place to be and my dad not to have to worry about another pet anymore. \n\nSo, WIBTA in taking my bird with me? \nAnd if not, I was thinking about removing him the night before but as I said he's scared of hands and people which make him scream at the top of his lungs. That would wake my family up and I don't need that. I want him to have the least trauamatic experience getting from one place to the next. But I haven't exactly worked out the details and need help with that. ",

      "description": "\"Linda\" and I have been best friends for 21 years (we're both F34). She has always been hypercritical of my lifestyle choices; mostly she disapproves of the company I keep. I tend to make friends with or date people who are a little rough around the edges and/or need nurturing, because I’m a bleeding heart caretaker. I suppose their shortcomings turn her off or something. She’s very judgey and doesn’t ever want to hang out with any of my friends. She has very few friends of her own.\n\n2 years ago, I started hanging out with a guy we know from middle school and high school; we’ll call him Brandon. She doesn’t like him because of his past struggles with drugs and alcohol (which she only knows about because I told her, big mistake). He has had legal problems and got kicked out of housing twice because of it. He is now clean, except he still drinks every couple of weeks. When he does, he gets shitfaced, but I’ve never seen him get violent or anything. He is a good guy, really smart and funny, and we are very close.\n\nSo Linda has been dating her current boyfriend for about 3 years now. She tells me a lot about him, including the fact that he has a drinking problem. He drinks like half to a full bottle of whiskey almost every night. He has health problems because of his drinking. There have been times where he was sober for a months, but he keeps going back to the bottle. He lives 8 hours away and she goes to stay with him for weeks or months at a time and I barely hear from her during those times, if at all.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I invited Brandon to move into my second bedroom because I’m broke and he was living in a crappy motel. We have a legally binding roommate agreement, so if shit goes awry, I have recourse. About two days before he moved in, I sent Linda a text telling her he was moving in. It went kinda like this:\n\nLinda: I don’t think it’s a good idea.\nMe: Why?\nL: You know why\nMe: No I don’t, tell me.\nL: Because he has a drinking problem.\nMe: Yeah, well your boyfriend has a drinking problem too and you don’t judge him for it.\nL: FUCK YOU, YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. I can’t even deal with you today, I’m busy.\nMe: Fuck me, eh? Well I am tired of your mean bitch attitude. Have a nice life.\n\nThe next day, I apologized for calling her a bitch. But she hasn’t spoken to me since. AITA?",

Her brother for example is in my band section and while him and i are buddy buddy close we are fairly good friends and we like to laugh together with the rest of the percussion \n\n\nThe third reason is the last time someone even thought that i liked her, my ex who’s in the same section as her lost her shit and started talking shit about me all over her Instagram and telling people to go and beat my ass. So I really don’t ever wanna deal with her in my life ever again \n\n\nAt the same time though, she is a really sweet girl and she is pretty and I know how much she wants to get into a relationship in general.

      "description": "It hasn't been long, only under 3 months. We are with in our early 20's and found each other off tinder. \nI was just looking for a hookup, a lil something something to ease the edge off my sexual nonexistence. He was basically a virgin and has never dated anyone. I made it very clear in the beginning that I wasn't interested in a relationship and he seemed to understand....\nOnly his behaviour was always extremely boyfriendy, I soon followed suit. And now we are dating  I'm still unsure how this came about. I guess I was enamoured by his devotion and intensity. But not really by him even though he seems very intelligent (and that is a definite turn on for me). I kept telling myself that he was just shy and needed help getting out his box but it takes SO much fucking effort to get him to engage with me. Which is weird because he is Hella interested in making us work and definitely puts in more effort than I do except when it comes to the conversation.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I am so bored with our conversation and him as a person. I don't know if it's just because he is depressed and escaping into that foggy, dense cloud that is weed addiction. Or if he is just a boring lame guy.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm with him and he seems to know that. But I am still very much keen to try make it work, I feel like there could be something in him that is worth talking too and would make me think and question life. I. Need. That. Shit in a relationship. \n\nMaybe I'm just sticking around because he is super into me and I like the validation. I have no idea and have been wondering wether to break it off for a while.\n All my friends who have met him tell me I'm settling (which is shit because how on earth can you place one person's value above another) but they don't know him when he finally does open up. My one friend says I'm being a bit of a bitch for staying with him because he could be using this time to find someone he really likes who feels the same way back. I think I'm just going along with the ride.\nIV been going back and forth on this forever but cannot come to a conclusion.\nWhat the fuck am I suppose to do",

      "description": "Recently my friends and I took a trip to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, which as the best man I planned. We don’t live close enough to drive so we flew. I told everyone to book their flight, but I collected money for the hotel rooms. One of the guys going, we’ll call John, said he’d pay for the room, but is driving due to fear for airplanes. This was planned probably 6-7 months in advance. John and I were good friends and used to work together. We’d always talk about how excited we were for the trip. I ended up getting a new job on night shift and we didn’t talk as often. Fast forward to a week before the trip. I texted John to make sure everything was set for the trip. He said that he was buying a house, and might not be able to go, but would let me know in three days. Fast forward to 6 days later. The day before the trip. I asked John what is plan was. John said he got the house, couldn’t make it, was bummed but it happens. He told me “I won’t be a bitch about the money, it’s not your guys’ fault I can’t go”. So case closed no big deal. The rest of us went, had a great time, came back. \n\nThen, out of the blue, John sends me a Venmo request without saying anything. I texted him and told him I was sorry but that money is gone.  There was no way we could have gotten refunded within a day of check in. Then John sent me a HUGE several paragraph text about how if it were reversed I’d already have the money back, it won’t be that much if everyone splits it, that it won’t break the bank for him but if I don’t send him the money it will be “fucked up and honestly probably ruin our friendship”. I told him he could ask whoever he wanted for money, but that I wasn’t giving him anything. \n\nIn the end he just asked me to forget about the whole thing, but I haven’t talked to him since. \n\nTL;DR- My friend backed out of a trip on short notice and threatened not to be my friend if I didn’t refund him his portion of the cost. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "We work at McDonald’s and lately my co-worker has been calling in a lot. So then she actually showed up to work on a Sunday, and asked if I was upset with her. I kinda of was but I was over it. She then continued to say, “I told my boyfriend I’ve been thinking about quitting.” So I was like really? Because honestly if you move on from here, then good for you. You’re making money moves and that’s the plan. But then she had a order to take and we never finished talking about it because I was leaving. \n\nThen Tuesday came and I asked my manager if my co-worker had a job lined up because she talks to my manager about everything.  When I asked my manger, I had the best intentions because I want to see how she’s doing. I care about her and so I want to know that she’s doing alright after she leaves. So when I asked my manager she knew nothing of it. \n\nThen Friday came and my co-workers “best friend” -who also works with us- told me what she had been saying.  Let’s call her bff, Liz. Apparently my manager had told Liz everything that I asked her about on Tuesday. Liz didn’t know what she talking about either, but she went straight to the source. She had blown up our co-workers phone in hopes of finding out if it was the truth. The first thing my co-worker sent was “Tell **** to shut her mouth and quit telling lies.” But the thing is Liz didn’t even know who told our manager. So then she had pretty much just confirmed that she had told me. So Liz was upset because she hadn’t been told anything. But then our co-worker was getting heated and was starting to say she wanted to come up and fight someone. \n\nSunday had come, and my co-worker acted like nothing had happened. I decided I wasn’t going to pick at the problem because we are forced to work together. My only problem is why couldn’t she admit the truth? Plenty of people have talked about quitting with managers and have never been fired. I don’t see why she would lie about it and tell others I was spreading rumors. ",

      "description": "As a bit of a background - both my wife and I are professionals, earning a good wage and have a two year old son.  We've never been one to splash cash, or show off... and we have a variety of friends.  Most of our friends however fall into the category of professionals and I'd assume household incomes in excess of £100K were fairly common.  I.e, they aren't struggling.  This will become relevant later.\n\nNow, we're good friends with a couple who live near us, who also have a two year old (a couple of months older than our son).  So it makes sense that we hang out a bit, given the kids go to the same nursery, and seem to like playing together etc.  So we do family outings to the zoo, or go on walks together etc.\n\nEverything was fine until my son started talking.  Like a real chatterbox.  We spend a lot of the time on these outings talking to our son, and teaching him new words.  We also try and do the same with their son.  The thing is he's not a talker.  Yes, people say our son talks beyond his age, but i also know he was amongst the last to walk amongst his peers. I've always prescribed to the \"Kids do things at different ages philosophy\", and as such have never really gave it much notice.\n\nA couple of times now I've received passive aggressive comments from these friends about constantly proving my son can talk better than ours.  They even said once that my son was \"acting like a trained monkey\".  This pissed me off.  A lot.  I am not showing off, he asks questions about what things are called, and repeats them, and understands them.  He enjoys it.  It's also what's best for my child.\n\nWe have now also started to get comments about the price of things, and whether we should really be getting our child a certain toy, or take him to so many places as he'll be \"spoilt\".  This is also something I'm acutely aware of and yes my son gets gifts, sure... but we have never, ever brought him something when he demanded it in a shop, and have taught him manners.  From when he was a year old we let him look at toys in the shop, but made him say \"bye bye\" to them, and put them back on the shelf himself.  Going back to one of my first points... they have plenty of disposable cash themselves it's not like I'm sending my kid of horse riding whilst they're struggling to buy food.\n\nI can see where they're coming from, and my wife seems to think we should dial our communication down with our son when we're with them, and maybe hide some of his toys to prevent comment from them.\n\nBut I absolutely refuse to. I talk to my son the same way when we're alone, and I'm not going to cater to their wants.  If this was a normal \"be aware of others feelings and circumstances\" things, I'd think I was being an ass hole.  But as this will limit my son's enjoyment of things I simply refuse to cater to it.\n\nSo, am I entitled to my views?  Or am I blinded by my son, and being an ass hole?",

      "description": "adopted a 6 year old dog about 7 months ago.  He’s 60 lb hound mix. He was brought to shelter from another state when his owner got sick.  In previous home, they knew owner was home a lot, had several dogs and found our dog as a stray a few years prior. \n\nHe was timid but loving.  He is loyal, friendly dog 99% of the time.  He’s great with kids, loves walks, cuddle, etc.  but he won’t be crated and has severe anxiety.\n\n7 months ago we put out crate, feed him in it, which he would do (and still does) but when we tried to crate train he resisted, pulls, jumps up on us to not go in.  So we stopped.  He would chew shoes, soft pillows and even chewed three doorknobs.  We left him toys, etc...didn’t stop.  We Took anything he could chew out of living room.\n\nOver summer I was home and we tried to crate train again...same behavior.   I think me being home made it worse.  He wasn’t alone very often and if he was, he destroyed anything he could get.  In early September just after I was back at work, he destroyed our couch, flipping pieces over, cut himself, etc.\n\nIn response, we made him a pen that we could walk in with him, tried to train him in it, he figured out how to get out and cut himself and hurt his face.  Further destroying our couch and anything else he could find including plastic, metal, etc.  he even opened a closet to get my coat out and eat it.  \n\nSo we got a training collar and a steel pen.  Got him in 3 times before he got out.  Had to reinforce it. I usually am the one to put him in before I leave with kids and I can’t get him in. The dog fights me for as long as I have, jumps on me, and I’m not strong enough to physically pull him in.  It becomes a battle.  I’ve been bringing him to husband at work but it’s not working out.  Dog is chewing things if husband and co-workers leave area.  It’s a garage that has chemicals, etc.  he can’t always be with our dog.\n\nWe consulted vet, put him on anxiety meds, but based on cost we can’t keep him on them forever...we also can’t afford the behaviorist/training that they recommend.  We’ve maxed out our savings with crates, meds, etc.  we also can’t afford to replace our couch so we have it taped up with a blanket over it.  It was 8 pcs. We have 4 ripped up pieces left.  \n\nHis anxiety is so severe that if he sees me getting dressed for work he cries, follows me around, and will hide if I call him to try to get him in crate.  He can’t handle being alone.  \n\nOur kids love him but they aren’t the ones fighting him and/or worried he will harm himself if alone.  We can’t go anywhere unless the dog comes because the crate training isn’t working.  \n\nWIBTA if we call shelter and surrender him?  Love the dog but worry he needs a different type of situation...\n\n",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short even though there are a lot of details. My dad, uncle I’m not really close to, and his 16 year old son are all attending a family wedding over the weekend. I’m 30, close to the groom and have already sunk a lot of time and money into the various out of state parties leading up to this, so I’m trying to do this as cheaply as possible. I agreed to split a hotel room with my dad, but after seeing the high prices of hotels in the area, suggested an Airbnb. After finding a particularly pricy one that was up to his standards, he mentioned that we should leave enough room for the uncle and cousin. I say okay, and think that’s even better because then my dad and uncle can split the bill between them as usual, and I’ll just give my dad half of his share. My dad calls my uncle to confirm, and upon hearing the uncle balk at the price, blurts out that we can split it three ways instead of two. I get pretty mad about this because we didn’t discuss this and now I’m paying way more than I planned to. Now, I know the 16 year old is in no way to be held financially responsible for the weekend. However, I don’t think it’s fair that my dad and I have to subsidize the uncle’s room share, when he and my cousin are taking up just as much of the house. It’s equivalent to my dad and I splitting a hotel as planned, then going next door and giving my uncle more money to keep things fair. Now everyone’s upset and I feel like a heel but I still think my logic is sound. ",

I do this more often than I’d like to admit, and she got really annoyed at me and told me to stop telling her to watch.

      "title": "AITA for refusing to leave the dog park and ruining a meet-up.",
      "description": "Ok, so I'm going to paint the picture. It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n",

I immediately looked at his body language and he is trying to act like he did it as a friendly gesture. I looked at my shirt, now stained, and yelled “why the hell did you just wipe your hand on me” and everyone began talking to me like I was the one over reacting, when from my point of view there is no other situation that I could see, other than him just seeing we had no napkins and thought that I would be too timid to say anything back about it. Either way, I’m not upset about my shirt, but rather the fact that everyone (including my brother who was with us) thinks it’s okay that he just used me as a napkin. ",

I was twice in a relationship with her, so the first time she broke up was because her father didn't like foreigner although I was born there. But we got back together because she changed her mind.

The message was about her losing me as a friend, if we were in a relationship and broke up.\n\n Let's continue with the story. In our second relationship, she met her bestfriend (male). They've met sometimes to go for a walk or so. But they did ask me if I want to got with them. I had this feeling that they had something going on, but they didn't kiss or so. But i could feel this connection or tension( can't describe it) between them. The next day I ignored her while waiting in front of the school to open the doos. She noticed and broke up. But before that we had a conversation why I did ignore her. I said I was jealous about a boy. But I didn't say it was her bestfriend (male), because I didn't want him to know because he was good friend of mind before  this happened. 2 month after we broke up she and her bestfriend were in a relationship. We still go to the same school but don't talk to each other. Am I an asshole?\n\nI'm sorry if I made a mistake while writing. I have problems writing. My hand is sometimes faster than my brain.",

One thing led to another and we ended up cuddling on her couch and sleeping together, albeit nothing happened beyond cuddling. Afterwards, she and I decided it'd be good if she texted my ex about what happened because my ex would find out one way or another, but now my ex is super distraught about the whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for letting this happen?

      "description": "So, me and my boyfriend have a kinda complicated relationship. We dated in 2016, and broke up after 7 months. Then, I ignored him for 2 years. But a few months ago, I reached out and started talking to him again. We soon got back together and have been dating for 4 months. But after we broke up in 2016, he became friends with the girl (we’ll call her M). They are very close, and I always suspected something was going on between them. When my boyfriend told me he liked me a few months ago, before we started dating again, I was still suspicious of him and M. 2 days after we started dating, he told me that M kissed him at a concert they both went to. (M knew that he was dating me at the time) Then, he admitted to me that him and M had been friends with benefits for a few months and he ended it when he realized he wanted to date me again. I was shocked, and angry, because it was something I expected, but also didn’t expect. I thought about breaking up with him, but I didn’t. Now, M figured out that I know they were friends with benefits, and she apologized. however, I don’t trust her at all. The second i’m gone, it seems like they’re flirting and stuff. They always make jokes about how they were friends with benefits (not in front of me but in front of a mutual friend, who tells me everything) and it makes me quite uncomfortable. I’m jealous because it seems like M is always flirting with my boyfriend, and they talk more and text more than me and my boyfriend. On multiple occasions, my boyfriend has assured me that nothing is happening between them, but a piece of me always doesn’t believe him. I’ve told him this, and he said he would never cheat on me. I’m not worried about him, it’s M i’m worried about most of the time. She has a very flirtatious personality, but she acts more flirty around my boyfriend than any other guys, which makes me very annoyed. I don’t hate her, but i just wish that she wasn’t friends with my boyfriend. Am I the asshole?",

This isn't good enough for her and she gets really upset about the fact that I have to spend more time at home, rather than living with her at her apartment.\n       I already spend about half the time at her place anyway, so it's not like we never see each other. I would expect a 4:3 split\n of staying at home and raising dobby versus staying with her to be fair. She says I'm valuing a dog more than her.

We are decent friend nothing serious and I am curious if other guys and girl for the topic of discussion feel this way, I really do not enjoy my friend (A) when she has a boyfriend. nothing against the guy she is with he is an actually a major upgrade in my personal opinion over her last one and of course she is still a very nice person who is nothing but kind and her house is always open to me and my friends (her house is party central with a hot tub and it is extremely fun.)   Me and (A) had recently graduated from Hs together and things were awesome for everyone majority of our friends are really smart and I do fall to the lower end of the intelligence spectrum with majority my friends becoming doctors, engineers and or very well received tradespeople. After me and A graduate from Hs, we stay home and decided to go to our local college. Over the summer break, this did not bother me as much but start to, so (A) is a real and very well rounded attractive women and is adored by all for looks a personality alike, prior to graduation A is complaining about J her boyfriend at the time who she has been dating for a very long time and we really do not know why, J is kinda a dick and hated her guy friends, being me and my friends who are mainly guys who hang out with her. We are different in the way that we give her the gears about being with this boy and we are very critical of her boyfriend because she just complained about him so we would constantly question her reasons for being with him so we do have reason to criticize her being with her boyfriend but at the end of the day we all agree she is an adult and she needs to handle her relationship by herself. \n\n Now the juicy bits, A breaks up with J midway through July and goes on multiple long rants about how she won't be with a guy for very long. LMAO. So things kinda hit it off between Me and A and we have the kinda odd thing between each other and we have sex and it goes from there. I go on a vacation thinking you know it might work out given time and we could potentially have a relationship but I feel like its also not enough time after the break up even though when we had sex is closer towards the beginning of August. I gave her a solid amount of time to get her self together because of her long rants. I take a vacation to California and enjoy myself knowing like whatever happen's happens, with this girl I'm sure well make it work were good friends after all and I like her company and I mean if the time and occasion occurs we are comfortable with each other to have sex so meh kinda shrug it off only to return home to her dating someone who happens to my coworker, who I have nothing against what so ever he's a good guy so what can you do so I can't really be upset about  him not knowing what we did not tell people about. Since were decent friends we worked things out but now every time I see her with a photo of her boyfriend which she constantly spams on  her Instagram account with I do get a bit angry cause now she just goes I this vicious cycle about complaining with her boyfriend not doing this and not doing that and I'm not entirely sure if it is me being mad at her for what happened between us or if it is me being jealous. Now I don't feel comfortable talking to A about this because I know she will just tell other people and I would like to keep it between us. So now I just don't talk to her at all through here and there in the group chat for a party or event we are planning. Feel like the asshole cause now I am at the point where I do not enjoy talking to her and just do not like her talking to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for feeling like this and has this happened to you before ( I'm curious) or do guys think it is because of im jealous she choose him.\n\n please go easy on me I'm worried more about judgment rather than grammar.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Went to see \"Us\" by myself last night in a theater. (It was awesome, by the way.) Got in just as it was about to start. I see a single open seat in the middle of the theater, middle of the row, just next to the walking path to the other side... I hope that makes sense. There were a group of three ladies on one side, and a couple (young, female next to the seat, male next to her). It was a small theater and was mostly full except for a handful of end-row seats. The whole row looked like this:\n\n  (More seating up here)\n\n\\_ X X \\_ X X X \\_\n\n\\_\\_(front walking isle)\\_\\_\n\n (More seating below)\n\nSo I asked if that middle spot was available, and the girl of the couple moved her purse out of it for me. I said thanks, sat down, then her dude said:\n\nBF: Aren't there any other seats?\n\nMe: Uh... sure, there's one next to you and a couple up there. Why, do you not want me to sit here?\n\nBF: ...It's just weird. \n\nThe movie was just starting so we both sat back. But I guess I just didn't understand why it was weird. I am pretty fluent in social norms. I'm also 36 and don't mind seeing movies alone. To me, if there's an open seat in a full theater, I'll take it. I felt like it was weird that he thought it was weird. I told myself that he's just young (probably around 20) and naive.\n\nContext: I don't smell bad, don't look like a threat. Just a normal dude. After the movie, they left first and there wasn't a word between us. But I just can't shake it and wanted some outside opinions.\n\nShould I have not taken the empty seat? Was I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throw away account, mobile user, yada yada yada.\n\nA bit of a background, My Ex and I, we dated for about 6 months last year. I was 17, and she was 16. I was pretty much her first love, and to me, I’m still not sure how I felt. It may have been love but let’s call it lust for now. Me and her still keep in contact regularly since she is a horned up individual and natural, (since I am a male) so am I. \n\nRecently one of my friends that I see and hangout with on a daily basis has started talking to her. I see him on her Snapchat stories and all that jazz. She asked me if I would be uncomfortable with them hanging out together. He most likely wants to have sex with her. He knows me and her have a history together but it doesn’t seem to bother him. I’m really not sure if I still have feelings for this girl but just hearing that has recently started making me wake up with night terrors about them dating. I’m starting to wonder if I should just let them do their thing, but that would probably end our friendship.\n\nTLDR: Friend wants to hangout with ex and I really don’t want them to. ",

I obviously don’t expect to live with him, but there’s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he’s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It’s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I’m not sure if there’s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It’s not getting me far, but I won’t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n",

She’s the type that always has to be the funniest, and she usually is, but she’s very type A (we always have to do what she wants, you can do her favours but not vice versa, etc). So recently I got myself a boyfriend! Yay me, right? Nope, she has decided she doesn’t like him and every time we hang out she feels it’s her right to tell me all of the reasons why (mind you, she doesn’t know him - at all). She also tells me that she doesn’t like who I am now (because I now have plans that don’t involve her on the weekend, god forbid). So I know I’m not the asshole for getting some space from her... BUT, here’s where it gets complicated.\nCarla has been with a guy for about 7 years. I knew him before I knew her and we had a wee bit of an affair (emotional affair only, but it was wrong none the less). I met her after it had started, ended the affair due to my guilt (I didn’t think it was an affair at the time but I did after I met her and felt ashamed), and then in a messed up way to absolve myself I became her close friend and inserted myself into her life (and it turns out, I’m now one of her only friends). I need therapy, I’m aware. \nSo - now I ask, aita for ending a friendship started out of guilt, where I inserted myself inappropriately in the first place, and where I’m her only friend  - simply because I don’t like how she treats me? I know I’m a hypocrite - but aita if I walk away and leave her alone and friendless after what I’ve done to her because of how she treats me now? ",

He always sticks to their sides even if they are clearly in the wrong. He is a really close friend of mine. \n\n There is this girl who is really depressed (lets call her T), she is always doing self harm to herself without seeking help. She is always cutting her arm, and she is showing it off at school like its something to be proud of, it gets so bad she even cuts her self DURING SCHOOL, she clearly has a mental problem, and everybody knows about it, she is only 12 (or 13 i don't really know her). Her friends tell her to get some help, and she never pays attention.\n\nthere is another kid who is really into fortnite (lets call him D), he is always talking about the new skins, game modes, guns, etc. And when he does start talking about the game he never shut ups. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay here is the story. We are in middle school, 2nd period (we have PE). When we get there, O starts arguing to D, for calling T a asshole. I get there and ask whats going on, O is mad because D called her a asshole (like i just said), and this might make her commit suicide, as soon as he said that i was dumb founded, how unstable must she be to commit suicide by just being called a asshole. I ask for D's side of the story. Heres how it goes:\n\nHe was minding his business. He was talking with a friend who is unimportant to the story, They were talking about new . fortnite skins. she comes up and hits him for no reason. D calls her a asshole and leaves. Apparently she gets butthurt over this, and then she tells her friends that D is a asshole, and she acts like a victim. \n\nI ask D why would she hit him, and he says he doesn't know why, and then O comes in and says because he wont shut up about fortnite. I then later agree with D saying that T is a asshole, and theres no reason for her to hit D. O starts saying that she will commit suicide because of D, i start arguing with him saying that she needs help, She is not being bullied to the point of wanting to commit suicide, and instead she is the bully. Me and O start fighting and we forget about it the next day. I felt bad because i called  a girl i don't know who has serious mental problems a asshole. \n\nEverything went good, and i haven't heard anything else from T. AITA?",

After graduation i moved to another country to continue my masters and try to find a good job for our future. Because if i stayed we could not have a decent life together and we won't be able to get married.\n\nAs expected we started to have problems and her family pressured her to leave me. They liked me but the fact that i still need to study and it's not certain to find a job afterwards bothered them. To be honest in my opinion they were right to be concerned. \n\nSince i was abroad i was alone and i have no friends nor family around and encountered many difficulties in my way. Despite that i kept most of my problems for me and didn't want to bother her or my family for that matter. On the other hand she was constantly complaining about how other couples enjoy themselves and living a good life but we are not and we're suffering.\n\nCouple months in the second year she ignored me for two weeks (calls and messages) and afterwards she said she wanted to end the relationship but then realised that she can't . I gave our relationship a second chance and ignored that event. Afterwards she started not giving too much effort on contacting me and was responding every two days. Obviously i was mad and stated the fact that we need to talk everyday at least 10 minutes and it's absurd how she can't find 10 minutes in her day to talk to me, otherwise we'll going to drift apart. \n\nShe ignored that and told me the reason she doesn't talk to me often because if we talk we will get into a fight. That in mind she kept complaining about how she misses me and kept comparing us with other couples.\n\nWhen things heated up she said it's better if we don't talk anymore untill i come back home and we discuss our situation and relationship.\n\nAt first i told her this will be the end of our relationship because 6 months without talking WILL impact the relationship and then i accepted.\n\nShe kept sending me messages time to time and i either ignored her or answered with a cold response. Untill one month before my flight she deleted me from social media and when i asked her about it she told me we were drifting apart and we both wanted this.\n\nUntil the point she deleted me i had good intentions of finding a solution and working on the relationship. I was just respecting her wishes of cutting the contact between us. After what happend with a cold heart i told her it's a shame that it ended like this and i wish her the best. For two or three months she kept sending me messages times to times and i just ansewered with only the necessary.\n\nAITA for not calling her when i went back home and didn't try to meet her and try to find a solution or when i acted cold when she contacted me the period where we supposed to stay away.",

      "title": "AITA for not returning my adopted dog when the family asked for it back",
      "description": "TL;DR Last night I adopted a dog from a family and this morning they’re asking for it back\n\nI have invested a lot of time and energy into the situation. I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I’ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can’t process the situation. Of course she can’t she’s too young. Why didn’t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren’t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what’s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don’t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn’t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn’t expect the drama to follow and she said she’ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn’t agree on over text. I guess in the family’s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I’m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she’s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere’s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn’t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don’t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it’s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n",

He got really excited and sat in front of the door waiting for me to take him outside to the car.\n\n I grabbed him by the collar and walked him out, but I didn't know that it had started to snow not too long ago and the instant I stepped outside I slipped on the ice and fell on my ass. Still, I got up still holding him and we walked to the car. I was about to open the door for him until I looked at the road and saw that it was covered in light snow. \n\nI suddenly decided I didn't want to have to deal with driving in fresh snow while also having a big dog in the car so I would just drive out to Timmies myself and leave my dog at home. I looked at Brutus and said 'no. No car ride.' And he immediately looked disappointed as we started to head back inside.\n\nAs I let him inside the house and closed the door, I looked through the window and him and he stared back at me but in a way that looked like he was expecting me to take him back out there any second for the promised car ride. I said 'no car ride' one more time and started walking to me car. I could hear him whining on the other side of the door.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So, for backstory, our roommate has very rarely been here since the first few weeks of August. During those first few weeks she adopted a cat from someone a few hours away who was abusing him. When he arrived at our house he was covered in mats and terrified. In this same week, RM's boyfriend got a house and she suddenly stopped being home for days at a time. \n\nThe cat pissed in one of her chairs, and one of our chairs within the first few days. My girlfriend and I dealt with it. Just continued to feed him and took it upon ourselves to shave him. He was much happier after that, but honestly still hated people. We told RM if we were going to take care of the cat all year, we should take the cat with us at the end of lease. She agreed to this. \n\nIn October, shortly after our boyfriend moved in, we realized the cat had peed on her futon. We threw about the pad, but I remembered her saying something about finding this on the side of the road, and the pad was already semi-gross so we kept it covered when we used it (broke college students amiright). We threw it out and started searching for a new used one. After I week, I gave in and texted her I was just going to buy a new futon pad for the frame so we would have something to sit on instead of an empty frame as the center piece of a living room. I ended up spending $200 on the pad for a new quality one. \n\nAfter about another month, we are trying new techniques to help get the cat to get along with our other cats. This seemed to piss him off, and he decided to piss right on the center of our mattress. GREAT! So we throw it away, and decide that we should probably check our roommates bed since she leaves her door open when she leaves. We find that he seemed to have been pissing on it for awhile now, and the entire bottom half of her mattress pad (\\~$57) was covered and her comforter (\\~$20 &amp; a few years old). We threw it away for her, since the smell was unbearable. We texted her and let her know what had happened, and RM immediately texted back links of a $170 dollar mattress pad and $80 extra plush comforter... We refused to buy those things since clearly we don't have that money to drop out of nowhere for upgrades of what was really her cats damages.. She says that isn't fair that we are picking and choosing what we will and not replace based on whats convenient for us, which we respond we don't understand what shes talking about, we haven't replaced anything for her to have. She freaks out, comes home and gather some of her things, and says after December she is moving in with her boyfriend. We had been expecting this for awhile so it was fine by us. She also got mad that we threw her things away, and since we had bagged them we went down to the dumpster and pulled it back out and put it in her room. We also decided to move our futon pad onto our boxspring since we can't currently afford a nice mattress, so it will do for now.\n\nRM came home a week later and acted weirdly nice.. it put me on edge. The first thing she asked me was where the futon pad was, which I replied we were sleeping on it for now. RM said she agreed that the mattress pad that we put back in her room was too ruined and so was the blanket, but for some reason only threw the blanket away. She didn't really grab anything, just left and said she had to run errands. \n\nI told my girlfriend and boyfriend that we should put a lock on our bedroom door, since we tend to keep our money in cash and have other valuables. We do it immediately after I recommended it. Very shortly after we get a text asking why we locked her mattress pad in our room. We were home at the time, and didn't know she had even been home, and so were very off-put that she would let herself in our room. Especially since I have heard her tell stories of stealing from people who she feels like owes her. \n\nSuddenly, after refusing to answer our text about when she will be by to get her stuff, RM shows up at 7am with her boyfriend and 2 strangers. They are throwing things around and generally treating my home and belongings with disrespect. They leave the door wide open while doing this, even though we have 2 cats now (we got rid of the one that destroyed our mattress - sorry kitty). I don't want to bother them so we all leave ourselves locked in our room. Suddenly she pounds on the door, and I come out and she tells me shes going to call the cops if I don't give her the futon pad. I explain calmly that I have a receipt, so she can call the cops but they aren't going to do anything. I attempted offer to help buy her a new used one, but she insisted she needed the brand new one we are currently sleeping on. I give up and go back in my room. \n\nAbout ten minutes later the cops come. I show them the receipt and tell them whats going on. They stay there until she gathers her stuff. In the meantime I realize my cat has went missing and EA and those she was with snickered while we walked around searching for her. She eventually got her stuff all out, but she was pissed when the cops told her the futon pad wasn't hers and she wasn't allowed back on the property. \n\nWe found the cat terrified in the back of the cabinet. All the people slamming stuff around spooked her. What an eventful morning.",

      "description": "So my girlfriend (27) and I (26) have been dating for nearly three years. We met in grad school (studying classical music) and have both since graduated. I’m from the US and she’s from an Asian country. We’re living together in a major US city. As my GF isn’t from the US she’s been here on a student visa (which is about to expire, but she just got another 1-year visa approved, though it limits her work to teaching music and performing).\n\nI graduated before she moved in with me and managed to get three jobs that provided me with enough income and spare time to continue to work on my skills as a musician, live comfortably, and even save a little money, when only taking care of myself. I was living in a three BR apartment that cost $1000/room with utilities when my GF moved into my room rent free (this was January 2018). She had just graduated from her program and had basically no income. She made it seem like she would find work soon and eventually we would split the cost and each only have to pay $500/month.\n\nMy GF had one teaching job for one day a week at a poorly-funded community-oriented music school an hour and a half away, where the pay wasn’t great and it was often one to two months late because the school has such funding issues. After a few months her piano teacher gave her a temporary job at our grad school that paid well enough. When that job was up she had the option to apply to a permanent position there, but she decided not to because she didn’t like the work environment (not that she had any other job prospects).\n\nNow it’s been a year since she graduated, we moved into a more expensive 2br apartment a few months ago (so I could fit my piano) at $2250/month, and she still isn’t paying rent. We talked before moving and she said she was going to pay for utilities, help find a roommate,  and hopefully even start paying some rent, but hasn’t/didn’t. I ended up finding our current roommate after not having one for 3 months.\n\nShe’s always complained that it wasn’t the right time to apply for jobs, only uses one web-resource to search for them, and passively refuses to ask her connections in the music world if they have any leads on jobs because they would never do that in her home country. As we approached last fall she stopped applying for jobs to work on her next visa. She hired a company to help with the application and even with their help she started too late. Now she’s needed to borrow $710 from me in order to expedite her application.\n\nThere are likely a lot of mental health things going on. GF comes from an emotionally abusive family that made her feel like she wasn’t capable of doing anything and never let her be in a position of real responsibility. She’s come a long way in dealing with her anxiety, but when family contacts her or deadlines approach she often shuts down for a few days and sleeps a lot(10-12 hours)/avoids work.\n\nWe were working on getting her a therapist but then waited because we read about a change in USCIS policy where people receiving federal aid (she’s on subsidized healthcare) might have their applications rejected.\n\nI’ve tried to be supportive and avoid things that seem to trigger GF’s anxiety/other things in order to help make work as easy as possible for her. But, aside from this stuff I’m beginning to get the impression that we have differing senses of what hard work means.\n\nI get up early and work until sometimes 9-10pm, whereas GF gets up aroudn 10:30am most days and is often lounging at home playing my switch by 5pm. She also has developed a habit of buying things to craft with when she’s stressed even though she has no money.\n\nI’ve tried talking to her about how supporting her is affecting me and she got really defensive and upset that I thought she could be working harder.\n\nMoving into this more expensive apartment was a huge financial burden on me, and I only did it because I thought I would get help from GF finding a roommate. Paying for this apartment, both our food, and some of GF’s visa stuff has brought me from having several thousand in savings to nearly nothing. I’m getting the feeling that she’s getting comfortable with not having to work her butt off and isn’t going to work to support herself unless she’s forced to, considering seeing me deplete my savings for her hasn’t changed anything.\n\nNow that her new visa is approved I’m planning on telling her that she needs to be paying rent within six months and that I won’t help with her future visa apps. The burden of supporting her and myself has brought on a lot of anxiety for me and isn’t feasible in the long term.\n\nI don’t know if I’m missing something here or if I’m contributing to the bad situation somehow...\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend has had difficulty getting jobs for a year. Supporting her financially has blown my whole savings. I’m planning on telling her she needs to pay rent in 6 months or else I’m kicking her out.",

      "description": "I have 9 month old twins who I love dearly. I have a husband who I love very much. \n\nBACKGROUND: (sorry this ended up being super long)\n\nI have a large sex drive, with some light fetishes. My husband has always been much more vanilla than me, but that’s fine, I could deal because the quality and quantity. When we first started dating, our sex life was very active, but over the years it’s slowly dropped off. He’s gained a good bit of weight, especially since we got married, and I think his sex drive has suffered because of it. I’m lucky if we have sex once every two months. \n\nI have always been slightly chubby. I was when my husband and I were dating, and when we got married. I’ve always been about 15lbs over my “ideal” weight. Before getting pregnant, I had finally gotten that pesky 15 off, and hit my goal weight, through obsessive calorie counting and a few unhealthy eating habits. \n\nHowever, when I was pregnant, I gained a LOT of weight. I was on bed rest (due to twins), and couldn’t do any exercise. I went from 125 to 200lbs by the time I gave birth at 39 weeks. Ugh. \n\nI’ve been struggling to lose the weight back over the last nine months. I’m down to 155 (about 30lbs over) but I’ve just been...stuck here. I can’t mentally make myself calorie count, I’m so depressed and all my mental energy goes into the babies and stress at work. I’m trying to eat a keto ish diet given to me by my doctor, but I stress eat, and I’m stressed all the time now. I’ve even started smoking secret cigarettes - I “quit” ten years ago. \n\nI also feel awful about my post-babies body. My stomach stretched so much I have this gross skin flap on the front now. I can’t look at myself naked. \n\nSo it’s no wonder that my husband and I haven’t been having sex. I try to initiate one or two times a week, and always get turned down. We’ve had sex once in the last year. He couldn’t have sex with me once my stomach was big enough to tell, and now he never feels like it. This has been a huge hit to my self esteem. It fucking sucks when you try to get all up on your husband and he brushes you off. When we were dating, I even got “dressed up” and he laughed at me and told me I looked ridiculous. \n\nI got really upset with him last night, after he turned me down again. He finally admitted that he’s not attracted to my body and my skin flap anymore (can’t really blame him there). And on top of that, he feels weird having sex with me because I’m his children’s mom, and the one time we did have sex, all he could think about was me being their mom and it grossed him out. \n\nI got pretty upset by this, so I shouted (I think it was more of a loud emotional talking) at him “well if we’re never going to fuck again then we might as well get divorced because I can’t handle a sexless marriage.”\n\nHe stormed out after literally calling me an asshole, and we haven’t really talked today. \n\nThe thing is, I DONT want to divorce him. I don’t want to live in a sexless marriage, but really I just want my husband back. The one who finds me attractive and can’t keep his hands off me. I don’t really think I’d divorce him over it, just be really sad and depressed and have a shit self image. \n\nWhat I honestly want him to do is exercise and lose weight and get his energy back, but we’ve had a thousand conversations about it and the lack of sex and how it’s affecting me, and he apologizes and then never does anything. I tried to get him to calorie count and lose weight with me when I did, but he just snuck food, and always had excuses why he couldn’t exercise. He says he’s not depressed, and won’t take any medicine. I know for a fact he’s ADD, but he won’t take medicine for that either. \n\nI’ve been feeling like shit over what I said to him all day, and I’m not sure if I’m being the asshole here or just overwhelmed and insensitive. I’m just sick of not feeling loved in my marriage, but don’t actually want a divorce. \n\nSo, AITA?\n",

      "description": "My [M 25] wife [F 30] hasn't had sex with me since the start of the year, and even then if was terrible sex and I could tell she wasn't into it.\n\nWe used to have an amazing sex life and were heavy into the BDSM scene, and would have play sessions once or twice a week.\n\nBut our relationship hit a rough patch in 2017, starting with my working hours increasing a crazy amout for nearly a month. I was working 15 to 16 hour days at the peak. Needless to say, I was waaaay to tired to participate in our normally weekly sessions, or even just pull off a quicky for the majority of the month.\n\nShe did not take it well.\n\nHowever as 2017 came to a close our rough patch ended, and our emotionally relationship was seemingly mended, however our sex life never really picked back up. I assumed it would return in time, and figured I'd let things resume naturally.\n\nIt never did. So fast forward to now, I've been forced into the sexual lifestyle of a middle ages Monk, and I've been getting more and more upset and impatient with the situation. I started to verbally press the sex issue 3 months ago (where as before I'd try to initiate with back rubs, lotion, soft kisses, and whatnot.) basically I told her the lack of sex was bothering me. She told me that I'm a hypocrite because I didn't have sex with her for that month last year.\n\nWe have now had a couple arguments about it, and its starting to harm our emotionally relationship. \n\nShe says she loves me, and I still love her, and I understand that my wife doesn't \"owe\" me sex just because we are married, but I'm in the best shape I'll ever be in, and the prime of my sexual life. I feel like its being wasted.",

      "description": "Just some background me(M20) and her(F21) Ill call her L. We've been best friends for 2 years to the point that we hung out everyday, we both suffer from demons as Ive struggled with treatment resistant depression and anxiety my whole life and shes struggled with Anorexia,PTSD, Bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. We were both at healthier points of our lives when we met and draw healthy boundries when it comes to our mental illnesses affecting each other, we've always had open communication and been honest about everything.  \n\n\nAbout 10 months ago L got in a relationship with this girl she met on tinder. They were happy for a month until L's girlfriend started fucking around and decided to \"break up\" with L because she wanted to be single. Over the next 9 months this girl remains a constant part of L's life and becomes extremely manipulative (gaslighting L, blocking L when they fought, making L feel like it was her fault they werent together) It caused L to spiral, her anorexia flared up in full force, she began lying to me about her eating habits and purging until around November when she finally realized she needed help and admitted everything to me and I was super supportive and told her id be there for her no matter what. L tried cutting her ex out of her life but refused to block her entirely because her ex also had an eating disorder and L felt she needed to be there for her. She was doing really well and the only social media she had of her ex was on tumblr until a few weeks ago, her ex posted on tumblr saying she cut herself because everyone leaves her, so L immediately feels she needs to reach out to her ex. This is when the troubles started, L knew I wouldnt be happy and began shutting me out telling me they only talk when her ex is having a hard time but it turns out theyve been having regular conversation daily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to today L tells me shes dog sitting a mutual friends house tonight and we should sleep there. Then later she tells me tomorrow shes going to have a lady friend over so I should leave and give her privacy. I ask her who is it and she tells me dont worry about it so I straight up ask her \"is it your ex\" and she says \"no no no never.\" A few hours go by and we get to the house, we decide on pizza for dinner and she decides she wants to go to the liquor store, she comes back from the store and says while half-heartily laughing \"hey so i lied to you before someone coming over tonight so I got them beer\" I ask \"who is it\" no answer \"L whos coming\" she responds \"ex is coming Im going to get laid dont make a big deal out of it\" so I tell her \"Im just letting you know I just dont even want to hang out with her so if you could tell me when shes close Id appreciate it, Im sorry if you think Im making a big deal out of this like I understand you want to have sex but, your my best friend and she hurt you so much for so long that I cant just shake my extremely negative feelings towards her, so Im going to have to excuse myself, Im also really annoyed that you lied to me and feel like you need to hide things from me but whatever youre going to do what you want, I hope you have a good night and enjoy yourself Ive just had a really shitty day mentally and Id like to remove myself before it gets worse.\" she begins to get really annoyed \"whatever just leave then like why do you care its none of your business she hurt me but I want to have sex and I know what Im doing this is my life and if you dont want to be here then leave honestly youre being so dramatic just leave.\" so I get up and leave.

Recently, however, everyone's been at their wit's end about some apartment construction nearby. It's taken months, but it seems like the only work being done is the production of noise pollution and dust. I'm sure all of these guys are just doing what their company tells them to, but the main issue is that they park in front of OUR homes to work on a building we'll never benefit from. Even worse, they take up so much space that we have to take blind turns onto relatively busy roads. While I was aware these guys were probably making minimum wage, I was fed up. I called the relevant authorities, and, sure enough, the next day, almost every single car was ticketed. And these weren't 'nice' tickets, either, I considered them pretty outrageously expensive, and I probably make almost twice as much as those guys. I don't know if their company is handling the tickets, or if they have to pay for them out of their own pockets. They still park there as if nothing happened, and the police can't be bothered to show up again and repeat the process.",

Sometimes my girlfriend will text me with a question and I’ll accidentslly respond with “Lol”. This normally isn’t a big deal and she’ll just repeat the question again after, but lately she’s starting to notice the pattern. One time I responded similarly and she said “did you even read what I wrote?” and just last night I did it again and she responded “okay, I’m just going to just stop asking you anything because it’s clear to me that you don’t read anything I send you”. She’s been distant since, but I really don’t see it as a big deal. I’m tired and mistakes happen. AITA for this?",

Growing up, my mom always made a point to say, \"halfeatendanish, go help that woman and pick up her luggage!\" if she noticed I wasn't jumping on it immediately.  I've always felt weird about jumping in like that without even being asked.  It feels like I'm saying, \"Step aside, weak woman!  Allow a strong man to do the job for you!\"  It feels insulting!  Like I said, I have no problem helping out if I'm asked, but my mom has always made me feel guilty for not wanting to throw myself in there.  Is she right?  Should I feel guilty for not doing this?",

      "description": "Not really sure how to start this. A lot of words coming, I apologize if it's incoherent. But if only one single person can read through this mess and tell me if ITA that's all I need.\n\nRight now I am in a relationship I always dreamed about.\nWe love, trust, appreciate each other really deeply and the sex is a very important part for both of us. Although we both had partners before, it's pretty clear nothing from befor our time comes even close to what we have now.\n\nI hear all the time how this is \"The best sex I ever had\". Or how with many many things we do \"I have never done anything like this, I never thought I could like something like this!\"\n\nThe thing I enjoy most is oral. And my SO always told me that he only does oral when he's in a relationship and that he needs to trust someone to even try oral.\n\nSince I have low self esteem (from absuing relationships beforehand) this really made me feel special and connect to him on an even deeper level.\n\nA few months into the relationship I was at the doctor and during the check I was told that I had an STD (nothing huge or dangerous, just a minor bacteria). So I talked to my SO how this could have happened since we don't know who got it first.\n\nI had unprotected sex once and SO told me he always protected except once when he got STD. That STD was treated though and he never had unprotected sex since.\n\nI'm very attentive when someone tells me stories so a few months later (after we got rid of our bacteria) I noticed inconsistencies with his story and after confronting him he told me that he never really protected. He had oral sex multiple times.\n\nThis destroyed me internally since I don't feel special at all and it seems as this relationship is not as exceptional as I used to believe.\n\nMy reaction was that I wanted to know everything else hat he falsely has stamped \"never done before\" or \"this is my first time\".\n\nWe had multiple big fights over the details I asked and I feel a little bit betrayed by him; even if it's silly and I know there's no reason to be jealous since our relationship is so amazing. His past was before me and that's fine. What hurt me is how he felt the need to lie about those things and create a relationship in my head that is partially artificial. He said that he regretted every partner he had before and I believe him. I know how he was used, lied to and treated like shit by everyone he slept with. That's why he told the stories because he regretted it so much he wanted me to be his first.\n\nFor me there's a difference between \"This is amazing, I have never enjoyed myself like this\" and \"This is my first time doing this, I need a lot of trust to do this thing.\"\n\nNow I really don't know if I am the asshole for digging up his past and making him go through those unpleasant memories again. But I feel so betrayed because he didn't have to lie and just could have said nothing instead of creating lies.\n\nThanks to anyone who sat through this and I appreciate your thoughts.",

I work weekends and she doesn’t, so it’s normal for us to take any time together that we can. \n\nShe’s got this habit of not knowing when enough alcohol is enough. She ends up sick, stumbling around, passing out on the bathroom floor after throwing her guts up. I hate it. I can’t explain why, but I do. \n\nI’m always careful about how much I drink and how I handle myself when intoxicated. She just keeps drinking until she hits the floor, then I have to make sure she’s drinking water, I have to make sure she didn’t hit her head on the bathroom toilet, I have to take off her clothes and get her in bed. \n\nAnyway, she texts me while I’m working that she’s going out to a bar with friends. I’m totally fine with this, I even encouraged her to. About an hour later, she texts me drunk as fuck, telling me all about how she had three strong mixed drinks and shots of this and that. \n\nMy day at work ended up shit, and I basically came home to an empty apartment and cried, out of frustration and loneliness and stress.

      "description": "A bit of context, a few months ago my sister gave me around 90€ to buy a ticket for a concert with the promise that I would give her these 90€ back in vouchers for books. Thing is the vouchers are electronical and you need a code that is sent to my phone each time which requires to be logged in with my card's credential and so on, in short I needed to be there for her to use them.\n\n\nToday after ten months of silence she came to me pretending to spend her money and order some books, so I told her to do everything and once I'd have the code I'd tell her. She said she didn't know how to and so I told her to \"Just Google it\". \n\n\nNow it's when things start to get heated.\n\n\nShe starts saying stuff along the lines of \"You HAVE to help me. I don't understand Google.\" so I told her that I only have to give her the code, nothing more than that. That's when my mother came in saying stuff like \"Ffs help your sister.\", and at this point I just wanted to get this over with (not gonna lie from this point on everything I say will be in a pretty aggressive way). I gave her the step by step process and she managed to get me the code but I had forgotten my card's pin (not the actual card's pin just the one needed for the app) so I said \"Give me some time.\" and I went through the process of recovery. While I was doing this my mom decided I wasn't fast enough, came to check what I was doing and asked how long will it take to which my sister replyed \"He's playing, he doesn't care.\" so I told them both to fuck off because that bothered me.\n\n-Note: I was already angry because of other problems, that's why I was so susceptible and they knew.\n\n\nThey shouted stuff a bit, my sister did a few things just to bother me and then they left. Once I recovered my pin I told them that, if they wanted, I was ready, but for whatever reason now my sister was mad, so my mother got mad at me cause of that. What followed was just me and my mother arguing for a good half an hour, me getting thrown out and my sister crying, I guess because of our arguing.\n\n\nHopefully it's not too much of a mess, also sorry for any grammatical errors but this just happened and I'm cold and salty.

      "description": "My father and I have always had a strained relationship. I am the only child and my parents split when I was little, so it was normal for me to have two homes. I lived with my mum majority of the time and saw my father every second weekend.\n\nIt’s been going on for a while where I would plead with mum to not take me to my father’s house. I was 12 when I first asked to take me home instead because I didn’t want to go. There’s so many reasons to list why, but in summary; he picked on my weight - subtle digs here and there, roll his eyes whenever I said something and never made me feel appreciated or loved. I’ve never heard him say that he was proud of me despite my achievements. There’s so many more things to go on about, like how he didn’t come to important events in my life, like my 18th birthday, or how he would prevent my mum from swapping weekends around so I could spend time with family. \n\nMy father got into a relationship with his now fiancée 3 years ago. About 10 months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent surgery and the cancer was removed. She’s in the process of radiation treatment now and is slowly getting better.\n\nLast time I saw them, we went into the city and it was fine. He made some horrible remarks about how much money he makes which made the day turn sour. Like I mentioned before, his fiancée is currently undergoing treatment for her cancer and so she has had to have some time off work up until recently. He made a ‘joke’ about how he “makes more money at home on the couch than she does at work” and how he has “been holding up this family.” This made me so angry because he has never provided for me and he was belittling his fiancée. My father never offered to pay for my books for high school or uniforms. My mother supported me to get to where I am now by herself. The only time he would pay for anything was when she begged him to. My mum is a single parent, who up to very recently had a small income that only went to the necessities and she really struggled with anything else. So, it’s fair to say that I didn’t see much support from him.\n\nI decided to stop speaking to him from that moment forward. I had removed him from Facebook and haven’t had any contact with him since I saw him in January. Monday just gone, I had gotten a phone call around 9:30pm from his fiancée. I was an emotional wreck, talking about my father the last few months has been a major trigger point for me and causes panic attacks and breakdowns. It’s not pretty. She told me that her cancer has a high likelihood of coming back and that she has a 6% chance of survival on the next 5 years.\n\nAfter that call, I was in hysterics. I had to explain to her why I didn’t want to see them because of my father and I was just told she may not be here in 5 years time. \n\ntl;dr: My father made my life hell, I cut him off, I found out my step mum has a small chance of living in the next 5 years after speaking to them for the first time in 2 months.",

The pricing is something like $35 for a cut, $10 for a nail clip, $5 for a wash, pretty good prices no one could complain about. \n\nI always tip $5 or so, doesn't matter what she does. She's an independent worker and it takes only about 30 minutes. She doesn't need to divide her tip with anyone or a company. I think it's fair and she has refused tips many times but I make sure she takes it.\n\nToday was her latest appointment. I wanted her hair cut only. I paid the $35 in advance and tipped her $10 in a rare case for me. I leave and do errands for 30 minutes and come back. Not only did she cut her hair, but also her nails and gave her a wash. I owed her $15 extra, she claimed. \n\nI told her it was unprofessional to do something I didn't ask for and then charge me for it, and I didn't like the idea.

      "description": "If anyone wants the (also long) prologue to this post, it is the only other post I have made with this account. FWIW everyone in this situation is 30+.\n\nLong story short, an acquaintance of my partner's and mine I'll call \"Brittany\" had been overtly hitting on him, even in front of me.\n\nI expressed my reservations about the situation to my partner. He initially didn't understand where I was coming from, but once I took us out of the equation and asked \"If I genuinely wanted to make friends with Jen (a mutual female friend of ours) and acted that way towards Jen's boyfriend in front of Jen, how do you think she might feel about it? Would that be a good way to start a friendship with Jen if being her friend was my primary motive?\" it landed.\n\nApparently my partner then talked to Brittany on a game night I couldn't attend in an attempt to establish some boundaries. I know this not because he told me, but because I received a lengthy email from Brittany a few days later.\n\nShe framed it like an apology and ostensibly a request to make friends going forward, and she did share a lot of fairly personal details about herself on which she essentially blamed her actions, but there were parts of it that felt - for lack of a better way to put it - a little passive-aggressive. Things like her claiming that she did flirt with him but stopped as soon as she realized we were a couple (untrue). Things like \"Your partner had great things to say about your looks and abilities,\" implying NOT ONLY that they discussed these things (my partner is adamant that they didn't) but that my relationship with him somehow needs Brittany's stamp of approval now that she's realized she isn't getting in the middle of it.\n\nBetween that and the fact she only expressed a willingness to tone down her behavior after being directly called out on it by him, I'm hesitant to believe that her message comes from anywhere genuine.\n\nWIBTA if I totally ignore all 12-ish paragraphs of her \"apology\" and continue to keep her at arm's length going forward?\n\nI talked to my partner and he supports that course of action, but I'd like a broader perspective since I'm still likely to run into Brittany at practices and games and she may or may not choose to start discussing the situation with our mutual friends, a la \"ProfanePsittacine isn't accepting my heartfelt apology for a misunderstanding between us.\" She has now begun liking and commenting on everything I post to social media, so I'm definitely going to *look* like the asshole to all our friends if I continue to keep my distance.\n\nTL;DR: want to know if I am obligated to accept an apology from, and bury the hatchet with, someone who is now being nice to me on the surface after a call-out but whom I still have a bad gut feeling about.",

She has helped me through my break up with Girl. I figured it’d be nice if I brought Friend some popsicles and a stuffed taco to her house while she’s recovering. Friend lives about 20 minutes outside of Pittsburgh so me and a friend made plans to quickly drop off the gift to Friend then spend a day in Pittsburgh. It would be about an hour and a half drive to Friends house from where I live. We brought her the things and left very quickly.\n\nI then get a text from Girl saying how weird that was and how uncomfortable it was. She was very upset that I went and “stepped over boundaries” that we never set, mind you. I tried to explain to her that yes, we broke up for the time being, but Friend has become a very close friend of mine. She didn’t like that answer and said it was weird.\n\nReddit, AITA?

      "description": "My wife and I bought our first house back in July. We did the walk-throughs, the inspections, etc etc with no signs of any real problems. The previous owners did have about a dozen cats and the smell was... interesting.. Like cats and lavender air fresheners. We attributed it to just having that many fucking cats. We assumed when the owners, the cats, and all their shit was gone we'd be able to manage things with a thorough cleaning and some new paint. Holy shit were we wrong. Long story short I spent the first month of homeownership working all day (building someone else's house ironically enough) then coming to our house until midnight and ripping out oak flooring, subflooring, floor joists, drywall and framing in about 8 different spots. Words cannot describe how fucking gross it was when I got into it. Needless to say we weren't happy. We were pissed (no pun intended) at the Realtors, the home inspector and mostly the previous owners who, when confronted about it, told us \"we had no idea, good luck though\". FML \n\nNot much longer after the work was done and I could move my family in... the packages started arriving. It wasn't bad. Maybe one or two a month until Xmas then it was every week. Each time I received a text from her before I got home with some line like \"oh so sorry, we forgot to update our address\" or \"oh, this was something that was backordered\" each time saying it would be the last time. Seven months later and shit still shows up here. My wife and I hit the limit of our patience and told them any other packages or mail would either be sent back or I could invoice her $20 to handle the package. It was not about the money at all but more about them getting their shit together. I was met with a very pleasant \"fuck you, you don't touch our stuff\". Did I mention what class acts these people are? There's plenty more to the story but this is enough for context I think.\n\ntl;dr previous homeowners ruined the house with cats marking, covered it up with air fresheners, played dumb when confronted and told me to go fuck myself when I asked them, after seven months and dozens of packages, to stop having things delivered here.",

Elisa has been using the keys to come back home at night before the rest of us arrive (we all work late hours) and put them back there after every use. Starting yesterday, Emma is having a friend of hers (Robert) stay in her room to visit the city while she is away on a business trip. She told him about the keys so that he could use them too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 8:50 p.m., my guest called me saying the keys were not under the pot any more, there was no one at home and she couldn’t get in. I am at my office, which is a 1.5 hour commute away and I still wasn’t done with work. I message my housemates asking where the keys are. It turns out that the other guest has taken them with him and is now having dinner with Karen and some friends 40 minutes away from home. I tell Karen to tell him to go home and open the door for my guest, because otherwise my guest will have to wait for me to get back to go in (10:30+). She tells me he is having dinner. To that I replied that he could resume the dinner later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey stopped replying to my messages and in the end my guest had to wait until I arrived at 10:30pm to go in. Robert turned up at 11:20.  \n \n\nMy flatmates now say IATA for expecting Robert to go open the door. They say that I should have told my guest to go to their restaurant to pick up the keys herself, but I think Robert is the asshole for not going and having my guest wait outside for over 1.5 hours.\n\ntl;dr: Friend’s guest took common spare keys away, locking my guest outside.

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nI played lords mobile a few months ago and I joined this clan. As it is a pay to win type game my wife only let me spend 15 a week which I used mostly on heroes. This allowed me to get moderately powerful and I made a few friends. I met this dude (I am assuming he is a he and not the she he said and we will get to why later it’s important) who posing as a female (again assumed) recruited me to his guild out of mine. \n\nHe attracted me with saying he was good friends with the top guild protection yada yada. And did pretty good Sith Lord role play which I found entertaining so I joined. He was overly flirtatious and after I joined the line app group he/she decided to try to keep me from going else where by giving himself/herself to me and sent me supposed pics of herself. \n\nBefore even thinking about reverse image I could tell things were amiss as the images were not of the same person. Not to say the bodies weren’t similar but my suspicion was confirmed when reverse image look up showed was a rips from two different Swedish instagrammers and he/she claimed to live in Florida. \n\nNow I admit I didn’t tell my wife what I found or what was happening and I regret that but essentially I decided to play along but worked in the back ground to destabilize the guild. \n\nRead:I made a dummy account and through it fed her details to bad guys and generally did what I could to destroy her as by the end it came out she was doing this to like 9 other people and would commonly just send out straight porn and claim it was her (no face, but I will say he learned how to gain and lose a tan fast) my wife says i crossed a line even though I didn’t send pics I just sent words.\n\nI showed her all the conversations and my evidence that manipulation was at hand and that I was merely enjoying the mind games cause I am a truck driver and traffic makes me feel like being evil sometimes but we disagree on what we call it. She admitted she knows I’d never do anything physical but she think I went to far with the ruse and I should have called him on his bs and moved on. \n\nI stopped playing lord’s mobile since and behave. The wife has forgiven me but we are working to rebuild trust. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Here’s some background information:\n\nI have a pretty close friend (I’ll call her Lara) who has been in a relationship with a guy (I’ll call him Chad) for about a year now. I have three other friends in our friend group, though only one (I’ll call her Derren) is relevant to the context of this story. I do not personally drink or smoke, and only Lara drinks/smokes regularly with her boyfriend in our friend group.\n\nNow, on to the story.\n\nI have known Lara for a few years now, so we are pretty close. About a year ago, she started dating this guy, Chad, who me and my other friends don’t know very well, but have seen. Chad is a high school drop out (he didn’t attend his classes enough) and now attends community college. He has smoked weed and done several other illegal things, and all with Lara. \n\nAs she’s been dating him, I’ve heard stories from Derren about Chad being a huge douche to Lara (though I cannot confirm any of these stories as they have been passed on to me by Derren due to the fact that Lara has stopped telling me about the things she does because I’m “too judgemental”). Lara’s emotional state has gone down, and has become more cruel and inconsiderate. Shes gotten to the point where you can physically see the emotional baggage on her, but refuses to break up with Chad. Both me and Derren have expressed our concern for her, but when we try and explain to her what a bad influence he is, she gets extremely defensive. She doesn’t see the problem with consuming so many drugs, drinking so much regularly, or having constant unsafe sex with him. (Did I mention that he gave her e. Coli and a kidney infection?) Now, I’m not one to judge people if they wanna do stupid stuff as long as they don’t get me involved, but this is ridiculous. I’m a good, rule following student, but they’re making bad decisions voluntarily so I can’t control them.\n\nLara has always had a pretty annoyingly large ego, and has been relatively selfish and an attention whore in the past, but it’s been getting exponentially worse as she continues dating him. Not only is she now a much (and for the lack of a better word) worse person, but it is very clear that Chad is the problem and she refuses to accept it. Derren and I both express to her regularly why she needs to break up with him, but she doesn’t listen. She has caused me to almost resent her to a certain extent, and it’s been the cause of a LOT of issues within our friendship and group. She claims “we don’t know him well enough”, but the issue with that is that Derren knows him well enough to know that’s not true. I’m legitimately concerned for her wellbeing, and I think he’s an awful influence on her. \n\nI’ve told her numerous times to break up with him, but every time, the response is the same, in the same quiet little “I’m such a victim” voice:\n\n“Why do you hate him so much?”\n\nAITA for hating Chad and wanting Lara to break up with him?

      "description": "In school, I have a usual group of friends I hang around, one of these friends is Al.\n\nNow, no one really knows if Al is autistic or whatever, but he definitely is slow. (His parents have talked about having him tested, but they never did because his dad was too scared of it coming out positive.)\nAlthough he gets picked on, he doesn.t let it affect him easily. He tells me about how he never really was well liked in schools before, and I wasn.t either. But he, unlike myself, is mostly a happy and energetic kid.\n\nWell, except when he.s asked to do something..\n\nYou see, me and my friends sit mostly on the same tables. Even most the teachers know where we sit, so do the lunchtime staff. We usually leave quite a mess and recently we.ve been getting warnings from staff about cleaning up after ourselves. I am usually the one who tries to get people to clean up, to save us from detentions, but Al almost always makes quite a lot of mess and never really cleans it up.\nAl is very VERY stubborn, he always has been. Asking him nicely, shouting at him, doesn.t matter. He won.t do anything anyone says.\nEven when I kindly ask him not to hug me every 5 minutes (he.s a clingy person), or ask him not to stand too close to me, or not to throw things, he keeps at it!\n\nI get irritated easily, quite easily, very easily. You can see how this would get on my nerves at times. I oftentimes call him out on this behaviour and “throw shade” at him for being stubborn. I wasn.t always like this, but over the last few school years, I became more distant and angry. Not even I.m sure why. Him bringing unwanted attention by being stubborn and, truthfully, lazy is extremely annoying. He always get quite upset when he.s scolded and apologises a lot, but almost always persists afterwards.\n\nWe talk about this often, we agree that it could be school.s fault (because most people there are very judgmental and I get very on edge at school), but I.m never sure. Maybe it is him and he.s the reason I.m so constantly on edge, maybe I should loosen up, I don.t know.\n\nI.d also like to note, other friends also call him out sometimes, call him annoying, but never as much as me. \nAlso, this isn.t just about the tables, but that was a recent example.\n\nI really don.t know who the true ass here is, so I await judgement with hope in finding answers and/or compromise.",

      "description": "So my girlfriend who I’ve been dating for 3 years constantly cancels our plans and makes up excuses or changes them to go and hang out with other people. I try to make plans and she will confirm them but on the day that they’re set for, she cancels them and goes and hangs out with some other girls or a group. \n\nAt first, I didn’t have a problem with it because everyone needs time to be with other people instead of their significant other and she would still see me about twice a week. I’ve gotten upset before because no one likes having their plans cancelled on them but she just got mad at me saying that she doesn’t see why it’s such a bad thing and that I was being controlling. I don’t think I’m being controlling because I didn’t get upset until she cancelled them 2-3 times a week and went out with other people.\n\nAs of now, it’s worse than ever before. I see her *MAYBE* once a week for a few hours and even when I see her she’s on her phone and just seems disinterested. When she’s interested she’s the most lovely and fun person to be around and our personalities just click incredibly well. I’ve told her before that she shouldn’t tell me “yes, we can absolutely hang out” if she just intends on cancelling our plans, if she wants to hang out with other people just tell me. \n\nThis has caused a lot of recent fights between us and I’m upset that she does this and she’s upset that I’m controlling her or making her decisions for her and she doesn’t think it’s a big deal to cancel. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I’ll preference this by saying I’ve been a waiter, I know how awful it is when people don’t tip when their meal was fine. I also get how frustrating it can be when their meal doesn’t go fine for something that’s entirely out of your control and your tip suffers from it. But at the same I feel like some servers have a chip on their shoulder about it. \n\nMy friend works at a very upscale restaurant. We met for drinks after his shift once and he was furious a customer didn’t tip. He’s in he boat that the couple who saw the rat weren’t negatively effected by his service so he should’ve been tipped. I told him that if the restaurant is charging that much for their service they’re asking their customers to put in an investment that it’ll be a great service. When something as off putting as having a rat scurry under your table totally destroys that investment  and now don’t want to give anymore money towards an experience that was ruined. \n\nHe’s also had customers give lousy tips because they had to stand 15 - 20 mins in line to use the ONE bathroom.  This one I’m a little more conflicted on but at the same time i feel I would be pretty pissed too if I dropped a lot of money on a dinner and had to spend a third of it waiting in line to use the bathroom.

      "description": "This person, let’s call him Alex, used to be my best friend. Alex and I were so close, and wouldn’t hesitate in telling each other any secret. Last couple of years, everyone liked Alex. In fact, they would all say he was the best guy they had ever met. But these 2 years, something happened to him. His attitude changed so suddenly, *I* don’t even understand it. \n\nWe didn’t talk as much, just because for some reason he wasn’t interested in talking to me, so I didn’t want to bother him. But this continued for a while, until we weren’t considered best friends, but we’re still close. \n\nMost of my friends ask me’”how do you deal with Alex?! He’s such a bully omggg. So rude, ignorant, mean, terrible!”.          \nI used to always stand up for him when someone would say that about him to me, and sometimes I would succeed in convincing my friend that Alex isn’t the complete garbage that they thought he was. \n\nHowever, when Alex started talking badly to me, I was kind of shocked. I ignored it, and was patient with it. It has been almost a year of me being patient with his annoyance. So I often tell my friends, “it’s his insecurity, don’t worry, he’s a great person deep inside”. \n\nI’m actually worried for him, because I don’t think he’s realizing that everyone dislikes him. And I’m not even slightly over-exaggerating that part. He changed so much, I can’t even believe it. I want him to somehow know that he should change, or else he would be left with no other friends. And it would terrify me to witness one of my friends go through such a thing. \n\nAm I the asshole if I tell him that he needs to get himself together, and have better manners or else he would be left all alone?

We felt awful we didn't help her. It's not like she was in danger or anything, she'd just have to hike out sooner that she wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, she should have come more prepared I guess?\n\nReddit were we assholes for not offering her some of our food?

My daughter loves her grandma and, don't get me wrong, I love the relationship, but.....\n\nWe're on the worse side of broke. We've asked her for money who knows how many times, I don't even know how much we owe her. For context, her parents (my daughter's great grandparents) both passed away last year. Their deaths hit MIL pretty hard, especially because they were a few months apart (3 max), and her way of coping was shopping sprees. I didn't like it from the beginning because I knew that as soon as she got her head straight she'll start bitching about how much money she doesn't have because \n1) she has no monetary discipline\n2) because of #1 her three sons (all adults) also have no monetary discipline\n3) her parents had no monetary discipline\n So because of this, everyone is broke. \n\nThis is all relevant in the fact that we were all hit pretty hard last year, so my husband and I promised that when we got our taxes we'd give her the majority. She got $6,000 out of roughly $10,000. A couple of days ago, maybe a week now, she hit a bump because some hardware store took money out of her account for a debt her father had left after passing. This was at the same time my husband was to pay her some bills (she's sort of our landlady). We were admittedly late by a couple hundred due work being a little slow, but we had plenty of time to give her the money before the bill was actually due. She bitched anyway because she was broke beo of her father's debt.\n\nToday she had my daughter all day until tomorrow for a sleep over. I was already sketchy about it because everytime my  daughter goes over she gets some new toy that her father nor I could afford. Now, for the most part this is fine, but today she got a bike. Her very first bike. We were not consulted about this. We had planned to get her first bike for her birthday (she's turning three). On top of getting her her first bike, she immediately got to work on trying to teach her how to ride it. This was personal to me. I grew up without a dad so I was really REALLY looking forward to watching my daughter have that moment with her dad. Now she won't being her grandmother chose to do that.\n\nAm I overreacting? I'm putting this up there with me telling my husband that I didn't like her kissing my babies on the lips when my daughter was first born. She still does this and husband plays it off as \"this is what my family has always done.\" when I told him it bothered me that she was \"having a difficult time kicking the habit\" ",

I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn’t help but wonder why she and her husband didn’t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I’m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n",

      "description": "Hey guys, new to this so I hope I get everything right. So back story, I'm from South Louisiana which is primarily Catholic and Cajun/Creole. Very, very, very different from North Louisiana which sits in the Bible Belt, hardly no Catholics, only Protestants (nothing wrong with that)! Anyways more backstory because I fuck with backstory. Cajuns and Creoles are very different from the rest of the Louisiana population. Yes, we like to get drunk and yes we have accents. There's a homely vibe that radiates in South Louisiana, more than anywhere else in the South. Cajuns (which is who I'll focus on because I am one) were at the bottom of the totem pole. My grand parents were beat in school for speaking French, people thought we were the lowest of the low. That being said, it won't suprise you to find almost anyone in South Louisiana willing to give you a hand, invite you over for some dinner, or give you a ride. It's a community that you can't find anywhere else. And remember that we are NOT white trash, but rather coonass. Come visit some time, try the best food in the world, come drink, come saltwater fishing or alligator hunting and I promise you'll never want to go home.\n\nAnyways, I moved up to North Louisiana for college around 2 years ago. I got a great group of friends, rushed a fraternity, and got really involved with the school. They all tease me a lot because of my accent but they love me just the same. I love to cook, it's my passion and I'd like to think I'm pretty damn good at it. It primarily consists of gumbo, jambalaya, or fried deer backstap, my top 3. I will cook every 3-4 weeks and invite over 15+ people, and I will normally pay for it all myself but as long as I got all my podnahs over here drinking and having a great time, I'm happy. I have a buddy in particular who I get down with all the time, we always got each other's backs. But everytime I cook, he comes over and eats and complains about it. \"Oh it's too spicy.\" \"Too much salt!\" \"Too much Tony's.\" This man literally told me, too much Tony's... Tony's seasoning is literally in my blood... It's my bread and butter for any good dish. He never enjoys my food. Keep in mind, when I cook, I don't make it how I eat it because I promise no northern could eat what I could handle... Joke! Don't get mad! Anyways, I make it not as spicy so people can add to make it how they like it.\n\nSo tonight I invited a few people over, but not my friend in particular, to have some seafood gumbo I had cooked for Christmas and froze. He didn't get an invite and messaged me asking what I was doing. I told him nothing and he called me out for lying... Am I the asshole?",

I asked her if she lives here, and asked her to please remove her items as that is specifically for people in this complex. She laughed at me and drove away.

It’s literally collecting dust now. \n\nI have been selling some things recently because I lost my job and have the time to sort through our stuff. And ok yes, I can use the money. \n\nHe says “it’s one of those things that’s good to have” and I’m going overboard with the selling. I also sold an ottoman today that we dumped in the basement because he said he hated it as soon as it arrived at our house. The ottoman was about 6 years old. Now he’s upset about the ottoman because he said he would use it when he was working on his hobby in the basement. \n\nI was on the fence about selling the sewing machine but I’m getting back about 80% of the retail price, and the woman buying it lost everything in a house fire last year and said it would be “life-changing” to be able to sew again. \n\nI’d love to have the time and talent to use the machine more often but I’d rather it go to a good home where it will be appreciated. \n\nWhen we need our clothes altered, we take it to a tailor because I don’t have the skill to alter clothing ourselves. It’s a very complicated, advanced machine and I’d rather have one with fewer features so I can get my hands around it before moving to more advanced techniques. ",

I try to ignore it but shes never more than 10 ft away from me in this massive store with plenty of other customers. I try on shoes and decide to buy them so I move up to the front of the store and she follows me. My social anxiety was triggered and I started shaking.  FML. My mom asks me to wait before purchasing the shoes because she might have a coupon. Time is moving so fucking slow and I look up just to make I contact with that sales associate. I say hi and she turns around and goes around the aisle to stand behind me. I put the shoes away and told her that her patrolling and staring had triggered my social anxiety and that I needed to leave without making my purchase. She understandably didnt know how to respond and just stared some more. I left and am now shaking in the bathroom. Maybe she thought I was shoplifting shoes in my skin tight yoga outfit. Maybe she thought I would tell the register that she had helped me make my purchase. Was I out of line for saying anything? My anxiety is my problem and not her responsibility right?",

I was drunk and said yes without thinking things through. Although, mind you it felt like us dating was imminent. \n\nThe next day I told her I wouldn't be online / talking to her for approx. 3 days. I've been feeling very stressed lately and my life has been extremely draining socially, which is difficult because I really value alone time. I am also sick atm and away from my phone. I told her that I was not just ignoring her but everyone who I am friends with. This is something I will often do, although because I don't talk to my friend's as much as I do her, normally I don't have to put a disclaimer like this. My friends will assume I'm busy. She will assume something is wrong. \n\nJust today though her Grandpa died. But I still could not bring myself to text her/replying because the very act of doing so feels extremely draining and I'm worried I can't be there emotionally and will just become growingly aggravated, only making her more distressed. \n\nI am not an emotional person, and although this is something I tried to tell her going into it, I feel like she still relies on me, pretty heavily, for emotional support. This is a relationship unlike anything I have had before as my previous boyfriend never had to be emotionally comforted, and would prefer to pretend everything was fine and distract himself (my preferred way to deal with things too). Further more, none of my friends rely on me emotionally either (they know it's not my forte). \n\nAm I the asshole for not being there for her right now? \n\n*Also I've kind of caught onto the fact that I am the asshole, but I'm kinda trying to get an idea of how much of an asshole.

      "description": "This is something that plays on my mind a bit. I haven’t had anyone tell me off for it but I do wonder if I’m being an asshole. Would appreciate Reddit’s feedback.\n\nI started a new job three-ish years ago around April. Settled in very quickly and it was a fun office although my director is a little bit difficult.\n\nChristmas comes around and we decide to do Secret Santa. There are around 30 of us in the office. I got my boss. We get on well generally and both like a laugh. I knew he likes a drink by this point so I got him a bottle of Jägermeister. He seemed to like it. I had to leave early so as I said goodbye, Happy Christmas etc I popped it on his desk.\n\nA few days later I learned that when he left to go home (after me) he picked up the bottle and in front of all my colleagues dumped it on someone else’s desk and said “You can have that.” And walked out.\n\nI was a little bit bothered to hear about it because it was a new position, I wanted to have a laugh and make a good impression for my first Christmas with them. We have a lot of banter in the office and, now, I do like to give him a bit of grief for it each year around Christmas time. He really does **not** like it when I bring it up though.\n\nI feel like he was rude to do that in front of everyone else after I’d gone home in the first place and a bit of teasing each year on my part is no biggie. To be clear, I’m still working there, my job isn’t at risk, and we have a decent relationship.\n\nAITA for winding him up?",

      "description": "A friend said she wanted to get a particular tattoo \"in honor of her father\" who passed away several years ago.  Tattoo isn't a name/date or anything like that - just an innocuous, regular tattoo (think, like a flower, or a feather - like that... though the object did have significance to her dad I guess).  I was a little surprised and asked, \"Didn't your dad not like tattoos?\"  I didn't know her dad SUPER well, but I met him enough times to have a general impression of what kind of attitude he had about tattoos / piercings / etc.  She confirmed- as somewhat typical for his generation, he did not approve of tattoos (IIRC she also didn't pierce her ears until adulthood due to his disapproval of piercings either, sooo).\n\nAnyway, I pointed out fairly mildly that if she wanted to do the tattoo because it has special meaning for her that's cool, and if it reminds her of her dad, that's cool too, but it probably isn't quite right for to say a tattoo is \"in honor\" of dad if dad actively disliked and disapproved of tattoos.  Another friend snapped that I was an asshole for saying that, that if someone says something is in honor of someone, then it's in honor of them.  Of course I feel like I was just pointing out a truth in that you can't honor someone with someone they actively dislike(d) - that's kinda like DISHONORING them right?  Like if you donate to an anti-LGBT organization and \"gift\" that to a LGBT person, that's not an honor, it's an insult.  Dramatic example, but the principle stands.\n\n(FWIW I wouldn't have said something if her dad had recently passed away or the emotions were still raw; grieving people get a wide berth and much compassion... but she's fine and it's been several years so I thought a mild semantics correction was OK).  We're all cool now and not in a huge snit, but I was wondering reddit, AM I the asshole?",

And 99% of the time, she is a pleasure to be around. So now that that is out of the way.\n\nShe stinks after sex. Shes not obese, shes actually very healthy, she doesn't eat any foods that i believe would cause BO, and she puts on perfume and prepares herself for me before sex.\n\nThere has always been a slight smell afterwords, but recently its gotten to be unbearable and shes unable to notice. The issue is her sweat, she just sweats a lot when exercising. I can fuck her for 15 minutes and she will be drenched in sweat, which during the sex I don't mind because it looks sexy and im too in the zone to smell anything.\n\nHowever after we're done she always cuddles up to me for a good hour or so. I am tired so i dont want to get up, and i dont want to be rude. During that time her stench is just on me, and I hate talking about her like this because she is very kind and beautiful, but its becoming an issue now.\n\nI have debated this for idk how long. I can't just tell her to go take a shower because she'll know she stinks. But i am reaching the breaking point here. I love her and i dont want to hurt her but i want this to stop.\n\nWIBTA if I just told her, honey you have body odor after sex? ",

      "description": "This has been an issue of mine for over two-ish going on three years now. I’m a 20 year old female living at home still with my mother and two brothers. All together four people and one dog. We live in a very small house with very small spaces meaning the potential for clutter to get out of hand is always abound.\n\nHere’s my biggest issue. My mother is always expecting me to clean up the piles of messes around the house like it’s specifically just me who’s doing it and it’s starting to really get on my nerves. Her argument is that it doesn’t matter if I made the majority of it  were all using the same spaces so we should all work to maintain it. That’s sound logic except I’m not the one making the major messes, but I’m the one getting harped on the absolute most. \n\nMy biggest issue here is one of the majority of the messes is from the dog my mother ran out and adopted and decided to take no effort in training at all. This dog was never potty trained, and my mother hasn’t really taken any real effort into doing it. \n\nHer idea of training is just throwing random puppy pads around the house even though the dog has already marked several areas, and continues to just pee on furniture and the bathroom floor. \nI’ve begged her to train the dog or enroll him in some form of classes because the dog bites me and has and continues to  destroyed a lot of my personal items and clothing.  \n\nEvery time I bring up her lack of training and how generally disgusting this all is she acts like I’m being a complete asshole. She told me that I should pay for training since she can’t, and if I’m going to continue to complain then I should take the effort. I told her this is unfair to everyone else in the house and if she can’t be bothered to properly train the dog that we’ve had for over a year she’s should give it away to someone else who’s actually willing too.\n\nBecause of this I’ve just become depressed and passive aggressive. Now I just walk over and around puddle of urine because I feel like a maid cleaning up after an animal that i didn’t want and isn’t mine. I barely stay in the house anymore became of this. It’s awful. Meanwhile my brothers stack and pile up dishes in the kitchen, and leave things scattered around and have never really been yelled at or told to clean up after themselves. \n\nI know I’m not the most perfectly clean person. I can be messy and disorganized like everyone else but I try to keep my shit contained so no one else deals with it regularly.\n\nPlease am I being an asshole? Do you have any suggestions? \n",

      "description": "My friends sister and I are acquaintances, because of my friendship with her bro. Their family has been nothing but good to me. Even has extended their home as a place I can go should I ever need to go somewhere\n\nI have a very strong and reliable connection, with a big time venue in my city, to obtain off the market complimentary tickets to shows and sporting events held there. Historically I have attended events with my friend, given a pair of tickets to his sister, and given a pair of tickets to their parents. To let them go see a shows they were interested in, as a kind gesture from me. Doing this favor costs me nothing, and I get to make people happy so I like doing this from time to time. I have sometimes given tickets to people I work with, but not always. I get uncomfortable when people ask for the favors, as I feel it is my favor to offer but not theirs to ask for, Generally speaking and mostly with work colleagues. I need to work on saying no to people I feel have no business requesting tickets from me, especially comps. I sometimes make an exception and require them to pay for the tickets (paid to the venue not to me) as the buying opportunity is a favor enough.\n\nMeanwhile friends sister had requested a pair of tickets for a show coming up in a couple weeks, literally over half a year ago, to which I already agreed. My girlfriend wanted to also see the show so I set them up with a pair as well. I'd have joined her but not my type of music. She took her friend, I soon learned that my girlfriend and her friend were very close to my friends sister and her friend at the show.\n\nMy girlfriend was upset with me for giving my friends sister tickets to that show because.. her reasoning,\n\n 1. I am not even friends with the girl.\n\n 2. She only texts me when she wants tickets, which is about once a year. (But I see her in person far more)\n\n 3. she doesn't want me to be taken advantage of\n\n 4. lastly that I dont know her like my gf does, and that she is a mean girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI presume that she may be referring to experiences she had with my friends sister in the past and throughout their friendship. I dont know, I have asked and my gf has not said that she was ever nasty to my gf in the past or anything.\n\nPart of me feels like my gf might want to feel that she can go to these shows exclusively because she is with me, and doesn't want other people she knows, able to benefit from my connection. But that's just a thought, I'm not a girl so I really struggle to follow how they think and rationalize sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward. Gf and friends sister made up and are friends again. Friends sister wants to go to another show.\n\nI am literally trying to make everyone happy and imo taking care of my friends sister is being nice to not only her, but her family as well, including my friend. I see myself being a good guy, making people happy..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Am I the Asshole for taking care of my friends sister on her request for the pair of tickets?",

      "description": "AITA for playing that second League of Legends game?\n\nEarlier in the day, I invited my boyfriend to come over to watch the Superbowl with me. He agrees but tells me he's leaving early because his family has plans to go visit his grandparent's house. And so I send him back to his house, assuming his parents will then take them all to his grandparent's house to celebrate.\n\nI get home and start a League of Legends game with some rando friends of mine (people I've met over the Internet), and we play a game. Halfway through the game, my mom yells at me to help her with the turtle tank, and I'm really distracted. By the time I refocus back on my game, I noticed my boyfriend's been spamming me in League chat.\n\nAnd when I say he spams me, he SPAMS me. I can never EVER tell what he's even upset about because he puts like 3 messages where he's actually talking sense and then spams a single character \"?\" or \"a\" or whatever over and over again.  This time is even worse because he just spams \"HELLO\" and \"?\" Probably 20-30 or so within 5 seconds. So I tell him \"hello\" and \"yes\", but he continued to spam nonsense so I tell him to \"SHUT THE FUCK UP\" and to \"stop being a baby\" since he's spamming me for literally no reason, and he begins to blow up at me for \"ignoring his messages\" and \"not inviting me\". So at this point I'm confused, since I 100% thought he was at his grandparent's house, so he shouldn't have access to League. Plus I didn't even see him send me any messages prior.\n\nSo I ask him if he's at his grandparent's house, and he's like \"Did you drop me off at my grandparent's house? I didn't say I had to go immediately. You would know if you looked at my FUCKING MESSAGES\". (FYI I rechecked the messages later, nowhere did he mention that he was NOT at his grandparent's house).\n\nAnd, mind you, I'm still playing League when this is all going on. It's extremely hard trying to play and type at the same time, so I'm typing between intervals of when there's no action going on. But since this takes time, every time I go back to focusing on my game he spams more so it's really annoying. \n\nHe says I'm ignoring his messages and at this point my game's finished, and he's spamming:  \n\"why\"\n\n\".\"\n\n\"do\"\n\n\".\"  \n\"not\"\n\n\".\"\n\n\"look\"\n\n\".\"\n\n\"at\"\n\n\".\"  \n\"my\"\n\n\".\"\n\n\"messages\"\n\n\".'\n\nAt this point my mind is on autopilot, I'm totally blank and numb to the notification sound since he's been literally spamming me all game. I automatically click \"Play Again\" and my rando friends start another game with me. As soon as I'm in game, he goes \"WHY DID YOU PLAY ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT ME?\" and starts spamming and sending angry messages.\n\nI 100% honestly didn't realize he wanted to play a game with me, I thought he was just spamming/being a baby about me \"ignoring\" him, since literally only 2 lines of his 50+ messages of spam mentioned anything about invites, while the majority was spam and the second majority was about me ignoring him. And it turns out, I was \"ignoring\" him because of one message he sent earlier after he got home \"YOU GOT A TURTLE?\", which I thought he had sent before he had come over to my place to check out my new turtles... because why would you message a question like that unless you haven't seen my turtles yet.\n\nAnyway, I did feel bad about starting the second game without him so I offer to play a game with him right after to make up for everything, but he said no, called me a \"snake\", wished that all my rando \"retarded nobody stranger\" friends \"died a horrible death\", and then called me a bad girlfriend for not prioritizing him, called me \"autistic\", said that I was so desperate that I would play with any rando, and that I had no empathy. \n\nI did give him my part of the story and I just want him to understand my POV but he just calls them \"excuses\" and is making fun of me for it.\n\nI'm going to ignore his messages for now until he calms down since I know I can't have a proper discussion with him while he's still mad, but am I the asshole for playing that second League of Legends game?",

      "description": "There's a little context involved, apologies for the length of post.\n\nTL;DR in advance, wife has had full unquestioned control of all joint income/spending, wife was primary bread winner with 6 fig income for first 6 years of relationship, I'm now earning equally with her and paying attention to bad spending habits, I struggle to get $20 to spend on needs/wants every month or so, AITA for taking control of my paycheck behind her back after asking politely for 12 months in a row?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, more details. I (29F Linux Engineer) met my wife (36F CFO) when I was 21 (8 years ago). We actually got really serious really fast. I was working several jobs at the time and going to school. My total income was fairly meager even though I did rescue her financially with my savings early on. She earned just north of 100K but was bouncing back from a divorce. As it was, and I dont remember exactly how, but we reached a point in the first year where we were living together full time and she handled all finances. I would deposit my checks and direct deposits into our joint bank account. She would handle all bills and expenses which was fine by me as I'm not the most punctual with money things and previously relied on a habit of over funding my bank account and scheduling things for auto pay that I would check every few months. After rescuing her with over 10K of savings and gifting her a reasonably newish honda accord, I didnt have that luxury any more so decided to trust her with my measly income and appreciated being able to enjoy obviously nicer amenities covered by her lifestyle and income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust over 4 years ago I started my tech career with a 32K entry level job. In less than 3 and a half years I promoted up to a 48K income, then got poached a year ago for a 6 figure salary. January 1 of 2018 I noticed some financial red flags that I had grown immune to or just been blind to out of appreciation for my wife's support. I ended up calling in sick 3 days in a row due to loosing sleep pouring over 6 years of bank and credit card statements and feeling sick from the pattern I was seeing emerge. I felt incredibly naieve and ignorant as I looked at the big picture. My thoughts were also haunted by the reality I'm poor at choosing gifts &amp; observing the gift giving traditions of certain holidays/birthdays and had been made to feel guilty or inadequate in that way on multiple occasions even though I basically had no money to spend on gifts and the ones I did manage to gift I had to strategically siphon money off of odd income sources to save up and get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously she knew what my attention was being consumed by. Once I was done, I personally felt hurt and betrayed by her for the first time in our then 7 year relationship. Knowing things I had done without due to \"budgeting constraints\" and feeling guilty when I did splurge on rare occasions for years, and living in a habitual state of knowing that if I need something mildly pricey I'd end up asking a month or two in a row and maybe being able to spend on it 3 months down the road ( not the way I had lived prior to joining our finances when I had over 10K in savings and always felt secure I could cover unexpected financial emergencies etc ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course we talked about how I was feeling, the pattern I was seeing, she admitted she is great at execution when someone else is making the financial decisions but is poor at self restraint when it comes to her making spending choices. We talked about how to change things going forward and agreed that it makes sense to split our finances, then work jointly to cover costs that make sense to split. Beginning of February she asked for 2 months before handing over my income so she could make a smooth transition and not leave anything falling through the cracks. With a light at the end of the tunnel and a plan in place I agreed without concern to those terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we're at the end of the year, I have enjoyed very little change in my/our life since doubling my income the last year, our checking still ends up at a 0 balance every month with a couple of cards maintaining a revolving 3-9K/mo credit card payoff, and each month she has asked to postpone one pay check again and again (I am paid monthly). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just applied for a bank account &amp; credit card so I can move my direct deposit over starting in January 2019 and begin building my personal credit history since I basically have none but I'm basically setting all this up behind her back and I'm going to tell her once this months paycheck hits our joint account that as of the January pay period I am taking back my income. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFactually I know in my head I'm not wrong to do this but I'm feeling guilty and like its an ass hole move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "My wife and I have a son who was born a few months ago. Lately she has been unhappy with me, saying she feels like a \"single mom\" and that I'm just a \"live-in child support paycheck\". This hurts because I honestly think I am doing as much as I can.\n\nShe's a stay at home mom. I work 10-12 hour days, 5 days a week at a factory. I stand on my feet all day doing the same monotonous thing over and over apart from a 30 minute lunch break. I wake up at 3pm, get to work by 4 and then I'm home between 2-4am depending on the workload. I make good money doing this so even though it sucks, I keep it going. Once I get home I like to watch TV until about 7 and then I go to sleep, but in that time I feed the baby when he wakes up (he still isn't sleeping through the night, he gets up every couple hours to be fed and changed and goes right back to sleep). \n\nShe is upset because I don't want to wake up early to watch him so she can get a couple hour nap in. She isn't lazy by any means, don't get me wrong, but I feel like her responsibilities are way easier than mine. The baby is usually up by 6-7 so she takes him out of our room (he doesn't have a nursery) in order to let me sleep better without interruption, which I really appreciate. She spends the day with him, he fights sleep but will usually nap for an hour or two at a time. I tell her she should sleep during these periods but SHE CHOOSES most of his nap times to get things done around the house or fuck around on the internet or watch a show. Even though she knows once he is up, he's up and wants constant entertainment and doesn't wanna be put down for longer than 20 mins at a time. 6:30-7pm is bath time, she feeds him and then he is down for the night by 9-10pm. She complains that she is exhausted because he wakes up every 1-2 hours but by my calculations, even with that, she gets a good 6-8 hours of sleep a night. Yet she still wants me to wake up some days and watch him so she can nap for a couple hours, because she is \"worn out\". \n\nSo, am I an asshole for telling her no? Because she has the easier job out of both of us? ",

      "description": "So I believe I must be a HSP ( highly sensitive person) and further more Senonsory Defensive. \n\nWhen my sister lived with me a couple years ago she always had the volume up louder then my ears appreciate, she is hearing impaired, my mom is too and growing up the volume was always too loud so I just stayed out of the room with TV. I am blessed like my grandma with good hearing. My sister and I got into many arguments over volume. \n\nShe moved out and now I live with my boyfriend. He is hearing is not so great so he has everything at full volume where I am on the entire opposite spectrum where I only need it up a couple of pegs on from mute. At work when I am listening to music I have it on some of the lowest volume. The only time I listen to something loud is when I am driving with windows down. \n\nSo our daily volume works like this, he turns it up and it hurts my ears, I ask him to turn it down, we compromise on a volume then a little later when I am not looking he turns it up. I typically leave the room if I dont want to confront. \n\nWhat our biggest issue happens when we are in bed and he streams something from his laptop. He typically has it at full volume, I will ask him to turn it down to half, I would prefer it down to like 3 notches from mute but of course that would not work. He turns it down to half but then a couple minutes later he turns it back up and if I ask, he gets upset saying he can't hear. \n\nI can't sleep with the loud volume and I am someone who typically falls asleep really fast. If he falls asleep first I then have to deal with his snoring which is sometimes difficult. \n\nI have tried dollar tree ear plugplugs but I fear that if the apartment fire alarm when off I wouldn't hear it since I am a deep sleeper and the last ones that have gone off it took me awhile to wake up from. \n \nHe doesn't like headphones and thinks I need to put up with it.\n\nIt rings my ears and even at this point I am in a different room then him and his football is blasting and its ringing my ears so obviously something must be wrong with me if my head is hurting and it's not even in the same room.\n\nWe also struggle with touching sensitivities where I dont like him touching my spine as it ends up giving me spasms, or he might lean against my back with his 300 pound body and that also triggers my back pain. Sometimes if he touches my arm it hurts.\n\nI also dont need a lot of light and he keeps all lights on and I have to sleep with eye masks as he likes turning on lights in middle of night or just keeping them on. \n\nSmells also bother me, cigarette smoke, perfume, even coffee. Anything strong.\n\nWhich makes me think I am an HSP and have some type of sensory disorder. I just found out about this disorder the other day and he thinks that makes a lot of sense. I found a book to read on it but it's all just really frustrating because he says I am over reacting and justifies his needs over mine.\n\nTD:LR\nMy boyfriend has trouble hearing the TV / Laptop Volume and wants it on very high.\nI have sensitive hearing and want it down low.\nAm I the asshole for wanting the volume down low where it may be difficult for him to hear the show?",

      "description": "So context for this. After going to my parents house for the weekend (im 18 and live with my boyfriend) my grandmother had come over. After awhile she started to talk shit about me when she thought I could hear (I dont have well hearing due to listening to loud music when I was younger). After becoming a bit pissed I had said \"what the fuck did I ever do to you?\" and going to the room I was staying in for the weekend (note, I am known for small outbursts due to mental issues ive had since I was a younger child and to avoid further harm I run away normally to a room) when I heard my mother walking in the hall to the room I was in. She then started to punch and kick me (I never thought much of it since this was a normal thing for me while ive been growing up plus she was known for bipolar and borderline personality disorder) and yell at me how I \"should respect my grandmother\" and how \"im too young to curse like that\" (which I understand her view, as I know I should respect other people but have a hard time with my anger due to my mental health). after she went away I was going to text my boyfriend asking him to pick me up so I didn't have to deal with this, but I noticed she took my phone in the heat of the fight, and decided to go ask for it back so I could leave. After going to ask her for the phone back, she starts again asking \"why I left the room\" and after I told her I needed to text my boyfriend so I could leave, she told me I needed to spend time with my family and I wouldn't get my phone back till Sunday night when I leave (this was Friday evening). After another argument she made me have an anxiety attack (I normally can calm down before any of that comes but the way I was being yelled at overwhelmed me) and while that happened she laughed at me calling me rude things (all having to do with mental issues of mine) such as calling me an \"autistic retard\". After the weekend was over I got my phone back and told my boyfriend everything, and now he doesn't want me to go back there. Yet I dont know who was In the wrong in this argument. ",

      "title": "AITA for cutting out half of my family out of my life?",
      "description": "It's something that greatly bothered me for a while and I'd really like some opinions on probably the most controversial situation of my life. It requires a lot of backstory and is probably going to be pretty dragged out, but I'll try to keep it short or just put a TLDR at the end.\n\nI feel the need to put some trigger warning for intense slut-shaming and sexism because there is a lot of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my father had passed away due to pancreatic cancer twelve years ago in 2006. He was diangnosed and died within half a year. It was very sudden for everyone, and at the end my mom was left a widow with two daughters aged 16 and 8 - me and my sister - to take care on her own. And she did a splendid job, in my opinion - two years after that she took a risk and we moved from my small hometown to a capital of our country, she sought a stressful, but high-paying government job position so support us and give us a possibility for a good education and prospects we otherwise wouldn't be able to reach if we stayed in our hometown. It was a terrible time - we were all devastated, lonely and stressed. Mom was busy working all the time and my sister soon left to study abroad (which also required money, obviously, so me and mom were getting by on whatever was left from paying her tuition that she did on her own) and we fought all the time, with her always asking me to work harder and complain less because she didn't have it easy herself and didn't need any more complaints. During that time I tried to kill myself for the first time and was diagnosed with clinical depression. Mom realised how much I suffered and our relationship changed then. It's still rocky, but I love her and admire her greatly as I recognise now how much she'd done for me and my sister.\n\nAnd then there's my father's part of the family - my uncle and my grandmother. I'll try to be objective about them, but it's really difficult for me. There's almost no good memories with them ever since my dad passed away. Quite on the contrary - it's like they're trying to break me apart from my mom's family by playing victim all the time and antagonising my mother, going as far as to say she's to blame for my father's death, saying shit like \"she hasn't done enough to save him\" or \"she should've done more\" (although nobody specifies what else she could do other than entrust him to doctors and their expertise). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one who's at it the most is my gradmother from father's side - for the sake of convenience, let's call her Mary. And this woman is the most hypocritical person in the whle story. Grandpa passed away in early 2000's and not a year later she just decided to illegally move to Italy and just live there for no reason. Mary was in her 60's when that happened. A couple of years later she *married* (**!**) an Italian plumber and decided to stay in Italy as a now-citizen.  I was around 4 years old when she emmigrated, so, granted, I don't remember her from the time when she wasn't a grief-stricken mother. And then she was busy being an illegal immigrant for years, so she never visited back home to check on us until the day she learned about my dad and his approaching passing. I literally never knew Mary as a person because she was always somewhere else, doing whatever she felt like doing and not being a grandmother. Once a year she'd send us a parchel with used clothes she was collecting from her acquantinces in Italy, half of which were hideous and the others were of wrong sizes so we never wore any of what she was sending us. That was the extent her input in my upbringing. But now that I've grown up and she doesn't need to help with anything since I got my education and I already have a job, she's happy to nag me about \"importance of family\", implying that I have to keep in touch or else I'm a bad granddaughter. \n\nSpeaking of which, Mary always hated my mother, going as far as to reserting to defamation when my father proposed to my mom. It's been proven she forged a fake letter addressed to my father, explaining just how huge of a slut my mother is and how he shouldn't marry such a skank. My dad said \"I don't believe this bs\" and went to have a happy married life with the woman he loved, but Mary remained bitter. Now that my dad is not here to defend my mother's dignity, she's back at it again, always accusing my mother of plotting against her, always calling her a slut for moving on from my father and having a relationship five years after he died (my mom never remarried though, unlike her). So one time my mom financed my trip to Italy for a summer when I was 15, telling me to go and spend time with her and maybe clearing up whatever misunderstandings we have because \"she's your grandmother and your father wouldn't be happy to know you too are on such bad terms\". Whatever, I thought, and went there. We spent a lot of time together - more than I ever did for 15 years of my life - and she still wouldn't shut up about my mother being a slut. To which I sat her down and told her \"Okay, listen. I'm not going to tolerate you referring to my mother this way. Not only is this unbelievably unfair to her, you're basically insulting me by calling her names since I'm, y'know, her daughter? So here's the deal - either you stop insulting my mother and we remain on good terms, or I'll simply stop talking to you because there's no way I'm tolerating this kind of behaviour\". She agreed and I even remember her saying something along the lines of \"You're so much like your father\" and I felt happy to finally put this behind us. But of course it wasn't this easy. Fast-forward to a year later, she visits our asscrack-country and, as per usual, she doesn't notify anyone in the family about it, expecting others to telepathically sense her presence and call her. Obviously, that doesn't happen. Then she calls not me, but my other grandma - my mother's mother - and asks her \"why your daughter forbids \\[my name\\] from talking to me?\" That grandma relays this info to me and, furious, I call Mary to set the record straight. I tell her \"Why the fuck do you still insist that my mother is plotting something after I clearly told you to stop?\", to which she screeched on the phone, telling me she never said that. I asked her if she's implying that my other grandma fabricated this then and lied to me, to which she goes in full-on hysteria, yelling that yes, we're all liars and sluts and then curses me to the best extent of what Russian allows (and Russian is very, very creative with its cursing), the crux of it being that I'm \"just as much of a lyign cunt as my mother\". After she's done, she hangs up on me. I sat there, completely dumbfounded and frozen in shock, until my mom shook me back to consciousness. After I realised what's just happened, I told my family that this day marks the day this woman doesn't exist for me anymore. And the moment I said that I felt such an overwhelming relief that even now, years later, I cannot bring myself to truly regret my decision to never speak to her again.\n\nThen there is my uncle, let's call him Richard, or Dick for short. He's a lonely, obese Nice Guy^((TM)) in his mid-50's, was never married and doesn't have his own kids. He's reclusive, but filthy rich - I don't know what kind of business he has, but he always had the best cars, a lot of real estate in the capital and outside of it, could afford to travel anywhere anytime and now my sister tells me he bought a house in Italy after he got his Italian citizenship through being Mary's son. But the biggest problem with him is that he's an intense Catholic (this whole part of this family is). After my dad passed away, he was just a bit too enthusiastic about replacing my father, always ephasising how \"me and your father are of the same blood\" and how there's no one better fitted for this role than him. Even as a kid I felt weird about it, telling him that I do have a father and just because he's dead doesn't mean I need a replacement. Dick insisted, however, that he \"teaches me in his fatherly ways\" and everyone in the family insisted I let him do that because \"well, he kinda has a point of your father being dead\". His idea of being an exemplary father was to either 1) take me out to dinner all the time I felt sad, indirectly supporting my binge eating disorder, and 2) taking me to church whenever possible, forcing me to partake in masses and praying when I expressed to him the fact that I don't believe in God and I don't want to waste my time worshipping an imaginary friend. In the end after a couple of debates on the matter of religion he conscieded the second activity, but that left him with only luring me with money and food since his personality just simply didn't cut it. He's bitter about women and is quite sexist, always saying that \"real women make babies and wisely let men be in charge of making them happy\". It just always rubbed me the wrong way and I let him know that it does. Still, his Nice Guy nature always wins and whenever we argue about this, Dick just casually tells me \"to listen to a man before it's too late for me\" while promising me to give me money whenever we meet. I just feel like a escort every time that happens too, it's just so derogative. So two years ago when the fallout between me and Mary happened, he, much like a Nice Guy he is, stood on the side of his mommy and was put on ignore ever since along with her.\n\nNow, there's a couple of things I want to say. I realize that twelve years ago these people had lost their son and a brother and this loss is as irredeemable for them as it is for us, losing a husband and a father. My father was a great man who kept us all together like a glue and with his passing we all were fucked up. We all had to learn how to be a family again from scratch. But somehow my mom pulled her shit together a",

I was naive to the internet at the time and decided to post about it on my YouTube, for support (i believed it to be the start of anorexia at the time. Yeah I was naive and uninformed). I post and a few days later I find this a-hole commenting that I'm lying and that I don't have anorexia because anorexics don't publicly announce their illness. I consider myself to be reasonable and they didn't really think, I'm just asking for support. But it got me wondering, AITA for announcing my ED early on when it might not even progress fully? Just wondering. (User who attacked me, don't come into this, biased b*tch. (Yes I know I was rude and called the user a bitch and asshole.

For example, today I called to tell her that I was going to pick my son up and my step son. She started shouting in the phone why are you picking up “step son?” He doesn’t need to go... he said he’s not going. I kindly responded I know he said that however he’s coming. She started yelling at me again saying he doesn’t want to come so what’s the purpose. I repeated again that he was coming. Then, even though I don’t feel I should have to go into explaining but I did. I explained I was picking him up to get a haircut. She started shouting “That’s all you had to say”.  I said I will be bringing him back, and she started shouting “nah if he leave he don’t need to come back”. I said okay I’ll let you and your son handle this. (Mind you she doesn’t want him to leave but is saying this to just say it). \n\nAt this point, I said have a great day and hung up. When I picked both boys up, she didn’t speak or say anything. I spoke and she said “mm”.  I asked if she’d like to speak with me and she said “they stuff is in there” I said okay. Thanks. Have a great day and left. \n\nSo AITA for demanding she show me respect or my son can’t go over there bc I don’t know what she may say to him or how she may treat him. AITA for requesting my husband speak with his mother but not be disrespectful but address these issues? \n\nThanks. ",

She did and we never spoke of it again. A couple days ago I told my friends about it and one of them is saying I’m an asshole and a “cuck” for denying my sister even though she was being loud. He said that shutting her down like that only serves to embarrass her and that stopping her only served to make her feel uncomfortable ever doing it again in the future.

I even signed her candidacy petition. She's involved in a lot of student organizations so her schedule is pretty hectic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur group only met once to discuss the presentation, and the rest of the work was done remotely. This girl did not attend the meeting and did nothing to contribute. Not a single bullet point, not a single PowerPoint slide, no research that any of us saw. The rest of us went ahead and finished the project last night (the presentation is today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was texting some friends in a group chat this morning griping about her freeloading. I said some pretty nasty things about her character and urged them not to vote for her for student government. And I truly feel that way. I get that she has a busy schedule, but if she can't make time for academics (the entire point of university) how can we expect her to be a responsible president?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the people in the group chat is friends with the girl and tried to defend her. Shortly after, I got a message from the girl asking if she should add anything to the presentation. This was suspicious because 1, it was two hours before our presentation, and 2, she contacted me directly instead of the entire group. My friend told me he didn't say anything, but I'm still suspicious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was nasty with some of my comments about her character, and worry that I'm the bad guy if word got back to her. Any thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Group project member didn't contribute to the project, so I told people not to vote for her for student government. A mutual friend *might* have told her I said this.",

      "description": "So, I live in a house with my parents, my grandma, and my 3 siblings. I interact with them often, but I try to avoid my sister as much as possible— even when she initiates conversation with me.\n\nFirst things first: She’s a 15 yo with ADHD, Asperger’s, depression, and anxiety. She spends a lot of time in our room (we share a bunk bed) drawing and talking to friends on Discord, and she has a hard time doing work that she needs to (i.e. schoolwork, homework, chores.)\n\nI try to be patient with her because of her mental state, but the truth is, she has extreme anger issues. And she can be SCARY. One, as my sister, she knows exactly how to make me angry or sad, and she manipulates my emotions often. Two, when we argue, she has been known to hurt me. I know I’m TA when we argue because I shouldn’t keep going (I’m the oldest and it should be my responsibility to be the bigger person,) but when it gets too far, I suffer the consequences.\n\nThe biggest example of this was when we were arguing about how neither of us do our chores correctly (I brought up her chore after she brought up mine, which, again, was wrong.) However, once it escalated too much, she threw her hot soup at me. I jumped away, but it got on my upper thigh. I was writhing in pain. I had to take a cold shower, but the damage was done. She had given me second degree burns. \n\nA few days later, she was eating soup again. I must’ve looked frightened because she said “stop looking scared, it’s not even hot.” I told her I had the right to be scared and she said I didn’t, since it happened in the past. I was appalled. I was still hurting from the burn she gave me, and she told me it didn’t matter anymore? I stopped talking afterwards and just got ready for school.\n\nShe’s done similar things before, just not as severe as that one. I still have the burn mark on my thigh (which she later said must’ve been a lie, and to “show her” even though it would require me to pull down my pants for her to see.) So, I’ve taken to avoiding her mostly (we still talk from time to time when she’s calm.) But I feel like I might be in the wrong because she has those mental afflictions, and she claims to be trying to get better... Whenever she gets angry, though, I get scared, no matter how angry she is. Sometimes when she goes to bed angry I sleep in my brother’s room instead. I’m not sure if that’s fair, though. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go near my sister at all? Will give INFO if needed.",

      "description": "Obligatory mobile-user warning.  And also insignificant story I'm curious about warning.\n\nNo one has actually gotten upset about this, but I'm just curious what people think of this situation.  So my dad ended up buying two tubs of ice cream for me(18F) and my brother(18M).  One of them was chocolate chip cookie dough flavor, which both me and my brother like, and one was mint chocolate chip flavor, which I like but my brother doesn't.  So my brother scoops up cookie dough ice cream and I scoop up both flavors since those are the flavors we like.  \n\nOver the course of the ice cream's existence, I eat a bit of each flavor over the course of a few days until my brother ends up eating the rest of the cookie dough ice cream and then I end up finishing the mint ice cream.  I ended up getting more ice cream than my brother, but at the same time I didn't choose the flavors my dad got and it was my brother's choice not to eat the mint ice cream.  No one has made a fuss over it or even mentioned it, but I'm just wondering if eating the flavor of ice cream that we both like when I could eat the flavor he didn't like so that the ice cream was split evenly was an asshole move.  So AITA for getting more of the ice cream or was eating both flavors a fair thing to do?",

      "description": "My 7 year old nephew came over this weekend with my SIL, and I happened to be playing Tetris99 on the TV. \n\nAfter watching me play a while, he asked if he could try. I lovingly but sternly told him that he could not. The game keeps track of my all of my stats, and I didn't want him ruining my win ratio. \n\nThis is where my SIL stepped in, and asked if he could just try it out. I told her that if she wanted, she could pay for a Nintendo online account for him and I'd be glad to let him play on my switch. \n\nI also offered to let him play Zelda or Mario or Smash Brothers. Here's the kicker. I even offered to let him play Puyo Puyo Tetris, which is BASICALLY THE SAME GAME. \n\nThis is when he started crying and throwing a fit. Seeing as my SIL clearly did not know how to parent, I simply undocked the switch and stepped away from all the drama. \n\nI later found out from my wife that the SIL was very upset and left soon after. \n\nGranted, the Nintendo Switch was a gift from them, but I don't think that gives their son to come over and act like he owns the place. I should also mention that I pay for the Nintendo Switch Online acccount.\n\nShe hasn't contacted me to apologize for her son's behavior, but I asked my wife to let her know that if she wants to venmo us the twenty dollars I'd be glad to set up his account for him. \n\nI get that kids sometimes throw tantrums, but I feel like giving in (like my SIL wanted me to) only reinforces that type of behavior. My wife thinks I should have let him try, but I don't even let her play on my account, so why would I make an exception for him? \n\nAITA for refusing to let my nephew play on my Tetris99 account? ",

      "description": "So my friend and I have known each other for about 5 years give or take, we met in high school. We weren’t really all that close until about 3 years back, and we have been good buddies ever since. I now live across the country, so we meet up by talking and playing through Xbox when our days are over, and we do this about 3-4 times a week.\n\nMy friend has had flings with a few girls since we started doing this, and on nights we play, he will invite me to the party, then walk away from his Xbox to talk to a girl for upwards of 2-3 hours. It never really bothered me too much I guess. I saw it as I was not his only priority in life and he has much more important things to do than sit and play Xbox a lot.\n\nRecently though, he met this girl who plays Xbox herself. I thought this would actually work to my advantage because that meant he wouldn’t be leaving me alone while he talks to her. I was wrong though, and ever since she came about, he acts like he has to do everything to impress her. These things include embarrassing me and making fun of me, which apparently she finds funny. I thought I would go along with it, but I eventually realized how nasty they were getting towards me and it felt like I was just there for entertainment purposes. He’s known this girl for two weeks.\n\nA few nights ago I was fed up and told my friend that he could find someone else to play and talk with. I was polite about it, but he didn’t take it too kindly. We haven’t talked since.\n\nI know people will see this as ridiculous but this was my only big way of communicating with him and this was how we bonded. I now wonder if what I did was wrong, and that maybe I was just upset he was giving attention to other people.",

      "title": "AITA for calling people monkeys?",
      "description": "So. Rather than calling people idiots or retards, I call them monkeys. This is simply due to the amount of hate I got for so long calling people retards when they would do something dumb. \n\nI never meant anything bad by it but it was just like “Oh you fucked up? You retard.” But so many people continued to give me a bunch of hate for calling people retards because it’s “offensive to those with special needs”. \n\nSo after a while of censoring myself from calling people retards, I went through probably a 100 different ways of calling people retards in an effort to not offend someone. The reason by the way that I don’t just say “you idiot” or “you dumbass” is a mixture of reasons. For one, calling someone an idiot isn’t “satisfying”. It’s so plain and boring to me and doesn’t sound like the person really messed up. I also stray away from dumbass because I don’t want to curse at people all the time. \n\nThus far the only word that’s given the amount of meaning and satisfaction when said is “you monkey”. I came to this from watching videos on youtube and seeing that monkeys aren’t the brightest of creatures. They throw poop and are very “wild” animals. They don’t do many things with much intelligence, and are (to my knowledge) one of the more dumber species compared to humans, gorillas, apes, chimps, orangutans etc. \n\nIn the last few months however, I’ve started to get called a racist for calling people monkeys. The most common reason is that it was a derogatory term used to demean African-Americans. The second most common is that members of the KKK call African-Americans monkeys even today. \n\nThus my question: Is it okay that I call people monkeys when they do or say something stupid?\n\nTLDR: I call people monkeys when they make a fuckup. I do it because it’s a satisfying word to call someone when they mess up because it’s just a simple “You monkey.” - Much more powerful than calling someone a dumbass or idiot because monkeys aren’t in the slightest bright animals.

      "description": "So this requires a bit of backstory but I'll make this as abridged as I can. It's an all-out family brawl now because my siblings are all calling me a HUGE FUCKING asshole and I don't see it. I think I'm the only one willing to stand for my grandma and the shitty cards she was dealt. \n\nAnyways, back in the 1970s (this is in Taiwan btw), my grandpa (now deceased) brought home a baby that turned out to be his. He was cheating on my grandma with this music teacher and she got pregnant and secretly had the baby because back then it was a big deal to be single and pregnant. Well, this isn't really the most scandalous bit in our family. \n\nWhat happened later is that my grandma raised this baby for a while then when she turned four my grandma let her be adopted away by a family she won't say. This was during the day when my grandpa was at work and her other kids all at school. My mom and uncles all remember her but none of them know where she went. They've asked my grandma for years but she won't tell anyone. My grandpa supposedly died of a broken heart. \n\nMy mom and uncles are convinced something happened to the little girl (like my grandma killed her or trafficked her) and they've always had a rocky relationship with her. HOWEVER, the older I am the more disgusted I am at hearing about how my grandma was treated by my grandpa. He was terrible. He was supposedly verbally abusive and cheated on her their entire marriage. In modern day, he would be considered the classic abusive husband and she would've divorced him. I think she did the right thing giving away the bastard kid. It wasn't hers and demanding her to raise it was insult to injury. \n\nI voiced this the other day to my siblings and they all went off on me, saying that my grandma was a monster and that's why they wont go see her in Taiwan. I argued that they've been brainwashed by my mom and her brothers because domestic abuse wasn't a big deal back then. I said that my grandmother had no choice and she did the best she could. However, I was being called a massive asshole, c\\*nt, etc. ",

      "description": "Here's a little backstory. I work for a Jewish temple which also as a preschool ( and grade school a few days out of the week). On Saturdays, they have a program which means any and all toys for the preschool are locked up in a separate room. This Saturday however, we had a catered event so we didn't need to worry about the Kuddish (Saturday Jewish lunch) so my co-worker and I decided to rest the room for the preschool. \n\nThe kids would knock on the door trying to get in and \"look for something they forgot\". I would let the kids enter room one at a time so they won't waste time or find a hiding spot from their friends and for the time it worked. One group of kids respected the rule and entered one at a time and \"looked\" (they really just wasted my time) but the other group was a different story. \n\nBefore I go further let me explain why kids can't play in the playroom. About a year ago, the main Rabbi saw the kids throw plastic balls, toilet paper and chair. Yes, chairs; metal folding chairs. Ever since that day, we keep all the doors leading to the playroom locked and kids are not allowed to be down there after the program is over.\n\nA brother and sister came down and asked if they could find something. I let the brother come in and told the sister to stay out but she slipped passed me and started playing on the tricycle. I ask her to leave but she didn't. I asked asked a bit firmer but she didn't. So now, I'm mildly aggravated so I took a deep breath and ask again which caused her to snap  back with this line \"You can't do anything to me,\" in a matter-of-fact tone.  \n\nThe brother was running out the room while a parent (not the girl's parent but he had a father look to him) walked in to help me get her out. I had no patiences left for this girl so I took another deep breath and yelled \"GET OUT OF HERE NOW!\"  The girl got up and left in a huff while the parent, slightly stunned, said \"You didn't have to yell\" \n\nTL;DR: Bratty kid didn't want to leave a room she shouldn't be in forcing me to yell at her.

      "description": "It bugs me a lot and I'm all stressed. So some back story, a year ago I went to new school, first day of school i saw this girl, I instantly thought that she is perfect looking for me but since she was in my class i thought \"I don't have any chance\" and said it to my self, like it was a known fact. I didn't talk with her much, December (so 4 months in this school) I met another girl, came closer to her but everything crashed after one month, after that I wasn't looking for a girl,still no contact with the girl from my class. So after it came to the second year of school, 4 months in, at the start of December I thought that I should at least try with this girl, I felt attraction, casually started to talk with her everyday at school. Im almost two weeks in this, we talk in school (like a decent amount of time ~1 hour every day talking just with her) we make eye contact from time to time and smile to each other every time we do, she approaches me and starts talking. (i heard from my female friend, that in friend group of her 'the girl that I like' they many times said that I'm handsome, I'm acting cute and all kinds of compliments, and everyone in my class says that I'm the most likeable person that they know). I'm very calm, kind to others, give everyone help if they need some. Here comes my question Am I doing something wrong, and should stop it? I mean talking with this girl, she likes me and i can tell that for sure. But ohh man I fell so guilty for waiting whole entire year, for last few days felt like I murdered someone. I'm so tired of this feelling and thinking of my self as a (fucking idiot). Is there anything wrong with my actions? \n\n\nIt's my first post, I don't even know if its in right sub, sorry if not but i just can't stand it a day longer. Also sorry for all the grammar and for the text that I wrote if its without any sense, also English isn't my native language. \n\nSo guys and girls just help",

      "description": "My mother in law and I were never on good terms since we were first introduced, she never liked me because I am an Arab and her daughter is German. However she and her daughter are very close and I always respected that.\n\nShe always put herself in the middle of our affairs when it comes to raising our daughter, and she always offered her opinions even when no one asks her for them. She also gives my daughter way too many unhealthy snacks and I always rejected that.\n\nHowever, long story short, three months ago we were invited at their place and at some point she was  trying to force my daughter to eat even if she didn't want to. I demanded that, it she doesn't want to eat that is okay, and once she is hungry she will ask for food by herself (my daughter is three years old). The grandma then flipped and told me to never disrespect her at her house and that she will never allow me here again if I don't respect her authority. I told her to put her authority up her ass and made sure that she has absolutely none on me our my kid. And said we will never visit you again. Then she asked me to leave the house and wanted to take my daughter from me. (my wife was out grocery shopping and she didn't witness any of this). I absolutely lost it and took my kid from her hand and pushed her out of the room we were at the moment, and closed the door shut. At that moment I was really pissed that my daughter had to see all of this and started calling my wife to come. Suddenly I hear my mother in law outside the room talking with a police officer on the phone. She called them and told them that I assaulted her. Skip to half an hour later my wife comes home and is very saddened by all what happened and wanted to go home. I said let's wait for the police to not seem that I am running away. Police arrive, and they basically laughed the matter away, and ended up telling the mother in law that if she wants to press charges she will need a medical certificate that she was assaulted (nothing happened to her whatsoever).\nMy biggest problem with all of this was something that happened just before the arrival of the police, as my wife was asking me to pack and go home I heard the mother in law saying to my three years old girl :\"you're papa will taken away by the police now\" which made my daughter cry and be very sad the whole day, and she kept asking me \"daddy are you going to be taken away?\" the whole week basically, which I found truly heart breaking.\n\nCut to today, we received a surprise visit from my in laws and they shamelessly asked if they take our daughter with them for a week to Paris and they already booked all the tickets including tickets to Disneyland there.\n\nI declined and said that to the grandparents that neither of them will ever be able to spend any time with her without me or the mother being present.\n\nSo basically my question am I going too far with baning them form seeing her without us being present?",

      "description": "I’m 18, at home for the next year getting my massage license before heading to college. I’m very very close to my family and value their opinions—except for one thing. \n\nI have multiple piercings and several tattoos. My family have always been pretty lax and open about hair dyeing and moderate (nose/ear) piercings. However, they despise any others. But I love the look of septum piercings. My friend got one recently and I loved it. My family (and a few friends) hates it and think it looks awful.\n\nI have been having some problems with self-confidence since it’s freezing here and I only feel like wearing bum clothes. In my opinion, a few piercings kind of make it look more like bumming around is intentional rather than I just gave up on life. \n\nSo WIBTA if I went and got a septum without anyone knowing? WIBTA if I hid it from them when at home?\n\nAlso my parents are on a trip for a few weeks and would have no idea. ",

      "description": "Tldr: I don't want to pretend to be straight, but I don't want to cause drama either\n\nMy family is very religious and when I came out to my parents 2 years ago, they asked/demanded that I keep it a secret so no one they know finds out. I refused to live my life in hiding (they wanted me to always pretend while in my hometown, where I still live, but in my own house), but I still dress like I used to and don't talk about it whenever I'm at family events.\n\nI'm kind of getting tired of that though. I've skipped most family events for a while, because of how weird I feel acting like someone I'm not, and being vague when people ask about my life. I don't care if they hate me or talk behind my back. Most of them I never see anyway.\n\nBut my grandfather is turning 75 and the whole family is getting together for it. I think it would be rude of me not to go, my grandfather hasn't done anything to me to warrant me cutting him off, in fact most of my relatives haven't since they don't know I'm gay.\n\nWIBTA if I told people about it while I'm there? I don't plan on making a grand announcement, just telling the truth when people talk to me. But I don't know how people might react, and I don't want to ruin his party. It seems cruel to have him hear such terrible news on his birthday, and while my family is very drama free (they're very polite and formal. People don't yell about things, they just talk about them in hushed small groups, or they all pretend nothing's wrong), I've never seen a relative come out to them before, and I don't know what the fallout could be.\n\nShould I just pretend again?",

      "description": "I went out of town for a week and my friend catsitted for me. Before he came, I told him to help himself to anything in my fridge but not eat anything in my freezer. The reason for this is I had many very expensive steaks in there.\n\nUpon returning, I discovered that my friend had eaten one steak: a pound slab of Kobe beef that cost about $120. I confronted him, he denied it. However, there's no one else who could've eaten the steak, and steaks just don't disappear.\n\nThe thing is, he also broke the cap of a very expensive ($600 or so) coffee pot I have. This wasn't that big of a deal, since it'd already been broken before and I'd glued it together--but he told me that it spontaneously broke when he poured hot water in the pot (an obvious lie that defies the law of physics; I've used it for months after it was glued back with no problems; anyhow, hot water not poured directly onto this glued bit of porcelain cannot possibly make it spontaneously break).\n\nIf he's willing to lie about the cap, I'm pretty sure he's willing to lie about eating one of my steaks (there are other reasons to question his integrity, like how he constantly cheats on his girlfriend, has stolen from his employer, and stolen from another friend of ours). So at this point I have decided to cut him out of my life entirely--while he has been a good friend to me for the most part (except for paying me back money he owes me very, very slowly), I feel I need to draw a line. I was willing to forgive him for breaking the cap of the coffee pot and probably lying about it, but actually eating a steak I specifically told him not to eat and then lying about it after wards seems to be crossing a line, so I'm kicking him out of my life. I haven't told him yet, but I will in the next few days calmly and simply, maybe say something like \"I'm sorry but I won't be hanging out with you anymore\" or something similar and wishing him well. I'll answer any questions he asks me, but not argue with him and just stop replying if he gets defensive or argumentative.\n\nAITA?\n\n(And, yes, I know I am the asshole for buying a $600 coffee pot and $120 steaks--specifically I want to know if I'm the asshole for ceasing my friendship with this guy.)\n\n**1 CommentShareEdit PostSaveHide**100% Upvoted",

      "description": "So I rent out a house with Roomie A and Roomie B. Roomie A has the master bedroom, and her own massive bathroom. Roomie B and I share the hall bathroom, which is directly in front of the door to my room.\n\nRoomie A had Friend over yesterday and they decided to dye her hair purple. Neither had ever done this before or let the other housemates know this was happening until it was already in progress. I am allergic to strong scents (more like hypersensitive, but they give me migraines and put me in so much pain I can pass out and lose memory if prolonged). Both Roomies know this, Friend did not.\n\nRoomie A and Friend did the whole dying process in the hall bathroom, not her own massive bathroom, because her tub is broken. Roomie B was out for the night and I came home from work to Roomie A mixing the dye for Friend. I asked them to put trash bags or something down to prevent a mess, and they told me they have towels and will clean everything up.\n\nI went to nap in my room (long day)and woke up to the beginnings of a migraine. The chemical smell had seeped through the vents or under my door and I had been breathing it in for at least thirty minutes. Roomie A did have the bathroom fan going the whole time and apologized for the smell. I stuffed a towel under the door and went back to sleep.\nThis morning, I woke up and can still smell it. I am more sensitive to these sorts of things, however, so I think they just couldn’t tell. What is bothering me the most, though, is all of the dye.\n\nI can tell Roomie did a basic wipe down of some things that got splashed, but it’s EVERYWHERE. Not at first glance, but when you look:\n\n- a bunch of dye under the lip of the sink,\n\n- the marble (or whatever the counter is made of) has a pink tone to it,\n\n- the door has a purple handprint on it,\n\n- the bathtub has purple streaks running down the outside,\n\n- the toilet lid, base and backing have splashes,\n\n- the bottom of the hanging cabinet has dots and streaks,\n\n- one of Roomie B’s towels was used to dry Friend’s hair and is splotched all over now (Roomie B said it was okay after they had started using it, but doesn’t mind because it’s old),\n\n- the wall behind the door has an actual blob of dye,\n\n- and there’s even splatter dots above the door frame, nearly to the ceiling!\n\nI didn’t want to ruin their fun, and I’m all for hair dying, but this is the exact same thing that happened at the last house I was renting. What I hate most is that it was all left there to be cleaned up later (At least, I hope she meant “later” rather than “not at all”). The longer it’s on, though, the more it seeps in. That’s exactly what dye does! \n\nSo I sent a long message to our house chat that I’m very upset with the state of the hall bathroom and refuse to allow any hair dying not done by a professional to happen in this house again. \n\nNow I’m wondering if I’m overreacting. I tend to get really worked up over things that mean little to other people. I just don’t understand why they couldn’t have used Roomie A’s bathroom. Ya, the tub’s broken, but there are two sinks and a shower. I’ve also only had my hair dyed at a salon, so I don’t know if this is a normal mess or what.\n\nAm I the Asshole, guys?",

      "description": "Let me explain. \n\nSo for a period of time I had to sleep outside my room due to the AC in my room shooting out freezing cold air. My brother was in the same room I was in playing fortnite and I couldn't sleep due to the clicking sound from his controller and him talking to his friends in the game. It was also at night when this happened. I asked him to get off of the game immediately but he just refused to get off so I punched him in his and said \"I'm gonna keep punching you until you get off\". He cried and got off on the second punch, please remember tjat I'm 16 and my brother is 12.. I can't really remember than many details from this story since I was filled with anger at the time.\n\n\nTL;DR My brother was on the game while I was trying to sleep at night. I told him to get off but he wouldn't so I punched his head to force him to get off.\n\n---------------\n\nAnother situation similar to this one happened. It was 11 o clock at and I was in my room. The room where my brother plays fortnite was outside my door and I could hear him talking to his friends. I couldn't get any sleep. I remembered the previous situation and decided to get my parents involved in getting my brother off. They said for my brother to get off of the game but he didn't listen. My parents didn't take any further action. So I decided to rip out the controller from my brothers hands but he got violent I was only trying to rip the controller out of my brothers hands. My parents got involved and broke up the fight. \n\nTL;DR same this but I tried to rip the controller out of his hands.\n\nAm I the asshole for these situations? If I am the asshole what do I do next time? I'm also 16 years old and a student.",

      "description": "Let me start this post off by saying I’m a 20 year old female and I live with my mom. It’s been just us my entire life because my dad was always in and out of it. \n\nFor about the past year me and my mom have had an ongoing battle because she hates how I’m not affectionate towards her. I’ll be listing the things she says I don’t do that hurts her feelings + the reason why I don’t do them.\n\n1) she says it hurts her feelings that I don’t kiss her. \nI told her many many many times I don’t mind kissing her on the cheek if I’m leaving or something but she always tries to kiss me on the lips and I’m just not comfortable with that it’s just weird to me I’m a grown adult I don’t want to kiss my mom on the lips lol.\n\n2) she says it hurts her feelings that I never call her or text her. \nI told her that I like talking to her on the phone but there are times that I just like to listen to my music on my way to an 8 hour shift or a 3 hour class. PLUS she has a habit of repeating herself multiple times and/or just not speaking at all. And it’s really annoying when I’m just sitting there while she’s breathing hard af in the phone. \n\n3) she says it hurts her feelings that I don’t do little things like cuddle with her or give her long hugs, etc. \nI told her that I’m just overall not an affectionate person!! It’s not that its because of her it’s just because I like my own personal space. \n\nI feel like she gets so upset because she hasn’t been in a relationship since I was like 10 years old, which I don’t think is my fault that she doesn’t wanna date. I tried explaining to her calmly that I’m just not an affectionate person overall, I’m the same way towards everyone else it’s not just her!! \n\nShe cries and it makes me feel extremely bad... AITA?? \n",

      "description": "My bf and I have been dating for a few months and recently the lack of communication has gotten worse for me, this has caused me to talk to friends (who happen to be male) moreso than my SO. It feels like the relationship is constantly hitting a roadblock. I  have an expectation that he should be able to hold a conversation with me. When we talk on the phone most of the conversation is silence and we do not talk OTP often, for maybe 30 minutes daily.  \n\nHe has a decent amount of anxiety, I get it and have been trying to accommodate him but seeing no improvements it is pissing me off. I have addressed this with him by trying to provoke him, sometimes with anger, to get him to let it out. \n\nRecently I have not been feeling it, I want someone to be able to talk to easily. I am tired of always carrying the conversations, it is just a perpetual cycle of dead ends when it comes to him.  He does not offer up information either, every thing I want to know I have to ask. So, I have been just as short and to the point with the conversation as he has. \n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My fiance and I (both mid twenties) live on the first floor of an apartment complex. I rotate between 12 hour day shifts and night shifts three days a week and occasionally have to sleep during the day. My upstairs neighbors work from home/stay at home, have two school aged boys and two large dogs. They are loud all day long during normal working hours, especially playing the piano, vacuuming, and generally banging about. The piano playing starts at noon and continues intermittently through dinner time many days. I'm convinced they play soccer/fetch inside up there when the boys get home from school. We've never had issues with them being loud at night. \n\nI work Sunday night, and my birthday is Monday. I have plans that evening for which I would like to not be a zombie and actually get to sleep for a reasonable amount of time. Would I be the asshole for asking them to mind their noise levels and not practice the piano on Monday so that I can sleep through the standard work day? I've never officially met them, so this would be the first encounter. To my knowledge, they don't know how inconvenient their daytime routines are to my sleep schedule. I already have blackout curtains, earplugs and an eye mask.\n\nI know that upstairs neighbors are something you sign up for with an apartment complex. Noise regulations don't go into effect until 11 pm on weekdays 12 am on weekends. Officially I don't have a leg to stand on, but is it okay to ask?",

      "title": "AITA For Being Upset Family Won't Let Me Hold New Baby?",
      "description": "Hello everyone, I want some opinions on this because it's been driving me crazy. So my cousin was like a sister to me growing up; we had countless sleepovers, went on family vacations together, we were pretty much always together as children. She was my best friend. As we became teenagers, we kind of drifted apart, but we grew close again not long after she became engaged. I was very involved in helping with her wedding, I was a bridesmaid, went to every shower and party, etc. I thought we were finally getting close again. When she announced her pregnancy, I was thrilled. She and her husband lived about 2 hours away from me, but we got together anytime they were in town, I went down to see them quite a bit during her pregnancy as well, and we always had a good time. She told me the baby's gender before her gender reveal party, and I went out and bought gifts for the reveal and for her later baby shower. She and her husband even asked me to be the baby's godmother. I was honored and so excited for the future.\n\nWhen the baby was born, I went to see them in the hospital the day after and held the baby for the first time. A few weeks later, once they were settled back at home and ready for visitors, I went down again to spend the day with them and see the baby, where I got to hold him again. Then, about 2 months later, they came to my city for the baby's dedication at their parents' megachurch. They invited me and of course I went to support them. There was a party afterwards, at my cousins' parent's house. I rode back to the house with my cousin and her husband and the baby. I sat in the backseat with my cousin and the baby and during the ride the baby reached out to hold my finger. I thought this was sweet and was enjoying talking to him when my cousin physically moved my hand away then sanitized the baby's hand with glittery Bath &amp; Body Works hand sanitizer. She made me sanitize my hands, too, and though I was a bit taken aback by this, I went with it because I figured it was typical first time mom stuff. When we got to her parent's house, I asked to hold the baby, but my cousin said \"no\" and walked away without another word. I was devastated by this. I was clean, was not sick, and had just washed my hands. A few months later, at a different family gathering, I asked to hold him and was again told no. They recently had their second child and I have not been allowed to hold that baby at all.\n\nMy cousin only lets her own parents hold the baby for limited amounts of time under her direct supervision, and routinely says they can only hold their grandchild if they do certain things for my cousin, or if they buy the baby expensive gifts. They have held the brand new baby only once for a Facebook photo. \n\nAt first, I thought it was something I was doing wrong, but I babysit regularly for friends and hold other people's babies all the time, so I'm starting to think it's not a problem with me. \n\nAITA for being upset by this? I was supportive, I never tried to overstep my boundaries, but I thought I was supposed to be involved in my godson's life?",

It's one of his favorite possessions and was his first major purchase after college and starting his professional career.

And his dog is a digger ,so she's destroyed most of the cushions. As a result, we have to use these huge blankets to protect the leather from her. It makes the entire living room look cluttered and messy. It would be fine for a large den or game room, but it just doesn't look good at all in our living room. And frankly, I resent the hell out of the fact that I got no say at all on it. \n\nI've tolerated this couch for our rented apartment, but we are about to put an offer down on a house.

      "title": "AITA for Assigning My Partner to Drive Me to Mechanic on His Day Off from Work?",
      "description": " \n\nFirst post here, here's the story: my car needed a brake job. There's an auto body shop roughly 3/4 mile from my work site, which is convenient as it's semi-close, however it's not reasonable to walk between there and my work site due to time constraints of a busy workday. The auto shop offers a shuttle service in one direction- from the shop to my work site. So once my brake job was complete, I would require transport from my work site to the auto shop. Normally, I'd do Uber. But my partner happened to have an off-day from work on the day that I was planning to get the auto work done, and he lives close to both my work site and the auto shop (we've been together 2+ years but do not yet live together). So my thinking was- when my car is ready, he can pick me up at work and drop me off at the auto shop.  I notified him about 1 day in advance of this plan. He grunted some comment about not liking to have to do extra stuff on his day off, but he agreed.\n\nOn the repair day, around 1pm I get word from the auto body that my car is ready. I call my partner to tell him to come get me. When he answered the phone, it was clear that I'd woken him from sleep. So I feel bad, but I told him \"look, the place is open till 5pm. Just finish your nap and then come pick me up once you're actually awake\". But no, he wanted to come do the drop at that moment, to get it over with. So he picked me up and then dropped me off at my car no problem. When he dropped me off at the auto shop, he told me he was going home to go back to bed.\n\nThat evening he called me when he was awake. In conversation, he tells me it *really* messed up his day off to have to transport me to my car. He asserted that - as a floor nurse, he **needs** his days off for catching up on rest. I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me).\n\nI'm a bit floored by all this. In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it. He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand. If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off. I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for causing a scene at my girlfriend's place of work because a creepy, old \"professional photographer\" wanted us to come over to his place so he could take pictures of her face?",
      "description": " This happened less than an hour ago...\n\nI went to visit my girlfriend for lunch at the cafe she works at. We're both in our early 20s, and I'll occasionally come grab a drink with her from whomever is covering her lunch.\n\nToday, after we had our drinks and were in the middle of a conversation, an older man (probably mid 60s to early 70s) walks up to us and starts asking us questions. We'll call him Steve, and my girlfriend will be Janet: \n\nSteve: \"Hey, do you work here (motioning to Janet)? And is he your boyfriend (motioning to me)?\"\n\nJanet and Me: \"Yes, yeah?\"\n\nSteve: \"Well, I know we're strangers but I was wondering if you wanted to come over to my place so I could shoot your face?\"\n\nAt this point, Janet looks at him confused, then at me, and I'm staring at this guy also trying to figure out what he's saying, and Steve holds up his hands and makes a camera motion, like he's taking pictures. Up until this point, I have been staring at him a lot, trying to figure out what he's all about, and I didn't think I was scowling, but I had started leaning over the table Janet and I are sitting at, trying to take the attention away from her. I can't remember what exactly he said, but Steve kept going on about how gorgeous Janet's face is.\n\nMe, still trying to be respectful: \"What is it for?\"\n\nSteve, still just looking at Janet, not paying me much attention: \"Oh, you know. Just for fun!\"\n\nJanet: \"Oh I'm really sorry, I am just really busy with work and I don't have the time...\"\n\nSteve: \"Oh I'm never busy, don't have anything going on\"\n\nI got kind of pissed off after that. I wasn't trying to start something, especially with someone that old, and I just wanted to get back to my convo with Janet. Another thing is that we're still in the cafe where Janet works, and this guy made sure everyone in our area knew that she worked there. Everyone in our area included an older woman sitting at a table right next to all of this, and Janet's older female coworker behind the bar.\n\nMe (staring at Steve, being very skeptical now): \"I think we're good man\"\n\nSteve: \"Well, this guy looks like he wants to... to take things out into the parking lot!\"\nSteve was kind of laughing here, like I was the ridiculous one for being protective or something.\n\nMe: \"Okay leave us alone man\"\n\nSteve: \"I am a professional photographer! I don't know what it is YOU do in life!\" \nAnd he kind of trails off there, I still don't know what point he was trying to make. I'm a college student. It's also worth noting that he had a large book with him that whole time, which I suspect is full of photos, and was probably from the chain bookstore the cafe is connected to. He would take this book and occasionally, slightly, slam it on our table like he was uneasy. I thought he was really creepy, and I just had to get him to leave: \n\nMe, voice raised: \"Look man, I'm not trying to start a fight, but we said no, so leave us alone right now!\" \n\nI turned away from him and let him leave, muttering. I was pretty shaken up by now, I could tell Janet was as well, and even the woman who had been sitting next to us the whole time. \nI apologized to Janet, and she apologized to me for having to deal with that. But more than anything, she didn't seem like she was completely stoked by my reaction, and same goes for everyone around me. I didn't ask her directly, but I did say, \"I probably should have reacted differently\". But looking back, am I really that wrong to raise my voice and help cause a scene? I get that she's at work, and that everyone was probably a little shaken up by that confrontation, but I feel like just because you're a professional photographer (which Steve hadn't proven at any point, either), you can't just ask strangers, especially girls less than a third your age, to come over to your house to take pictures \"for fun\", \"because they have such a gorgeous face\"\n\nAITA for raising my voice the way I did? Is there honestly any way I could have reacted differently in that situation?",

The only response I had gotten was a temp job at a very large company to cover a woman while on maternity leave. It paid well enough for a kid just out of college but is not something I'd exactly like to do forever. I took it because I panicked and was happy that I'd be starting employment two days after I graduated. \nI can handle the tasks but lately they have been mounting. The place and its nearby branches seem very shortstaffed. Recently some very toxic emails have been sent en masse detailing dissatisfaction with a lot of peoples work ethic. \nRecently people have been asking me to do certain tasks  and projects without any training, and asking for help is next to fruitless as everyone is so busy. The people I work with are very kind but anyone above is a nightmare with few exceptions. I am 100% regretting taking this job. I'm applying to new jobs and looking anywhere I can for an out, but I feel like a scumbag for even thinking about leaving. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Some background. My dad was a neglectful, emotionally abusive narcissist and I left home at sixteen to support myself to get away from him. I actually had 'begging for food' incidents in my teens.\n\nThis man didn't buy me shoes or clothing, my grandparents and his sister did. I didn't get to have a bath in the eight years he  raised me because 'they cost money'. And no, we weren't broke. I was bullied until the day I left. Both I and two of his ex wives had breakdowns because of his constant emotional abuse.\n\nI've seen him all of four times since I was sixteen, only once intentionally (over thirty years plus). He acted like I was the bad guy. Whatever.\n\nHe recently died, and I swallowed it and turned up at the hospital to say goodbye on his deathbed. I was a bit sad, as I do have a couple of positive memories as him from when I was a tiny child. He seemed contrite as he was dying, but some talks with my baby brother after have turned up that he was telling people a lot of crap about what went on in my childhood. No I was not 'dumped on him' by my mother. He in fact kidnapped me at one point and then fought for custody purely to upset my mother. I was there, I remember him telling me he only wanted custody so he didn't have to pay maintenance. And some recently found family letters talking about the court case and how the whole point of getting custody was as an abusive act of control against my mother. Not a nice man and full of shit to the end. He essentially stopped me seeing my mother between the ages of eight and fifteen. Destroyed the birthday and Christmas gifts she sent me.\n\nThe funeral is in a few days, and although I am attending (it was all prepaid) I have declined to buy him flowers. My grown up baby half brother, who never saw my dad as an abuser thanks to not being raised by him after dad divorced his mum, seems scandalised. As does his mum. Who was ironically one of the ex wives who had a breakdown, but who is a born doormat.\n\nHowever: I didn't even buy flowers for my mum when she died, as we had a quick cremation and a informal ceremonial ash scattering for her. Her request. I'm sure as hell not buying the abusive asshole flowers when I didn't even get my mother some.\n\nShould I take the higher ground here and just buy flowers so as to not upset my brother? I am a long way from broke, it's the bloody principle. \n\nAm I being an asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "So almost two years ago, I moved in with my girlfriend and thought, “She’s the love of my life. This is it.” I still think that could be true. She’s the kindest, sweetest, and most thoughtful person. We agree on all the essentials (finances, kids, politics, life goals) but still have enough differences to have fun debates and deep conversations. She’s always been supportive and encouraging, and without question, she’s the best friend I’ve ever had.\n\nWhen we started dating, I knew she had anxiety and medical problems, but things quickly took a sharp downturn when she stopped hormones about three months into the relationship (she’s a transgirl). Her anxiety is now so bad that she can’t stay home alone. She was recently let go (partially because of her medical issues and anxiety) so now she carpools with me to work so she can look for jobs in the bottom floor of my office building. She’s also anxious about elevators and driving in traffic which makes her job searching even more difficult because she’ll have to take the bus/uber. With her medical issues, she can help with some of the housework but struggles with bringing groceries into the house, walking uphill, and anything that agitates her heart. I grew up with cats and she’s allergic, so even after two years of washing my clothing she’s still worried about cat dander in my clothes and puts blankets on the couch wherever I sit down. Additionally, while I’m very supportive of her gender identity, my attraction to her really changed when she stopped hormones and I really struggle with introducing her to friends and family.\n\nI love her, but after living with her for two years and the constant anxiety and stress from medical issues, I’m extremely tired and burnt out. I’ve been dealing with depression for the past year and even relapsed into cutting recently. I have an appointment with a counselor but it’s still weeks away.\n\nI’m debating moving out for a few months so I can take a break from all the issues and just have some room to breathe and deal with my mental health. But with me moving out, she’s going to have to rely on our roommate’s schedule to be able to stay in the house and it will make her life a lot more difficult with housework and other things. I’d still come by the house a few times a week to help but she’s still going to struggle, mostly with anxiety. But I feel like I desperately need the space.\n\nTL,DR: My girlfriend has really bad anxiety and medical problems, and I've become extremely burnout and depressed/self-harming. I want to get my own apartment but it would mean she would struggle to keep up the house by herself. AITA?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Advice would be appreciated too.",

Basically I spend about 50 hours of the week studying and/or related activities. For that I have a very specific schedule that I always stick to. Since I'm an introvert, I also designated some time where I just shut myself in my room and recharge from studying/socializing at uni.  (obviously some free time as well, but I like to use that to go to gym or read a book)\n\nNow, my roommates are entitled to their own lives, they can invite whoever they want and they can eat whenever and whatever I want, I don't care as long as they don't disturb me between 1-6am where I'm sleeping. However, they often invite people over, that I know as well, just mostly not on sunday where I have the most free time. I usually say hello and chat a few minutes and then go back to doing whatever the fuck I was doing (and since visits are mostly in the evening that's usually when I want to relax). Same goes for eating. When I get hungry I eat, and if it's 11am and my roommates cook at 12, fuck it, I'm full (i tell them I already ate beforehand). \n\nRecently I've been getting a lot of hate from relatives/acquaintances for not having time when they came over (even though I had nothing to do with inviting them) and roommates \"because it's unnecessary and egoistic to eat early when we could eat together.\" \n\nI always feel like they got something wrong: we entered a subtenancy contract, not a relationship. We aren't a family, I won't actively try to not be there/not eat at the same time, but if it doesn't suit my schedule, fuck it. I don't think they are entitled to my time, and if they don't bother asking me if I'll have the time when they invite someone it's their problem, not mine. AITA?",

One of the things my 11 year old picks out is this little Tetris arcade machine. He's pretty excited about it. Plays it here and there.  Fast forward to the weekend and we get a challenge going - who can get the higher score. \n\nHe plays and gets about 6k. Talks some smack before and after. But, says if I beat that, I have to beat his best score of 20k.\n\nAlright. \n\nI play and wipe the 6k goal. He starts checking in every so often. I keep going. Passed the 20k goal. Still going strong.  At this point, he's kinda stopped asking where I was but still checks a couple times.\n\nAt 100k, I start to feel like I'm beating a sad, dead horse to death.  He seems kinda quiet.  I make it to 130k and could keep going but, instead, stack the blocks to fail.\n\nHe seems too quiet still. At this point, I feel like I went way overboard and maybe destroyed his enthusiasm for the game.  \n\nI'm the asshole here, aren't I?",

      "description": "Okay back story- my fiancé recently moved in with his cousin. His cousin had a gf of four years and her and I quickly became very close. Over the last couple months I have come to consider her a really great friend. \n\n*To make things easy I will refer to my fiancé’s cousin as Tom and his gf as Jan \n\nSo tom and Jan had a very rocky relationship. She has trust issues from stuff he did at the beginning of  their relationship but with that being said sometimes she did take it overboard in being controlling over him. They did not have a great relationship at least in my eyes. *So they broke up last weekend. ( side note they break up and get back together a lot).  \n\nJan after the break up was obviously very sad and emotional. I was there while she cried and helped her talk through it. She repeatedly told me that I needed to tell her if I found out Tom did anything with any other girl. I told her yes but in my mind really wasn’t going to tell her if I found out anything minor because it would just upset her for no good reason.\nSo for reason that aren’t important,  I found out Tom slept with someone else 3 days after they broke up. Me and my fiancé were surprised. I completely understand that after they broke up he could do anything he wanted. I just didn’t think it would be so soon with all things considered.  \nSo fast forward to yesterday-Jan and I had already planned to hang out. So I go over and we are talking about everything and how she has really missed him and wondered if he wanted to get back with her.  So she asks me to my face if I know anything and so I told her. I  just cannot lie anymore. I’ve lied for people in the past in similar situations and it literally ate me up inside. So oblivious she was crushed, she understands that he didn’t “cheat” on her because they were broken up but she is just so hurt, she never thought it would happen so fast. \n\nSo obviously Tom now knows that I told Jan what happened. And he is pissed at me. He told my fiancé that I better not come around their apartment anymore and all this stuff. Also my fiancé is kinda mad at me for “stirring the pot” when I could have kept my mouth shut. But how is that fair to me? To have to lie for Tom when I don’t even know him that well and now consider myself way closer to her than him. If she wouldn’t have found out she would have literally obsessed over him and wanting to get back with him. And now she is completely done with him. Still emotional obviously but ready to move forward with her life. \n\nSo AITA? Should I have done things differently? ",

      "description": "For background information, I just graduated college a year ago and started a job in my field. Bought my dream car, a 2018 muscle car. Not brand new, it was a rental car before I got it but it's still a 2018.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, in stop-and-go traffic I got rear ended because he was going far too fast while catching up to where traffic was stopped. (Big opening between the stops so you can get some speed). I would guess by the time he hit me he was going about 15mph. I had looked into my rear view mirror, joked to myself that he might hit me, and then when I looked back up I realized he was actually going to hit me so I eased off the brake enough that I wouldn't hit the car in front of me, but enough so that some of the force would be expended through just pushing my car forward. When I had first looked up and joked to myself about being hit, I was stopped completely and in my opinion there was more than enough space for him to brake if he started to apply it there with at most a moderate amount of pressure. It looked like a kid driving their parents vehicle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy car is getting repaired now, and the total estimate came out to be probably less than their deductible would be, unless it's a super low deductible. My car has a textured plastic bumper cover, the only noticeable damage was what his license plate screws did to it. His license plate and license plate cover took all of the shock, and while the license plate was bent [like a hard taco shell](https://www.appetizersusa.com/uimages/images/create-your-own/mini-taco-shells-yellow.jpg), that was it. I wasn't sure if anything else got messed up with my car, and in case I got injured I definitely wanted to report it. I also read that you are required to report every accident unless it happens on your private property against your own property. It being a new car that's financed, I didn't want to risk not reporting it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for reporting it?  I feel bad because he was even younger than me and his rates are probably going to skyrocket, but it's my first car and the potential for injury on my side is what made me decide to report it.",

We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.",

He is basically the nightmare of a roommate.\n\nI moved out 10 days before him, and because I didn't trust his knowledge when it comes to washing, I cleaned and tidied the entire apartment, which took me an entire day! I scrubbed each millimeter of the apartment (except his bedroom and his bathroom).\n\nAfter doing this, I showed him how he had to clean before he was to move out, etc.\n\nMoving on, to the day after he moved out, we got a message from the real estate agency where they told us that the apartment needs cleaning, especially his room and bathroom plus the kitchen (which I know I washed real good before I moved out). So they wanted us to pay for a cleaning company to clean this (we can not come back to do this ourselves, as we are from another country). My ex-roommate paid for this, but is now asking me for half of the money, but I refuse in giving him anything.

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for formatting...\n\nbackground - I returned to school after winter break on January 3rd (Thursday of last week). I had a new semester class, and a group of my friends happened to be in the same class, so I sat next to them. The next day (Friday), I was absent from school because I was feeling ill. In that time, another student sat in the seat I was sitting in on Thursday. \n\nWhen Monday (the day I am writing this) rolled around, I sat in the same seat as I did on Thursday, unaware of what had occurred on Friday. When the other student in question walked into class and saw me sitting in ‘his’ seat, he was visibly upset, but did not confront me (I’m not saying that the chair in question is mine per se, just that I was sitting there on Thursday and that I would probably sit there for the rest of the course. People usually sit in the same seat every day regardless if there is a seating chart or not). \n\nToday also happened to be when the teacher created an official seating chart. She didn’t assign our seats, but the seats we were sitting in at the time was now our official seat. I was sitting in my Thursday seat, so it was now my official seat. A friend of mine sitting next to me told me that the other individual in question sat there the previous day.\n\nI am unsure if I was being a dick. If the general consensus shows that I am in fact the asshole, I’ll offer him his seat back the next day. Thanks in advance.\n",

      "description": " So, like I said, I was playing a video game (League of Legends for further context) with a friend. I was a character that relied on him to get kills in the early-game phase. He constantly ran away as soon as he saw an enemy to let me die (he was a healer so if he stayed neither of us would die). I told him that it was his job to help me out when that happens (since he’s a healer) and he wasn’t doing well this round and said, “Oh I thought my job was to die.” I dismissed this comment as I did not know how to respond and he continued running away and leaving me to die.  I said it a couple more times and at the end of the game I was carrying the team. When the game ended I had the vast majority of kills (36 kills and the 2nd highest amount of kills on the team was 6). I then noticed a few days later that he had blocked me. This had happened previously for reasons I still do not know, so I just assumed he was a moody person. When I requested to play with my friends (which were in the match that I previously described), one of them told me I was being really harsh on the whole team, and that she felt the resentfulness among the team.\n\n\nI have never considered myself a rude person, and when I told my other friend (who had no part in this), she was very confused and said that my teammates were just moody. I honestly don’t know if I’m in the wrong here.\n\nP.S.  if you’re going to go on some tangent about how video games ruin relationships or connections, please keep that opinion to yourself.",

A break which will be over after New Year's and i will have to get back to Denmark.  \nI bought the ticket home two weeks ago, telling her that i would like to go, and back then she agreed to it, after i told her that no matter what i do in this situation i could not satisfy everybody.   \nThere was not any conflict or trouble before today, where she bought it up, and started asking me to be there at New Year's. After telling her it was not possible. She then bought forward, that i had promised that we should experience New Year's together in Istanbul. A promise i apparently gave her on the latest New Years.\n\nSo she is angry that i am breaking a promise. I had totally forgot that i said such a thing, before she told me. And she is now threatening me with breaking up.  \nI know that i am not leaving her completely alone, as she can either go back to her family, or visit one of her friends and his partner in Antalya for New Year's. She says she does not want to be the only single in a couple parties.\n\nBecause of her exam schedule and financial situations, it is impossible for her to come to me for New Year's, and i am not very keen on celebrating Christmas away from my family. Neither do i as a student have the money to buy a ticket back to Istanbul, just to go back to Denmark again after New Year's.  \n\n\nI want to go home, i already bought the ticket, and made my family know that i would come.

      "description": "For a school project my friends and I were paired up with a kid who usually keeps to himself. He usually sat by himself at lunch but we invited him to sit at our table to discuss the project. We even exchanged phone numbers and social media. After the project was over he continued sitting with us which was fine until he just started talking about his depression with us and how bad his life is and just bums us out and makes things awkward. When we sit with him there are topics we can’t discuss because when we do he looks really depressed (An example was yesterday when we were discussing plans we had with our girlfriends). Apparently he called my friend really late at night because he needed to talk to somebody. He tells us his problems almost everyday and always thanks us for being friends with him and that he’s glad he can talk to us. We’ve asked him to stop telling us these things and that he should seek professional help but he says his family can’t afford it. I have no problems being friends with him but I really don’t want or think I’m suited to be his personal therapist. My friends are saying if he doesn’t stop they’re going to ask him to go back to sitting alone because he’s starting to make them feel depressed and I kind of agree.",

      "description": "Okay, so a little background info:\n\nI work 48 hour weeks minimum and for the last couple of months it’s been 60 hour weeks. I work 4:30pm to 4:30am, usually fall asleep between 6am and 7am after I get off work. Normally wake up around 1:30pm but I’ve been extra tired these last couple of weeks and have been waking up at 2:30pm.\n\nThis week my wife asked me if I could skip the extra day this week and take Saturday off so that we could go out for St. Patrick’s Day with our friends/family. Neither of us drink or go out very often at all, so I cleared it with my boss and was pretty excited to be able to tie one on tomorrow. I could use a night of drinking honestly.\n\nThen earlier tonight she informs me that we are being picked up at 2. My first thought was that the bars stop serving alcohol at 2 so that would be kind of dumb, then it dawned on me that she meant 2pm. At first I was king of a dick, thinking that it wasn’t her that made the plans so I was saying stuff like “who goes drinking at 2pm?!?” Had I known that it was her idea I wouldn’t have been an ass about it in that way, but whatever. In all the times we’ve gone to a bar we have NEVER gone before 9pm.\n\nSo I explained to her that I guess I’d have to skip, because I’m not waking up on my day off an hour/hour and a half early to go drinking. I like to wake up, have coffee, go to the gym, come home and shower, etc. That would be like if I woke her up at 6:30am (she usually gets up at 8am for work) to take her drinking. \n\nNow, we RARELY argue, whether it be little stuff or big stuff, but she was kind of butthurt that I “made her feel stupid” (which was not my intention at all, I was honestly just trying to explain why I’m not cool with going drinking at 2pm) and was also mad that I didn’t want to go out anymore. \n\nAt the same time, I was butthurt because to me it’s pretty inconsiderate that she would not only make these plans when she knew I’d be asleep (and yes she knew I’d be sleeping, I text her when I wake up every day) and also that she’s just now telling me the night before. I mean, even if had known it was at 2pm at least I would have been like “okay, guess I can’t make it” instead of thinking all week that we were going to go out and have a good time Saturday night. I went from looking forward to it to being disappointed about it, not to mention that if I had known this I wouldn’t have taken the day off and just worked it because the whole 12-hour shift would have been overtime.\n\nSo now we are kind of at odds with each other, because she’s irritated with me for not wanting to go/making her feel stupid, and I’m irritated with her for making plans like that when she knew I’d be asleep and then not telling me until the night before.\n\nSo, I’m ready to accept my judgement here... AITA?",

As a result, my dad is a dual German-US citizen. About a year ago, he pointed out that I too could obtain a German passport since I was a citizen by descent. He pointed out several reasons why I may want to have a passport. \n1) traveling to Europe would be easier and I could stay beyond the 3 month limitation that applies to non EU citizens. \n2) I could live and work in the EU without needing a visa.\n3) I have more options of where I can live than just the US. \n\nUpon first discussing this with my dad I was excited at all the opportunities this could afford me. When I went to share the news with my aunt, she immediately mentioned how I was gaining this at the expense of immense suffering of previous generations and made me feel guilty for even being excited. She totally downplayed the benefits mentioned above and was talking about the suffering of others. Now don't get me wrong, I think the Nazi Regime was horrible and I hate that it even happened. I just don't think I should feel bad for being a German citizen. Ever since that conversation I feel self conscious about even bringing it up with people.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to take care of my grandfather, who has cancer?",
      "description": "TL;DR: My mom wants to get my grandfather, who has cancer and will probably not recover from it, to live with us. Since I am waiting for a place at a university and only have two “smaller” jobs she wants me to primarily take care of him. I think this is too much stress for me and could potentially scar me for the rest of my life, I am only 19 years old. \n\nBackstory:\n\nThe relationship to my mum (and her side of the family) is difficult, to say the least. My grandma was the only kind and understanding person from that side of the family and ever since she died a few years ago my grandpa has basically turned into that typical right winged idiot, who complains about the government and refugees all the time. I didn’t really like him before she died and now I try to stay away from him as much as possible at family meetings. He is just as stubborn and unreasonable as my mother, and both of them constantly criticize my lifestyle choices (e.g. job choice, clothing style, overall behaviour.)\n\nNow:\n\nHe has cancer. And my mum, understandably is absolutely shocked and wants to help him as good as possible. He lives two hours away from us, alone in his house. But he is too stubborn to accept help from any nurses or services in general that would take care of him in his house. He believes he can do everything on his own, though he probably won’t recover from this disease. My mum can’t live with the thought of just leaving him there and that something might happen and then no one can help him. I understand that. \n\nBUT I also know from a friend that taking care of someone who is close to death is literally traumatizing, especially if that person is so close to you. Even though the mum of my friend, who took care of his grandmother that had Alzheimer, is a nurse, his family was always “in alarm mode” when they heard any noise in the house. He says he still wakes up in the middle of the night if he hears a noise and panics something happened to his grandma, though she has been dead for years.\n\nMy mum wants me to primarily take care of him as well, because as she puts it “you don’t have any job related responsibilities” (I have two jobs btw). Also; my grandfather doesn’t like me and I don’t get along with him either, I am bad with kids and elderly people in general. I just don’t know how to take care of someone who is so sick. It scares me if I am honest. So, for the sake of my own mental health, I threatened to move to my uncle, who has a small flat he would let me rent for a dicsounted price. Ever since I told her that she totally ignores me and if she talks to me, she just says how selfish and in-moral I am. But I seriously think it would damage me permanently to be forced to take care of someone I don’t respect and watch him get worse and worse by the hour. ",

I do talk to her about everything I post on here, she just doesn't know I post. \n\nMy posts are few and far between because I know if I fall into the habit of bringing everything to Reddit, our relationship would take a huge hit and things would end up very poorly, which I would rather avoid.\n\nIdeally I post about other things that bother me in my life, but a philosophy I try to live by is to only worry about problems I can solve so if I have an issue with my mom I can't deal with, I just let it go because I know her as a person and I couldn't get anywhere with her with all the help in the world.\n\nSo I dunno, am I a piece of shit for having this account and posting what I do on here?

      "description": "This past week I was staying at my uncle's place for a week while I was attending a CNA class. This class was about an hour away from where I live and started at 8 in the morning--my uncle agreed to let me sleep at his place, provide me a bed and some basic amenities rent free so that I could travel less and be closer to school that week. \n\nEverything went swimmingly until the last day; I came home from class, and as I was getting out of my car to go inside a cat rubbed up against my legs. Doing what any sane person would, I reached down to pat his head. Kitty was enjoying it until a car zoomed by and spooked kitty, at which point he mauled my hand. \n\n\nI work at an urgent care clinic, and at least once a week I'll see someone with a cat bite that has gone septic, so no way in hell was I going to go about my business without first getting that shit looked at. Per policy, the clinic made me fill out an Animal Control bite form before I could be seen. I was treated, put on meds and then sent on my way.\n\nRight when I get home from the clinic, I see my cousins playing with the same cat that had bit me just hours before. Turns out it was their cat, but wasn't allowed inside and I didn't ever know about it. I tell my uncle that it had bit me, that I went to the urgent care clinic, and asked him if the cat had had all of it's shots. He said yes it had been immunized and there shouldn't be any problems.\n\nFast forward to yesterday when I get a call from animal control with some follow up questions. They ask if I had any new info about whose cat it was/where it happened etc. I give them my uncle's phone number when they asked for it assuming that they want to talk to him about the cat's vaccination records etc.\n\nToday my aunt texts me saying that animal control rolled up to their house, cited them, and are making them quarantine their cat for 10 days. I told her what had happened, explaining that at the time of the bite, I had zero information on their cat and that I didn't want to get rabies or an infection, and that I only provided my uncle with their number for follow-up purposes.\n\nI feel like I did what was responsible, but I just can't shake the feeling of being a gigantic cunt and a burden to their family. My aunt didn't sound pleased at all about everything and I understand why-they let me stay at their place, and as a thank you, I got them a 10 day quarantine and a citation.\n\nDid I do anything wrong in providing the city w/ my uncle's info? Should I have just not been a baby and went on with my day? I just feel bad that they let me in and I kind of shit on their hospitality. ",

      "description": "- sorry for weird format! im currently on mobile. \n\nMy friend (19M) has been staying over at my house for the past year or so due to him being homeless\nduring last year and this year, he probably took at MOST 4 showers. I offered him to shower here in a shared bathroom between my sister and niece but he refuses because “it’s dirty” - I have cleaned and bought a bath mat to fix this but he makes excuses often that “Oh well it was dirty earlier” “I dont smell THAT bad” (he does) \n\nAnyway I just bought a new bed, sheets, pillows TWO DAYS AGO because he absolutely WRECKED mine with his sweat and stench. (literal sweat stains and smell of his b.o. carved into the fibers of the bed) I know its not me sweating. While i do burn up like a furnace in bed, My sweat is not so extreme to the point it leaves the sheets damp and wrinkled every night. Plus, my side of the bed is perfectly fine. \n\nToday,  I go to lay on my bed when i notice that the sheets are wafting this overwhelming body odor, the sheets were wrinkled from the sweat. I kept involuntarily gagging to the point i almost threw up while to take off the sheets on my bed. \n\nI have smelled dead animals before, and if you have too you know how disgusting that smells? this was almost the perfect replica of that smell but just musky. \n\nHe heard me gagging and throwing the sheets off the bed. I brought up that he needs to shower because his body odor was very overwhelming and i dont want to ruin my new shests and he got upset saying stuff like “ill just sleep on the couch so you arent bothered by my smell” or just being rude to me in general because i brought up that his body odor is pretty bad.\n\nTl;dr: just bought a new bed &amp; bed sheets; friend who refuses to shower slept on it two times and now the sheets smell incredibly musky and are moist - complained about it to him and he believes i was an asshole for gagging at the smell and is, in general, being upset over it",

I thought about reasons why they would leave me out, I thought that skill (in the game) could be the reason but I that's impossible since rank-wise, I am the highest along with one of the 5.

      "description": "This all started about a month ago, when my ex-best friend, C, wanted to hang out with me. I explained to C that I was unable to hang out with him because I had other responsibilities. Most notably, I decided do a favor for my therapist by watching her 13-15 year old pomeranian while she was away. (They don't know how old he is b/c he’s a rescue) \n\nI explained to C that I needed to keep a close eye on the dog, give him his medicines, etc. C replied with \"The dog will be just fine with a leash and a heavy chair, it's dead anyway. Besides, I'm basically your therapist at this point. Stop wasting your money on somebody who doesn't give a shit about you.\n\nI'm not easy to anger, but this just got to me and I tried to convey that to C. He shuts me down with \"You're just salty you can't hang out with me because you're 'busy'. You can't pull that shit on me... I mean, we both know that you don't have a life outside of me.\" I saw this as an attempt to manipulate me, much like my ex-S/O did. For some dumb reason, I decided to apologize to him; I had convinced myself that I had overreacted.\n\nCouple days later, I was able to meet up with C at his house. He suggested walking over to the diner a couple blocks from his house because it was such a nice day. We started walking to the diner and everything seemed pretty normal, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nWe get to the diner, order our food and sit there talking for a few minutes before he says \"Let's talk about your episode you had last week. I want to make sure you don't pull that shit again.\" \n\nI tell him that I wasn't comfortable talking about that in a public place. C replied with \"Exactly.I only brought you here to talk about your BS without having to deal with you bugging out on me.\" I refused to talk.\n\nSo, we just sit there in silence for 10 minutes as we wait. But when our food comes out, C just sits there, buried in his phone. After about 5 minutes, he gets up without eating, throws a $50 gift card down and walks out with a simple \"Bye.\"\n\nI wave my waitress over so I could ask about getting the check. She notices that I am visibly upset and sits down on the other side to comfort me. She then brings me the check and two to-go boxes. I was so disgusted with him that I didn't even take his uneaten meal. (Kind of regret not taking it now, actually). Luckily the gift card covered the meal and a hefty tip for my waitress.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago, C messages me (excuse the bad grammar, I'm literally quoting C's texts) “just wanted to reopen our line of communication and apologize for walking out, that was a fucking scumbag move.\" later on he completely changes his attitude; \"I literally left enough money to pay for both of us so it's not like I left you with the bill and we walked there so it wasn't like I drove off and you were being a bitch for no reason so what's the fuckin issue it's been a month get over it\". \n\nAfter that, I decided it would be better if I just cut off all my ties with him.\n",

I’m a guy and she’s (obviously) a girl.\n\nI was on the phone with my girlfriend, and we were going to play a game of D&amp;D soon. We were waiting for the DM to finish some homework so it was just me and her. She started talking dirty to me and as a result I got hard and was horny. About halfway through this the DM texted us and said he was ready. After I told her that I got hard, she erupts into laughter. I asked her why and she explains how she’s laughing at me for how easy it is for her to turn me on and she had no intention to turn me on for her benefit. And I was really hurt by that. It felt as if, I described to her, she fondled me and then laughed right in my face when I naturally got erect. She apologized and told me she was sorry and would never do it again.\n\nWe left the call together so that we could get into a group call with the DM to play. I was about 20 seconds late because I was trying to clear my mind and stop being upset. So I got in and they’re both laughing but immediately shut up. I hear my girlfriend say “oh, nevermind.” And the laughter stops. I ask what they’re laughing at and the DM informs me that they were laughing at me behind my back because she blue balled me. And this hurt me in a multitude of ways. A minute ago she told me she would never do something like that again and now she’s laughing at me with my friend behind my back? And I’m not particularly comfortable with her telling people that we dirty talk over the phone either, but that was minor.\n\nSo while the DM was getting ready she could tell I was upset and we had a text conversation that went like this:\n\nHer: are you and I okay?\nMe: I’m sorry, It’s just you said you wouldn’t do it again and then you went and laughed at me behind my back immediately with (the DM) and I don’t want to start a fight but I’m just hurt\nHer: how is that doing it again?\nMe: i dont care about the blue balling i just dont like being laughed at by my own girlfriend\nHer: I wasnt laughing at you??\nMe: \"we were laughing at you behind your back\" -(the DM) and you said \"oh nevermind\" the moment i came into vc\nHer: (the DM) says stupid shit, I was just telling him about the blue balling and didnt think you wanted to hear about it. I’m sorry. Eggshells (saying she has to “walk on eggshells around me”)\nMe: so you were laughing at me behind my back. It’s whatever. Just let it go.\nHer: I wasnt laughing at you behind your back.\n\nAnyways, this just frustrated me further because it’s as if she’s totally lacking any self awareness? How is that not laughing at me behind my back? I felt totally disrespected and I never thought she would do something to me like this.\n\nThat’s as much detail as I can provide.",

      "description": "I've been with my boyfriend for two years. He floats between the houses of different family members and is looking for a job after some health issues. I had to move for a job which he supported and I offered to pay for him to come with me but he has refused.\n\nRecently I grew frustrated with him saying \"one day\" to moving here, to kids, to marriage. Then often sounding like he only said \"one day\" to avoid losing me. He won't move until he gets a job, gets fit, etc. But life won't ever be perfect.  \n\nAt the advice of my therapist (who said to give him one month then it's over) I applied pressure. I told him to give me a date by which he would ready to move here because there needs to be one. He accused me of giving an ultimatum, said it reflected poorly on me, and has been teetering between avoidant of talking about it and outright nasty. When I lean towards breaking up he gives me what I want (like the date I asked for, but no real substance to it) so I stay, but after the last few weeks I'm not sure if I want to be with him - the relationship feels like it's moving backwards. I'm tired of being called a bitch over this. \n\nAITA for putting pressure on my unemployed boyfriend of 2 years to commit to a time to move in after growing tired of hearing \"one day\"? Is he an asshole for saying he will do it one day but only after [excuse] (which is an ever changing and growing list)? ",

      "description": "Hi. This is the first time I'm posting on this thread. I really need your help with this. I am a very bad writer so please try to bear with me. \n\nI am a senior in high school. I am involved with basically all things music. I am in chorus and I am the lead role in our upcoming musical. I have this friend (I am uncomfortable using names so let's call him Josh) who is in all of these things with me. This friend suffers from pretty sever depression and I'm kind of the one he goes to whenever he feels down, and I am always happy to cheer him up. \n\nNow, my best friend in the entire world (we'll call him Jack) decided to join theater senior year just to try something new before he leaves for college. He is the preppiest guy I have ever met; he runs cross country and plays tennis and wears only Vineyard Vines, etc. Jack has just been there with me throughout my life and we have so much fun.\n\nHowever,  I learned that Josh is like IN LOVE with Jack, even though Jack is straight. And Jack knows this. Naturally, Jack feels a little uncomfortable talking to and being around Josh. Josh took the hint and eventually backed off, but still loves him from afar. And Jack continues to try to avoid/ignore Josh at all times.\n\nHe keeps coming up to me and talking to me about how much he is in love with Jack even though he is an asshole to him sometimes. I naturally try to cheer him up and tell him that everything is okay, but he never listens. He just keeps complaining that Jack is being a dick and that he will never love him back. And I never know how to respond to something like that so I just try to change the subject. \n\nAuditions for theater roll around and Jack gets a pretty good role and I am happy for him, even though it is not the biggest role, but he is still grateful for it. Josh on the other hand doesn't get anything. Like NOTHING. Full blown ensemble. And of course he's pissed because he has been so loyal to the school's theater department and they go and stick him in the background for his last show. He was so upset the day the results came out and everyday after that he kept complaining about how the cast sucks and that our director doesn't know what she's doing and that he's going to quit and join crew. I always say the same thing \"It's going to be okay Josh, it's only high school.\" He never listens and continues being sad.\n\nThen one time he told me that he was mad at Jack because he was fighting with him to get my attention at one of the rehearsals. I had no idea what he was talking about and he essentially told me that he was jealous that I was spending more time with Jack than with him. I said that I was not intentionally doing so and that I would hang out with him a bit more from now on. \n\nNow for part in which I decided to end our friendship. \n\nWe did a Secret Santa for one of our chorus ensembles and I got Josh. I got him a very nice gift, wacky socks which he absolutely LOVES and a Game Stop gift card so that he could buy more games for his Switch. My parents even got him a gas gift card to \"repay\" him for all the times he had given me rides and things like that. In my opinion, it was a thoughtful gift and he absolutely lit up when he opened it. He was very happy.\n\nBut we had rehearsal later that day and after rehearsal I said goodbye to him. He ignored me. Flat out ignored me and walked right past me. I got pissed because I know that I had done nothing wrong. I texted him saying \"what's your problem?\" He said \"I hate cast so fucking much\" I said, \"Okay, but why did you ignore me when I said goodbye?\" He said \"Because I'm really fucking depressed and I couldn't find my wallet and I thought I left it in the bathroom when I changed.\" I said \"so you take it out on me?\" He said \"You have no idea how shitty I feel right now. I literally feel so bad I want to slash my fucking wrists open again and I'm not going to but life isn't fucking fair and I'm literally so fucking angry  and upset about this show.\" I said \"look I get that but none of it is my fault. I shouldn't have to get ignored because you feel shitty. And I'm not spending my last musical feeling bad for you the entire time. I want to have fun and I would rather be with the people (Jack) who want to do the same. I get you are upset about your part and want to do crew but could you have at least sucked it up for the first two rehearsals instead of dragging everyone down with you?\" He responded \"You don't have to talk to me I'm just fine sitting by myself don't worry about it.\" I said \"omg this is exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not spending my last show listening to you beat yourself up.\" He said \"Then don't listen to me\" I said \"Whatever. You enjoy your present though\" And that was the end of the conversation. \n\nAm I an asshole for what I said/did? What would you have done in this situation? Let me know. Thanks for your time.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I live in a ski town, well over an hour from any major city. She had made a hair appointment, months ago, with one of her friends, in the major city 100 miles away. A couple of days before the appointment, we both talked about how bad the weather forecast was looking for that weekend.  \n\nThe day of the appointment came, and my main concern was catching the rad snow brought on by the storm, and I hoped she would cancel her appointment, due to the unsafe driving conditions. I was skiing with friends before she was even out of bed, and by the time i was home, she had left in treacherous driving weather. The travel time to the hair appointment in a storm like this doubles, to a three or more hour drive. I am under the impression, that she expected me to take the day drip with her, although it was clear the day before I wouldn't be driving with her, I had plans to ski with friends. \n\nTo my credit: I asked her to consider canceling the appointment, or consider heading to the appointment the night before. She knew the storm was coming and made a conscious decision not to cancel the appointment. She also made a conscious decision to hang out with fiends the night before, instead of leaving for town ahead of the storm. I also don't think i should be expected to give up one of few great ski days and 8 hours for her hair appointment.\n\nTo her credit: I am a much more relaxed snow driver, and more experienced. She also is going on a big trip and would like her hair to look nice, and this is her last chance to get it done. Lastly, a lot of the reason we live in a ski town is due to my hobbies, although she also took a job here and moved with me, I feel somewhat responsible to help her with trips like these. Should I?\n\nIt is blizzard conditions outside, and I'm starting to get worried she is in a wreck! AITA?!?!",

      "description": "I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 22 and have been dating for 2 years. I started taking the anti-depressant/ anxiety medication escitalopram which killed my already low sex drive. My boyfriend and I are still virgins but when I still had desire, we would mess around and such. He asks me every day, several times a day to give him oral sex or a hand job. I say no about 9 out of 10 times, and its extremely annoying constantly being asked. He has also started begging for sex, which I absolutely refuse. We have tried several times to get me to enjoy these activities again but I get zero pleasure. I can't imagine losing my virginity and only feeling pain from it.\n\nHe gropes me out of nowhere around 5x a day and only stops after the tenth \"no\" or if I pry myself away. He takes at least 45 minutes to orgasm, which is very tiring for my arms (and nearly impossible to give oral due to my severe TMJ). \n\nHe is the love of my life, but I feel violated due to his behavior. Is it selfish of me to ignore his needs and tell him no? Should I start pleasuring him more often? Is it wrong to deny him sex after two years of dating?",

      "description": "I tried to write this out yesterday but I guess I was too wordy lol. \n\nAlright long story short:\n\nDue to some issues last year me and SO were given the opportunity to crash at a friends to avoid being homeless. \n\nWe did not pay rent as it wasn’t asked of us but we cleaned the whole house regularly, did their chores, and provided food for ourselves and for them. We made ourselves be scarce and unless invited to hang out with them we stayed in our designated area and avoided using any of their utilities. We even stayed locked in our room for hours to make things easier on them to avoid any conflict with their extended family. \n\nWhen we ended up leaving we were in a better spot financially as SO came into some money and we offered essentially back rent and then some. We offered what their roommate was paying at the time. We offered countless times in different ways and each time they declined it. \n\nDue to them declining we rebudgeted and allocated those funds to something else. Fast forward to us leaving suddenly they started demanding money like we never offered them any. We told them why we rebudgeted and we would still pay them back if they wanted however it would be in chunks rather than one huge payment. \n\nWell after that conversation they decided it wasn’t good enough and started spreading lies and rumors about us. It got to the point with what they were saying that I was afraid to let my guard down. So I cut off contact and encouraged SO to do the same. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I didn’t pay them like they’ve been demanding? Honestly if they reached out and apologized to SO about how hurtful they were I would ignore what they said about me and most likely pay them back for their kindness. I’m not sure what to do. \n\nTo be clear: when we moved in to begin with they did not expect any money or any help with food but we offered food we bought with food stamps and tried to offer them money throughout the time we were there. They accepted the food but declined any money. So we did our best to pay them with keeping the house spotless and such. ",

I can also be extremely sensitive to touch, especially when I'm sick, when just wearing clothes hurts. \n\nLast night after my boyfriend got home from work, when we were hanging out at the kitchen counter, he put his hands underneath my shirt and onto my sides. It was really cold, unexpected, and painful, so I yelped and dove to my right to get away. He didn't let go so I had to pull hard. I was in panic mode and just wanted *away*. I think I hurt his hand doing so, but I'm not sure. He says \"Oh come on, it wasn't that cold!\" I told him that yes, it was cold, and yes, it did hurt, and instead of denying that it hurt me I told him he should have just said \"sorry\" and moved on. He says I'm overreacting, that he just won't touch me ever again, then leaves to the bedroom. \n\nI was shocked, because it wasn't what I expected. But this has happened before. I'll complain about something physical he did, and he'll say \"it wasn't that hard / cold / bad\" in response, instead of apologizing. I know that if I accidentally hurt someone, I'd apologize, not try to convince them it didn't hurt. Is that unusual? Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? \n\nHe avoided me the rest of the night, until he found me crying and apologized. Not for anything specific, just \"I'm sorry\" while he held me. Today, after visiting him at work, he told me yesterday's weirdness was my fault, that if I felt differently then he won't touch me again. That really hurt, because I thought his apology yesterday was him understanding what he did was hurtful. Now, as I'm typing this, I'm wondering if I'm being a pansy by getting hurt by a little cold?

      "description": "Thank you so much for your comments\n\nSomething I wanted to clear up, some people commented that my friend wanted to bone my boyfriend but I don’t believe that. She wants to save herself for marriage and sees her virginity as proof that she’s more pure than other women that have slept around.\n\nOthers said my boyfriend should have been the one to set boundaries with her. Since this is a kinda new relationship (we’ve been dating for a few months) as well as my first, I didn’t want him to think I was a jealous person vs feeling insecure. I felt more comfortable approaching her since we’ve known each other longer than they have. She could also do what she does to him to any of her many *single* male friends, and it would be welcomed wholeheartedly. With the exception of one dude my boyfriend told me didn’t like her because he said she “stinks” and “seems like the type to stir up drama.” I remember thinking he just doesn’t know what he’s missing out on.\n\nToday my boyfriend was cold towards me, holding me at arms length and when I tried to kiss him he straightened up so I couldn’t reach. He wasn’t in the mood and trying to get him to talk when he’s angry is like trying to get blood out of a stone. I’m scared. I have depression, I’m taking antidepressants, going to therapy, yet what I feel for him is what gets me out of bed. He’s a great person, they both are. I can’t stop crying, I know your first is rarely there forever but I feel like we breathed life into this relationship and it’s dying and I’m just watching helplessly.\n\nWhen I confronted my friend about it she looked cornered and uncomfortable. She was wearing his sweater, but that’s just because she has wardrobe malfunctions with her shirt buttons straining against her chest, and she’s always being told to cover up. She has a jacket but it’s too heavy to wear around in school. My boyfriend is a furnace and only wears sweaters to school even in the dead of winter, so she just borrows his. Despite knowing that, seeing it today made me so upset. I got a lot of advice yesterday to keep my cool, and I really wanted to believe she didn’t mean any harm so I tried to phrase the question in a non-accusatory way. I said “Hey, what was up with Saturday?” She said she didn’t invite me because I “didn’t have to be there” and class started so I had to go back to my seat.\n\nIt hurts because I really thought this girl was my friend, we’d stay up for hours talking after school, we have tons of inside jokes and hang out and listen to each other complain. I can’t stop thinking about how I never would have done this to her. I hate this situation, I hate feeling like this, I hate that I loved them and it was like they both chose to hit me where it hurts. Unhappy update but I guess I can only hope things get better from now on.\n\n\nPrevious: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/auanne/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_for_lacking/\n",

We were good friends last year and had similar interests but over time I started to grow out of those things and at the start of this school year me and the rest of the friend group merged with this other one and all was good except AU wasn’t interested with the same things everyone else was.\n\nWe were all laughing about memes and marvel while he was still focusing on stuff like Pokemon. I have been friends with a good few autistic kids during my life so I know what they’re like and what they struggle with but now I’m needing to grow out of these sort of things like Pokemon so started thinking about other friend groups that AU could join but over time I don’t know why but he started being extremely clingy.\n\nWe are all choosing groups for a school project, he has to be with me. Picking teams for sports, he has to be in the same team as me. I don’t hate him for this but it’s being stopping me for hanging out with the people I want to.  I felt like I’ve had enough and everyone else in my friend group is done with him to. \n\nEveryone is sick of his sh*t but I’m trying to keep my cool and try to find him a new friend group. The problem is that the longer that he’s around me the more annoyed I get at him and know I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong because I’m actually starting to be really mean to AU such as completely ignoring him but every now and then he guilt trips me by saying I’m his best friend. \n\nI don’t want to be like this and I’m starting to feel like I’m being to harsh on him but I’ve started to be really stressed about the situation, so AITA?",

      "description": "Hello all,\n\nI (30m) help run the family business. My wife (31f) has weird hours, in that she works 4 days on, 5 off. I try and structure my time at work, such that I can sorta be home when she is to maximize our time together (she suffers from depression and this helps her I think). We recently promoted someone to manage the restaurant, which requires a ton of professional judgement that isnt learned overnight. I typically receive 15 texts/week when I'm not in restaurant. Many of these texts come from the assistant manager we promoted while she develops her skillset, some being relevant, and some being unimportant. This irks my wife, because she believes that home time is home time, despite me structuring my work so I can maximize my home time. I've confirmed shes not jealous of this person specifically, just that she doesnt believe I should be bothered if I'm not at work, and that she perceives she comes after work in my eyes.\n\nMy explanation is that it's the family's business, and as a single store, we need to know if product is running low, or equipment breaks, as happens on occassion. My thought process is that being home early, but responding to a 30 second text or a couple phone calls a few times a week is better than not being home at all. I've since asked managers to try to double check critical items at the start of their shift and communicate issues in one text rather than adhoc. \n\nImo, this could be avoided if I actually worked 40-50 hours per week, but in the past this has caused strife in our relationship.\n\nThis all came to a head when my wife was supposed to work this week, but called in sick for the shifts because of her mood. She wanted me to stay home as well, but I obviously couldnt. She ended up checking my phone while I was showering one day, saw texts from my employees during times when she should have been working anyway, and lost it over the fact that I received texts reminding me to bring uniforms in for a new hire, and that a piece of equipment broke down, which \"distracted my attention from our time together\".\n\nAita because I allow my staff to text or call me despite the fact that it bothers my wife? I have a business to run, and believe this to be the most efficient way to run it when I'm not in store. I've recently made the asst manager salaried and she takes care of many of the issues other managers bring forth, but she still reaches out for material issues, because I'd prefer my restaurant to run effectively.\n\nTo quantify, I spend &gt;40 hours per week with my wife, with what amounts to typically 10-15 minutes of distraction from work.if I worked in my original career, we would likely only have 15 hours per week together.",

      "description": "So my gf and I(33) have a habit of checking each other's phones (whether this is right or wrong is another discussion) and i finally snapped and confronted her about this. She has a divorce finalizing and she told her sister (this I understand) and her 2 friends (of 3 years or so) about it. She has a court date next month and as soon as she found out about it guess who she told, her friends and sisters. She took one of her boys to the ER (nothing serious) and guess what? The funny thing about this one is the text she sent them looked identical to what she sent me. Apparently she copy and pasted. \n\nNow I know you guys will say \"yta\" right about now but hear me out. he wanted to get bunk beds for her boys. She sat there and had a whole conversation with her older sister and her 2 friends (separate conversations). A few days later she tells me \"oh I want to get the boys bunk beds\" not discussing it in the least with me. \n\nThere's times she'll message or call me all excited and I'm glad she's sharing this with me only to find out she did the same with guess who her sisters and her 2 friends. \n\nI have an older brother, younger sister and a best friend and they don't know shit. I know I know people are different and I don't expect her to be like me. But unless I'm dying or going to jail I don't tell them anything I just share it with her. I feel like we have no personal connection. That she treats me like them or sometimes worst. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

I went out with him for a few times, but with no romantic/sexual intentions whatsoever. I genuinely went out with him as platonic friends. My ex found out thay we had gone out, got very angry and ordered the friend to break off any communication with me. The friend refused. We went on a few more outings before the friend confessed that he liked me. At first I thought it was very unfair to my ex, then the friend tried to calm me down by saying that their relationship was already getting weaker, they weren't much of friends as before, they were growing apart. I still felt guilty, but, long story short, we're together. Although I still feel kinda sick and disappointed in myself, even though I myself have experienced a similar situation from my ex's view, and I personally didn't take offense and didn't order my friend to break off everything.

      "description": "A little backstory.  I am the single earner in our home of 5.  I work about 60 hours a week on top of a 1:40 commute each way.  Today I took the day off to have some time for myself.\n\nI really miss seeing my family so I got up early and made breakfast.  My wife didn’t want the breakfast I made so she made something else.  \n\nWhile my wife was still in bed, to help out, cause I’m not home often, I emptied the dishwasher, got the baby up changed and dressed.  Helped the other two get ready for the day.  Fed the two littlest kids.  Made my wife coffee, I don’t drink it cause it upsets my stomach.\n\nThen I took out the trash and the diaper pail.  My wife and I split the diaper duty every other time.  But, being that I’m home and can pitch in I covered for her today.  Then I walked the oldest kid to school. Which she does everyday.\n\nWhen I got home I moved my car out to the street, so she wouldn’t have to when she left for the gym.  Then I came inside and saw the dishes were done.  All except the bowl, spoon and pan I used.\n\nI chuckled and asked if she intentionally left them for me.  Then she got upset saying “I’m not your servant” and “do you really expect me to clean up after you?”  She was really aggressive about her responses.  \n\nI said, “no, I’m just surprised cause it only takes a couple seconds and I thought we were a team. I’ve been trying to pitch in all morning.” This got her really upset saying “Jesus Christ, I can’t believe you are coming after me,\nJust cause you took the diaper pail out!”\n\nI calmly relied “I am not trying to fight”. “I just thought it was inconsiderate when I’m really trying to pitch in as a team.”  Left it at that.  \n\nShe continued to get really upset in front of the kids.  I said, “I’m not willing to argue over this”. Went and did the dishes and calmly went down stairs.  She continued to yell at me as she left the house with the kids and slammed the door on the way out.  \n\nSeriously, I feel like I stepped on a land mine. I feel really uncomfortable when I’m at home.  Cause there is a running theme where she tells the kids that I make things difficult on her when I’m at home.  Whenever I am home, I make it a point to pitch to in everywhere I can.  I also have a number of household duties we have agreed I do.  I do them every day/week. \n\nAnyway, just really frustrated.\n\nTLDR; left dishes in the sink while walking my kid to school.  Came home and all were done except mine.  I had pitched in and done everything else this morning.  Got yelled at for asking if my SO specifically left my dishes for me to clean up (a fork, bowl, and pan).\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my wife to keep her job?",
      "description": "Precursor: My wife has been battling depression and anxiety, which is likely exacerbated by having a stressful job (nurse), and her inability to effectively cope with things not going precisely her way.\n\nA couple of years ago, she quit her job when she first spiraled into depression, for 6 months, she refused to seek appropriate help, would not submit to inpatient treatments, had a couple of suicide attempts, just generally a shit show of me trying to keep a roof over our heads, paying her school and other payments, leaving less than nothing for me, all the while expecting to come home from work to a corpse one day. 6 months, and some additional debt later, she managed to get it together enough to find a new job (not in a hospital, at much lower pay). \n\nWe had put a deposit on a new build house before all of the depression business, and somehow managed to procure a mortgage (likely because of the preapproval from when our finances were in good standing) We moved in shortly before she got this new job. During this time, her new job didn't really cover her share of the household expenses, so I was covering more. The debt I accrued for living expenses etc during her time off couldn't get paid down much because of this. She lasted a year before getting fired because of her generally poor attitude towards authority because they didn't want to change policies or procedures to the way she wanted to do things. Cue 8 months without a job, me footing all of the bills again, and going into more debt because all the while she's spending like she's working full time and goes bonkers if I question anything. Finally, she takes a job with the first hospital she worked at. She's 4 months in now, a miserable anxious wreck (because surprise, every single thing during every single shift doesn't go exactly her way), she still won't seek additional help other than seeing her psychologist something like twice a year, and wants to quit in order to find a low stress job. \n\nThe problem is that based on the lifestyle she in particular wants to live, we cannot afford to take in less money, as we're already drowning in interest payments. When I try and have a conversation with her about this, she complains that it's all about money with me. My compromise is that if she wants to become underemployed, she should at least pay off her school loans first, because by making less than 1/3 of what she is now (which is what she'd reasonably be able to hope for at minimum wage), she wouldn't be able to pay the debt she's (we've) accrued, and i'd end up struggling to pay both of our debts/mortgage/living costs.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty frustrated because she is a miserable wreck because of her career choice, but because of the choices she/we made, there isn't an immediate escape plan for her, and rather than attempt to find a way to make her job work, she'd rather just give up at the first sign of adversity, and expects me to just maintain her lifestyle expectations, when we clearly need two good incomes for that. \n\nAITA for expecting her to keep working until we can get into the black, and expecting her to change her lifestyle expectations if she wants to weave baskets or pet cats for a living?\n",

The first year we were together we celebrated it with our own families because I was still in the closet, and the year after we did it at his parent's house. His brother and his wife alternates and so I assumed we would do it at my parents' house this christmas, but he's very reluctant. We talked a little about it a few minutes ago (he went to bed, because he got stressed about it) but initially his argument was that me and my family don't have traditions \"I didn't even know you celebrated christmas\" and I said yes we're different and we don't watch the same movie year after year and maybe we only eat one christmas traditional dish (the porridge thing because it's fun), take pictures and open presents, but we're a different family and of course it's going to be different. And then he said but where are we even going to sleep, like one of your sisters don't even have a bedroom. And that part is true, but he's just so reluctant to the whole idea. Am I the asshole for being so stubborn about celebrating it with my own family this year? He's my first bf, but he and his siblings are all over thirty so this is not a teen who misses his family.

      "description": "I feel so justified, but my mom is telling me that I'm being an asshole for the way I'm handling the situation.  \nI'm in school for music production, my 2nd degree, 1st was music performance , but the classmate in question (L) just finished highschool. It's an expensive school that spits out professionals ready to work and almost guarantees work out of the gate.\nWe're in groups of 4 for our project, recording a song from an artist we find ourselves. I wanted a challenge, so I looked for an unfinished song I could work with the artist to complete together. Only I would be required to extra work, they could if they wanted, but I didn't want to make things harder on anyone but myself\nFirst session: artist is great, great song, interested in all of my ideas. We have 2 weeks until our next session, but we don't have access to the internet and we store the files on a portable drive that is only compatible with Mac. Out of the 4 of us, only L has a Mac, so I take the recording as an mp3 and I give it to him, asking him to email it to me asap so I can work on the song over the 2 week break.  He says yes.  \nNext day I email L if he could send it over. No response    \nI email him again: I really need that mp3, it's important that I get this work done before the recording session, so none of the group has to suffer. Finally responded today, saying he couldn't access the files from his home computer. Thing is, I already knew that, why is why I gave him the mp3. I tell him It's ok if he lost it but if he has it I really need it, and that it wasn't cool to ignore my message because if I had known he wasn't going to send me the file days ago, I could have booked the time to come in and get, but too late now. I won't be able to get the file until tuesday, and we're incredibly busy every day next week.  \nI say if he felt like I had pressured him into doing something he didn't want to do, I'm sorry, but you need to say that  \n\nIgnored again   \n\nfinal message: how much of an extra burden it's putting on me now that I can't work on my days off, if I don't finish the work in time I'll be screwing over the entire group, and it was easy to prevent if he had been more honest or had just responded to my messages faster. I would have been fine with any excuses earlier, but it's too late for any excuses now to not come off as an asshole.  He's still a kid, so I he should know that this is dangerous behaviour in a professional setting   \n\nno response, am I the asshole? \nsorry if it's disjointed in places, had to cut more than half of it so it would be under 3k characters",

      "description": "I'm sure almost everyone has had to deal with thermostat issues at some point in the office, at home, etc. I know it's a  very fine line to walk and that's why I'm seeking advice here. Earlier this year, my roommates (7 total) and I agreed to keep the thermostat around 70-71 during the day and 68-69 at night. I agreed to this back in September and still think it was a reasonable range of temperatures. \n\nFast forward to now, we are in a cold snap (of course) and temps are in the high 20s/low 30s for a week or two now. I'm freezing quite often. I've actually just had blood drawn to check for hypothyroidism/anemia but until I get results this is going to be an issue.  I have a space heater in my room, windows closed, dressed in plenty of warm clothes/layers and am still chilly constantly. I've been putting the heat at 72 degrees regularly for a couple weeks because 70 degrees isn't enough and those 2 degrees help a bit. Note here: I usually sleep at my bfs house and rarely touch the heat after 7/8pm or so, this is a daytime issue. \n\nA couple of my roommates, one in particular, has been angry the past couple of days because she is too hot. Temperature is such a sensitive subject because everyone's body is so different and I understand that. We are both uncomfortable with the current state of temperatures in this house but I feel like I've run out of options. I can keep layering up or sit around swathed in blankets, but if the rest of the house is fine with the thermostat at 72, couldn't she open her window or remove layers before I have to keep escalating? (this was actually suggested to her in our group chat by another roommate but the suggestion upset her).\n\nShe's been getting progressively more angry about the heat situation and I just need to know AITA? I feel like there are no assholes here really but I need some outside perspective before I lose my mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They always complain about how ugly and fat they are and then go on about how no one cares about them yet they're the ones thinking so when people actually do care about them and go through hell and back just to make them happy.

The thing is, I still want to try and make it work and i hate just casually dating its pointless as far as im concerned, but it does help me nkt be crazy and jealous in regards to her. So i went on a site and made a profile but i cant help but feel slimey and shitty. \n\nI really dont know of its good advice or if i should just give up because i feel like after a little over a year its worth fighting for still but i dont want to be the only one fighting even though shes the one who came and got me back... \nSo AITA?

      "description": "My girlfriend can get upset a little easily, most of the time I get it and I can take responsibility and brush passed it but I'm quite bothered tonight. I got home from an especially exhausting day at school and I was really sleepy. I told her I was going to try to stay awake but I'm sorry in advance if I fall asleep. She told me she felt selfish for wanting me to stay up but she didn't want me to sleep. I understand why she wouldn't want me to sleep, we have a temporary LDR at the moment so I know how time together is important. However, I fell asleep—for 5 hours... When I woke up she was really really mad. She said \"I even had the intention of calling you since you said you wanted to see me.\" I asked her why she didn't just call me and wake me up with a normal phone call she said \"do you know how stupid that sounds? To wake you up just because I want attention?\" At this point I was getting bothered so I asked her \"So then it sounded better to you to say I will chew his ass when he wakes up because I want attention?\" She did not enjoy that... After a little bit of arguing she called me in a video chat. I apologized a lot and she refused to accept it. I told her \"I'm not responsible for how you feel. I didn't do this to hurt you. All I can do is sympathize and apologize.\" It really didn't help at all. After a while she said she was leaving to sleep so I said my goodnight and everything and that I love her. She didn't say she loved me back but she did say bye. I told her \"I'll see you soon? \" she said \"sure\" which is very different from what she usually says. I guess what I'm saying here is am I the asshole for thinking this is an overreaction? Or does she have every right to be upset? \n\n\nTL; DR: I am in a LDR, I fell asleep during the day for 5 hours and idk if that is a bad enough thing for my gf to be so angry",

      "description": "Background: I'm a PhD student. I live in graduate housing, and the buildings are ok but the bathroom walls are thin.  I live in the second-to-last townhouse to the end. It is relatively quite, with some of the students having kids, but its nothing I can't deal with. A few months back, our old neighbors moved and new neighbors replaced them. They are a family of a husband, wife, and one younger kid.  \n\n\nEver since my neighbor moved in to the last (end of the row) townhouse, he throws up. Its very clearly the guy. Almost every morning (before he leaves for class) and every night (8pm-2am) he sits in the bathroom and yells while he chucks it. I MEAN YELLS. I can hear this guy from downstairs with the TV on. This has gone on for months. Its gotten to the point where I can't get ready for school sometimes because I am a sympathetic puker, and the sound of him chucking it about does me in. I have to hide in the bedroom until he finished. I was once taking a shower when he started and...I'm glad I was in the shower so I could clean up right away.   \n\n\nI know they know. The family won't make eye contact when we see each other outside. They don't acknowledge that anything is wrong. I've reached out to the leasing office twice now, and they said I should feel free to approach the neighbors since they indicated the throwing up wasn't \"medically related.\" So, I guess he doesn't have stomach cancer? Would it make it any different if he did? I'm wondering if that means the violent puking is due to drugs? This thought makes me want to approach him even less now, knowing that there may be something else involved. I've even batted around the idea of calling the campus police for some sort of....wellness checkup? This guy sounds like he drank bleach before he throws up.   \n\n\nI view this as: there is noise that is disrupting my daily life and sleep. The source of the noise doesn't matter. Any neighbor that replaces me is going to have the same problem. AITA?",

I asked why she didn't get anything on the way home herself, she said that she visited someone on the way home and was waiting until she got home to decide what to eat. \n\nI argued that this is the exact same thing as she is accusing me of: not contacting the other person 'when their plans change' \n\nAITA or should I have contacted her when my dinner plans changed?

      "description": "This friend and I originally met online, and we became really close friends quite quickly. We talked all the time and played games together quite often, until at one point I felt like she just ended up ignoring me after we had met up in person for the first time. I told her that I felt that way, and we stoped talking for about a month before things got back to normal as she was upset that I felt like that. After we began talking again, she said that her boyfriend told her to not talk to me for some reason. Later on she was having problems with her boyfriend and I told her that I liked her, not much changed after this and we continued playing games and talking almost every day. One day while playing games she had to quit early in order to help out a friend of hers who was depressed, which I didn't mind at all. A few months later she got drunk at a party and messaged me that she loved me, which I was quite doubtful of at the time due to the fact she was drunk and still with her boyfriend. I've forgotten what else happened in relation to that, but nothing changed and we continued talking and playing games together. \n\nA few months later we had both gone back to college, in different cities. One of our mutual friends went out and got drunk with some others, during which one of them lost their phone. I felt that it was a bad thing to have happened, and my friend agreed with me when talking to her about it. I ended up talking to the mutual friend about it, and when I did he said that my friend had no problem with it. Around this point I was starting to become depressed, and it was very hard to get in contact with my friend. Any time I tried to talk she was too busy, or didn't want to talk about the depression as she had been through something similar in the past which I understand. I was slightly confused though, as in the past she had stopped playing to help somebody else in a similar situation. My depression continued to get worse and it was harder and harder to contact her, all while she would post things like \"I wish I had friends\", and \"If only somebody would talk to me\". We met up one more time in person, along with the mutual friend, and I ended up having a panic attack the entire time. They were staying at my place and had booked flights for the day before they had told me they would arrive, which I felt was slightly inconsiderate but I didn't mind too much.\n\nAfter this we barely talked, and any time I tried to start conversation I would barely hear back from her. My depression got to a point where I ended up in hospital, and although she seemed concerned when I first got there by asking if I was ok she then wouldn't reply to any questions I asked while I was there no matter how basic they were. After getting out of hospital I decided that it would be much easier for me to cut her off and move on with my life, and I personally think that it has helped me to get better. I'm still not entirely sure whether I'm the asshole though, and would love some third party opinions on it. ",

I try to tell her that I enjoy hanging out with her, car or not, but it's incredibly hard to make a argument when I am in her car. Anyways, after not being able to reassure her, I offhandedly say, \"Well, you are fun to hang with, but you can be really mean and toxic sometimes.\" After this, she basically went silent the rest of the time she drove me home.\n\nNow, I stand by what I said about her. After all, I do believe what I said to be true. But was I in the right to say it to her like that? She does have a few family issues going on, which makes me feel really bad about the entire situation.\n\nIn short, I called my friend out on mean things she did to me, won't talk to me. AITA?",

      "description": "Breakdown of the title if no one knows what I meant - my job is working 32 hrs a week with a client with intellectual disabilities (ID) and he and his mother have a horrifically gross house infested with roaches &amp; carpet beetles and I recently discovered a series of bug bites that look like bed bug bites on my client. \n\nI spent 32 hrs a week in this home. If they have an infestation I could easily take them home and basically ruin my brand new home (just bought &amp; moved in sept 2018)\n\nAnyway I’m a mandated reporter and I told my supervisor, she reported to department of social services (DSS) and they showed up Friday morning. The mom was super angry, tried to kick them out bu they told her they legally had to be there and speak with here. They took a general history and got permission for a exterminator to contact her, even though they’re gonna need much more than that. (A professional cleaner?) I’m glad she accepted that first step of help, but she talked so much trash about anyone who couldn’t called DSS on her. She knows they won’t just show up unless it was a call. I’ve played it off so far as I don’t know what was going on, my supervisor came by and did our monthly meeting and acted as if she knew nothing about if “verifying” my story but I still feel awful for embarrassing these people I’ve gotten so close to over the last year. \n\n\nSo like I asked, AITA? Would you have done the same thing?\n\nThey are human beings and deserve to sleep in a clean bed, not get eaten up by bugs. Right? ",

      "description": "Basically, I identify as asexual (not sex-repulsed but zero interest whatsoever) \n\nOne of my friends in particular has a highly active sex life, and as a part of our friendship we regularly joke about the topic of sex. We rarely have serious conversations about it, but lately I've been quite annoyed because he doesn't seem to understand how asexuality works. He constantly encourages me to masturbate and says that I'm \"not asexual, just inexperienced\" and that I have an unhealthy relationship with sex that needs fixing. \n\nI've tried to have serious conversations about it and it always ends up with him just joking around and dismissing it. He usually can't get the hint until I'm literally crying in any scenario because he's such a jokey guy all the time. In one situation I was feeling really insecure about it and tried to stand up for myself and say that I'm not broken and I don't need fixing, but he told me I'm in denial and of course I need fixing and that it's not normal for humans to not want sex, and that I'll learn to like it. It's making me second guess my identity quite a lot and I wonder if maybe I was the asshole for bringing it up and making things serious when we were just supposed to be having fun and joking around?\n\nIt isn't a massive deal breaker in terms of friendship for me because since sex is such a huge part of his life, I can totally understand that he can't comprehend living without it. However it's been really grating recently and some of my close (gay and bi) friends have noticed. It annoys me a lot that he respects their sexuality but \"doesn't believe in\" mine. My other non-straight friends think it's BS and are really sympathetic. They want to help the situation and agree that he's being an asshole but they agree he won't listen if we try to talk about it seriously. \n\nThey've suggested that as a group we should tease him a bit in response and intentionally try to make him feel uncomfortable in the same way he makes *me* feel uncomfortable to drive the point home since he only seems to communicate through humour and isn't taking me seriously. Teasing/making fun of each other is a big part of our group friendship, so we always try to respect boundaries when we hit them, but WIBTA if we did this with the intention to make him feel bad and hopefully understand how his actions affect us? \n\nHis friendship is valuable to us and we would never ditch him over it, but I don't think it's fair for me to just have to \"get over it\" or \"grow a thicker skin.\" I don't want to end up being an asshole in return just because HE'S being an asshole, that wouldn't make me any less of an asshole... I'm not really sure what to do about the situation since we've already tried talking to him about it and it hasn't gotten through.\n\n",

My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn’t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad’s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn’t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would’ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this.

During one of the conversations we were having a coworker, who is always cracking jokes and is part of the supervisor team, starts reminiscing on funny stories of the employee, who is going away. One of the stories he told included a part about his sister, who was held back in grade school because she was too shy. \nAfter the story, a coworker, who is not part of the administrative team and fairly new, says out loud, “I was almost held back from kindergarten because they thought I was autistic.” There was a short pause and then the coworker, who was telling funny stories said, “and the verdict is still out!” At this point, the coworker who said it, started to laugh, and I also started to die laughing. I was laughing so hard because the poor girl had left herself open for a joke like that and for him cracking a joke about her possibly being autistic at a mental health organization. Everyone laughed, but realized that the joke was inappropriate, and settled down. I continued to laugh to the point were I began to tear up. After my good hard laugh, the coworker, who was made fun of says to me seriously, “why are you laughing.” To which I respond, “because it was funny.” \nI composed myself and hung out until everyone cleared the room and had the chance to talk to the leaving coworker. \n\nWhen I repeated this story to my girlfriend, she told me that I was the asshole for laughing, which is something that had not crossed my mind because I was not the one who told the joke. \n\nSo who is the asshole?

      "description": "My boyfriend \"M\" has a female friend \"P\", who he previously had a thing with in October (while we were not together). Once we got back together, he stopped hooking up with P but never told her he was dating me; he would always avoid telling her when he was with me, telling her white lies and withholding the truth. So P had developed feelings for M while they were together, and M knew she still had feelings while he and I were already together. She told him she needed to confess something, and M has been putting it off for weeks. Basically, he's ignoring the whole situation (that she's in love with him) while still being friendly with her. \n\nI've told him this situation bothers me and to fix it, which he always agreed to but never followed through. To me it seems like he's leading her on, plus I don't particularly enjoy being kept a secret. His reasoning for not telling her is that he didn't want to make big drama when it wasn't necessary, he doesn't want to hurt her, and that whatever he does P will end up upset either way. He says she's not a great person, that she's stubborn and sensitive and ignores him most of the time anyway (but is that really an excuse?). It finally blew up this morning when she found out from a 3rd party that M is with me. Now she's upset with him, I'm upset with him, and he's upset that I'm upset. He says I don't understand the situation, that I don't understand the type of person P is. He also says he cares about her as a friend, and that he needs support from me during this time rather than anger.\n\nAITA in this situation?\n\ntl;dr: Boyfriend ignores that female friend is in love with him, doesn't tell her about me for weeks, says she's a difficult and sometimes mean person (even though he still cares about her as a friend), and ignored the whole situation because it wasn't necessary and caused drama.",

      "description": " I live with a girl, let's call her Sarah in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seemed fine at first, but quickly small issues started becoming a problem. For starters, Sarah's girlfriend (they started dating right before move in) began living in the apartment right off the bat. Now like I said, its a 2bd2ba, but the kitchen and shared space is very small, so it definitely became very cramped. I really like the girlfriend, she's super nice but she doesn't pay anything to be here, despite being in the apartment every week at least 4-5 days at a time. I attempted to bring this up with Sarah but felt like it was dismissed as being no big deal. This was also something she never asked if I was comfortable with, never asked if I minded, just starting having the girlfriend live with us. I didn't really push it, because I didn't want to make my living situation difficult/cause fighting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a very clean person and Sarah is not. She almost never does the dishes. When she uses dishes, she leaves caked-on food on pots, pans, and plates, and leaves liquid in cups all the time. There will be empty food wrappers and open things of food left out on the counter, and she constantly leaves spilled food all over the stovetop. She will put dishes in the sink sometimes, but that’s it. I'd often just do the dishes because 1. they were mine, and 2. I needed clean things to eat/use. Some friends convinced me that I should stop doing that and let her deal with the mess that she made, which I was starting to agree with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then, the dishes would sit in one side of the sink, start to smell, and then her girlfriend would eventually do them for her. Again, some of these things are mine that either I paid for or my parents got for me, and while it's not like they are fancy (IKEA brand, target, etc.) I would prefer that they don't get ruined by sitting in dried grease and left to grow mold. I tried to talk to her about dishes multiple times, sometimes a quick reminder to clean up after herself, or just a comment here and there, and always nicely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today I made a decision. I move out in May, which is about a month away at this point. I went into the kitchen, cleaned all the dishes that I owned, and then took everything in the kitchen that was mine and packed it up. When Sarah and her gf got home, I claimed that I wanted to get some stuff packed early (not technically a lie) and that I felt like we had enough duplicates of things that it wouldn't be an issue (also not a lie, she has plenty of plastic cups, plates, bowls, and recently bought plastic silver-wear to avoid doing dishes). Her and her girlfriend were absolutely fine with this, and didn't seem to care. I can't help feel a little guilty about it, because I 100% know it was passive aggressive, but after multiple times trying to get her to clean, I didn't feel like I was being listened to. So, AITA?",

      "description": "So I'm 15.5 and I have a car lined up for me. It would be my first car. Problem is it's my dads. My dad through most of my life hasn't been there for me. He was always out on the road and when he came home he would try and turn me into something I'm not. Then he went to prison for 5 years. During this time I loved to Washington while he stayed in Oregon. My mom had to take care of me with little to no money.  The five years past and I didnt know why I never saw my dad. I was later told what he did. This is where the problem comes in. I talked to him about and I soon learned that he wasnt a father. He was a lame excuse for one. He is manipulative and racists and sexist. Like racist to the point of calling black people n***ers in public. My parents aren't legally divorced so my dad isnt obligated to pay anything but over the past 8 years he has only ever given my mom 100 dollar to help with two kids.  I want to cut him out of my life. People in my family believe I'm being harsh and kinda a dick. I also dont want his car because it has 380k miles on it. Am I being too harsh? ",

      "description": "Quick bit of info that needs to be said first off: My sister has a different father than me, but I live in the same apartment as them. He and I don't get along, he was abusive to me when I was a child. Now he is too afraid to pull his shit on me because im bigger and stronger than him. He is a geniune asshole and very few people like him, not even his own mother likes him.\n\nNow onto the part I need help analyzing. My sister is 10 years old and we used to be very very close. Around the age of 6, she started to exhibit nearly the same behavior as her father (who I hate); being aggressive, rude, loud, and obsessed with toys. He thinks the way to peoples hearts is with toys. He is 41 and still buys toys for himself :))) God forbid you leave money out, you will find him with a new supreme key chain or some shit. \n\nAnyways... As she got older, well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and she is a spitting image of him, in her mannerisms, attitude, just....  everything. Seeing the man I have so much hate for being manifested in my sister who I love so much... It really fucks me up. I've gotten really good with selective hearing and sight so you can be right next to me trying to get my attention and I wont aknowlege a thing. I've only ever done this to my sisters father, but now it's been almost 4 years and I cant remember the last time I even aknowleged my sister, who I see every day. She sometimes asks me why I don't talk to her or why I dont spend time with her anymore, to which I usually shrug or just act like I didn't hear her. \n\nI already know that I am the asshole in this situation, but I honestly don't know how to act any other way. Ignoring people is the way I've protected myself since I was a kid. But it kills me though because I truly love my sister more than anything and I wish I didnt see the person I hate so much, in her. \n\n\n\n ",

      "description": "This happened yesterday...\n\nI was at work after a meeting talking to a few coworkers in a group. My supervisor came up to me and started talking. I could tell by his tone, body language, and the fact that he was getting kind of red that this wasn't necessarily a positive encounter. \n\nHe says \"I need you to do something. I'm mad and it doesn't have anything to do with you. I don't need any of your shit. I don't need any sarcasm. I don't feel like hearing any other shit you have to say. You need to just answer me and only the question I ask. Can you help me out?\"\n\nThe speech was a little longer because it lasted about 30 seconds before that last question. I was thrown off from the approach, but decided to attempt to comply. I had 3 or 4 of my coworkers standing next to me. I was also a little... in suspense? Because he didn't provide any context, so my mind during this is wondering \"wtf happened?!\".\n\nSo I choose my words carefully and say \"I could.\" No more, no less. That's a direct quote. I have no doubts that there was apprehension in my voice because I was surprised and.. bewildered, for lack of a better word.\n\nHe responds, \"There you go with that smart ass shit again. Exactly what I said not to do. Fuck it.\" And then he storms off.\n\nSo I'm sitting there confused. The coworkers were mixed on reactions. One just stayed quiet, another said how he would have handled the situation if he were the supervisor (blaming him), and another asked why I didn't just say yes (blaming me).\n\nFrom my viewpoint, it was one of those \"hey I need you to do something but you have to say yes.\" types of situations just not in the playful way.\n\nBut I also understand that he was upset and frustrated for whatever reasons and perhaps instead of diffusing that bomb, I cut the wrong wire and made it blow up. \n\n\n",

      "description": "So I’m in high school. I’m failing a lot of my classes, but trying my best to make up for it. \n\nOne day, my parents get my report card and my dad says he wants to talk to me about it, so that I can tell him how I think I’m doing in my classes and he can tell me how I’m actually doing and talk to me about how I can do better.\n\nI don’t have a specific plan for how to do better, which he wants me to have, but I’m going to try my best and I don’t particularly want him being too involved with my school affairs. \n\nI tell him I don’t want to talk to him about it; he asks me why not, and I don’t have a good answer other than “it’s a waste of time” and “I can do it myself”, which he refutes by saying “clearly you can’t, because you said the same thing at the end of last semester and your grades are still really bad.” And I don’t really have anything to say to that, but I still don’t want him to go over my grades with me.\n\nSo he decides he’s still going to, and I tell him I’m not going to interact with him about it. When he tries to anyway, I ignore him and don’t respond at all; eventually he gives up and say he’ll talk to me about it after I finish my homework.\n\nSo after a little while it’s time for lunch, so I eat lunch and he talks to me about it again. I offer the same crappy reasoning why I don’t want him to go over my grades with me; as before, he starts to do it anyway. I tell him I’m not going to interact with him about it; he asks me why not again, and I’m tired of having the argument, so I ignore him and then go back to my room.\n\nI kind of feel like I shouldn’t have to keep on trying to justify my decision not to go over my grades with him, but at the same time I feel like I haven’t offered good enough justification and I should just do it. So based on my biased point of view, I was wondering if people think I’m acting like an asshole or not.",

We couldn’t place our luggage in the flat we rented the night before, so my sister wanted us to keep our luggage at the train station luggage storage. \n\nWe got up quite early around 9 am to go to the train station to place our stuff, the walk from the flat to the train station was 5-7 mins tops, I was already carrying a big backpack + dragging along my luggage, sister was doing the same. Mom and aunt were sharing one big luggage and they were each carrying a backpack. I generally walk pretty quickly, so I walked a head to the train station with my sister while my mom and aunt was a few feet behind us, it was pretty busy that morning in the train station so me and my sister rushed to the luggage storage place to secure a spot \n\nWhen my mom got to the luggage storage area, she went off at me for being a useless son and how I was a male I had to help her. I was taken back cause I had no idea what I did wrong? In my mind I was thinking, If she needed help with the luggage she should’ve just asked and I would’ve helped. I just told her, I didn’t have to deal with all this and put on earphones. She spent the entire day throwing a petty tantrum and still hasn’t spoken to me, even after I offered to help her with the luggage later on. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\n",

Instead of forcing her to sit still for me to put a tiny ponytail on top of her head (which she hates but I can make her do, it’s just a hassle and I’m the only one that pulls her hair back) I let her dad know I was going to trim her bangs. Her dad and I usually have a great relationship and have not once had an issue with raising her as we’re choosing to co parent. But after I sent him a picture of her trimmed bangs he seemed angry and when I asked he said he was annoyed that I did. I cut an inch, maybe an inch and a half of her bangs around her eyes so I don’t feel like I’m depriving him of being there for her first haircut. There wasn’t even enough trimmed to justify cleaning the sink. Am I the asshole or his annoyance a weird response?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting contact with my dad and his new family?",
      "description": "Now this has to do a lot with my parents past.\n\nI (17m) life with my mother, my half brother (another father) and my full sister.\n\nMy parents had me when they were in their very early 20s. After my mun was pregnant with me, my dad said he wanted to teach me piano (he was a music teacher at a local school). My mum agreed. As soon as I was born, my dad showed his bad sides, gambling, drinking, smoking a lot. When I turned 5, he taught me to play the piano, well taught would be wrong, as he more or less beat the lessons into me. My mum didn't know about it as I didnt say anything. during the span of one year, he became more and more violent, hitting my mum and even attacking her with a knife once whilst drunk. My mum decided to leave him in a rush, for the sake of our safety. Now I don't know if this has to do anything with it, but I was a rough child. my mum had to give up a job, as she had to constantly go to the kindergarden or school, whenever I misbehaved (fighting and doing dumb shit). I got diagnosed with ADHD and my mum decided to resort to medicine (I don't blame her). It worked out and I behaved well. Fast forward a bit and I'm 14. We're on a vacation to see my dads parents who I haven't seen in 12 years (so never really). My dad was also there at that time with his new daughter, about 5 years old. I really liked her as she's been the kind of little sister I've always wanted. My little sister was never on good terms with me, dunno why tbh. \nFast forward 2 days and we're still there. A stupid family arguement breaks out with two sides. The agressive A-Holes including my father and his bitch sister who claimed that my cousin punched her son (she didn't) and the ones that wanted to talk, including all of my family, my cousin, my grandparents and some other cousins. My dad goes to attack one of the male cousins with a pipe which he blocks. fight ends as soon as my dads older brother arrives. He tells us to leave for our own safety (in a kind way, gave us money for a hotel) and apologised for his siblings behaviour. This incident was the last time I saw my dad. \n\nI also need to add, that I am still playing piano and if it wasnt for me learning the piano, I wouldn't have got to known the most amazing person I've ever met, who made my life so much more joyable. I know that she would've wanted me to meet up with my dad as well. I'm grateful to my dad that he gave me this gift.\n\nNow here comes the thing:\nMy mother has been badmouthing my dad forever, and tbh most of those things I would say sound like things he'd do. But I don't hold grudges against people, as life is simply to short for that. My mother on the other hand still hates him and I understand. \nHe contacted me and my sister in November 2018, if we wanted to meet up every two weeks again. My sister instantly said no. I don't blame her, She barely got to know this man, only a few times and he just jelled and had a pipe in his hand. I on the other hand agreed. Now I do have the right to see my dad and my mother or anyone else can't do anything against it. She got pissed at me for saying yes, calling me a \"betrayer\" (haven't heard that for the first time) and saying \"do you know what I had to go through, do you know how much therapy I needed to get past his abuse?\"\nWell I said no but I still wanted to see him. \nWe somehow ended the arguement and left it open. My dad contacted me last week, saying he wanted to meet me. How'd he get my number? I didn't care. All I cared about was if he's the real guy. So I asked a couple of questions which he got right. He told me his wife got a second child after the first one and they want to meet their big brother. Now, he did contact my sister but she instantly blocked him. I didn't tell my mum. Instead I told we'd meet at a café and I'd bring along a friend. Time comes and we're at the meeting and talking about how things are. He invites us to his place and we meet the girls. They are lovely and I love both of them. The wife is also very kind and caring. I left with a positive attitude.\nI went home and told my mum that \"oh yeah, today I met up with dad\"\nshe just asked \" what do you mean\" so I told hee the same thing I just told you guys. Shw gets furious, screaming at me that she told me not to do it and even if, I needed her permission. \nThe incident spread throughout the family in an hour and I got threats from different family members. One said he'd take away my laptop, console and piano (all things I paid for with my part time job money) to which I replied he can go ahead, as I wont back down about meeting him regularily. He took the laptop and the console. well I wanted to go to the police about it but my mum said she'd not file a complaint (I needed parental confirmation or some shit like wtf) \nThe piano stayed as my mum convinced her brother/my uncle to stop it).\nI'm in this situation where I don't know what to do. \nI understand my mothers worried actions, but she needs to understand how I feel too (which is always last priority in this family).\n\nAITA, does ESH or is NTA?",

      "description": "So last night my upstairs neighbor was blasting music so loud I could hear it from down the street. I got home at about 9:30 from work and was ok with the music for a little bit because it was still kinda early so I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and was hoping itd get cut off soon. But the music never stopped and then there was constant stomping and what sounded like yelling. So I called the nonemergency line and got some cops to head this way just for the music . But while I was waiting for the cops one of the people that live got in their car and sped off spinning tires. I live in a quiet community so thats a big no no around here and I had the dispatcher call me back and I told them about the car speeding off and everything. And then  the car pulls up outside parked in the road. I guess they forgot something. \n\nSo the cops show and pull up behind the car. And I guess they were just checking to make sure everything is ok, so they just a basic traffic stop. And I guess the cops smelled something because they ended up running the dog on the vehicle and I guess it got a hit. Because they ended up searching her vehicle and arresting her and towing her vehicle. \n\nI didn't want any of that to happen, I just wanted the music cut down so I could sleep. But AITA for calling the cops and getting her arrested? ",

She calls out for backup...no reply. \n\nI stand in the number 6 or 7 spot with my fiancée. She is working her butt off, and no one has come for about 3-7 minutes. This is admittedly, the most debatable part. \n\n I leave my lady to hold the line(she knows I’m wild) and I go to the back. In the way, way back, I see two employees. One was helping a customer, the other was stocking shelves. \n\nI walk up to the gentleman and say, “Excuse me sir, there’s a huge line up front and there’s no back-up, can you put in a call?” Then as I quickly turned on my heel, I threw over my shoulder, “we have been waiting awhile...thank you!” \n\nThen, when I return(to see my lady had moved up two spots but three customers had been added. Then, within 2 minutes, an employee came from right around the end corner, next to the door. \n\nIdk...but...AITA?!?!\n",

      "description": "Hey Reddit! So currently I’m on spring break at Disney! When riding a water ride a group of teenage girls got on. It was a big raft water ride at Animal Kingdom with plenty of seats.\n\nHowever, when the ride started one of the girls pulls out a juul. I am VERY against all forms of smoking since that’s how I lost my grandfather. My little (who was also on  the ride) has sensitive lungs and has trouble breathing in areas where people smoke.\n\nSo, I (Being the dumb teenager I am) start fake cough every time the took a hit and thanks to mild allergies, I can sound a bit wheezy. My little sister picked up and started coughing as well. Another woman on the ride told the teens to stop but they didn’t listen.\n\nAfter the ride my mom scolded me and told my dad who thought what I did was hysterical. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

She didn't like that but said whatever and that she had no opportunity for the next 5 or so days. Two days later she asks me again if I want to go on a date, for the next day, and I tell her I still want to know ahead of time, not the day before. She never replied to that, abruptly ending a consistent and enjoyable month long chat.\n\n\nA second date still gives me a bit of anxiety, so I'd like to know ahead of time. Not to mention I'm driving 40min both ways and paying for the date, so it's costing me like $50, the least I could get is a two day notice. Note my schedule is open(self employed, but I do work a fair bit every day) so she knows I could go on a date any day of the week. \n\n\nI know rejecting a girl's second date request twice is never smooth, and I *am* basically available 24/7\n\nAm I the asshole?

So, I was writing a test for which you have to study for about a month or more because it’s really hard and it isn’t a normal thing you learn in school. For a moment I looked next to me where the girl is sitting, and she is just looking up the answers on her phone! Which was totally unacceptable. She is known to cheat on tests, but tests are just her thing, so I try to don’t care but this one was the last drop. When we finished writing the test I went to the teacher and tell him about it. He said that he will think about what he will do with it.\n\nNow I fell really terrible about it but on the other hand, she was cheating and this could affect other students. Also, thanks to the cheating she is straight A student and sometimes she exalts herself above the rest and that just isn't fair.\n\nThank you for all the replies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I had gotten home from work to find my parents helping my six year old niece and my four year old nephew go sledding in our backyard. This was all good and well until I heard them mention sending my dog down the hill. My dog is an 11 year old extremely healthy daschund chihuahua mix weighing in at around 10 pounds and he hates the snow. \n   I tell my parents that they could not do it as our hill is very steep and has a lot of spots covered in thorn bushes towards the end. I went in my house to start making some cocoa, going back outside to find my parents laughing and putting my dog on the sled. He was not having it and was struggling to get off when my mother gave him a hard shove. I watch in terror as my dog rockets down the hill.\n   When he finally came to the end of the hill he hit a large bump of leaves sending him flying as they had been somewhat packed by the snow. His back end hits a small tree giving out a yelp and goes a little further before coming to a stop. I ran down the hill to pick him up and get him inside. When I finally got to the top of the hill and ran him inside I asked my parents what was wrong with them. They're telling me I was in the wrong now and saying he's okay and that there was nothing wrong with it.\n   When I got him inside and set him down to see if he would walk okay he began to limp, I'm going to bring him to the vet after work tomorrow to check him out but my parents are still telling me I was in the wrong.

So we all agreed to arrive at 08:00 am.

And Professor replies saying he is dissatisfied is the other members and know he knows who is interested in the project. So now it's 09:30 am. One guy shows up and now I leave for meeting and then a class. The remaining 2 show up at 12:15 pm all pissed of at me. Saying they were busy and bad weather and meeting (excuses and I came from other city before them in bad weather),they were like you shouldn't have emailed the professor (prof warned them of a grade F last warning) and they wouldn't do it of I were late and I replied saying I would have let you guys know that I will be late. We were supposed to finish at 02:00 pm but finish at 04:00 pm so AITA or NTA for letting my Professor know that none of the group members are here for the test?",

      "description": "Hello again read it I’m bad with a slightly less sexual topic this time. I imagine this will might be split along gender lines for some reason but here we go. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not caring that my wife doesn’t know what she wants to eat. Let me explain whenever my wife wants me to cook for dinner or take her out to a restaurant she never knows what she wants or where she wants to go. I get answers like oh whatever you want or oh make anything. Until I actually decide on something then she doesn’t want that.\n\nThis is been something that is been happening daily for the last seven years. Until recently I decided to stop caring. Now when she asked me to cook for her but she doesn’t know what I just walk away and say “let me know when you do” then go play video games. Now when she doesn’t know what restaurant she wants to go to, no problem luckily I know exactly what restaurant I want to go to and I walk right inside.\n\nNo I personally feel great she however is becoming more and more irritated at the fact that I don’t play the well what about this, well what about that, well what about here, well what about their, game with her anymore. Also I’m getting to eat a lot more of the food I like :). \n\nI wouldn’t mind so much if when she said whatever you want it actually meant whatever I want instead of let me shoot down your ideas for the next 30 minutes.

      "description": "So this happened a couple years ago but I'd like to hear what you all think about it.\n\nThis guy (A) was one of my best friends for years but we lost contact after high-school, you know how it goes.\n\nA few years back I start a new job and A happens to work there so we start to hang out again. I'd heard he recently got married and when I meet his wife they seem like the perfect couple.\n\nFast forward a few months and I hear from a mutual friend that A is getting divorced! I hadn't caught up with A for a few weeks since we worked separate shifts. Then I hear that within a couple weeks of the split he's living with another, visibly pregnant woman...\n\nThe same mutual friend tells me he didn't just cheat, he was also abusive. Hearing it from 1 friend was bad but 2 other friends told me the same thing. So now I'm re-thinking my friendship with A and when I hear that the abuse was bad enough for neighbours to call the police I decide I want nothing to do with him.\n\nA few months go by when I get a phone call from A. I'm planning to tell him where to go, but his new gf is with him on speaker and they want to tell me the baby arrived. Also, he's said such great things about me to her, she wants to meet me. Well now I figure I'll at least meet to ask him for his side of the story. \n\nAs we decide where to meet up, the gf takes the phone off speaker so we can chat a bit one-on-one. At this stage I'm worried so I subtly ask questions about the relationship and she tells me he's getting help for anger issues. Then I mention the rumor I heard about the neighbours calling the police. She tells me it wasn't much, just a noise complaint. But then I realise something, I was talking about the police being called to a fight with his wife, but she's talking about it happening while SHE'S been living with him. \n\nNow I've made up my mind, I'll still go and I'll let him tell his side of the story, but unless he has an incredibly good explanation, I don't want to see him again and I'd advise her to get out of there for the sake of her and their baby.\n\nSo the night of the meet up arrives, and they don't show. I send a couple texts but they don't respond. Oh well, it makes me feel better about cutting him out of my life. \n\n3 days later a friend of ours from high-school I'm still in touch with calls me to tell me A's partner died of a heart attack on the night they were supposed to meet me. He also knows the ex-wife and she told him one of the reasons they used to fight was that he used drugs. They even once had the police called to a fight they had while they were on holiday in another country! \n\nThis is the point where I decide to cut off all contact. He's texted me a few times over the past couple years but I ignored him. \n\nSo tell me Reddit, A is definitely an asshole but am I one too?",

We then made plans to hang out at least 3-4 times a week, not just purely for sex. So, around 2 weeks ago, I asked offhand if she's seen anyone else recently. She was quiet for a minute or two then said that she metup with an old friend of hers who was in the city for a few days (he lives abroad) who they had a thing going on before. She told me that they slept together for a night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was devastated hearing this, but I didnt let it show. I messaged some of my other connections in bumble and setup a date last saturday night. Sarah asked me to watch a movie with her last saturday, but I told her I was busy. So I met and slept with the other girl. Come monday, I told Sarah the truth that I saw someone else. She was visibly hurt and wouldn't talk to me until today.\n\nWas I an asshole?

I came to grips with that.\n\nWas it zhe big titties?\n\nMaybe. But I do NOT gamble with maybes.\n\nWas it annoyance?\n\nYes indeed.\n\nFast forward two years, we became close friends and I caught a girl who's one cool gal.\n\nMy friend however, gonna call her Marie, kept changing guys like they were socks. She's not a ho by any means, I promise. She dates people and moves on when shit goes awry. Sometimes it's not her fault and she be with assholes, realizes that and yeets.\n\nBut this one dude named...Richard came into play and fuck shit up. Richard didn't have a good...emotional mindset to rejection.\n\nRichard comes outta nowhere and starts taking her out to each, taking her out for her birthday, driving her wherever, all that jazz. I didn't care. In school, they started showing affection. At first it was a hug and a loving hand hold departure, now it's a full makeout session. I don't care.\n\nI don't have any beef with that. I don't care. Just as long I can look away and continue bout my day. \n\nThey weren't together. He didn't want the title of boyfriend of Marie. Of... Marie... Okay.\n\nShe found his \"secondary\" social media page after a friend alerted her about it and I was flabbergasted off of what I saw.\n\nRichard's Bio basically said, \"I love Black Porn and I'm single.\" She was in Awe. Fetish for black bitches. We had a long ass convo about meeting good guys and not nice guys. I didn't care if I was a goddamn hypocrite, but I said it's better if she's single so she can focus on her dream of becoming travel scientist.\n\nCoupl' month later, they dating. Welp.\nI thought they were dating because he trapped her into the relationship because she didn't want to feel responsible for whatever his emotional meltdown could be. It could be violence against others or himself, exposing her secrets yadda yadda. This was just my theory based on previous experiences with his \"LoVe LiFe\". And this is where the situation gets my attention.\n\nI told my girlfriend that even though I find all humans to be art, he's fucking garbage and they he should get lost in hell.\n\nMy theory was proven wrong, and she wants him to be (basically) sugar daddy\n\nI told my friend we shouldn't give her any advice on her relationship because we already tried.\n\nAITA for thinking that way or am I too protective of my friend?\n\nWIBTA for letting the castle break on it own? I don't want anything to do with it now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So my girlfriend (26F) and I (27M) dated for three years. Let’s call her Jessie. We met on Xbox and I moved from one state to pretty much across the country to be with her. Jessie’s great, she’s sweet and smart but I never really fell in love with her.\n\nI broke up with her about 9 months ago because of her very controlling and insane mother. I decided to date another girl that I fell madly in love with but eventually turned out to be a very toxic and immature person. So we broke up.\n\nNow I’m considering dating Jessie again. We talked and hung out a lot for the past three months and just a few days ago we decided to be in a relationship again.\n\nMy main issue with her is her mother. Jessie pretty much lives and breathes for her mother. Any time her mother tells her to do something, she does it. If her mother tells her to be home at 7 PM, she’s home by 7 PM. Jessie’s mother has hated me since we first met, because since day one she’s tried to tell me what to do and how to act and I just politely tell her to fuck off. She’s super controlling and even goes as far as getting up and walking across the house to Jessie’s bedroom to tell her to let the dogs out, when Jessie’s mom is right next to the door, just because Jessie’s mom doesn’t want to stop playing her video game. She’s put 12,000 hours into Destiny, and is well on her way to that with Destiny 2, and if anything gets into her way with her gaming, she gets highly upset.\n\nFor the past few days we were talking about her coming over today and spending the night and leaving at 6 PM (her mom usually makes her be home at noon if she spends the night). I made sure every day to ask her if she’s going to spend the night, and she promised that she would.\n\nToday she shows up and tells me that her mom convinced her that she shouldn’t spend the night. I explain to her that she’s 26 and still worships her mom like she’s Jesus Christ, and she says she knows and gives me some random excuse.\n\nThis wouldn’t be that big of a deal if this was the very first time this has happened. It happens on a weekly basis, she’s apparently not allowed to spend the night twice at my house, only once a week, because she makes an excuse if it comes to spending the night twice. I believe her problem is that she tries to make everyone happy and is too scared to take a stand one way or another.\n\nSo I was thinking about breaking up with her in a few hours and just go our separate ways. I’m so tired of being let down by her and her controlling mother. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Considering breaking up with my girlfriend because she follows her control freak mother’s every whim.",

      "description": "So recently i broke up with my girlfriend because i found out she was cheating on me, and of course i told my buds about it. A school being a school, as usual, rumors fly fast. Soon enough the whole school knew about this. And she blames it on me for spreading 'lies' about her cheating on me.  She was hanging out with him before school,  after school, and everything else in between. I'll be damned if the school didn't know about this even after seeing that. They even snuck out together before. And she was still saying she wasn't seeing anyone outside when i asked her. So after me and my best dudes did some research we found out that she WAS cheating. So i just decided to break it off. Take not that at this point we were in 8 months already. After we broke up she got really pissed at me about this whole thing and she called me a baby for not being able to keep the news to myself. And she really hurt me, so i don't know what to do now. Be vulnerable and take the blame or stand up to her because i have nothing to be afraid of and have done nothing wrong whatsoever. Please help :) much appreciated &lt;3",

I don't often tell people I am in a relationship **unless the conversation warrants it** (i.e. the discussion shifts to talking about our partners, etc.) \n\nIn my perspective, this isn't necessarily \"lying\" per se, as much as it is the omission of irrelevant details. \n\nMy primary reason for this is that I have been criticized before (particularly by men) claiming that I'm entitled for thinking they \"want me\" because I told them I was in a relationship straight-up. \n\nThis has been an area of contention for me because, on one hand, it does seem a bit odd to disclaim that outright, but on the other hand, I have gotten shit for \"leading people on,\" if I don't reveal my relationship status early on in a conversation.\n\nMy boyfriend is uncomfortable by my decision to keep our relationship relatively private unless I am asked/the context permits it, but he also has a better sense of intuition than I do. \n\nMy environment makes it so I constantly interact with individuals my age that I'm obligated to be nice/courteous to, and I am a petite and relatively conventionally attractive woman. This makes my boyfriend worry because I have been confronted both publicly and privately by people after \"leading them on,\" which compromises my safety.\n\nMy partner isn't insecure and our relationship isn't unhealthy, but AITA if I decide to continue only discussing my relationship status when asked or when the social context permits it?",

I called a rideshare carpool and got in the back -- my mom called so I picked up and was making small talk with her about her day. The driver picked up someone else and we continued on our way, and I continued chatting with my mom. \n\nAfter a minute or two, the other person said that I was being rude by talking on the phone and that I should stop. She said that she was just trying to get home and didn't want to listen to my conversation. This was surprising to me, since I had always been under the impression that it was normal to have regular-volume conversations in rideshare carpool situations, similar to being in a cafe or public bus. \n\nStill, rideshare carpools are a fairly recent thing, so I want to see what gut reaction Reddit folks have to these situations.

      "description": "So, just some background information first; We've been planning this wedding for 2 years &amp; my friend has never been on the guest list, &amp; when we started planning she was single, we saw each other about once every other month &amp; spoke sporadically. Once she met her girlfriend she started seeing me more as we could do couples stuff but it's still not often we all see each other.\nA couple who are invited to the wedding are very close friends I game with who live in a different city but we speak &amp; skype often &amp; visit each other for long weekends. This becomes relevant I promise.\n\nAnyway, the other night her girlfriend (GF) messaged me asking what time they needed to be at the hotel for the wedding as my friend needed to book time off work. I told her that they weren't invited to the wedding &amp; maybe she'd confused it with the party we were hosting after we returned from our honeymoon. No reply to the message straight away but saw it.\n\nI went to bed &amp; the next morning had messages off both the GF &amp; my friend. My friend simply stating how she'd sort it but was disappointed in me &amp; her GF going off at me about how we were such close friends &amp; how I'd ruined her plans to propose to my friend at MY wedding &amp; that she wouldn't forgive me, especially as I'd invited \"Random geeks off the internet\" (Told you it was relevant).\n\nI muted the chat &amp; got on with my day. When I did look back through her messages she'd played the gay card (I'm bi) &amp; said she'd been dreaming about the wedding &amp; planning how and when to propose. I told her she was obsessive &amp; that she needed to realise that it was my wedding.\n\nI got a message from my friend telling me I shouldn't have been rude to her GF &amp; that we'd known each other a lot longer than the other friends I'm inviting, however they know my favourite colour &amp; my partners middle name whereas she called my partner Bill for 2 years. I told her if she didn't like it they didn't have to talk to me again &amp; they should just forget about the party though if they apologised I'd reconsider letting them attend the party though the apology had to be in person. \n\nNot heard from either, the GF has removed me as a friend but not blocked me.\n\nTl;dr - Friends GF and her call me an asshole when I tell the GF she is being obsessive over my wedding which she was never invited to.

I asked her about it at the beginning of class here and, in front of 27 other students that [most] already don't like me because of my interests, said \"Well you should have used your brain to make it up earlier. Maybe I will wait to grade it as long as it took for you to make it up.\" I was gone all of the earlier days, and the marking period ends in 2 days, meaning I would get a 0/36 for something I couldn't control and did. Everyone during this speaking activity since this happened has been harassing me over it, insulting me. She has been ignoring it entirely at her desk on her phone.\n\nI'm livid and want to talk to my principal over the matter for two reasons: one, I am scared for my grade and two, I feel outed to the entire class over a private conversation about my grade. I just don't want to be that dick that probably gets her in large trouble over something that might be no big deal.\n\nAm I an asshole if I were to talk to my principal over it?

He comes to visit this part of the country because he’s never been here and stays at my place. (Until there nothing happened.. we were just friends.) \nA few days later he tells me that because everyone kept asking him if i was his girlfriend, he started to think about it. I said I’ve never felt that way about him and if he thought this was too harsh and wanted to stop talking to me, it was fine. He says he doesn’t want to lose the friendship so let’s talk normally.\n\nHe lives with his family, which he doesn’t get along with, says he wants to move to another place, so I get him a job here really near where I live.\n\nOf course I show him around, I introduce him to my RL friends. And on a saturday I just have a break-down on a club because of my BF, and by this point i’m pretty fucked up and don’t know what’s happening, I just remember I’m crying and my friends are taking me out of the club. A while after, someone tells me this friend, at the club just said “I can’t believe she is gonna suffer because of that guy. I don’t feel good so I’m leaving”\nTake it into consideration that it’s his first time in this place, he doesn’t know the city... wtf........\n\nSo in between dealing with my ex BF, being ashamed of the break-down, and asking what was up with his reaction, I just choose to deal with one thing at a time, the most importante is dealing with the ex-BF. So I have been pretty much ignoring this friend for about 3 days.. but he doesn’t stop messaging me like nothing happened.. AITA??\n",

I didn't think Ben would go tell her what we talked about, but then that night the girl comes to me and explains everything and that she liked me. I told her to give me a day to think about everything, mostly because I didn't expect to come to my door and I was kind of taken off guard. I decided I was not into her and had no interest in dating her, especially because I would not want our relationship to make anything weird with Ben if we ever broke up. So I decided to tell her that I was not interested and that I was didn't really feel like I could commit to a relationship at this point in my life, which is true.

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, grammar, etc. I’m on mobile, yada yada yada. \n\nSo last night my sister got into a car wreck, (her fault, no one was hurt seriously besides bruises and being sore.) She was freaking out because the both of us work CNA jobs which don’t make very much, while also in school for medical professions. She would start her program a year ahead of me, but it’s very hard to work during either programs so both of us would have to be PRN or not work at all. Some people work while doing it but it’s insanely hard and stressful, especially since you have to have a certain grade point average throughout otherwise you get dropped from the program. \n\nLast night, she was talking about having to push back starting the program so she could work and pay her car note, car insurance, etc. She had already pushed it back a year before that, and I didn’t want that. I told her to not worry about it, I’ll pay her note and insurance. I’ll work, and I was going to push back my school and my plans for life. \n\nShe immediately began looking at cars online, cars well over 10k. My grandfather is coming to pay for the down payment for a car Thursday, which he doesn’t have the money to really do. He had said before that he would help me pay for my transmission to be fixed, not the entire thing since I didn’t want him paying that much money, but now I can’t ask him for any money. The guilt is weighing on me even having him pay my sisters down payment. \n\nI was planning on buying my own car because the transmission on my old car is about to go out, and wanted to move in with my boyfriend later on this year. My mom is controlling, beyond so, and doesn’t help pay for very much. She’s never truly had much money, and what money she gets she blows easily. We now live with my cousins while my sister and I share a tiny bedroom, and she pays less here than when we were in an apartment. I’ve been unemployed and just now starting to work again, the entire time I was unemployed my sister payed for everything I needed. Bills, paying for clothes, groceries etc. \n\nI had a talk with my boyfriend, and I don’t want to pay her car note. I want to move out, I want to go to school, I want to get a car that doesn’t shake and the engine doesn’t scare me that it’s going to fall apart every time I drive it. I came home and told my mom this, and she told me “It doesn’t work that way. You said you would pay it last night, you don’t have a choice.” \n\nSo I’m sitting in the bathroom, trying to cry as quietly as possible while texting my boyfriend. AITA or would I be if I didn’t pay the car note for her new car?",

When no one is moving, it's just a normal (albeit huge) spot - nearly double the size of a standard space, but not quite (it's about 1 foot short of the threshold to make it two spaces). When I use this space, I pull up to the curb and leave as much room behind me as possible so that other people have another space to park.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the questionable part. When I see someone not extending the same courtesy to me and other residents or their guests (who also park free), meaning they make it impossible for two cars to use the space, I take a picture of their license plate with the make and model of their car also visible, log their information into a personal spreadsheet (which I show to NO ONE), and then leave a note on their windshield to the effect of: \"Please do not park like this! This space can easily fit two cars! Please either pull up to the curb or back to the line! Be more considerate of others! Thank you!\". The exact wording changes each time because I do them all on the spot (never bothered to make a template or anything), and though I always use please and thank you, I also tend to use exclamation marks. If their parking is not egregious, and can still technically accommodate my car, I will park behind or in front of them as best I can without touching their car, sometimes getting as close as one inch out of necessity, and I will NOT leave a note or log their info.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been doing this for about a year and a half, and so far have logged 36 offenders, or about 1 every 15 days. Today I felt the need to post this because I finally got a response note saying exactly: \"Stop leaving Notes on people's cars and taking pics or we'll call the cops on your self-entitled ass...Thanks!\". My first instinct was 'I can't wait to write another note with a disclaimer that what I'm doing is not at all illegal and they shouldn't waste their own (or the cops') time and just be a considerate driver (parker?)'. But I stopped to wonder...Am I the Asshole? (side note: is what I'm doing the legal definition of harassment, or something else?)",

She has  asked me in the past if I wanted her to stop talking to this person, to  which I’ve repeatedly replied that I did not want to tell her who she  can and cannot talk to, but that I would like her to let me know  whenever he messages her.

      "description": "I'm in nursing school right now, and my dad is putting me through it. I am very gracious for this, and I know that this makes me more privileged than others. Although, I don't think this excuses what he has done (and is still doing) to my family.\n\nI'm going to attempt to make a long story short. I'm originally from Spain (Mom = Spanish, Dad = Filipino). My dad is in the Navy so that's how he got himself to Spain where he met my mother. I grew up in Spain for 10 years, and then we got stationed in America. Ever since my dad got the chance to put the whole Atlantic Ocean between my mom and her family he has been treating her like complete, utter, absolute shit. \n\nI think my dad has some sort of Bipolar Disorder or PTSD, but at this point I don't care because I wish he would drop dead tbh. For 11 years he has been treating my mom, 4 siblings, and I like garbage. He justifies it all because he pays for everything, and that sense of control/power over us has made him do some pretty ballsy stuff. My mom deals with it because she wants to wait until my youngest sister gets her college paid for by him, and then she wants to go back to Spain (I am going to make this happen for her). \n\nFor some more context, my mom is a pretty independant woman. Regardless of his verbal and sometimes physical abuse, she managed to get a job out here and she managed to learn english. Although, because of this, the abuse just gets worse. My dad always falsely accuses her of cheating and being a whore. This usually occurs when my mom goes to work, my dad really believes that she actually prostitutes herself. He will go around the house yelling that she's a whore, loud enough for my baby sisters to hear. I have tried to tell him to grow up and settle things the mature way, keep the arguing contained, my sisters don't have to hear this bs. He just takes this offensively and threatens to kick me out (this was back when I was in High School). Now that I really can get legaly kicked out, my mom told me to stay on his good side. My mom is depressed, and tired if this. \n\nI am a couple months away from graduation. I am grateful that I get my school paid for, I am lucky. But I want to cut ties with this asshole after I'm done. I always imagine myself taking care of my mother when she gets older, but I will gladly pay for the cheapest, shitiest nursing home for my father. Thinking like this makes me feel slightly bad for him, because unlike him I am an empathetic human being, but the hell he has put us through for 11-12 years will never leave my psyche. ",

I won't get into it, but he was emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive and tried to rape me at one point. He's also a compulsive liar, and probably bipolar. \n\nWhen I was 20 (he is a year older), I found out via a mutual friend he became engaged to someone. I talked to my lifelong friend about whether or not I should tell this girl what he's like, but chose not to out of fear of retaliation. He knows where I live and is military and has lots of guns.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I discovered, that less than six months after their marriage, they separated (unclear if officially divorced), are not on speaking terms, and she is pregnant (also unclear if his). I have a lot of guilt if this girl ended up knocked and divorced with an unstable and abusive person's child she has to care for for the rest of her life, and wonder if I could have prevented it by saying something two years ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy SO (a wonderful, wonderful human being nothing like my ex) and my friends assure me I was not the asshole because of my fear of him and PTSD and trauma from the abuse, but a girl I'm barely aquaintinces recently made a comment that if she had an abusive ex she would tell every girl he dated after to \"protect them\" and girls who don't do this are \"anti-female\" and don't support other women. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

However, he met this girl. Call her A. He swiped her on Tinder and said he wanted to be fwb. She agreed, they sexted, then when he and I got back together he ghosted her. \n\nNow, we’ve been back together for 6 months, and everything’s great, he’s been talking to her about joining us in the bedroom. Only now, she’s saying she wants to hang out with only him. And she keeps telling him how upset and mad she is at him for ghosting her. She says she liked him and wanted a relationship and is upset that he “ghosted her to get with someone better”.

It hits extremely hard sometimes, to the point where I start hyperventilating and crying and shutting down. I don't have any mirrors in my room anymore, and I try not to be in any pictures. It just pains me everyday. I'm extremely depressed over this.\n\nAnyways, I don't like confrontation. I don't like talking to my mom about this in real life because it pisses her off. At school, I text her a lot during my breaks and open up about how much I hate being a girl, and how I wished I had been born a boy instead, and asking my mom for what to do. My mom keeps ignoring me, and trying to point out that women are better than men, or saying stuff like \"Yeah but we can cover up our flaws with makeup! And have kids! And do all wonderful sorts of things!\" and other \"advantages\" that aren't actually advantages, or anything I'm interested in.\n\nI don't have anywhere or anybody else to vent out to , so she's my only option. The thought of a diary popped up, but I don't want to have a typically feminine hobby like that.\n\nSo obviously, I'm extremely depressed over this, right? And whenever I text my mom to vent, she just gets angry and says \"Why can't you just love yourself? I love myself!\" \"It's just a phase that all girls go through, give it some time.\" If she's true about the phase thing, what an awful fucking thing all girls have to go through, yet another reason why I hate being female.\n\nI honestly truly hate it, and my mom doesn't want me \"talking shit about her own gender\" and making her \"feel a bit upset\" about how I'm feeling. She acts like she wants to do what's good for me, but all she does is make me feel worse, and she knows it.\n\n(She won't let me see a doctor for this, but I don't think this is a necessary point in this story)\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I was driving along in Utah (from Moki Dugway towards Hanksville) and if anyone hasn’t driven there, it’s basically an endless road and nothing else for 2-3 hours. I didn’t even see any other cars which was eerie, and while the red rock hills around make for a stunning scenic drive, as I was alone I was kind of getting a The Hills Have Eyes vibe. \n\nAt one point a hitchhiker appeared ahead, put his thumb out then started waving frantically when I didn’t slow down. I put my hand up apologetically but just sped right past and kept going. He didn’t look dodgy, had a lot of camping gear and I’m guessing he was just someone who was out camping/exploring in that area. \n\nI do like to help others normally so I felt a bit guilty as I would probably have been safe (I’m 25M) and potentially made a friend, but ultimately decided to play it safe. \n\nThere was a ranger station a 30 min drive further on so if he kept walking he would have reached that.\n\nAm I an asshole for that? What’s the etiquette with hitchhikers these days? ",

      "description": "I'm extremely into genealogy. I've put a lot of time and effort into researching my own over the past 6 years. I send out periodic updates to family members all over the country via emails maybe twice a year but definitely once at the end of the year. I almost never hear back from them on this particular issue. Basically, no one is as big a nerd about this stuff as me. I do know that they read the emails and internalize the info. I've gotten pretty far back generationally speaking and most of my family are late-19th century to early 20th-century immigrants from Europe that settled in and around New York and Connecticut. I'm incredibly proud of that immigrant part of my lineage considering the station in which we find ourselves only a few decades later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in August, I got thrown a bit of a curveball. It turns out that me and my cousin's 5th &amp; 6th, great-grandfathers were slave owners in upstate New York from the 1770's until the 1820's when the last 19 were freed. I found a list of that last group and three of those people had the same last name as my cousin and after a bit of digging, well... to make a long story short: part of my cousin's family (his mother's side, white) was once owned by another part of his family (his father's side, black). I find this mortifying and it is absolutely killing me. It is literally is making my stomach hurt right now. I desperately even payed a professional genealogist a few hundred bucks to try and disprove my finding somehow to no avail. I've been putting off an update for months and now it's the end of the year and I'm faced with the choice of telling everyone or telling no one. I've written the draft email that excludes this information but I haven't sent it yet. I feel very strongly that adding this information into the email would cause undue humiliation and mental anguish for my family and particularly my cousin and my aunt and I don't want to visit upon them anything close to the emotions I'm having, if not more. No one would have ever learned about this if it wasn't for my dumb hobby anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA if I leave this out?",

      "description": "Hi reddit,\n\nFor context:\n\nWe are a small company, there was only two people really experienced here. One of them left last December and I got a proposal from the same company to go with him. After much thought, I talked with my last remaning experienced colleague about the matter and she told me that it would be a bit unfair from my side to the company to leave at such a critical moment. I've decided to stay based on this thought, too, because I'm not as experienced but my bosses really like me and I think I've been doing a very good job so far. So  think it would be really hard for them to lose us both at the same time.\n\nBut January came, and they decided to fire our last experienced member (the same one I just mentioned) simply because one of my bosses (they are a couple) doesn't like her. She was top notch professionaly, everybody liked her, expect the boss. So they fired her, leaving the team even more crippled. \n\nMy feeling of \"being unfair to leave\" dissolved completely on that moment. \n\nA month later (a week ago) I received a fantastic offer for my career on another company. I really want to go, even though I know it will hurt my company and current bosses a lot. They recently gave me a raise and I know they are totally counting on me, but I still feel like leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for leaving?",

      "description": "I work for a relatively large consulting firm and am comfortable with my job and the people I work with. It's pretty chill here compared to more competitive territories in the US or Asia Pacific.\n\nMy gf lives in Japan, where we met a few years ago while I was on exchange. I absolutely love her to bits. We Skype regularly and I fly off on my holidays to see her in person. In our discussions, the topic of us being together in a more permanent situation gets raised quite frequently.\n\nShe tells me that she doesn't really like how people are in Japan, with the usual cold demeanor they have with strangers and their unreasonable standards. However, it is still the country where she was born and raised - so of course she still feels at home there. \n\nI like Japan as a country to visit, but I'm adamant that it isn't a country that I'd like to continue my consulting career in. Even if I spoke fluent Japanese (which I do not), Japanese companies tend to work crazy hours and have very backwards culture around certain societal norms that I take for granted in my country.\n\nShe's recently gotten a full time job in her chosen field, and wants to wait it out for a few years before a decision is made. However, I've made it clear that I have no intention of moving where I am. That she has to move here, if our relationship is to progress. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Long story short, my ex boyfriend (C) broke up with me 2.5 months ago. We stopped talking and cut each other out of our lives and sort of moved on; he started sleeping with a random tinder girl, and I started hanging out with/sleeping with one of my work friends (J), who I’ve known for 2 years, actually a bit longer than I’ve known my ex. \n\nMe and J started sleeping together and I told him at the beginning that I didn’t want to date or catch feelings because we weren’t compatible and I didn’t want that and neither of us were completely over our exes. So it was just sex at first, but then we started hanging out and doing homework and watching movies and hanging out with my roommate. He would sleep over almost every night, with sex maybe 1-2 nights of of the week. Needless to say, we both started catching feelings. I pushed mine down as best as I could because I knew he didn’t want anything like that, and I didn’t think I could fall for someone again. He never outright said “hey I like you and I want to date you” but he would say that he liked me and would give me compliments and basically do all the boyfriend things without any expectation of dating.\n\nHalloween rolls around, and I’m invited to a party at my friend K’s place, and my ex was invited too. I ignored him for the first hour and then got really drunk and talked to him, and it was good. We talked about a lot of big things in our lives and how we did miss each other, and then he was kind enough to hold my hair back when I threw up later. After rinsing my mouth out and all, we talked in the bathroom and basically ended up making out. He walked me home, tucked me into bed, and stayed because I asked him to. So we slept in the same bed, no big deal. Then the next morning, we had sex. Sober. Yeah. Mutually agreed upon. \n\nThat next night, I went with J to a friend’s party, and we were hanging out and he asked me how the previous night’s party with C had been. I told him it was okay at first, and then later in the night I told him what had happened. Needless to say, he was furious, told me this was over, and that he didn’t want to speak to me again and stormed out. He proceeded to block me on all social media. \n\nI talked with C two days after all of this happened, admitting everything that I had told J and all of that, and C comforted me and held me and gave me good advice. Then he kissed me, as in he initiated it and wanted it. I told him we needed to talk about all that had happened but we haven’t yet. \n\nAnd then tonight I saw J at another party and cornered him and told him that I was sorry, that I did have feelings for him and that we needed to talk about things, which he drunkenly agreed to. \n\nSo basically, AITA for telling J the truth about the fact that I slept with C? J and I were not dating, and it was never specifically stated as exclusive, but I asked him to tell me if he slept with someone else (he never did). And AITA for wanting to get back with my ex a little bit? AITA for cornering J at a party?\n\nPlease help. I feel like an ass and I just found this sub so help, and ask any questions for clarification \n\n",

I'm in the advanced class for English (I got in from test scores, sorry if this post is not written correctly) and we started book clubs. My teacher assigned me to a group with my crush who is also been my friend since 7th grade, and I started liking her in 11th (saying this so I don't seem like I'm saying I'm a Incel in the \"Friend zone\") but even if I do like her she can be a ass a times. Usually demeaning others if she's better at a skill or not apologizing if she makes someone angry. To get to the point a read 150 pages ahead of her. Let's call her G, after I came to English the next day and she saw she was on page 130 and I was on 280. She freaked demanding that I just play on my phone for a week until she catches up, I told her this is unreasonable but she wouldn't hear it. She signed rolled her eyes, and continued reading, I stopped to make her happy. I tried ignoring her for the rest of the day and I couldn't handle it very well, we Talk a lot and her trying to start a conversation, along with when I got home for the whole day her spamming me \"IncognitoClient please respond\" and \"I'm sorry if I made you mad :( please text back I want to talk I'm bored\". I later texted back saying I forgive her for everything and we talked until I was tired and fell asleep. My friends later took my phone from me and looked through my texts, nothing unusual they were just dicking around I do the same thing to them. When they opened my Texts with G the told me I'm a pussy, that I can't hold my ground all because I want \"Coochie\". Am I the asshole for just not holding my ground, and letting G win again. She did technically apologize but when I say sorry she always expects a essay describing what I did wrong. My friends said I should only accept the same back.",

      "description": "First ever post on Reddit in my 2+ years of lurking so forgive me if my formatting or anything else is not correct. \n\nFor context im a 24 year old guy and my girlfriend is the same age. \n\nSo last Saturday I went out with a couple of friends whilst my girlfriend stayed at home, one friend was there that I haven't seen in a while but have been friends with for over 8 years. The friend is a girl.\n\nThe night goes on and she eventually tells me she has a spare ticket to a concert on the following Thursday and she's upset because the person she was supposed to be going with won't be going with her anymore. It's for a band that I used to enjoy when I was younger so I checked my schedule and I was free that evening and said I would go with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Obviously she's very happy as she thought she was going to be going alone and I'm happy because I get to see an old band that I used to like and get to spend the night with an old friend.\n\nMy girlfriend on the other hand is not happy. At all. She is saying that I'm not allowed to go with her because \"just you and her going to a concert is basically a date.\" For the sake of honesty and to get an unbiased opinion it is worth noting that when me and this friend were 16/17 we shared a drunk kiss - which my girlfriend knows about. But in the 7 years after nothing of a romantic nature has happened between us.  I can't understand my girlfriends reasoning because in my head I know how platonic our friendship is and it is the furthest thing from a date that I can imagine, it's just two friends enjoying a concert together. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years, living together for just over 1. We've been arguing about it for the past few days, the concert is tomorrow and we can't come to any kind of agreement, she flat out refuses to listen to my reasoning and is telling me I can't go. \n\nSo, AITA in this situation? what do you guys think??",

      "description": "I'm 21f, he's 20m. One of my good friends from school bought me a nice handbag and wallet for my birthday, probably cost around like $350, this was last month. I was really happy he got me something and it was so sweet of him. About a week later he basically confessed his love for me and I had to turn him down because I didn't like him like that and I had starting seeing a guy in November (who's now my bf). He didn't know about this because I didn't tell him, and he was really devastated. He cried a lot, acted like a child kinda and was extremely sad. But never really insulted me or pushed me in anyway he just kept saying he loved me which annoyed me a lot. The second time we met up to speak about things between us again he bought me a really nice Tiffany bracelet and said he cares about me so much etc and wanted me to have this. I took it, he also wrote me a letter telling me how much he cares about and loves me and stuff like that. I know I shouldn't have took this but it was such a nice bracelet and I've wanted one for so long. And honestly it was nice getting something from someone, even though it was from a guy trying to buy my love I guess? He asked to speak again after class and was still sad but not crying anymore and he gave me a few pandora rings and earrings which were nice. He said he bought all this stuff for me before and didn't want to return it and just wanted to give it to me so I know how much he cares about me. It was just such a sad situation from the start and I didn't want him to be sad anymore so I just took them. I feel really bad about taking like 1k worth of gifts from a guy that I friend zoned and I've known for like 2 years but they were good gifts and I think not taking them would have made him even more sad. I told him we can never be together and we can only ever be friends and he almost started crying again but said ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have not told my new bf about this at all as I feel like I can handle it on my own and did effectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So the other night before bed my bf and I were scrolling through the TV channels. He stops on a fox news talk show, where they are talking about toxic masculinity. Of course the commentators are saying there is no such thing as toxic masculinity and saying it's ridiculous. \n\nFor context, I am moderate-liberal, and my boyfriend is all over the place but claims to be libertarian. Whenever we have political discussions we disagree, so I tend to avoid them. I can accept his views as long as he doesn't wander into Trump-supporter territory. We still have pretty similar priorities and are generally very happy with each other. \n\nWell after watching this segment, I keep my mouth shut because I'm trying to go to bed and not get into it with each other. But he starts this long tirade/rant about how toxic femininity is the real problem, since all girls nowadays are whores who seek attention with duck faces on instagram. He then goes into how Mackenzie Bezos is a whore for taking Jeff's money, and how the world is shit now that its the \"century of women\". I obviously disagree with all of this, and I feel he took it way too far. I hadn't even said anything up to this point, other than to comment that the fox news people weren't letting the psychologist talk. So I leave the room, and lock myself in the bedroom to get ready for bed in peace. It wasn't late yet, and I just wanted to shower without being bothered. \n\nHe then freaks out that I did this and calls me immature. I admit I could have handled it better but it's really frustrating to deal with his misogyny. He says demeaning things about women all the time, and it's hard not to take it personally. At this point I just get in bed and his verbal attacks continue. This is where I kind of lost it. \n\nI defended myself and told him that he was very immature to act like that in the first place and make such offensive comments when we have talked about this before. I start fact checking his arguments til basically he has nothing to say. Then, I started to attack his character. I called him misogynistic, and said I don't think our values line up. I questioned his morals, how he treats his parents, him stealing/lying, etc. It was off-topic but it all came out at once since I was frustrated. Most of these concerns I had brought up with him before but they still bothered me because of his continued behavior. \n\nThe next day he's very upset with me, and insists that I apologize. I do, because I know that I overreacted and shouldn't have gone that far. But then he starts saying he can't believe I consider him misogynistic, that he only says those things because I say \"men are trash\". First of all, I only say that as kind of a knee-jerk response when I hear about rape/sexual assault stories. In contrast, he'll call a woman a whore for posting a selfie on social media. Second of all, I've seen the misogynistic tendencies in him since we met. Third, I wish he had just said that me saying men are trash bothered him so much instead of ramping up the misogyny, I feel like that would be the mature thing to do. We somewhat made up, but he's still mad about what I said, and keeps threatening to keep me out of the apartment we both pay for. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for going off on him? Or was I justified in defending myself? \n\ntldr: Boyfriend makes misogynistic comments. I go off on him for the comments and for his character. Did I really take it too far? ",

      "description": "Backstory: about 3 years ago my wife (fiancee at the time) was acting very weird about her phone. She would hide the screen when it would light up, turn it upside down when around me and act very defensive over it. After confronting her about it, she had been snapchatting and texting a co-worker of hers (male) that she had developed feelings for. He had also told her he had developed feelings for her and she had been keeping it from me. We worked through it, she cut off contact with co-worker and we moved on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to tonight, we are in the bedroom talking and her phone is lying right next to me on the bed. Her phone lit up and I guess I glanced down and saw it had multiple text messages. In my mind I thought I would see who they were from and let her know she had messages from those people. I didn't touch it or pick it up, but I bent over the phone to see who was texting her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second she saw me looking at her phone she snapped at me \"Are you looking at my phone? Why are you being so nosey? You need to mind your own business\" and grabbed the phone. I headed downstairs and she came down soon following and sat down to watch a movie. She could sense something was wrong so she asked and I asked her why she was being so defensive over her phone (she usually isn't like that). She got very agitated and said I was being nosey and whats on her phone is none of my business. This is where I may have overstepped - I mentioned that her being defensive over her phone just reminds me of the past and makes me feel uncomfortable. I said that her reaction didn't make sense to me and I didn't appreciate the way she reacted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got very upset and said that we had worked through this problem \"Years ago\" and that it's not fair for me to bring it up. She also said that she is upset now that I would bring something up and that she felt like I was accusing her of cheating (which I was not - in my mind I was expressing why I didn't like her reaction). She offered me her phone to look through (which I declined because I don't need to look through her phone?) and told me the messages were from her mother. AITA for bringing up a (very similar) situation from 3 years ago and applying it to this situation? How could I have reacted better? ",

We usually host a BBQ every few months, I cook a ton of food, we provide drinks etc. Friend is usually invited but gets really pissy if the dates don't suit him and has previously demanded we change/or host a party every week. \n\nFriend never hosts and I suspect the reason why is because he doesn't want to buy food or clean up after. \n\nAnyway the reasons I don't want the stag party at our house are:\n\n1: I don't want to clean up after. SO is useless at cleaning so getting him to do it won't work.\n\n2: I'm working over 70hrs this week including Saturday. I want to come to my home and sleep, not have to find somewhere else to go because of a party I'm not invited to. Also why I don't want to clean.\n\nI know it's SO's house too, so AITA for wanting him to stick to the original plan of going out for the party?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Alright, I got another one that'll make me seem like a gold digging poo but hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend of 4 years and I moved in together 9 months ago. Initially, we went grocery shopping together but for my own selfish (personal) reasons (that she understands but it still bothers me that I do this), I started only taking her to the stores, waiting for her in the car. She's been paying for all our groceries constantly, save for anything a little outside our price range, then I'm more than happy to contribute.\n\nThis hit me pretty hard our last grocery trip, and I sent her $100 to help cover as she continues to vaguely bring up the fact she shops alone, and before that last trip, she mentioned how she has to pay for all the groceries. I do my best to ask as much as possible if she needs help financially with anything, and I'm more than willing to contribute as much as I can. I have a few more bills than her so I'm not always rolling in money, but I won't hesitate to give her what I can. Often she'll refuse and tell me not to worry about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offer to shop for us whenever I'm out, and if she says yes she offers to send me money, which I decline ***obviously,*** but when I *do* shop alone, it has to be very late at night, or sometimes in the middle of the night because I can't handle the crowds. I always end up getting the wrong thing or forgetting something no matter how detailed a list she gives me, which is why I prefer *her* to do the shopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She keeps on missing school with reasons like: 'i'm sick' 'I have a terrible headache', stuff like that.   \nShe hasn't been going to school for one day the entire month of november.  \n\n\nYesterday, I got in an argument with her, saying she had to go to school or drop out and find a job.   \nI also said: I probably can't live with someone that does nothing and just lays in bed all day.  \nShe got mad, said she has a depression, which I respect, but it's never been diagnosed because she doesn't look for help or accept help.   \n\n\nSince then, nothing. she's ignoring me.  \n\n\nSo, Reddit.

She says that her friends were laughing because one of them had a sex dream about a foursome with us and also what underwear her friend's boyfriend likes her to wear. The conversation tanks when she says that she wouldn't discuss our sex life, to which I responded \"What sex life?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO: Do you think it's because we don't know what each other is in to?\n\nME: I'm not really into anything in particular, I like what we do.\n\nSO: But I don't think you're into it.\n\nME: I am, what do you say that?\n\nSO: You never make any noise?\n\nME: I'm still enjoying it, I'm naturally not noisy. It's normal.\n\nSO: It's not normal.\n\nME: It's normal whether a guy makes noise or not, I'm not going to fake it.\n\nSO: It just feels one sided.\n\nME: What do you mean, your side or my side?\n\nSO: Your side, like you're just interested in yourself.\n\nME: I always make sure you come first, then I finish myself off. How is that one sided?\n\nSO: That's what I mean, it's like your not really into it.\n\nME: I am, I enjoy doing what you like first, I just can't finish that way. I've always found it difficult to come, I can't change that.\n\nSO: It just feels like you are not interested in having sex.\n\nME: What do you mean? The other day I joked around and said that we should buy some toys, try something new. Besides, it works both ways, you don't particularly act interested either.\n\nSO: I just can't articulate it.\n\nME: I'm always horny nowadays, how is it not clear when I'll have a boner and try kissing you?\n\nSO: Just because your horny now doesn't change all those years where you wouldn't have sex with me...... I know you were mentally ill, but....\n\nME: How is that relevant? I can't go back and change that. If you want to improve things it's best to be positive rather focus on the past.\n\nSO: I can't just be \"positive\" after all those years getting used to you not wanting to have sex!\n\nME: What the hell are you talking about, you're being incoherent. Your saying that you resent me for denying you sex for years, when we had plenty of good sex just until a couple of months ago!\n\nSO: I had to switch off my sex drive for you, and you just want me to switch it back on now on your terms.\n\nME: How is blaming me at all conducive to improving the situation? It's basic psychology, you don't double down on someone if you want to improve your relationship. Your acting like a fucking child. I'm going to bed, please turn off the light.\n\nSO: Silence...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's been telling me how happy she is recently, so a dry spell in the bedroom wasn't worrying me, although I had put out a tentative 'let's try something new' just the other day. Low and behold, drunken sex talk and now she resents me for not giving her enough sex in years gone by, a resentment apparently absent when we went boning around Europe last year.\n\nI know I fucked up with the 'What sex life' comment.

I met him in preschool, when I we were 5, and we are now 23. We went through primary school, high school, and partially university together. He's not my best friend, but he's one of my close friends. A few weeks ago he started acting strange. At first, we asked what was wrong and he said he just felt \"off\". We weren't really bothered, just concerned for him. We began to hang out with him more just to see if he was okay, but apart from being quiet most of the time, he joined all of our activities. Then, yesterday, we were at his house and he sat us down and told us he was gay. We were surprised, but as it didn't directly affect us, we didn't say much. However, we did congratulate him for doing something that can be really hard. After we all finished, he left to go upstairs. Me and my other friend followed around 5 minutes later. He was crying, and we knocked. He opened the door and let us in, and he had knocked over most of the furniture in the room. This was our first warning flag, so we asked what was wrong. He just lost it, he started wailing, not making any words, and just screaming. I got my friend to tell the others not come up and I slowly calmed him down over about half an hour. Once he was calm, he told me he was angry that we didn't ask more. That's all he said. I asked him what he meant and he stood up and shoved me, saying that I should know what he means.\nThis is what he said (from what I can remember)\n\"What the fuck is wrong with all of you? I just told you something that I've been hiding for a while and you just leave it by saying you're happy for me? Don't you, as my friend want to know more? And even prior to today, you never asked if I was gay, I mean you didn't get the vibe? That just shows that you don't ever pay any attention to me.\" I was shocked and at a loss for words. I ran out of the room and a wave of guilt washed over me. He came downstairs and started telling us what he hates about us until we left. I told my girlfriend what happened and she said we had no reason to ask more, because we accepted him, and I agreed. However, one of my other friends told me that we could of enquired more about it because it was a \"traumatic\" experience for him. \nI cannot stop thinking about it, I have taken a day off work today, and im just really conflicted as to whether we should of taken more action.\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "First day of college I meet a girl and we talk. She tells me earlier that week she met a guy on tinder and that she loves him. Ok sure, we have a nice conversation and I leave it at that.\n\nSee her again a few weeks later, we talk and shoot the breeze for a minute or two then I have to get to class. Cool.\n\nNow I have a rule. If I meet or see a girl I’m interested in on 3 separate occasions then I have to ask for her number, and or, at the very least approach her. So I‘m in the student lounge and I see her sitting down. I approach and ask her how she’s doing, but today she’s not doing well. I ask her “why what’s wrong.” Long story short we ended talking from 2pm until 10pm. We walked around town while she vented, we went to the mall and got food (I paid, which to me either means I’m really nice or probably into you) then we went to a train museum. I wouldn’t call it a date but I would like to.\n\nFrom this moment on she and I hang out just about everyday for a month. I’m very attracted to her. We lay in bed and watch movies, we hug when we meet and leave. My hand is always pretty low. I help her with her homework, study, and during a serious emergency (she got evicted) I both helped her move her stuff and find a place to stay. While also counseling her. Never complained because hey, shit happens.\n\nHeres where the trouble comes in. I really want a physical relationship with this girl. But she consistently says things like “I’ve never felt this comfortable with a **friend**” or “You’re going to be a really great boyfriend to a girl someday.” I can take a hint.\n\nMeanwhile the entire ~two months or so I’ve known her, the tinder “BF” has never once appeared. Never replies to her text. Ignores all her calls and (after the first week) said they shouldn’t date because his mom was sick or something. She claims he’s just really busy with work and his mom but that they really love each other. Cool.\n\nSo, she invites me over for dinner because she wants to repay me for being a good friend and helping her move. Sure. Side note she can’t cook and I ended up making the food but w/e. I notice there’s a hickey on her neck and ask about it. She tells me that she texted tinder boy “Want to have sex?” He finally replies and shows up later that same day. Weird. Thought he was really busy with work. And a sick mom.\n\nAfter hearing this I make up some sort of excuse for why I have to leave and go to the door. As I’m walking out she tells me to text her when I get to the dorms as I normally do. I take out my phone and delete her number. I still see her in school and she’ll approach me but I always keep the conversations short.\n\nAITA? Obviously you’re not owed sex for being nice, but at the same time if I’m not getting what I want from the relationship why keep it up?\n\n*Tl;dr* Was really nice to a girl I wanted to have sex with. She had sex with a guy she knew for a week who also ignored her the entire time we were friends, so I deleted her number.",

She gets to do whatever she wants, i get that she is the adult. This is the first time she has lashed out like this. At this point I'm not bugged about the fact that she is gone a long time. I've gotten used to it and i'm older.\n\nSo my mom gets home from helping a friend lay some wallpaper and chatting. She comes home angry that she came home at 10 PM and says \"I can't believe I stayed there until 10. I wish someone could have texted me saying that i needed to come home.\" She is contradicting herself here. She gets furious when we say that we want her to come home after a while, stating that \"She is the adult.\" Which is true. I point out that she contradicted herself and she claimed that she never does that. She is nearly 40 years old. She then says that she sometimes feels like she isn't wanted, I guess. Again, this is the first time she has done this specifically. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously we want her around! We make that clear when she is around anyway any normal person would. You're my mom for Christ sake and my best friend. I then say that she is just blaming her frustration (That she's late coming home) on us. She claims she isn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much all there is to it, but if needed i'll edit and add more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for revealing my feelings to a coworker even though he has a gf?",
      "description": "I’ve been working at the same job for years, and over the time I’ve been here I’ve become really close friends with a coworker that sits at a desk near mine. Our boss is intolerable and the company isn’t the best, but having him here makes it worth it to keep going. I recently broke off a long engagement to another coworker of ours that works in another part of the building, mostly because it wasn’t making me happy but also because I started to realize my feelings for my other coworker.\nA few months ago, he told me that he had feelings for me but I was still engaged. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and didn’t have the confidence to end the engagement. However, we kissed later that night and I knew that I had romantic feelings for him too. I still told him I couldn’t end my engagement, and he soon transferred to another branch in the company. \nThe past few months have been terrible. It’s like the color in the world has turned to grey without him here. Occasionally I’d have brief contact with him through a work-related phone call to our branch, and it gives me hope that he might come back. And then, it happened. My boss announced that he was transferring back to our branch along with some other employees of the same branch because theirs was shut down due to company funding. \nI was ecstatic to have him back, except for the fact that he started dating a coworker from the other branch while he was there. She transferred here with him, and it’s so difficult to see them together knowing that I missed my chance months ago. There’s nothing wrong with her at all, she’s a really nice girl and I don’t have anything against her, but I can’t help but resent her a little bit for dating the guy I’m in love with.\nYesterday, our boss took us out to a local beach for “teamwork exercises” which was silly, but a nice break from being at the building all day. In the evening, our boss started a bonfire and had more activities, like a coal-walk.\nLater that night, I built up the confidence after doing the coal-walk. It gave me a sort of high, a confidence where I felt unstoppable and I couldn’t hold my feelings and thoughts anymore. I went to the bonfire where everyone was sitting, and I told them that I needed to say some things....most notably, that I ended by engagement because of my feelings for my coworker and how I missed him when he was gone and how I wished things could be the way they were before he left. He sat there, shocked, next to his girlfriend. I feel really bad for saying that especially in front of her, but after being quiet for years about my feelings I couldn’t hold them in anymore. Am I the asshole for basically admitting my feelings for my coworker in front of him and his girlfriend?\n\nTLDR; Had feelings for a coworker while I was engaged, then he left and I ended my engagement, and when he came back I announced my feelings for him in front of all of our coworkers including his new girlfriend. AITA?",

      "description": " A few months ago I met one of my boyfriends friends at the gym we frequent (boyfriend, friend and I all go to the same gym). It was night (24h gym), so nobody else was around. We were training normally, but started talking a bit during the breaks. At some point we started talking about martial arts. He had been doing boxing for about five months and recently started mma, my bf used to do some karate a few years ago, but they do some casual training together at the gym now). The friend started constantly bragging about how strong he was and how he always wins against my bf. He also asked me to feel up his muscles... (I didn't). \n\nNow, I guess I am a bit protective of my bf and I felt like he was constantly trying to impress me, which I found suspicious, so I asked him to show me how good he was and we went into the ring.  What he didn't know is that I've been doing MMA for the past 9 years... He tried to go easy on me first, but obviously that didn't work out well. After his arrogant behaviour, I really started to enjoy hitting him and because he didn't give up or go down, we went on for a while. Let's just say he didn't look too nice after. I was a bit afraid to tell my bf that I had beat up his friend, but he didn't mind (looked more amused/happy tbh). Not sure if I should tell him about the bragging/feeling thing though.

      "description": "Apologies for length and teenage drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in high school, I became close friends with a girl (I am female as well), we’ll call her Jane. She was an eighth grader/freshman and I was a junior/senior. We met through being in the same instrument section in our high school band (which eighth graders were part of), so we saw each other in that class every day.  While we were in school together, our friendship was great. Eventually Jane confided in me about her relationship with a boy we’ll call Richard. He was in the grade below mine and on the surface things seemed great between them. However, she confessed that he was actually a huge jerk and she wasn’t happy, and that she didn’t know if her feelings of discomfort were warranted. Naturally, as her friend, I was very concerned and tried to advise her to the best of my ability. I told her to dump him and that her feelings of discomfort were not an overreaction because, from what she told me, things between them seemed very toxic. Jane also had a lot of other issues as well (stemming from past events and depression), and as a result wasn’t the most apt at recognizing when a situation wasn’t ideal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Jane broke up with Richard, and seemed somewhat happier as a result. Jane began coming to me more for advice/comfort. However, not long after she broke up with him, Jane told me that she’d gotten back together with Richard. I didn’t think that was a good idea, but I wasn’t her mother; it was her life. Eventually, they broke up again. Jane did not go full no-contact with Richard. They kept talking, even when broken up. Rinse, repeat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI graduated high school and moved 3 hours away from my hometown for college. Combine the distance with the workload and it wasn’t exactly feasible for me to go home every weekend or spare much energy on faraway events outside of school. Jane and I messaged each other often over Snapchat. I worried a lot about Jane. She and Richard were very bad for each other. He had even leaked her nudes at one point (which I found out from a friend, not her). Eventually I got fed up, and, while I didn’t want to \\*not\\* be friends with Jane, I was also at my wits’ end because my sympathy was running out. I’d told her time and again that Richard was bad news and yet she always ended up going back to him. I didn’t want to deal with that drama anymore. When a mutual friend of ours told me that they had gotten back together (she had stopped complaining so much about Richard to me) I decided to be less communicative; I didn’t message her quite as often anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I'm wondering if I was too concerned about her, too into her business. I wasn't her mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week or two later, a different mutual friend (let’s call him Ben) messaged me. He was very upset. Apparently Jane blamed him for how distant I was being. (A pertinent piece of information: Ben was my ex-boyfriend, and still in high school.) So I messaged Jane, intending to sort things out once and for all. I laid out why I wasn't messaging her quite so frequently anymore: I felt rather used, fed up, and a little hurt because Jane kept coming to me for advice and I was doing everything I could for her, but she was consistently blowing it off. Thus, I didn’t want to deal so much with her anymore. I stated this in a civil manner; I did not make any negative insinuations about her character. Jane, however, thought that I was angry and jealous because apparently Ben had feelings for her, and I had somehow found out about it, despite having not talked to Ben for over a month prior. She refused to believe me and said some very mean things, deliberately meant to wound. This completely threw me for a loop. She had never before struck me as the kind of person to say such unkind things until that moment. My perception of her changed rather drastically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened on Christmas Eve. I was twisted up in knots. On New Years’, she apologized. I accepted. I was eager to be friends again because I missed her, and thus did not address the mean things she said. However, after what she said, things weren’t really the same between us. Time passed. I found myself drifting away from her again, and then she blocked me on all social media. I felt guilty, so I apologized to her for being distant. I was trying to save a friendship that had died months prior, on Christmas Eve. Eventually we saw each other again at a band concert I came to, and she messaged me apologizing, and at that point I was just tired. I told her that I just didn’t want to be friends anymore. The matter was finally put to rest. This was eight months ago, in March.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I have a nagging guilt over the whole situation. This girl had no other confidantes besides me. She couldn’t talk to her mother, her father had passed away, she was pretty depressed and had a number of traumatic things happen to her in the past. She didn’t have many people that she considered close friends. She poured her heart out to me, and I abandoned her. What kind of a friend does that? So, Reddit, what do you think? Am I the asshole?",

Anyway she found out and got super pissed, she blocked me everywhere and her friends/ my friends (we share a few friends) started to hate on me and they also stopped talking to me. Then a headline popped up that 5 kids and a few adults died on a trip to Disneyland, since I was close to there atm I felt really bad and made a post about how I sad it was. (Sincerely felt bad for those poor kids). She then commented on my post saying “those were my friends” and when I questioned her asking “really? Are you ok? How do you know them?” She responded with “I just knew them really well, stop questioning me asshole” she then proceeded to flag my post and eventually took it down. She told all my friends I was a monster and didn’t believe her, (which I did at the time). Finally I learned she didn’t know then at all, her friend (gonna call her friend jake) jake told me she never knew any of them. So now I reached the conclusion that she made it all up, and it was extremely perfect timing too.\nTL;DR friend/ ex got mad, I was making a diss, she found out. Said her “friends” died and blamed me for being a monster and evil.",

      "description": "Some backstory:\n              My brother came to live with me when he was 16 because he dropped out and left home. While with me he got his GED and babysat for me while me and my husband worked in exchange for room and board. This lasted until he started seeing this woman that he worked with and she introduced him an IV substance. Brother started stealing from me and when I began finding his paraphernalia laying around I told him its her and the drugs, or your family and a place to live. I even offered to drive him to and from NA or rehab or whatever he wanted to do. He left the next day, with our rent money. Started sneaking into our shed and stealing things at night. I have even found him camping on our property. I told him to go away and not come back until he was clean since he wouldn't get help. Fast forward a year or so, I take him and this woman in because they are going to meetings and seem to be on the right track. Until one day I get text from brother about his girlfriends teddy bear. How she left it behind and not to let anything happen to it because it was a gift yadda yadda... Well teddy had a busted seam in the back and their paraphernalia was stuffed inside. I ditched teddy in a dumpster and reamed him for putting me at risk by having it in my vehicle while I was driving. They stay another 2 weeks until they can find a place but the night after they left (I work nights) they busted into my house and cleaned me out. Ps4, xbox1, a laptop, the list goes on. He even stole the battery from my emergency vehicle. I don't have proof but I know it was him. Whenever we would hang out cell phones would go missing etc. It sucked. So I cut him out completely. Fast forward to now. He moved out of town with family after being incarcerated for 6 months, is working a job, seems clean, girlfriend is in rehab. He seems to be getting it together and has been reaching out (for favors). I haven't responded and I don't want to. I'm not ready. I haven't forgiven him yet and he hasn't even apologised. WIBTA for telling him to stop contacting me? Telling him that I'm not healed from what he did yet even though he seems to making a decent recovery?",

      "description": "Okay there are multiple aspects I need to unpack here. Firstly, I got the tickets three months ago for my birthday and I’m pretty sure they were resale (extra pricey). I obviously thanked my parents and made plans with a friend to go together. Cut to a day before the concert and I remind said friend about our plans but she tells me she’s busy and to find someone else. The fact she blew me off so easily hurt so bad. I know this will sound like an overreaction but keep in mind my mental health is currently in the toilet (anxiety disorder + anorexic + incorrect meds). I just sat there and cried. I felt so numb I couldn’t eat. My parents found out and they could tell I was in a lot of pain but they tried to stay upbeat about it. I felt like such a failure, am I so shitty that a friend would just forget about our plans and not give a shit? Also the plans she said she had got cancelled the morning of the concert and she STILL said nothing about going with me instead. Anyways, I felt like utter garbage and tried sleeping it off but of course I awoke to feeling like I was about to vomit. Somehow I kept the bile down and went to school. I didn’t eat the whole day and by the time I had to go to the concert I just could not do it. My mom was going to take me but the thought of me not having enough friends to ask made me feel borderline depressive. I couldn’t do it so I told my mom and dad I couldn’t handle it. My mom was fine but my dad… well he screamed at me, called me ungrateful, all of the good stuff. He was yelling about how expensive the tickets were so I explicitly said I would pay them back but he just laughed and was like “that’s not what this is about”.  He also yelled at me about again tonight. So that’s what brings me to this subreddit. Again, I understand my parents frustration but if I give them the money back is there really still an issue? Am I being ungrateful and weak? How do I fix this?",

Both of us got numbers, etc. I also went to another girls birthday with one of our other roommates a couple weeks ago and it was a great time. So I've been semi-joking for three weeks now about how women's birthdays are literally the best possible event a guy in his late twenties. \n\nAnyway, so last night, he told me he was going to this woman's birthday party, but that he didn't want me to come. The birthday was for a woman that he was kind of interested in, and that's kind of why. For additional context, he's not exclusively interested in her, and is in an open relationship with another girl, and has been going on lots of dates recently. Jeff is a good looking guy, but he's not been taking super good care of himself and was looking a little ragged, and this week I got a nice haircut and shave, and I'm also decent looking. I'm fairly certain he didn't explicitly told me he didn't want to come simply because he didn't want any competition.\n\nAnyway he got back home later, told me it was awesome, and that he should have invited me because he ended up being the weird kind of alone guy at the party and so he left early. \n\nBut anyway, I'm fuckin' pissed at him. I haven't really spoken to him much since. I've been trying to go out and do shit with him for weeks now. I buy him drinks a lot when we're out (because he's fucking broke). But yeah, 17 years of friendship. He's always been a shitty wingman, but holy shit, after 3 weeks of me saying we should go to more women's birthdays and he doesn't invite me to one because he thinks I'm gonna try to steal \"his girl\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Before I even begin to explain the situation, I am an Indian and Indian parents are a bit involved in their kids lives. Also, coming from India, there is this \"notion\" of traditions. Something I am vehemently against when certain traditions are biased and rooted in archaic principles.\n\nComing to the story, me and my wife are visiting India after a year and a half. Last time we were in India was for our wedding, so it's a bit of a big deal heading back the first time. Me and my wife decided to spend majority of the 26 days of our vacation at our respective parent's place. We decided that I would stay for 5 days at her parent's place and she would spend 4 days at time. The unequal days because she spent more time at my parent's place after our wedding\n\nWhen I proposed this plan to my mother she didn't take it well at all. We switched the plan to make it equal days and my mom was still not fine with it. \n\nMy mom is pretty progressive and this just took me by surprise. She strongly believes that in India culture a girl should spend more time with her in laws and understand their culture. This did not go well with me and things got heated up between us. I ended up saying somethings (that I regret now) but my mom interpreted them in a completely different manner. Certain things in the argument made her think I am comparing her with my wife and that I feel my wife is a lot better person than her.\n\nThings are pretty bad at the moment and even after I have apologized to my mom, she doesn't accept the apology. She made notes on whatever I said and messaged her and she keeps reading them and wonders how I could say those things. For the past two days I have been on calls with her where she just kept shouting at me and I stayed quiet to let her vent out everything. Even after those calls, I apologized to her for what I said in the past, but doesn't look like she is done yet.\n\nI have intentionally not involved my wife in the argument and not told her the things my mom said. My mom has the habit of digging up things from the past and she commented a lot on my wife's parents and how they didn't meet her expectations at our wedding in terms of how my parents and family were treated (which isn't accurate and a lot of her perception is based on certain miscommunications during an inter cultural wedding).\n\nI am at a loss of words now. Her behavior has started affecting me. I dread the evenings when I might need to talk to her again and keep shivering and feeling nauseous at work inside, while trying to act normal with my colleagues. ",

      "description": "Ok so first off before anyone accuses me of being an asshole just from the title, it's an electronic drumset, not an acoustic one. I won't get an acoustic drumset until I have my own house. The electronic drumset still makes noise and transfers vibrations through the floor, though.\n\nI live in a second floor apartment, and like to play the drums as a hobby. I never play during unreasonable hours, like after sunset or before noon. One time my downstairs neighbor came knocking on my door, complaining that it sounded really loud, like someone was just straight up banging on the floor. I told him I was sorry about the noise, but drumming is just a hobby that I like to do for fun. I decided after that confrontation that I was done for the day, anyway.\n\nA week later, more or less, I decide to blow off some steam and hit the drums again, trying to not be quite as loud. It just doesn't feel the same when I try to be super quiet so I gradually get louder while still being conscious of my loudness and not letting myself get too crazy. I get a call from the leasing office. Someone called to complain. I have a hunch it's the same guy from downstairs. I go for a little longer, trying to be quieter, but eventually get frustrated that it doesn't feel the same so I quit for the day.\n\nI feel like my neighbor(s?) are being unreasonable. Like I said, I laid my own ground rules, never playing before noon or after sunset. We don't live in houses. You have to deal with loud neighbors sometimes. It just comes with living in an apartment. I only play drums within what I consider to be reasonable hours and usually don't go over 30 to 45 minutes at a time. I pay rent to live here; I should be able to do what I want in my own apartment.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? Am I being entitled or reasonable?",

      "description": "I went away to college for three years. I am the youngest of my siblings and none of them went away to school. My school was only 3 hours away, a pretty far drive but doable (I think). My siblings only visited me probably three times in three years. They came only on Family Day every year because there was “things to do” in town (it’s a small town). \n\nMy brother’s girlfriend went to the same school as me. So he visited her quite often. Half the time he wouldn’t come to see me even though he was a five  minute drive from me/have time to see me. The other half the time he wouldn’t even tell me he was in town. I would only find out from my parents asking me if I’d seen him. I frequently got rides with my brothers girlfriend home, and paid her to do so. She didn’t tell me when she was going  home for his 21st and when I asked to ride down with her she told me she was already home. Making me miss my brothers 21st birthday. My fault should have asked he Wednesday, not Thursday for a ride home Friday. \n\nI told my mom once I wanted my siblings to come up and she told me that it was unfair of me to ask them to put all those miles on their cars and take off work. \n\nDuring third year at school, I lost four friends and none of my siblings came to see me. They called me once (or twice) and that’s was pretty much it. Which really hurt since they knew I was struggling with it and had a lot to deal with. \n\nAfter another death, I moved back home to heal. However, by this time my brother had moved out state about 7 hours away. My sisters and parents have been giving me a lot of shit for not going to see him yet, since he has bought a house now. \n\nI don’t feel like I should have to go visit, but my family thinks it’s important and that I’m hurting his feelings by not going. I have a low paying job, student loans to be paying off and a dog. I can’t afford to take off work very often and when I do, it’s for the trillion other family events. I don’t feel obligated to go, especially if he didn’t feel obligated to see me. I just am tired of being made out to be the asshole, when I feel like it’s not me. Am I crazy? ",

There's no contract or legal obligations.\n\nWe work in accounting and due dates are CRUCIAL, specially the 17th (in 2 days) because tax reports need to be given in my country. Now, casually this week I'm on University finals and I can't stop working on my things because my due dates are all today (dec 15). I also have a panic condition and have been recently medicated.\n\nA month ago I asked my mom and she said it was fine for me to take my time while I need to do so. I said ok and that I would help as soon as I was done with it. Fair deal, right?\n\nHowever, it wasn't. These last 3 days that I've been taking my medication she's been yelling at me saying I'm lazy and that this are the dates she needs me the most, which I understand, but I also have pending work from school. I asked her for time and patience but she's literally not talking to me and acting like if I let her down entirely when I'm simply a. trying to get better and b. trying to finish with school papers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I'm tired of that yelling and screaming at me.

I, irritated by the disrespect, take it back out of her hands and as a result she cries. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Typing on mobile so apologies in advance. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, I moved from BE to the UK to come live with my boyfriend (now fiance) that I met online. He and I had long discussions about who would make the move, and as he doesn't speak my maternal language and wants to stay close to his small family, we decided that I would move. I speak English on a near-native level anyway and I have a degree and experience in an international field so making the move wasn't hard. I applied for and found a job overseas, planned my move, packed my stuff, and left.\n\nHowever, my parents and brothers were and are dear to me.  Realising that, my fiance said we'd visit frequently. Our first visit about 5 months after my move was... a disaster. I had lost my job, it was winter so the weather was bad, ...  In the end, due to a number of reasons, we didn't visit for over a year.\n\nThis year, we'd planned to go back for a visit in spring. But due to me and my fiance taking up a new hobby, and both of us agreeing we want to get married this year, my finances are nowhere near sound enough to both fund a visit and a wedding, even a small quiet affair like we'd have. Trouble is, my parents and brothers miss me and talk a lot about how much they miss me and how much they're looking forward to our next visit, and I miss them something fierce as well, but I'd choose getting married to a wonderful man over going over for a 4-day visit. Does that make me an asshole?",

We didn't live together, but spent a lot of time with each other. I dumped him a year ago, cause he was full of BS - he didn't want to work, and lacked ambition. All the time he was talking and annoying me with some business project he does, and told me he is actually unable to move forward without finishing it, since he planned to be rich. I got pretty sick of the bs.\n\nBreakup went well, he even told me he gets my feelings, and wanted to stay friends. I said sure, why not - we live in quite small town and will run to each other quite often. Soon after, I've found someone else to date (we broke up already).\nHalf year after breakup, I've his project was finished - he managed to buy some expensive stuff - house, few fancy cars, speedboat, jewelry, whatever.\n\nHe called me and told me that I helped him a lot before, and If I need something, I can call him.\n\nWe went for dinner, while I had no any interest to be together again - and I told him on the spot - he responded he neither.\nAfter that dinner, he and my female friend started to date - he buys her fancy clothes, takes her to vacations, pays for her manicures, sauna, pretty much everything he promised me for years - I think he does it on purpose to make me mad and jealous.\n\nI know that I broke up with him, but still I feel like it's not fair when she gets lifestyle which supposed to be mine.\nI was the one who stayed with him while no other woman would.\n\nI know it's his money, and I don't feel entitled to it, yet, AITA for being mad at him?",

      "description": "My friend started dating a guy who was very controlling and selfish and then found out she was pregnant by him. During her whole pregnancy, he forced her to hide it because he still hadn’t completed his divorce yet from his wife whom he had been separated from before they met. It wasn’t until about 8 months when she was allowed to openly discuss her pregnancy publicly. \n\nAfter the baby was born they disagreed on a lot and he controlled everything. She wanted to breastfeed and when the baby would cry at night, he would blame her saying if she formula fed the baby would sleep better. He would punish her for going against his ideas by not helping her when she tried her ideas. He refused to ever get up in the night with the baby at all even after she confessed she was developing PPD from sleep deprivation. \n\nRight before the baby turned one, he reached out to one of his exes via social media and cheated on my friend. She wanted to stay with him. I told her I believe people can move on after cheating and that she will have to truly trust him and forgive him but that it’s possible and completely supported her in her choice. \n\nHere’s where the story takes a dark turn and where my feelings changed. One night, they got into an argument. She locked herself in a room trying to escape the nasty things he was screaming at her but he just kept going. She came out swinging at him in anger. He picked her up, slammed her on the ground, and then proceeded to choke her. She told me she thought she was going to die and felt herself blacking out. \n\nHe could have broken her neck throwing her around. He could have actually choked her to death. He almost took my best friend from me. He almost left their child without a mother. After that night, I could not forgive him and could not try to support her staying with him. I know she hit him first but I still don’t believe he should have taken it that far. \n\nMy friend wanted me to show the same support I did after he cheated but I could not. He refused to delete the girl he cheated with from his social media. I felt like this was evidence enough that he wasn’t going to change and that he didn’t respect her. \n\nI basically told her that I could not be a good friend to her anymore because I couldn’t tell her what she wanted to hear and she admitted that’s all she wanted from me really was for me to make her feel confident in her choice to stay. \n\nAITA for leaving her after all this happened to her?

Some photos of a very high profile car (Mercedes AMG, one of two in the country) started circulating on Whatsapp yesterday because it had crashed. So I sent them to an auto group chat I'm in. It was relevant to me because I had gone to an event at the racetrack with this group of people about a month prior, and in that event the Mercedes, then new, caused a two-car crash with his very aggressive driving.\n\nThe chat goes like this:\n\nPurple: Please delete the pictures\n\nMe: Why?\n\nPurple: Well, would you like pictures of your car crash to circulate on whatsapp?\n\nMe: It’s a high profile car, I don’t see any harm in sharing the pictures\n\nPurple: You are answering yourself ((this to me is a non-answer as I don’t have a high profile car and I have shared my own pictures of my crash before))\n\nBlue: There were pictures of the McLaren crash on the front page when it happened\n\nFast forward a bit and the guy now demands that I give him a reason why I sent the pictures. I saw it fit to stand up for myself in my response so I said: “Because I wanted to? I don’t have to justify myself to you. Accidents happen and it’s not our responsibility to censor things”\n\nBlue: Your answer shows your lack of education\n\nMe: No sir, that is not a lack of education. You are starting a fight over nothing and demanding I explain myself to you. Freedom of speech is a constitutional right.\n\nThe argument goes on for about 5 more minutes where one of the group admins requests we make up so I offer to delete the pictures in good faith, and I do, as can be seen in the screenshots.\n\nAITA for standing up to this guy?",

My mom asked if I would ever get lip fillers and I said no because I thought it was a waste of money. My SO joked that he did because he has large luxurious lips(even though he doesn’t have fillers). We all laughed and were joking around so I thought it would be funny to ask what he would get if he did. He immediately stood up and said well now that you called me out I’m going to go do my homework. There was no joking humor and he looked hurt. I immediately just got frustrated because it was obviously a joke (at least I thought I said it with sarcasm). He seems genuinely upset which makes me upset because our family is constantly joking but it’s super harmless and we never mean it. I honestly can’t contain my anger because he does this all the time and he just joked about it right before.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset at this?",

My mom said that it wasn’t that long and that “We started at 10:30” I chimed in and corrected her saying that we actually started at 10. She flipped out at me because “I wasn’t supporting her” I told her that she was right and that I shouldn’t have said that because I knew that’s the only way it wouldn’t cause a fight. Then she just keeps attacking me about it. I replied a few times and also tried to stop the fight a few more times. Eventually I got tired of it and told her that it wasn’t a big deal and she gets offended about everything. This has proven itself to be true over the past few months. She recently didn’t like the way my dad replied to someone he was talking to. She tried to correct him and he “Ok” in a bit of an exasperated voice. She went crazy telling him how rude he was and that his tone was mean. She’s done this multiple times recently. So after I say that she get offended by everything and she says she doesn’t, she talks to my dad and eventually they get to a point where she is upset that he was on his phone checking emails during scripture study and she tells him “It really hurts my feelings when ur on ur phone” I thought this was funny cuz she just said she wasn’t offended by everything. She came back into my room multiple times after to tell me about what a bad person I am even thought I’ve been patient with her for the past couple months. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Earlier today my boyfriend asked me to drop off something he bought for a friend with said friend, and to pick up the money owed. My boyfriend was driving and I was the passenger so I quickly jumped out, dropped it off and came back to the car and we set off to a pub for lunch. I asked him where he wanted the money and he didn't answer so I put it down in the little coin part that most cars have in front of the gear stick. We went out for lunch and when we got back to the car he was really angry with me for leaving the money there claiming 'someone could have smashed my Windows to get that money'. It wasn't a particularly dodgy area, it was lunchtime so broad daylight and we were maybe 100yards down the road in a pub. He also consistently leaves his car unlocked overnight to which his argument was 'Yeah but there's never anything valuable in it' \n\nSo AITA for leaving money visible in his car for an hour?\n\ntldr: I left £20 in my boyfriends car in a visible area, he is mad because he thinks its attractive to theives (we live in an average area, not super dodgy)",

He has a coop build in my walk-in closet. I had to leave town for a week, and my mother was babysitting him. Which is basically feeding and water him, and making sure hes okay. \n\nWhile I was away She called me to tell me she had a miscarriage.\n\nThis was about two months ago.\n\nI have recently discovered that my bird may have had Chalmidya. Before you think anything weird, no, you do not have to have intercourse to get it from a bird. Its often carried in dust. I had fully cleaned his coop before I left, so dust may have been flying around when mom went in to feed him in the morning. I really don't know how to feel. I have so many emotions and thoughts right now, and I would really like some different perspectives on this matter.\n\nTL:DR My mother may have gotten exposed to a virus carried by my pet bird, and subsequently miscarraiged.",

      "description": "I have a part time job at a major clothing retailer. A customer started chatting with me, and we realized we live in the same area. Cool! Let’s call her Rachel. As Rachel and I  were talking, another customer—we’ll call her Sarah—entered the store in a hurried manner. I noticed her out of the corner of my eye, but before I could greet her, she walked right in between Rachel and me, even though we were clearly having a conversation. Rude. But whatever. We kept chatting. About 3 seconds later, Sarah interrupts us and says in a demanding voice “Where is the boys underwear??” \n\nI stopped talking. Looked her in the eye, and said: “They’re over there.” I gestured to the back of the store where we keep those items. I was surprised at her behavior, butting into a conversation to demand my attention. Lots of customers have questions, but they usually wait until I’m not with another customer to ask. \n\nA coworker walked up on the other side of me and asked what that was about? \n\n“This girl just totally interrupted me while I was talking to a customer,” I muttered. Coworker coughs, and I turn to see Sarah standing there. Crap. She probably heard me. \n\n“Oh, were you talking about me?” She said. \n\n“Yes,” I responded. No point in lying, and I hadn’t said anything terrible. \n\n“You were talking about me because I asked where the boys underwear was?” She clarified. \n\n“They’re over there.” I gestured to the boys underwear, really just wanting her to go away. \n\n“I spend a LOT of money here,” she said. \n\n“Good!” I responded. What else does one say to such a statement? \n\n“That’s really rude,” she said in a disapproving voice, and walked away to complain to my manager. \n\nSo what say you, Reddit? Was I an asshole for admitting that we were talking about her? \n",

      "description": "Names: Hayley = cheating friend, Gary = her partner at the time, Zack = the partner's son, and Katy = the other friend in this story.\n\n\nThis happened around 2-3 years ago. I had gotten back in contact with Hayley after a few years of us not seeing each other, and she started telling me about her new boyfriend Gary. Hayley was around 23 at the time, and Gary was in his mid 40's. Gary had a son, Zack, who was a year younger than Hayley, Hayley and Zack had actually gone to the same school together but didn't know it until seeing old school photos.\n\nThings seemed to be going fine in Hayley and Gary's relationship and she ended up moving in with Gary and his family. Quickly Gary's sister didn't like Hayley and was accusing her of doing inappropriate things with Zack while Gary was at work. Hayley denied them and I believed her, just thinking Gary's sister didn't approve of Hayley because of the age gap.\n\nUntil one night. Through a series of events I can't talk about because it'll make the post too long, Hayley, Zack and I were spending the night at my friend Katy's house. At night we sorted out our sleeping arrangements, Katy and I were going to sleep in Katy's bed, and Hayley and Zack were going to sleep on the air mattress we'd put up beside Katy's bed. So we turned off the light and hopped into bed.\n\nKaty fell asleep quickly, but I can take hours to fall asleep, but I was quiet, so Hayley and Zack probably assumed I was asleep too. Then I started hearing noises, like hand movements and a male voice groaning. Without getting too into details, it was obvious what I was hearing was Hayley giving Zack a handjob (even found some used toilet paper on the floor the next day, gross). My back was facing them, so I couldn't open my eyes to try and see what was going on, but you could easily tell with just the audio.\n\nThe next day we had planned to all go to a birthday party, but I told the others I was feeling sick (I had health problems at the time, so it was believable) and asked Katy to stay behind to look after me, which she did. Once they were gone I told her what had happened, and asked if I should tell Gary. I wasn't close to Gary or anything, but I did have him on Facebook, so I could of contacted him.\n\nUltimately I felt scared at the potential of losing Hayley as a friend, and not knowing if Gary would believe me since I didn't have any actual evidence, and also didn't want to screw up Gary and Zack's father/son relationship, so I didn't end up saying anything. AITA for not saying anything to him? He and Hayley ended up breaking up sometime last year for unrelated reasons, but I still feel somewhat guilty for keeping my mouth shut about it.\n\nTL;DR: heard friend masturbating her boyfriend's son but didn't end up telling the boyfriend, not sure if I made the right decision or not.",

      "description": "I just got ACL surgery about 6 weeks ago (tore it playing soccer, during the first 30 seconds of the season but that’s another story) and I’ve been way ahead of schedule with my recovery as I’ve tried to be super loyal to the PT regimen since I’m trying to get back for my senior year baseball season (17 M btw). \n\nAbout a week ago, my physical therapist told me that while I can’t run, it would be great for me to get into a pool and jog to help my body get running mechanics back even before I’ve rehabbed my quad enough for it to be ready to bear the weight of running. I’m lucky enough to have a running membership at a local Equinox that has a pool available for all its members so I figured it was perfect.\n\nThe first day I got there I asked the lifeguard if I could get into the slow lane and walk/jog/backpedal as long as I stayed out of the way of the swimmers (that didn’t really end up being an issue because they were going pretty slow). He said yes as long as I did my best not to bother anyone so I eased myself in and started walking up and down the pool.\n\nNow, the PT has told me to run for about 15 mins before standing in the water and doing some single leg squats, hip hinges, etc. It was at this time that I decided it would be a good idea to ask my dad to film a couple of the exercises I was doing. I’m planning on taking a lot of different videos and editing them into a youtube series for my senior project because a) it lets me drop a class senior spring and b) some of the tutorials I found online have actually really helped.\n\nThis caught the attention of a guy swimming in the far lane (the fast one) and he began to yell at me for clogging up the lane. To be fair, I was probably taking up a yard or two off the end of my lane, but I didn’t think there was anything wrong with what I was doing. He said I was being selfish, and when I responded with “Happy Thanksgiving to you, too!” (this happened on November 22nd), he left the pool yelling about the selfishness he was tired of in the sports club. \n\nIt’s a long winded story for a short description, but it’s been bothering me for a couple weeks. I’m kind of scared to go back. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened almost four years ago and ended this friendship. She got in touch with me last night and we both still think the other is wrong. \n\nAllow me to set the stage- it’s 2015 and my friend, L and I decide that the upcoming fall we are gonna hike the Appalachian trail together. L and I grew up together and had been life long friends. There was a time when I’d have said I felt closer to her then to anyone in the world. She and I both struggle with our demons and mental health and we were both in rough shape at the time. She’d just had a difficult break up and was extremely depressed. I had been living with my parents after I ended up in a partial inpatient behavioral health program. \n\nGiven what we’ve both been through, this hike meant more to us both than just a fun trip. It was meant to be life changing and cathartic. We were really serious about it. We started planning and researching and decided that this would be a six month long endeavor. \n\nBut, things didn’t work out. Around March, shit started to hit the fan for me. My parents were getting divorced and my dad had to be removed from the house by the police. My mom had a restraining order but he continued to stalk and harass her. I had a public blackout/meltdown and got arrested. My mom decided to sell the house we were living in and move across the country. \n\nSo by summer, I found myself needing a place to live, alone in a strange city, estranged from my father, owing court fees and pretty heartbroken. I realized I couldn’t afford to go by September as we had planned. First months rent, security deposit, costs of moving, and court fees had depleted my savings. I told L that we would have to postpone our trip because I needed time to save up money and figure out my shit. She was pretty upset and not super understanding (her parents pay her bills) but she was furious when she found out that I wasn’t planning on canceling a road trip the following month with my boyfriend. \n\nIn my defense, boyfriend (now fiancé) and I are LDR, him in Europe and me in the US, and we had planned this trip for nearly a year. Not to mention, BF has a great job and paid for the whole trip. The only money I spent was on some postcards. While I felt horrible for postponing my trip with L, I didn’t think it was fair of her to ask me to cancel my trip with my boyfriend. So I didn’t. I went and had a great time and it was a huge relief to be away from all the shit that I’d been through that year. The rest of the shit with L was just drama and nonsense and I’m glad to have cut her out of my life because it got pretty nasty. But still, after talking to her last night, I’m a little shaken by her confidence that I was completely in the wrong. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "They’re twins, and we kind of rushed into our relationship, one day, she stopped talking to me, and I tried to talk to her a few times but just got shut down, I decided to wait for her to be ready to talk to me, assuming she’d say something when she was. This went on for weeks and during this time, her twin sister (also a friend of mine) noticed I was confused and upset and started doing things to make me feel better, like talk to me a lot and give me hugs (she was not trying to get with me, she didn’t want to be in any relationship at the time). Anyway, my now-ex girlfriend never did start talking to me again, and, after an awkward prom, she broke up with me in tears over a voice call and I told her I understood. (Later I learned she’d been telling her friends (not me) that she was waiting for me to talk to her but I was always talking to her sister. I wish she would have said something, I thought she would just shut me down again.) At this point, the sister still didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone, but we kept talking, a lot, and she was making me feel better about myself and helping me get over the breakup. A few months later, we were dating. A little after we got together, I learned my ex was already having sex with her new bf. I didn’t mind. But that was almost a year ago, and my ex still doesn’t talk to me, and whenever she’s having a rough time in her relationship, she’ll sometimes get mad at my gf for dating me, and I feel a little bad. I do feel like I would have been happier dating my current gf from the start than recovering my relationship with her sister, but I still feel like I might have done the wrong.\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend stopped talking to me, and her twin sister (my friend) started making me feel better despite being ghosted. Girl broke up with me, and I started dating her sister a few months later.",

      "description": "Okay so I know what the title says, but I would like to clarify that I know that leading someone on is a dick move. I’m more confused as to whether or not what I’m doing can be considered as leading someone on. Basically, I met this guy in a club in December and we made out in the club and exchanged numbers. We’ve been texting since then, but we live in different cities and so we barely see each other. Since then we’ve met up like twice, but we text a lot, like everyday. Anyway, it’s quite obvious to me that he was sort of into me, but because we hardly saw each other and barely knew each other, I figured it was pretty casual. Between seeing him, I’d continue to casually see a few other guys casually. Anyway, a few weeks ago, he got really drunk and drunk called me, but I didn’t answer and he left me a voicemail which was largely unintelligible, but my friends and I managed to distinguish him saying ‘I want to be exclusive with you’. I don’t really know what that means, or at least I don’t want to assume, and when I was texting him the next day he said he didn’t remember anything from the night before. Anyway, I haven’t said anything about it and we are still talking and he’s planning on coming to see me next week, which I’m excited about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends seem to think I don’t like him, and I’m not sure I do. I definitely like him as a person, and we get on really well, but I’m not a 100% sold on anything more with him. I definitely see the potential, I could see us having something more, but for now I’m just so confused because we’ve hardly spent any time together. While some of my friends have told me to tell him about this, I also don’t want to be too presumptuous about the situation. We never defined the parameters of this relationship/friendship, and I don’t want to assume he wants something more if he doesn’t. I’m just worried that I’m leading him on, and I would never want to hurt him, so, AITA? ",

      "description": "So this Christmas the plan is for my fiancé and I to fly out and visit my parents. We’ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there’s no privacy at my parents’ (Which is true - we won’t be the only guests there. But it’s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I’m already going to have to deal with my mother’s hurt feelings over this since I don’t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fiancé feels somewhat smothered. But again, it’s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I’m not spending money on a hotel room and that I’m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she’s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she’s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn’t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they’re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I’m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I’m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I’ll see her afterward. But I feel like she’d actually kill me so I haven’t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n",

      "description": "Ok so, I'm pretty sure I'm \\[24f\\] the asshole here. This just happened, and I am really trying to calm down and get my head straight. Please rip me a new one here if I deserve it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came back to the house this morning with trash overflowing in the garbage can and a bad smell. I took out the trash and this isn't the first time this happened. My roommate \\[27m\\] is somewhat of a slob. Granted I'm not the most organized person ever, but I am sanitary. I don't mind mess, but garbage and stink...nope.\n\nI got kind of petty and asked him to do the dishes, which were a lot but nothing gross. Mostly just dirty water cups and such. He was being an asshole and got mad at me for even asking, and I told him he didn't have to do it, but I did take care of his garbage. I went to go pee and noticed piss in the toilet, and I got annoyed. He never flushes his pee. One time at 4 am, I accidentally peed on top of his and it fucking splashed up onto my vagina and the thought of doing that again really makes me want to vomit. YUCK. I can't stand his habits, but other than that we are pretty good friends when things are good. However, to give myself a laugh, my friend prank called him saying to take out his garbage and he literally went off, saying he'd find my friend and beat his ass. He proceeds to blare screamo and pout for a good 3 hours. \n\nI was on the phone with my bf when I hear \"dog got out\" and apparently he accidentally let my giant 110 pound great dane/pit/lab out. I asked him to help me retrieve my dog and he just says \"no\". This is a big deal because people are very afraid of my dog (which I get. He's friendly but very scary looking. He's black with yellow eyes, giant looking pit) and I need someone stronger than me to grab him sometimes. Thank god some kind strangers came to my aid.  I come back and his friend was like \"there's the bad boy!\" jokingly. I didn't find it funny and was like \"no, this is \\[my roommate's\\] fault, lazy ass didn't even help me\".\n\nI come in and notice that there's trash ALL OVER the basement steps. covered the walls and was stinking up. I fucking lost it. I yelled at him to clean it RIGHT THE FUCK NOW. He said no, started plugging his PS4 in and I unplug it, telling him to clean. We are pushing each other around like fucking children. He refuses. So I said if he doesn't, I'd throw the trash in his room. And that's what I did. I apologized to his friend that is just watching this all unfold. He started cleaning stuff up and gagging because of how gross it was. \n\nI am now back to my room, fuming and trying to cool off. I might have a problem. ",

      "description": "Started a new job about a month ago. Good job, but it's the kind where mistake are very easy to make. My trainer and I are basically splitting the duties of a single role, we each take half, with her watching and always available to help. \n\nAnyways, today a found a case that had several errors on it. A page was missing I had look up, some of the information was filed incorrectly, etc. easy stuff to mess up. But it was a lot, so I needed her help to sort it out. At one point during the review of it, she makes a comment that clearly indicates she thinks I did it. Now, that is a fair assumption, they are easy mistake to make, i made them, and I'm new. Her tone wasn't accusatory, she wasn't going to report the error or anything, no one is getting it trouble. The thing is *this time* it's on her. Her name and employee number is all over the case. Would I have been this asshole if I had advised her this was all on her?\n\nBonus info: she is pregnant and in pain from preexisting medical issue exacerbated by the pregnancy. She is always kind and understanding with me, but I get the feeling she can be a bitch. Also, her and our boss worked together for almost a decade at this and another firm. So it may not be wise to call her out even if I'm not the asshole...\n\nTl;Dr: My cranky, pregnant trainer at my new job thinks I made a error that she did. No one is getting in trouble for it, so would I have been an asshole if I corrected her?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of our dishes are meat based?",
      "description": "So I have been working in my parent's bar and grill/cafe for as long as I can remember. There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment. AITA?",

And recently she got married, moved state and got pregnant so I haven't seen her in a few months, but we still keep up. And then she invited me to her birthday party and because I haven't seen her in a while and didn't want to be a bad friend I told her I'd be there, her husband even offered to buy my flight which surprised me because we never got along.\n\nSo her husband picks me up at the airport and things are a little awkward but I try to ignore it and when we arrive at their house as soon as she see's me, she gets up to give me a hug and I noticed she's VERY pregnant, so I say \"Wow look at you, ya Fatfuck\" we both laugh and when she hugs me I said \"just kidding, you look beautiful\" this is where the problem starts.\n\nAfter this interaction I noticed, I didn't know ANY of the people there and people didn't seem to like me, a few people gave me dirty looks and a few snide remarks were made but I tried to be as friendly as possible, people would also compliment her and look at me, I didn't know what they were doing and still don't.\n\nAbout halfway into the party her husband and a few other people pulled me aside and said I should apologize to her as what I said was really inappropriate and mean, I just told them it was a joke, she took it as a joke and this was how we always talked to each other and her husband said \"I know you always had a thing for her and I always put up with it, but you need to apologize or you must leave\" I told him he was being an idiot and needed to calm down and that I don't have a thing for her but he wouldn't listen.\n\nJust to stop him from arguing with me I apologized to her and she was like \"for what?\" and the next few hours were shit, everybody was ignoring me, I even heard someone call me an asshole. So I felt pretty shitty the whole night, so I had to ask you guys, was I an asshole?",

She's never really had money, but she used to just bring it up if I asked her to go to something expensive (say, a $35 trip to a museum). She's also always smoked weed, but it used to be around a few times a week. I've never smoked regularly, I'm not a fan. We used to talk about all kinds of things, positive and negative, but that's changed.\n\nIn the last year, Taylor started dating and living with this guy, I think his views are rubbing off on her. Now when we hang out, all she talks about is being broke, smoking weed, hating capitalism, and being depressed. I know she's struggling, but she's also distant and refuses to talk about any of these issues in anything other than that joking, existential meme way. She smokes weed 3-4+ times a day, and now refuses to spend any money when we hang out together, even on something very inexpensive ($10 movie tickets, etc.) We end up just walking around or sitting in my house.\n\nIt pisses me off that Taylor has enough to spend on weed but can't set aside less than an hour's wages to hang out with me. It makes me feel like I'm not important enough. AITA for thinking this way and not wanting to see her as much anymore?",

(I love my father so much and it hurts me that I should feel this way.)\n\nRelative to situation: My sister lives with my parents, her car just broke down and my parents bought her a new car. (Sister is paying for college out of pocket.)\n\nMy situation goes like this: I was recently laid off and have been living off of unemployment for a couple weeks now. I will receive my own tax return, but I cannot claim my money from the parent plus loan. It would have to be divided up under the correct percentages for both my brothers loans and mine as they are inseparable (company only allows one account holder for the multiple loans.) \n\nI have been paying double the amount on this loan and expect a rather large return, but my mother called to inform me that I will not be given that money as they are to use it for medical bills and the like. Due to my father being the main account holder, they are the only ones who can claim these loans on their taxes. They are also taking my brother's money as well, but I'm sure he doesn't feel this way.\n\nAITA for not wanting them to use my money, when in the past they have taken my money and not used it for things they said they would? My mother was crying to me on the phone trying to guilt trip me, but when I found out they bought my sister a $4k car, I think some of that has disapated. I am frustrated and feel like an asshole for not caring about my parents well being. \n\n",

      "description": "Hi Reddit, using a throwaway and this will be a x-post to r/offmychest.\n\nMy BF (27M) and I (25F) have been together for 3.5 years. We moved in together last summer. We have always wanted to get married and feel the time is coming soon. He said he wants to be married before he's 30. We're also at the life stage where many friends are getting married, so it gives lots of opportunities to discuss what we want for our future.\n\nThe problem is this: we have some financial goals we want out of the way before we get engaged. Most we took care of shortly after moving in, but one remains: he wants to start his new job before getting engaged. However, the company has been stalling him on that for over two months, so I feel like there's no firm timeline.\n\nHe said if the job doesn't come through by next month, he'll start thinking about a proposal. He also said if he doesn't get an offer next week, he'll start searching elsewhere. I don't really believe him on either of these, because he has a habit of changing his mind and then getting mad at me when I call him out on not following through.\n\nHe is stressed at work and doesn't want me talking about it when he comes home. (Everyone else left the old company, so he's basically doing the work of a whole department by himself.) Whenever I try to bring up that he shouldn't be waiting this long, he can consider other options, this is delaying our marriage goals, etc., he tells me to \"stop bitching\" and \"it'll happen when it happens.\" I'm trying to give him space while being open about the relationship, but it's like talking to a brick wall. I know this isn't healthy communication on his part.\n\nHe's been in touch with the boss and they keep telling him \"any day now.\" But I think two months is enough and highly unprofessional considering they told him the job is already his. His current job is stable for now, so I don't see any reason to let this control other aspects of our lives.\n\nTL;DR long-term BF won't propose until he starts his new job. Company has spent over 2 months on hiring process, still no offer in sight. BF refuses to talk about it because he \"can't handle any more on his plate.\" AITA for thinking it's time to solve this?",

I paid and tipped 15%.\n\nWhen we were about to leave she came back and asked \"Did someone have 2 pounds of wings?\"  I sat there hoping not to be found out but all of my friends ratted on me.  So I said \"Yeah I had the second pound.

      "description": "For as long as I can remember my sister has wished for a puppy. But for several reasons wasn't allowed. Both me and my mom aren't huge fans of dogs, she grew up with a Dachshund which she nicknamed \"Devil's Sausage\" for reasons that should be obvious, and I when was 6 years old and playing on the curb a barking dog ran over to me and knocked me over, gave me a concussion, which apart from the trip to ER gave me a lasting fear of large dogs.\n\nI'm a grown man now, and she's a grown woman. She's a bit older than me is already starting a family, has one beautiful 2y.o girl and is in the 2nd trimester of her second pregnancy. She lives her life mostly free from me, I live mine mostly free from her.\n\nLast we met she talked about getting a dog and I generally supported her. The reason she didn't get one growing up was because of me and my mother, not her. She's an adult now and can make her own decisions. Around 2 months ago she visisted an animal shelter not long after, and after some back and forth decided to adopt a little brown 6 week old purebred pit bull puppy.\n\nI wasn't exactly a fan, and asked her if she'd really thought the whole thing out before going through with the adoption. When my mother found out however she was deeply dissapointed, she voiced her opinion privately via texting but after some time sister exclaimed that she was a grown woman and wasn't interested in arguing over her dog anymore. It wasn't until we met at a family gathering for a birthday where things really spilled over. You could call it a dogfight. Mom v. Sister, with me reluctantly supporting my mother, and my brother reluctantly supporting my sister. It ended up getting pretty ugly, mom called her an irresponsible parent, sister called us heartless dog haters, and sister ended up leaving early. \n\nThe day after me and my mother texted eachother and decided to compile a list of arguments against her decision to adopt a pit bull if the topic were to ever come up at another family gathering. It went like this:\n\n* Pit bulls are responsible for 62% of dog fatalities, and while they score middle of the road in agression tests, their strenght makes them far more dangerous.\n* Sister is not physically strong enough to restrain a fully grown pit bull if it decided to attack another person or dog.\n* Her daughter screaming or crying could set off the dog and make it snap.\n* Her dog could be an annoyance to her downstairs, and other neighbours in general. She could face discrimination when trying to find housing in the future.\n* She's never had a dog before, and pit bulls are high maintenance\n* Dogs are expensive and she's living on limited income, any visit to the vet could leave her in big debt\n* The dog will live a dull life stuck inside her appartment\n\nA few weeks pass and me and my mother are sitting in the living room chatting and the topic about the list comes up, I agree somewhat reluctantly to send the whole thing to my sister and perhaps predictably, she blocked me without even replying. Mother messaged sister's S.O, a wonderful, smart and compassionate guy, and he explained that my sister is pretty upset and considering not coming to the christmas dinner unless we stopped criticizing her dog\n\nMy Father and brother are both telling me to leave her alone and let her have her dog, however I think the impact that the dog would have on herself and others is too big to just turn the other cheek to, and would end up damaging her in the long term. My brother and father are both very sensible and reasonable people so I'm afraid that might be the asshole.",

      "description": "I know the widespread opinion on unfaithfulness but try to hear me out first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off this isn't an AITA for having cheated, that's clear and not up for debate. I've long accepted full responsibility for it in person, 2 days after it occurred. I then explained that I was unhappy with our relationship and thought we should see other people. She was naturally upset and I offered to leave or call her a friend, but she asked me to stay and we decided to grab dinner to recount old times and cement/celebrate our transition of relationship into friendship.\n\nAfterwards we naturally saw less of each other but still hung out regularly and got along well. Things quickly devolved. I can't be sure why her attitude towards me started to change, but my best guess is she was getting over the realization of \"we've broken up\" and into \"he kissed another woman\".\n\nShe began to vocally berate me whenever we were in a room with friends, would tell me graphically about the other men she was having sex with and would take pride in the fact that I hadn't seen anyone since the breakup. She would also lie about what she'd told other people, leaving me unsure what my friends were saying behind my back. \n\nI understood she was hurt and considered this fair game until a mutual friend messaged me while I was out drinking and I (stupidly and drunkenly) responded that \"I was going to pretend not to have seen it\" given she was a close friend of my ex and seemed wildly flirtatious. I then passed out for 8 hours.\n\nI woke up to a shitstorm on every platform imaginable from both Friend and Ex. I apologized and tried to explain that I must've misunderstood the context of Friends message, but Ex was having none of it. I offered to three way video chat so we could all work it out. Ex replied that there'd be no point, as I'd probably just invalidate everything she had to say.\n\nSeeing as we were at an impasse, the conversation ended. A few hours later friends began asking me about Ex's posts on instagram detailing \"some people\" are never meant to be trusted and \"some men\" are just scum. Taking polls on \"how she should kill her ex's Sim\" and \"how to destroy all photos of us.\" A few minutes later I received the message that she was ready to talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a patient man, but this was where I drew the line. It's normal for her not to forgive me, but I'm tired of being walked all over and its become unambiguously clear she was never going to stop. So I told her that it was probably best we went our separate ways and. I explained I didn't hate her, but I certainly didn't like her anymore.\n\nOver the next 24hrs I received numerous \"heartfelt\" apologies, I ignored them. 48hrs later her spiteful behaviour returned with a vengeance, and I've since had people I've never even met grimace when I introduce myself due to having met Ex first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for deciding to break off contact, or was it the right thing to do?",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my flatmate before he left me with the lease to myself",
      "description": "So I thought that my flatmate and I are like family. I do heaps of chores for him like cooking meals and unpaid babysitting for his son. Actually his son is lovely and I spend untold amount of time with him. When my flatmate had been sick or hung over or hospitalized, I've always been good to take the kid for a day for the dad to recover.\n\nSo one day we have the smallest of all arguments. Essentially I'm unhappy that dad let's his son ignore other adults and go see daddy when he doesn't like what he's been told by another adult. I call it \"daddy appeal court\". My friend disagrees and ignores me, and I get upset, but I hold my emotions in check and keep it to myself. I take 24 hours to myself and I don't respond to texts for a day.\n\nSo my friend, instead of offering to discuss the issue or apologize, just says that he's moving out in three months. He thinks this is enough time for me to figure stuff out. The thing is, three months time is Christmas/New Years, and I have vacation plans. And movers and realters will be the least available. Also November - December is my busiest work time. I told this to me friend, and it's definitely not OK for me.\n\nOur lease is due up in the end of February, but the landlord is willing to let us go since it's our second year. I ask my friend what he'll do if he can't find a new tenant for January. Will he be responsible for his end of the rent until the end of the lease? Three times I ask, and three times he deflects the question. Obviously I'll be stuck with triple rent (me, dad and son is three rooms) if he goes and no one fills his place.\n\nSo after a bit of probing, I find the reason he's so stuck on December is that he found the perfect new place, but he needs to move on the end of December as that's when the place is free. \n\nSo since I can't move out in November or December, and since I can't afford the potential triple rent, I move out at the end of October, which works best for me. It was a pain to do it in a rush, but it's better than being worried about starving in January.\n\nMy friend asks me if I'll pay for November and December at the old place. I tell him I can't since I need to come up with a deposit and moving fees real quick. Keep in mind that he makes 3-4 times what I do, and he gets child support. I'm also finishing a masters so I don't have a lot of extra cash lying around. I didn't plan for a sudden move now. So we're not friends anymore since I feel what he did massively betrayed our friendship and put me in a serious bind unnecessarily.\n\nTLDR: my former close friend wanted to leave before the lease and potentially leave me with his share of the rent, so I left earlier and left him with my share of the rent.

Curious, i googled it.\n\nApparently this is when manipulative sociopaths try to make people doubt their sanity by telling them false things happened, or by telling them true things didnt happen, correct? Heres the issue.\n\nI do this all the time, to coworkers, to friends, and to family. I find it funny, like a prank.\n\nLike telling my coworker our boss wanted to see him the next morning, and then when our boss tells him there was no meeting i would convince him that i never said what i said and he believes me.\n\nOr telling my girlfriend to get me bluebell ice cream, then when she does ill tell her i asked her for ben and jerrys. Then when she gets me b&amp;j ill tell her i asked for bluebell.\n\nOr calling my friend and asking him where hes at, pretending that we had plans and were going to hang out all day when in reality no such plans existed.\n\nI told all of this to my online friends and they say that im abusing people whereas i think this is just a standard bait and switch inside joke i have.",

      "description": "Backstory, my “fast dining” restaurant that is “Mexican themed” just lost its general manager so it is just the shift supervisors there. I am now making the schedule, one is in charge of ordering inventory, one is doing catering worksheets, and the other is day-to-day business. Recently, we had our main night cook put his two weeks in. We were going to fire him because of his attendance back in December, but I talked to him and told him hey I know you are young but this is a job not a place to hang out stop calling out and it worked. He has been written up twice for this. For the last few weeks, he has been calling out and making some shitty excuse like “my grandma fell” or “i have a rash on my arm” or “I’m puking” or “I have a lot of schoolwork” you get the point. I give leeway to the high schoolers because I was in their shoes once and I don’t want any mad parents coming my way, and they are usually good hardworking kids. I would usually believe him, as he has a rough life as it seems already, but he came in on his lunch at school on the days he called out! So today, he was supposed to be my cook and he called out and didn’t give an explanation, just told me he could not make it in. So I said fine, that tells me that yesterday was your last day and he got pissed and started backtracking and I said I have to go and ended the call. It is easier for me to cover his shifts in advance versus calling someone same-day and trying to get people to come in. Now, all the high schoolers (they all go to school together) are mad at me and the shift supervisors for doing this, and saying that his new job didn’t start until his two weeks were over, and he needs the money because he has to help his girlfriends parents with rent because he lives there. So, AITA?",

It's making her frustrated because she doesn't know the reason for it, but she just wants to move on. She is telling me that \"if he just had an affair it would be much easier\"... \n\nJoe and the girl from the affair is starting to form a couple now, secretly.

      "description": "I grew up in a very rural conservative area, went to an equally conservative college then married a nice Christian boy. My life has been the perfect American dream. I stay home, cook and clean. My contribution to our relationship is being a homemaker. I can’t say that I dreamed for much more than this, I am quite happy as my guy comes from a rich family. But, I was constantly getting bored during the day. I found myself watching youtube videos, talking to my parents and taking long baths to fill my time. That is, until I started going to a charitable group that helps kids in under served communities. I met some friends, found purpose and had something to do during the day.\n\nAt this charity event, I started talking to this man who is also married. He has a much broader build than my husband and more defined masculine features. Apparently, he has some kids that needed to be taken care of during the day since his divorce. He works from home, so he wasn’t asking for much. More just for a female presence to be there. I asked for my husband’s permission that night if it would be okay to watch for his kids sometimes for some extra money. He was fine with it, no issues and suggested that we invite the man to church with us sometime. After all, men and women can be friends and to suggest otherwise would be sexist.\n\nAnyways, when I go over to his house to baby sit, I have some ungodly thoughts about him. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love that my husband provides an amazing life for me. But it feels like I am taken over with butterflies in certain parts of my body. I have done some research and found out that there are several different kinds of love, such as lust, romantic and friend. I feel like I have friend and romantic love for my husband and lust love for this man. I have not acted on this but I have decided to take myself out of this situation because I feared cheating on my loyal, kind, nurturing husband. I have been feeling guilty about this internal conflict. So am I the asshole for fantasizing about another man while married? ",

      "description": "Last year, my sister got married. She and her husband both finished their degrees in what will be a very lucrative field. They both landed jobs in a city they like and plan to stay there for a while. They didn't want to move into an apartment, then move again in a year or so, so they asked some family members for money toward a down payment on a house. As they will both be making good money in the next year or so, and they had a good budget plan, my husband and I gave them some money with the understanding they would pay it back within a year or two (which they are doing). I didn't spread it around, but my sister's very open with our parents and she mentioned it to them. This wouldn't have been an issue, except: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier this month, my brother got in a car accident. He's fine, no one was hurt any worse than a few bruises, but his car was totaled. My mom thinks I should give him money to help him get a new (or new to him) car, because he won't be able to afford one otherwise. I consulted my husband, and we're in complete agreement. We refused. We don't want to do this for a few reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. This would be a gift, not a loan. There would not be a question of repayment. That makes this an entirely different situation.\n2. This is the sixth (I think) car accident my brother and his wife have been in during the last five years.\n3. This is the fourth car he and his wife have totaled between them, and I don't see their driving habits improving any time soon. We don't want to throw good money after bad.\n4. My brother hasn't asked. My mom asked (well, suggested. Strongly suggested). \n5. We have given him money several times over the years. It just seems to vanish, and my husband isn't fond of the idea of, essentially, supporting two households.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not asking for advice - at the end of the day, it's our money, and my husband and I are the final arbiters of its use. I just want to know, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(A few extra points - no, my parents cannot afford to give him money. No, I don't think my brother was aware of my mom's request. Yes, they have another car and can function as a one-car household, but it would be difficult.)",

      "title": "AITA for cutting myself off from my sister’s boyfriend’s church group?",
      "description": "*all names are changed for privacy\n\nI used to attend a church youth group that was part of a small church (the pastor is the father of my sister’s boyfriend). We would meet once a week, and have our bible study, then often go somewhere to eat, or have dessert if most of us are prior to that. We would often carpool, though I would usually go alone, since I didn’t know the others that well. We would meet every Monday night, usually at 6:30 pm. Let me mention here that I’m a paraprofessional in Special Education, and due to having morning duty at school, I have to be on campus by 7:15 am, so I wake up at 6 am at the latest, so I try not to stay up too late on school nights. \n\nOne night, I was super tired from work, the kids had been very active that day, so I was considering not going. My sister convinced me to go, saying that we didn’t have to go anywhere afterwards. I went, and drove my sister and brother with me to save on gas. It ended a little earlier than usual, so my sister begged me if we could go somewhere after all. I told her that I was really tired, and didn’t feel like going anywhere to eat, and would rather relax at home with something picked up to go, so she suggested that we just go somewhere to get dessert instead. I wasn’t really wanting to, but I decided to go for their sake. We then, as a group, began debating on where to go. My sister and I made it clear that I wanted somewhere that wouldn’t be a lengthy drawn-out meal, so we began naming places in the area that had desserts or good appetizers and sides. We eventually decided to go to an ice cream chain that was located somewhat nearby on a busy street that had many other restaurants and event type places. \n\nI drove my car, and my brother went with me. I thought my sister and her boyfriend were coming with us as well, but then they surprised us by going in his car, and with his two sisters and the boyfriend of one of them in another. I didn’t particularly care, so headed on. Her boyfriend has a sports car, and likes to drive fast, so unsurprisingly, I saw him pass us on the highway. Though his sister left slightly before us, I passed them. I took the best exit to get to the place (there are multiple exits one could take, the one I took was the most expedient, but GPS doesn’t say to take it, and if one isn’t familiar with the area, they wouldn’t know to take it). I saw the sisters pass by the exit, and figured they didn’t know about it, and so assumed we’d get there sooner than them. We arrived at the place, and I was surprised to see that my sister and her boyfriend weren’t there (they had passed us earlier and he speeds, while I typically don’t). A minute later they pulled up. He told us that he forgot about the exit I took which why I beat them there. We went in to see what we wanted while waiting for the others. \n\nAfter a few minutes in which they should already be there, I asked John where the others were. He said, and I quote, “Oh, Jane (one of his sisters) missed the exit too and got lost. She’s so dumb. They’re using the GPS now though, and should be here before too long, but let’s order in the meantime.” So we did. My sister ordered hers and finished it quickly, while my brother and I took our time. My sister said, “The others said that they didn’t really want dessert after all, so they went to the fast food chicken place across the street. We’re hungry, and John (her boyfriend) didn’t want anything anyway, so we’re going to join them. Come join us after you’re done!” Then left. I was mad, because after we’d all agreed on going to the ice cream place, the others apparently on their own decided to go get chicken, without me. My sister tried saying that the others hadn’t actually agreed to ice cream specifically, just something in the area. I say that that’s untrue, as John told me that the others were on the way and were only delayed in getting there because they missed the exit and got lost, causing a big delay in their arrival to the ice cream place, when in actuality they took the next one (that only would’ve caused a slight delay) and had gone straight to the chicken place across the street. \n\nI had a big bowl of ice cream, so I took my time finishing it, then texted my sister saying that I was going to pick up food to go from the place next door, and to be ready to leave (by that time she and her boyfriend would have been there at least half an hour, probably more due to the time it would take to pick up my food). I drove over to the other place, ordered my food, then when it was ready, brought my car next door to pick up my sister. I texted her saying that it was ready, so so her goodbyes and whatnot. I then walked in, and she’s still eating. I told her that we need to go, it was already late, and I needed to get home. She started saying that she needed a lot to eat, that she had just ordered some fries and would have to waste the sauce if we left right then (her words, I still don’t get what she meant). I told her that I’d texted her in plenty of time, and she’d had plenty of time to eat already. She wouldn’t budge, so I simply said, “We’re leaving. Now.” Then turned and walked out, fully prepared to leave her there if she made no move to leave\n\nShe followed soon after, and upon getting in the car, started saying that I’d embarrassed her in front of her boyfriend, his sisters, Joe (Jane’s boyfriend) and everyone in the restaurant (which was a chain that she worked in another location of). She said that I was being unreasonable, and trying to act like her parent. I told her that I’d given her plenty of warning to finish up, and had been doubly generous (possibly triply) as I hadn’t even wanted to go that night as I was so tired, but went so she wouldn’t have to drive, then after that agreed to go somewhere after even though I’d said from the beginning that we wouldn’t, then, when they changed what we had agreed on, didn’t fuss about it (initially) and took my time with my ice cream to give her time to eat as well. I had texted her multiple times so she would know to be ready, but she claimed not to have checked her phone (which I suspect is a lie, as she’s almost constantly on her phone; at other times when we’ve been doing things together I’ve had to tell her to get off of it). \n\nAs we walked out, I could see from their faces that the sisters were judging me. After that, I stopped going to the church (which is basically the only contact I’d had with them other than a WhatsApp group they created for the youth group), as they apparently went out of their way to exclude me from the group, either because they didn’t want me to be with them, or because they didn’t want to have just a fast thing after and rather than simply disagreeing with me, pretended to go along, then changed the plan when I wasn’t there to physically object.

      "description": "Edit 2: I figured I'd come add this even though I'm sure no one will read this. Turns out I wasn't over reacting over the noise.  The family left a few days ago. I was talking to someone in the building and everyone could hear their banging, slamming and stomping. I talked to a few of my neighbours and all of them had talked to the landlord about the family above us and asked him to talk to them about their noise. Apparently the landlord talked to them about it and they just left. I'm not sure if they'll be back because you can't evict that fast, but it's been a few days so we're all hopeful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit : I edited this because I wrote it in anger immediately after they yelled at me. This is a more accurate representation of what we're both like.\n\nHey guys, I was wondering if AITA\n\nI moved in to my apartment a few years ago. The problems started when me ceiling started leaking in May, and it kept leaking on and off until it was FINALLY fixed in the end of December. After that, the noise from the new tenant (moved in mid december, both insanely loud walkers so relevant) above me became INSANE. It was constant, and registered between 60-85 decibles. This isn't normal noise, this is constant door slamming, throwing things,  stomping so loudly the dishes in my kitchen rattle and a bowl vibrated and fell off my dresser loud.\n\nI've been documenting the times they're loud and it's literally constant. They seem to get louder when I'm playing music to try to drown them out so I can think/study. My music isn't loud enough to leave my bedroom when the door is closed so I know it's not bothering other tenants. You can still talk over my music and have a conversation, so it's about conversation level loud.\n\nSee my edits below. I was patient with them and the noise. I gave them 2-3 weeks to settle in before asking them if they could be quiet. I phrased it as the building being old too not out any blame on them. I couldn't even finish my sentence before they told me no and slammed the door in my face. I tried to talk to them another time and they ignored me. I've asked the landlord to talk to them. I spent a month trying to be patient and civil while we dealt with the noise and ceiling issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere kitchen and bathroom are directly over my bedroom. The ceiling was fixed by him taking everything down and then using a piece of wood to 'hold up the leaking pipe' and then nailing a piece of drywall to the ceiling supports. A quick google tells me he basically created a drum from their kitchen counters/bathroom into my bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning they were so loud the vibrations from banging things and slamming doors woke me up every half an hour from 7/8 am until i had to be up for school at 11. It's midterms so my sleep is extra important to me right now and i ended up going ti bed around 3/4 am. I basically only got 4 hours of sleep last night and had a lab and exam to write today. I was exhausted and frustrated and knocked on the ceiling with a broom. I then turned my music up loud (again not loud enough to be heard in the hallway) and they started BANG-BANG-BANG hitting something extremely hard when I did. I got ready and went to school.\n\nWhen I got home they were actually waiting for me outside the building today to tell me that it wasn't them, then that the noise was just their baby learning how to walk and to stop being passive aggressive. When I mentioned that I was woken up they said that it was noon (it wasn't, I had class at noon).  When i explained they'd add no sound proofing they said they knew but 'so what'. I explained it was very, very loud and they said that I should be up by noon anyway. When i said a baby can't slam doors they said that I can't prove it was them making the noise and rolled their eyes and walked away\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI 100% know it's them because they're the new tenants, they're the ones who live above the unsound-proofed ceiling and they're so loud I know their schedule. I know relatively where they are in their apartment, if they're cooking, using the toilet, doing dishes, leaving their apartment, etc. Normal living noises don't bother me. It's the slamming, stomping and banging that causes vibrations down my wall and rattles my dishes that do.\n\nI play music loudly (white noise while sleeping (70 decibels, so louder then id like but it's how high its needs to be to sleep through them and my landlord told me to do it) , spoify during the day. (Again, 60 decibles, so conversation level. I realized my level for very loud isn't everyone else's level) ) to drown out their noise, and this morning after being woken even 20 minutes from 7-10 through the white noise (75 decibles) and earplugs I was a bit grumpy and banged on the ceiling. I then turned my music higher and proceeded to slam my bedroom door every time they stomped/banged/threw something.\n\nI\"m a little ashamed of that, but it's like they expect to live in a silent home while being as loud as they want but I can't play my music over a certain limit before they start stomping/banging louder. I'm pretty sure it's in response to my music because I'm hear a very loud, QUICK and constant BANG BANG BANG BANG within minutes is starting it.\n\nThe reason i clued unti the lack of sound proofing is because when I was in my bedroom with my boyfriend they'd start stomping, slamming and banging directly overhead the entire time so loudly we couldn't hear each other and had to move to the other room. So, PI guessing they were trying to drown things out. We aren't loud and talk at a normal volume.\n\nTheir sleep schedule seems to be 8pm to anytime between 4-7am. Mine is 2-3am until 10-11am and I'm not changing that. I have class until 10pm three times a week and I'm a student so I like to sleep in on weekends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI want to add that the banging/stomping is so loud that the dishes in my kitchen rattle and I've had a dish vibrate off the dresser in my room and break. The footsteps are only an issue when they're stomping and my ceiling rattles. They normal living doesn't bother me. It's when they bang and stomp knowing I'm asleep. When I first started using the noise machine I'd leave it off until they woke me up (5-6 am) and then they'd get louder after I turned it on . It was like they put on boots after I'd turn my white noise on (6am) for over an hour while slamming every door in their house before leaving. A few times they'd slam their door and stomp down the stairs outside the landing to try to see where it was coming from.\n\nEdit\n\nBy blaring my music I mean I'm playing it loud enough to fill my bedroom but not escape into my living room with the door closed. About 60 decibels, so about conversation level. To me, this is loud music. It doesn't go into the apartment hallway so I'm fairly confident I'm not bothering other tenants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\nI also want to add that I went to talk to them before any of this started and they cut me off, told me they couldn't be quieter and slammed the door in my face. I then tried a second time before asking the landlord to talk to them. I didn't buy my sound machine until at least a month after they moved in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a sound war with upstairs tenants, landlord promises to fix the unsound proofed ceiling for the last month but hans't. I've been blaring music at around 60-70 decibles during the day(Think conversation level loud. You cab talk over it) and white noise at around 65 decibles at night to sleep through them. They still woke me up this morning (ever 20-30 min from 9am-11am because of their vibrations from banging so hard) I ended up tiredly banging on the ceiling this morning because they keep waking me up, upstairs tenants waited for me outside the building today and says the 80+ decible constant banging is either not them or a baby learning to walk. I feel like they're calling bullshit and have seen them bang/stomp louder/slam doors whenever I turn my music on to drown them out.",

      "description": "It got a litte bit longer than I thought so td;lr at the bottom.\n\nLittle bit of backround: \nI [F 25] moved away from home to a new town and I was looking online for new friends. There I found Kim [F 30] (fake name) and we seemed to have a lot in common. We chattet for some weeks bevore we decided to meet in person.\n\nEven though we chatted online constantly the conversation was really slow when we met up. I  had to keep the conversation going on my own or we would be sitting there in silence. Additional to that most of her responses were only 1-2 word sentences...  It was really awkward and also kinda exhausting for me because I am a litte shy around new people and an introvert. \n\nAfter our meeting she wrote me how much fun she had and that she was looking forward to seeing me again. So I figured that she is even more shy than me and that she maybe only had to warm up to me. So we met again several times and while I noticed that she became more talkative, she would never start the conversation on her own and it was still difficult to keep a conversation going. A few months into our friendship I found out from one of her posts on social media that she has social anxiety, so I guess that explains her behaiviour.\n\nBut I soon found myself dreading our meetings... At this point we knew each other for about 8 months and we had met like 10 times. I don't know if you would call that a friendship, for me she was more of an acquaintance. Meeting her was really mentally exhausting for me because of her inability to have a ongoing conversation. Meeting friends is supposed to charge my battery but it was the total opposite.\n\nI thought she guessed that our meetings weren't as fun for me as they were for her, because after our last meeting she never wrote me again. And I was relieved because that way I didn't have to end our \"friendship\" and also never wrote her.\n\nFast forward to two months later: \nI see online that her husband left her shortly after our last meetup (he already got a new girlfriend) and that she has a depression. I think she didn't write me because of her husband leaving her and now I feel kinda bad. I thought about reaching out I think she could use a friend and I know she doesn't have any in this city but I don't want to honestly....\n\n\n\nTd;lr \nMet [F 25] a girl [F 30] online and we met a few times. She is super shy and never contributed to our conversations so I had to keep them going. I found myself not wanting to be her friend and when she didn't write me I never reached out again. Now I found out she has depression because her husband left her and I think she never wrote me because of her situation. Now I feel bad.\n\n\nSo AITA because I don't reach out even though I now know of her depression and divorce?",

Sometimes it was nice if I asked her to, but very frustrating most of the time, as she would do it whenever she wanted and it would hurt like hell, but she would just continue despite me visibly getting upset with her. \n\nThis particular incident happened 3 years ago in  my college dorm room. I was laying on my stomach on the bed and she started popping pimples on my back. This went on for at least a half hour, and hurt very badly. In her defense, I did not explicitly tell her to stop, but we had been dating well over a year and she knew me well enough to tell from my mannerisms I was very annoyed. \n\nFinally I got up and went to the bathroom and noticed in my mirror that there were welts all over my back from where she had been pinching. I came back into the room and got pretty mad at her, at which point she got mad at me for being mad and saying it was not that big of a deal. There was no long term damage and the welts went away but it hurt like hell and I felt like I was justified in being mad. \n\nAITA? ",

If she doesn't reply fast enough he'll ignore her most of the day while being active online. One day when she brought up the fact that he too replies late and even purposely ignores her he told her all she does is \"bitch\" about things &amp; they ended thing between them for two days but got back together after he spontaneously showed up at her doorstep to \"talk things out\" &amp; having her ears filled with people telling her how happy she makes him, she seemed uncomfortable and told me she felt so but regardless she went back to him. It seems not much has changed, if anything it seems a little worse because she said that NOW he's comfortable enough to point out what she does \"wrong\". Then there's the jealousy, she posted her brother and he asked, \"who the fuck is that?\", and he'll regularly ask her if she's talking to other guys on social and want her to basically prioritize him. On one of our day out she explained how exhausting and draining it feels when he has these episodes but she still loves him, I became concerned about the situation, he may be my cousin but it seems a bit toxic, and I suggested she break up with him definitely. But now my family thinks im an asshole for \"trying to end their relationship\", so AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "I hate being tested, a trait developed because of my mother, and shared by my siblings. Being tested on my character cuts directly into me and hurts a lot, usually leaving me angry and bitter.\n\nLast week, my girlfriend's best friend decided I needed to be tested. The plan was for my girlfriend to avoid me for two days, under the guise of \"being busy with homework\". At first, I took things at face value and accepted them, having no bitter feelings or problems with the situation. However, my girlfriend's friend begin to goad me a little bit, dropping hints and implying I did something wrong. This is where I realized I was being tested. However, I didn't go confront my girlfriend on it, I just let things happen. I acted closed off and avoided my girlfriend. When she questioned me on it, I told her that I was upset about being tested, and I had told her about that in the past. She was very apologetic and I knew she genuinely felt bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days after the fact, my girlfriend and I were in my dorm room at 11:30 pm, as she was helping me with homework. She gets a call from the same friend, who asks us to come to her room. When we get there, she asks us to stay there, because she needed to study for her test, but she really wanted to make out with her boyfriend, who was also in the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was annoyed with this childish behavior, and suggested perhaps it was her turn to be tested, to see how she could do away from her boyfriend. She got very insulted by this and insisted I leave. AITA?",

We used to be really close and have constant message conversations throughout the night where we got to learn a lot about each other. We were really close. However, after I left for College, we moved apart and stopped talking entirely.\n\nRecently, I decided to start messaging her again to see if she how she was doing. Since then we've been having semi-regular message conversations however every single time it just turns into repetitive boring questions about each other's day; 'How're you?', 'Good, you?', 'Yeah, same' and so on. And we've gotten to the point where we have nothing to talk about every time we do message.\n\nBecause of this I've tried to message her less and less, however she will still message me from time to time. I kept acting as if there was no issue while talking but I had next to no motivation when talking to her. She recently asked to meet up and I had no choice but to drop the bombshell.\n\nI told her that I'm not invested in our conversations, I find it difficult to talk to her and that I'm no longer motivated to message her again. She got offended because she took it as me calling her, as a person, boring. Did I do something wrong here? How can I resolve this in the best way?",

      "description": "My family has always had 2 or 3 dogs at a time. I love dogs, and they usually like me back. If they don't, or if they seem to be only tolerating me, I leave them alone. But all of my dogs have either warmed up to me or been friendly from the start. I feel like I have only met one truly mean dog, and it wasn't her fault; she had been trained to be a \"fighting\" dog, and even she settled in and became friendly. But our new dog is something else.\n\nI'm not even paying rent, so I don't think I get a vote as to whether or not we have new pets, but I did ask to wait for a while. Two out of our three dogs died of old age last year. It hit me hard, and I miss them like mad. My father brought home a 1-year-old yellow lab about 1-2 weeks ago.\n\nThis dog hates me and only me. For the first week, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because he's moved to a new home and is certainly scared. He's loosened up around my parents and our other dog. He's friendly and even cuddly at times - to everyone else. I have been nothing but gentle toward him, but he can't stand me. He snarls and growls at me when I move. He barks every time I - and only I - open a door or use the stairs. Most terrifying: he seeks me out, growling, then starts barking and advancing when he sees me.\n\nI am shorter than my parents and significantly smaller. If I were attacked, I would not win the fight. He genuinely scares me. At first, I tried speaking in a friendly/calm voice while giving him space, the same way that my parents did. This has worked for them. It has not worked with me; when they aren't home, he \"guards\" the bottom of the staircase and threatens me when I appear. His old home didn't have any stairs, so I tried staying downstairs all night with him. When my parents are downstairs, he jumps up beside them and lies down. With me, he moves to the other room, then growls and barks whenever I make noise or move around.\n\nHonestly, I think it would be okay if he only did these things when I was near him - because then I would just give him space. But he comes looking for me or goes to wherever I am and acts like I'm an intruder. I don't even know how he knows when a door is opened by me as opposed to anyone else, but he only growls when it's me. He especially freaks out any time I use the bathroom, and I have some medical issues that mean I'm in there every 2-4 hours. No one has been able to get a full night's sleep because of the barking. I feel like it has been long enough that he should at least understand that I live here too, because I haven't done anything differently from anyone else!\n\nI don't want to be all \"It's me or the dog.\" That's not a fair choice. But I'm constantly on edge. I can't stay if this dog stays. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, so back in October a myself and a friend (A) split the price of a drift car. We sort of came up with an inside joke about the guy who sold it to us, and from there a ‘team’ name was born. My cousin (who we will call B, happens to be my A’s boyfriend, they’ve been dating for 3 years but we were friends for a little while before that) started an instagram account. If I’m being completely honest, I really don’t like B. I think she is rude, short tempered and quite frankly I think she is the total opposite of the total package. She’s very controlling, and somewhat verbally abusive toward A. \n\nMoving on. I bought another car and sold my half of the original one to A. I wanted to post on the Instagram account in question, when B said she lost the password. I waited a day and asked again. Nothing. So I made my own. On a sort of side note, B called her account ‘(fakename)racing’ whereas I called mine ‘thereal(fakename)’ in an effort to stick it to her. I told her about it and put all of the information into a group chat we have so we can all access it. B became incredibly passive-aggressive, and I got a text from A saying he was with B, and that she had ‘spent the last two hours talking to Instagram support so she could reset the password’ which is total bullshit. I told both A and B I would just make a new account and share the password. Which is what I did. \n\nNot too long ago, I started posting on this new account, to which B said something along the lines of ‘you’re just trying to cut me out of your life, none of you love me’. Spoiler alert, I don’t. She posted an absolutely awful photo (terrible quality, improper and overused effects, etc.) of both of the cars on her account with the caption “the beginning of our (fakename) family!!!!”. I messaged the group chat, having had enough of her bullshit, and said that we should just use the account with more followers by the time the race season starts, to which she freaked the fuck out. \n\nOnto today. After posting some photos of both my daily driver, and my race car, taken by a semi-pro photographer friend over the past few weeks, A started giving me some flak for not using B’s instagram account. He said that we should only post basically memes on my account and actual content on B’s account, and that people might get the impression that one of the accounts is an ‘imposter’ (Together we have about 15 followers, 4 of which are hers, no one wants to imitate that). \n\nI just want to post about my car, and have maybe a modest following without having to post about myself. I hate posting about myself (mostly on Instagram, far too personal) and I have always wanted to just have a car people will like. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "AITA for getting a wee bit to wasted and spilling a year prior’s frustration!\n\nMyself and my wife got a liil drunk before new years and met up with SIL’s friends from her home country. Somewhere along the way we, mostly I, went on a rant about how messes up half of her family is to her sister’s friends. \n\nLittle bit of info : got married last year in her home country as it is closer to her family and they can’t travel to our current country, for very frustrating reasons, diff post will be needed. 2 of the siblings did not attend our wedding due to religious belief, ( had a lesbian wedding as there it is legals, current country of residence it is not )!so only mom and brother attended. A bit annoyed as all our friends made an effort and even my own mother who was not fully accepting got her ass on a plane not to miss the big day. Whole time before wedding we were there no effort was made to see their sister, and only 2 days before we had to travel back was there plans made to meet up and lister to them moan how short we are there and stay longer and such, please note up until this point we have been there for 2 weeks already!! \n\nThe thing that gets under my skin is I am suppose to accept their religious stance and not say a thing, but then you show up the day after the wedding to come have an ‘after party’ if I can put it like that. No apologies or niceties , I must just accept that was the way it was going to be and pretend it is ok! It is not ok! It is not ok to accept this and it is not ok to assume my wife and myself must dock up 10k and more each time to go visit them as it will not be done from their side to here. This is the only way she sees her family, if WE go there! \n\nI suppose I am an ass, I don’t regret what I said, perhaps just how and when and to whom I said it! Mind you, if I had the chance I’d say it the same way personally, but I have boycotted the visits, I refuse. You want visits, save up and come here! Ironically enough as I write this I don’t to message arguments and such, I prefer face to face! \n\nSo drunk me blurted all these things out and some!\n\nPatiently waiting for that phone call coming my way!

      "description": "Some backstory: My GF and I have been dating for about 8 months. We started dating when she and her ex-BF were on a break in the relationship. At the time we started dating they were still living in the same apartment and her ex-BF was not happy that she broke up with him and started dating me. Neither of them were financially able to leave and find a new place to rent immediately so they both had to live with each other as roommates for a while.\n\nThose few months were the most awkward and strangest times because her ex-BF thought she was just trying to get him jealous and play with his emotions. He still considered himself her \"real\" boyfriend and I am just that guy in the way because he believes she should have never broken up with him because they were on a unofficial \"break\". \n\nAll that fuckery aside, it all culminated 2 months later when he was about to go travel to see his parents and he asked my GF to give him a handjob before he goes. She told me about what he said and I tried to go to speak to him but she stopped me from doing so because it would jeopardize her living situation because honestly I would have got physical with him. \n\nFast forward a month later and she's finally able to move out and we are so glad that we don't have to deal with her ex-BF anymore. Or so I thought because a few months later she began telling me about how she wants to go out and see him again as a \"friend\". I immediately told her how uncomfortable I am with that idea and that I don't support that decision. She got disappointed with my answer and she tried telling me to let go of the past and move on but I still held firm in my beliefs. \n\nShe told me she feels discouraged from seeing him again because I don't support her decision and I feel uncomfortable with it but she's making it seem like I am forcing her not to see him. In the end I told her it's her choice but I let her know up front it will cause a strain in our relationship. She said she just sees him as an old friend and she doesn't get why I feel so badly about her seeing him because she says that she no romantic feelings towards him at all. \n\nThen she said she won't go see him \"right now\" since she thinks I am just being jealous/ not trusting her/ being a controlling boyfriend. That somehow later I will change my mind on it but I made it clear won't ever. That only led her to say that I am not \"allowing\" her to have friends and that she feels controlled on who she can see. \n\n\nI can't really see how I am controlling her here so IATA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my family I moved out? [Update/More info -- long]",
      "description": "So we had a brief discussion about how I went about notifying the family I'm moving out. My sister said she felt as though I had lied to her. I don't get this. **In October, we sat down and talked. At this point she was fully aware I was planning to move out in or before January 2019.** Roughly 2 weeks ago I told her I was looking at apartments; I got approved and signed over the weekend. I just have to turn on my lights and I'm gone. \n\n[More information was requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a4bwzl/aita_for_not_telling_my_family_i_moved_out/?st=jpj68z5t&amp;sh=4551f5c7);\n\nDuring the time I've spent here:\n\n* For a brief moment we were pooling money for groceries. They asked for $150 from me which I gladly gave! However, when we were at the store they wouldn't buy me a $5 fruit bowl. Instead, they spent $40 on sushi for themselves. They later showed me the receipt explaining the cost until I pointed out they were including the items they bought for their own personal use. \n* They consistently locked me out of the apartment. Its happened a few times in the rain and a once at midnight. (we don't live in a safe area). Its not by accident or occasionally, they will lock the top lock and wait until I asked to be let in. On average I was locked out for 5-20 minutes at a time.\n* They've told me I would have to pay extra for the privilege to lock my door.\n* When they ask me to buy a product, its usually the more costly name brand. When they have to replace a product, its the generic brand or a smaller version of the product. \n* They ran 2-3 loads of laundry every day, while I washed 1-2 loads on the weekends. For a while we took turns buying detergent but it didn't seem reasonable to me. I would purchase the large Tide 100-load boxes which they would use up in two weeks. \n* She'll enter my room when I'm not home to mess with my cat, then complain about the cat's claws and tell me she needs to be declawed. The cat has not scratched the carpet or any furniture in the room.\n* They made me replace the items she needed to clean her dog's urine off the floor. She used 1/2 the box of laundry detergent to clean the carpet, and told me I was \"nickle and dime-ing her\" and it was \"my turn anyway\" to replace the detergent. I had cats and didn't want to replace something i didn't use, and something she used on her dog's urine. \n* They've told me I was delusional and selfish for wanting to live on my own. I had an issue with my finances earlier in the year and they used this against me, asking how would I have gotten through it if I had to pay rent at the same time.\n\nThings I've been douchy about: \n\n* They told me to declaw my cat, **I fully admit, I agreed to do this**, but was never going to follow through. Once I received a deadline letting me know I had to declaw the cat or they would take her to a shelter I signed for whatever apartment approved me. I put the cat in boarding over the weekend and once I was approved, I told her that day.\n* I had a sense of entitlement when it came to paying the utilities. They had a benefit that allowed them to live rent free (none of my business, but relevant information), but I was paying them $200/mo. They asked for $145 for utilities. I didn't want to do this but did pay anyway.\n* They changed the wifi password and were going to request more money from me (I overheard the conversation). I already pay $145 in utilities. I reset the router when they left and continued using the wifi. \n* My bank doesn't have any ATM's in the area so we use an app for paying rent. She began asking for cash which is a hassle for me, and I did have a bad attitude about this. \n* I *was* paying rent late before, and began paying early/on time. Though I was getting the hang of getting to my banks ATM and paying early/on time they asked for a $50 late fee, with $10 every day after. I felt entitled, since she is family and living rent free she shouldn't be charging me this much for being late. This is entitlement and I know this now. \n\nMSC/Irrelevant\n\n* I'm 20 and have always lived with parents or family. I want to get out and *live* without someone breathing down my back or questioning everything I do.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr **I'm shitty and they are too, but AITA?**",

      "description": "I have a 12 year old nephew, my BIL’s son, who is…..big. And I don’t just mean tall. My MIL has told me that when she would take him for doctor visits, the doctors would pull her out of his hearing to tell her that he needs to lose some weight. He’s 12 and wears 2X mens shirts. I don’t know his exact height but it’s around 5”4 and the last time he mentioned his weight, he was 189 pounds and has gained more since then (that was about a year ago). He has a “hump”, a mass of flesh between his shoulders at the base of his neck that has caused a “crease” in the skin on the back of his neck, which has recently started to look darker than the surrounding skin.  One good thing about the family is that they have never shamed my nephew or made any (that I know of) disparaging remarks about his size. Quite the opposite. I’m afraid in the effort to not give him a complex about his size, they may have gone a little too far in the other direction. It’s like he sees himself as a slender reed in a field of lumpy, round potatoes.\n\nWell, the other day my nephew came over by himself. My husband was in the living room and I was at the kitchen table scouring Pinterest for healthy dinner ideas. Nephew asks me what I’m doing and I tell him. “I’m looking for some healthy dinner recipes.” Then he asks me the dreaded question….”Do you think I’m fat?” Now the truth is I try not to think of people in terms of “fat” or “skinny”, but instead of healthy or unhealthy. So this is what I told him “ I don’t think of people in terms of fat or skinny. I try to look at things being either healthy or unhealthy.” I was just trying to keep it vague, but he said he didn’t understand. So I told him that some people that look “skinny” can have some very unhealthy habits and some people that look “heavier” can be perfectly healthy. So he asked me if I thought he was healthy. So I said “I think everyone in this family, myself included, could be making better health choices.” I then changed the subject and asked him about school and a little bit later, he decided to go back to my inlaws.\n\nWell, about 20 minutes later my FIL shows up. Apparently, nephew came into their house crying and told them that I said he was fat. My husband told him what I had said and that I never even said the word fat. My FIL shrugged and said he figured it was a misunderstanding. My husband also mentioned that he didn’t care for how my nephew lied and he felt that needed to be addressed, but my FIL dismissed it, saying “Oh, you know how dramatic he is,”. Then he said he had to go because BIL was on his way to pick up nephew for a visit. On the ride to BIL’s house,  Nephew also told BIL that I called him “fat” and all hell broke loose. BIL has called my husband, demanding that I apologize to nephew for calling him fat.\n\nAITA for saying we could all be making healthier choices to my overweight nephew?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was not diagnosed until recently, earlier this year to be exact. Before this time, I didn't really know what I didn't know. I struggle with identifying emotional needs and then meeting those needs. That's a huge deal. Until my diagnosis, my wife apparently just thought I was kind of a selfish dick. I'm a good person at heart, and I do a lot of things to show this, so I imagine she had some cognizant dissonance, else she probably would have just dropped me like a bad habit, rightfully so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've constantly been working on this, moreso, and more effectively since my diagnosis. I am becoming more and more aware and really working hard to improve my capacity to meet her needs. I love my wife very much and I love the family we have built. I recognize I have weaknesses and am trying to learn to accommodate those while also playing to my strengths. I'd say things in our relationship are better right now than they have been since before we had children (which I credit to having massively less amounts of stress in our lives).   \n\n\nThe reason for the background information, is that one of the things my wife has complained about is feeling that her hopes and dreams took a back seat to mine. In reality, the way it played out, they have...in my mind, I think, \"If you would have just told me you wanted to do XYZ we could have done it!\"... She says there was never a point in our life where she felt like she had the ability to do that, as my needs seem to have engulfed our life.  Thanks Autism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is correct. I would do anything for her and am willing to make sacrifices for her, even moreso now that I recognize how much it has been neglected. So, back to the matter at hand. She wants to do foster care. This is something that I have zero interest in, never have. However, it's not something I am against. I think it's a wonderful thing. It means the world to my wife, so yes, I have agreed to do it. We had to take a classes over a few weekends to get licensed. We weren't able to go to them together as someone had to be here to watch our children, so she took her classes first, and then I took mine a few months later, every Saturday for a few weeks. My wife was married previously to a man who also agreed to do the foster care, but when the time came to take a placement, he backed out and said he had only done it to make her happy...which is a terrible thing to do, but I believe this fear is something she still harbors, and its understandable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have since become licensed foster parents. (Resource parents is the correct term now I think). We had a family member's child, who had been taken into custody, living with us for a few weeks before we were licensed. She is now with another family member. Since being licensed we have done respite care for a \\~8 year old girl who also has autism...the stays have ranged from a weekend to 2 weeks. My daughter has had a real hard time adjusting to the respite placement when she is here. I don't know if it is specific to that girl or just someone cramping my kid's style in general. To be fair, that girl was up her butt constantly and my daughter prefers her space.  \n\n\nSo, we currently do not have a placement with us. My wife is pregnant (due in June). She suffers from Hyperemessis (I have no clue how to spell this...it's like morning sickness, but on steroids...she is sick all day every day, struggles to stay hydrated and to eat enough...constant danger of losing too much weight). I try to do what I can to help. My struggles with executive function (thanks again Autism) make what I can do, not quite as much as I or she would like. We're always behind on housework for example. I say we, I mean I am always behind on housework, for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to bedtime, my daughter does not sleep well at all. On a given night, she doesn't go to bed until midnight, sometimes as late as 3 am (thanks Autism again). In b4 suggestions for getting her to sleep....we have tried everything short of sleeping medication, which I am not comfortable giving a child. Generally melatonin helps the most. Regardless, I opt to stay up with her so my wife can sleep as I feel she needs it more than I do....so every night I am up at least until midnight, usually later. It's not just hanging out with my daughter either. We do get to spend a lot of cuddle time, but much of it is her being super upset because she wants to sleep but can't...laying down, thrashing, popping up and running about, crying, rinse and repeat. It's exhausting. This then compounds the above executive function issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the morning comes, my wife lets me sleep usually until she needs my help with something, bless her....but I still wake up thoroughly beaten and exhausted from the anxiety + stress of the night before. But, we're making do...we are improving, I am finding and practicing ways to work around my shortcomings. She actually told me yesterday \"You have been such a big help this pregnancy and I really appreciate it\"  which made my heart swell, because in the previous pregnancies a complaint was that I did not do enough to try to help out and make her time easier....I always wanted to, I just did not recognize how. So this little thing, is a big thing for me. I have an appointment to begin seeing a counselor the second week in January, which I am very optimistic is just going to help me further with ways to cope and work with my adversity. So on the whole, things are looking up....now comes the real issue (sorry but I think the background info was important)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday we received a call from DHS. They have two brothers that need to be placed. a 3 month old baby and a 2 year old boy. DHS says the 2 year old has no behaviors that would be dangerous to our children, which we both have agreed would be a deal-breaker. They said the children have a family member who 'might' take them....I learned from my class and asking my own questions that DHS will say anything above the law to get a child placed, and making us feel like it might be temporary is a tactic that is often used. The children are coming from a different foster home where they have already been for a month. They were taken from their parents for substance abuse. I don't believe this would be a short-term placement. The other foster parent who the children would be coming from is dealing with some health issues, which is why she is not keeping the children herself. Fair enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my wife asks if we can take them. My mind is flooded with a billion thoughts. I know she wants to. \"I want to have a baby to snuggle and I think our son would love having a buddy to play with.\"....those are true statements, and I understand them. I'm a super logical person, and to be honest, what I am thinking is the following:  \n\n\nWe currently have our hands full with our two kids, mostly due to my own shortcomings, which I am working hard to improve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou (wife) are so sick all the time..most days you take a nap while I watch the kids so you can get a break. There's no way I am going to be able to properly care for 3 children and an infant while also doing my work (I work from home...moved my computer right into the kitchen so i can work while watching/playing with my kids, so my wife can try to get some rest)  \n\n\nOur kids don't sleep...my son goes to bed around 9pm, my wife sleeps with him, and he wakes up a few times during the night. I am up with my daughter anywhere from 12-3am. Now add two more children, one being an infant to that mix....  \n\n\nI feel like my wife is thinking of the positive things but not considering the very real negative things. I feel like if it was one of these children...either just the baby or just the 2 year old, it would be tough but we could handle it and adjust. I expressed these fears to her and she listened, and even said \"yes, I think those are valid concerns.\" and I even expressed that I don't want her to think I'm leading her on, getting licensed just to make her happy but not taking any children (as I've said, we've had a respite placement already, and if this was just one child, I really believe I would have been uncomfortable (thanks autism) but I would have done it, because I know what it means to her and I know it would be ok). She said she knew that is not what I was doing.  \n\n\nSo I said, \"I don't think it's a good idea to take a 2 year old and a 3 month old right now. I think it would be too much stress on our family.\"  \n\n\n\"So that is how I feel. But if you truly believe it is a good idea and it is so meaningful to you, if you want to do it, I will support you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueue nuclear disaster.  \n\n\nNow she is extremely pissed off. Told me that her dreams are not important to me and that everything is about me. That I make all the decisions and she gets no say, that she's never going to be able to do the things she wants to do, etc, etc.\"  \n\n\nI asked her if she would feel this way still if they had called with one child...she said , \"Yes because you would have said no to that to",

      "description": "So with two kids (7 and 9) in sports and a full time IT job I barely have any time. I started reading about how some successful people get up early and go to the gym or the office to get ahead or even just stay on top of stuff. So I started setting my alarm at 5 on vibrate and doing the same. So far it works well for me - I go to the gym, put in a full day, and then have time at night for the family. This was happening for about three weeks. I was always very careful to be quiet so as not to wake the kids, and would sneak out.\nThen my wife one morning had a meltdown, started yelling at stuff about how she couldn't do this, it's too early, etc. She also works full time in IT. I wasn't turning on the lights or making noise, but just the vibration of the alarm is too much and then she claims she can't go back to sleep.\nAm I being unreasonable here? ",

      "description": "So I like to debate topics. I’ve never been on the debate team or anything, but I find it to be a lot of fun. I’ve brought up topics with my girlfriend and when I see that she has a differing opinion I try and debate with her about it. In the past, she has told me that I get too into it and it feels like I am talking down to her and not listening. I apologized for that and told her I would watch that in the future. Keeping that in mind, I tried to start another debate while watching my tone to make sure I wasn’t belittling her. Unfortunately, this didn’t seem to work and she started to get upset. At this point, I wasn’t sure what about the way I was speaking was bothering her. Even though I like debating, I hate actually fighting. These discussions aren’t worth it to me if it devolves into hurt feelings. Because of this, I apologized again and told my GF that I wouldn’t debate with her anymore because I didn’t like what they turn into. Apparently this was the worst decision I could have made because it just made her even angrier. She said that she didn’t want it to feel like there were things I couldn’t talk to her about and that it made me seem fake. Now, I can see where she is coming from with this. To me though, it just doesn’t seem worth it to have these debates if it’s just gonna lead to a fight. It’s not like it’s a discussion that needs to happen that I’m keeping from her. I only start them for fun, and the result is anything but fun. So why would I keep doing it?\n\n\nAm I wrong for this? Should I keep debating her but watch my tone even more? ",

      "description": "My grandma has lived with my family since before I was born. She’s in her eighties now, and she’s gotten progressively worse in manners as she’s aged. She complains about her son- my father- to her friends constantly, despite the fact that he’s been supporting her and caring for her for decades. When we moved into the house we currently live in, she immediately demanded the master suite because she said she needed her privacy. My parents acquiesced. The suite is on the second floor and the kitchen is on the first. My grandmother complained incessantly that she didn’t want to walk up and down the stairs just to get food from the fridge, so my father bought her a fridge for her room- it’s sitting there now, completely unused. She still complains that she doesn’t like walking up and down the stairs. My dad bought her a small oven to keep in her room. It hasn’t been used. The master suite has a bathroom with a shower- she uses the only other bathroom in the house (that the rest of us use) more than anyone else. About a month ago, she complained to my father that she felt unwelcome in our house (I fucking wonder why) and she asked that my father buy her a house- not an apartment or a condo, but a $289K house across the street from ours. Not three days after his application for a loan got approved and his offer on the house got approved, she burst into tears and asked why he was forcing her to move out. He objected, saying that it was her idea, but she said he shouldn’t have let her force him into making the purchase.\n\nI know that the elderly don’t always think rationally and that parents deserve a lot from their kids, but am I an asshole for really, REALLY not liking my grandma?",

      "title": "AITA for ignoring a friend on my birthday?",
      "description": "Yesterday was my 21st birthday and I wasn't very excited for it this year. This is mainly due to the fact that all my friends have gone back to university due to classes starting on the 7th on January. Because I am on a co-op term, I have to stay in my home city which is hours away from my university. Basically, I'll have no friends to hang out with this year. \n\nBut y'see, I joined this nifty online Discord community so I thought that I would still be able to spend time with some close online friends. Unfortunately for me, many of them are also busy with school and exams and whatnot. However, one of my closer friends, let's refer to her as Sam, doesnt study a lot and spends most of her time playing League of Legends, which I also play with her often. So my birthday hits, I finish work and get home at 7pm where I expect to find Sam online. I see her playing some League of Legends as expected and I ask if she wants to play with me after I finish dinner. She agrees so I promptly head out to dinner so I can finish quicker and have time to play with her. Note: I sleep at 10:30pm due to an early work schedule and Sam is aware of this fact.\n\nSo I finish my birthday dinner and am heading back at around 8pm. I message her to reconfirm that she's available to play with me once I get home. She confirms this fact and I head home. So I get home at around 8:20 and I give Sam a call. She doesn't pick up so I wait in the empty call by myself for a couple minutes before me messages me saying that she will be home in a bit. I'm a bit taken aback by this because I wasn't even aware that she had gone out. So I just so \"ok\" and go watch some youtube for a bit. So fast forward half an hour and Sam has not messaged me since. I ask her what's up and she says she's still not home yet. At around 9pm, she finally msgs me to tell me she's home so I give her a call and get prepared to spend the rest of the day playing some League of Legends with Sam. Before she picks up she messages me \"if ur too tired you can sleep and we can play another time\". I'm completely dumbstruck by that statement and I got the impression that she lowkey didnt want to play so I quickly hang up the call. She notices that and tries to recover by saying \"Oh unless you want to play today\" but I'm not having any of it. Her lack of apologies for being late, lack of notice for her absence, and implying I sleep off my birthday pissed me off. I log off discord and am in such a bad state that I go to get some alcohol. It seems a bit pathetic but I was lonely and bored so I didn't really care at that point that I was drinking alone. Sam calls my phone a couple times and I ignore them and continue drinking because at that point we would only be able to squeeze 2 or 3 games in and in the mood I was in they wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I spent the rest of the day drinking my sorrows away.\n\nI wake up today and log back in on discord and I get a message from Sam saying \"let's play league today!\". I tell her I wanted to play league yesterday but she replies saying that it was my fault we didn't play League because I ignored her calls and whatnot. We argue for a bit with her saying I misunderstood her message and me just getting pissed at her for what she did yesterday. She puts the blame on me and gives a sarcastic apology for her actions such as \"sorry I cant teleport home\". AITA for jumping to conclusions quickly and having too high expectations?",

      "description": "Hi everyone.\n\nFirst off all; English isn't my first language, sorry for misspellings, sorry for bad formatting(still don't get it).\n\nI’m posting this for a good friend of mine (age 60+) who isn't into the internet as I am, being 17YO.\n\nSome Background info:\n\nAlso, our prime-school is at the end of a cul-de-sac, the secondary-school being at the southern side of it.\nAnd the Church is to the north uphill at the intersection to the main-road.\nThere are Parking lots on both sides, with a bigger parking space in front of the gym at the end of the road.\nThere’s also some law involved, but its not that important, aaand I’m restricted on characters…\n\nSo, to the Story; about two weeks ago, Anne drove to our local church.\nShe's my villages priest(protestant-church) and hit a marten whilst parking.\nIt slipped out a mousehole in front of the car.\nBill was there. He is our schools caretaker.\n\nMy good friend = Bill\n\nOur town priest = Anne\n\nSo now there was a marten lying beside the car.\nBleeding.\nBreathing.\nClearly done for.\n\nAnne was aggrieved.\nShe strokes the martens head and sent a prayer to the skies.\nBill sent Anne to sit on the hillside, what she did.\nThen Bill quickly realised, that this poor animal is done for.\nSo Bill made a quick look around, took a small stick and looked towards Anne.\nShe looked back and knew what he was up to.\nShe just said \"Do it. He can't be saved. Just make it quick\".\nSo Bill took a second look around, to reassure that no one was watching, hauled off and hit the marten on the head.\nFor comparison; The marten was pretty big, clocking in at around 15kg(33lbs) and a body-length of about 1m(3.2ft).\nThat is massive for such an animal.\nThat is the size and weight of a big cat.\n\nThe marten was dead now.\nThen, it was bound to happen, a child from Prime-school saw Bill killing the marten and then throwing the stick into the woods on the hillside.\nPolice got involved and Bill got discharged from school-keeping duties.\nAnne put in a good word for him.\n\nI think Bill was in the right to do that, I mean...\n\nThe marten was already quite dead, and it would have only suffered, if they waited for the police and a vet to come.\n\nOn the other hand, Bill broke a law and is now in question of animal-cruelty.\n\nBut it would have been crueller to let the poor animal suffer, and Anne reassured Bill to do it.\n\nBut Bill wasn't allowed to kill an animal.\n\nBut...\n\nHuhmm...\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIs Bill the Ass for killing that fatally injured animal?\n\nEven the vet said; \"due to the accident-induced injuries, the marten was done for. I would have killed him to!\"\n\nPlease let me know in the comments what you're thinking.",

      "description": "So a couple of months ago I was told that my friend had been accused of sexual harassment. I never heard anything about it from him but it was pretty obvious something had happened. He had left the local football team and also had come back from college after everything had come out. I’d heard it from multiple people and pretty much everyone in the village believed he’d done it. I felt like I couldn’t bring it up to him and still haven’t. A bit more recently I found that he was taking anti depressants and also that apparently the case didn’t go to court due to lack of evidence. This made me feel guilty over trying to distance myself from him but it didn’t stop me. Despite him being my friend for years he had been a real asshole to some of my other friends. Just to make things more complicated for me he’s also started acting much nicer recently to me and my friends making it hard for me to ignore him.\n\nTLDR: My friend was accused of something but didn’t go to court and I am treating him as if he was found guilty.",

      "description": "I have a friend who seems to have no respect for anyone's time. Yesterday, after not hanging out for months he invited me to grill steaks and watch a game at his place. I know he's usually late for everything, so I gave him a little extra time since his set time was an \"around\" time. I get there and the grill isn't set up, and while his car is in the drive he doesn't answer the door or the phone. I send him a message letting him know I was there and that I'm kinda pissed. I get a call I ignored and a sob story text seven hours after I get home. He passed out, and he'd like to hang out but everybody suddenly needs him and he just wants one day off. The last time we tried to hang out he forgot he'd already agreed to hang out with his girlfriend. He told me that two hours into me waiting for him, then told me if I waited another hour he thought she might not show. I never heard back from him that night, so I guess she did. Dude does this for other shit, too. I'm super grateful he's around to help when I have car trouble, but the guy once told me he'd be there around five to help me and I didn't see his ass until 9:30. He had been texting and calling the whole time about how he was \"on his way\" but apparently he hadn't gotten out of bed and kept falling back asleep. Other friends have written this guy off and I don't want to do that, but it makes me feel like a huge asshole lecturing him when he pulls this shit.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting a larger room instead of my brother?",
      "description": "We're moving house soon, and we'll finally all be able to have our own bedrooms. I am currently the only one with my own room, but it's a tiny, claustrophobic office meant for just a desk that we put a bed in because the only alternative was sleeping in the bath. I can touch both walls easily at the same time. My younger brothers share the largest bedroom of the house, which can fit both of their beds, a large wardrobe, a large 6-drawer chest of draws, a double-desk, chairs and extra floor space left over. Compare that to my room which can just about fit my bed, my cramped desk, a small ikea 3-drawer chest of drawers and a bedside table for a lamp.\n\nIn the new house, there's one small room (not much bigger than what I've got now) and two medium rooms. One of the medium rooms is already taken since one of my brothers has severe sensory processing disorder and can't cope with small spaces. This leaves the small room and the medium room. \n\nIn the house we have now, I gave up the larger room for my brothers. I've also spent the majority of my life caring for them and looking after them, since one has severe autism and SPD, and the other has incredibly mild/high-functioning autism, and there have been things going on with my parents (not going to get into it now) that meant that for most of my life they've needed my help to look after my siblings. I've given up so much for them, even dropped out of college so that I could spend more time looking after them. Because of that, I've spent the last 3 and a half years balancing looking after them and teaching myself the qualifications I need to get into university for the course I want. I get a small benefit income from the local council due to my situation preventing me from being able to get a job, but even then I give up most of my income to pay for things they want or need.\n\nMy high-functioning brother has said he'd be fine with the smaller room multiple times in the family conversations we've had about the new house, but he's still insisting on the larger room. I know it's petty and selfish and that because I'm older, I should let him have it, but I gave up the larger room in this house for them, and have given up so much over the course of my life for him. I just want a bigger room and some more space. \n\nIt'd also be great because it would offer more privacy than I have now. The room I'm in now is directly opposite the bottom of the stairs and my siblings regularly come running downstairs and charge straight into my room, regardless of what I may be doing; if I'm asleep, if I'm getting dressed, if I'm just out of the shower, if I'm trying to work for my exams. Because I'm the oldest and because I've spent a long time helping to look after them, if my parents are busy they come to me for everything. But the larger room in the new house has a door sturdy enough for a simple lock, something I've been wanting for a long time because the door I have now isn't strong enough for one and the majority of my family doesn't knock.\n\nI will (hopefully) be moving away to university in around 8 months' time, so I'd only be using the larger room for those 8 months, and then he can have it and I'll happily stay in the small room for the few weeks a year that I visit. But the rooms at uni are (obviously) small as well. It'd just be nice to have a larger room for once and some more space/privacy, even if it's just for a few months before I move.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting that room?",

      "description": "So I live in an apartment with a shared laundry room, we have two washers and two dryers but one of the washers is down so we only have one at the moment.  I went down earlier and saw the one washer was in use but only had 12 minutes left so I figured I'd run to the grocery store and pick up a few things and by the time I got back the washer would be free. The trip to the grocery store and back probably took about 15-20 minutes. When I got back the wash cycle was finished but the clothes were still in there. I debated waiting longer but I didn't really want to stand around in the laundry room or carry all my things back upstairs so I started taking the clothes out and putting them on the dryer. An older women then enters through the fire exit and yells \"Are you taking my clothes out? Don't ever touch my clothes they haven't even been in there long!\" I just apologized and stepped aside so she could finish taking her clothes out. The entire time she is ranting at me that \"younger people have no respect, you're rude and entitled, how dare you touch someone else's clothes I don't want you messing with my things don't ever touch my things\" I apologized again which was met with \"You better be sorry I should make you wash these again since you put them on the dirty washer\" I just kinda stood there silently putting my clothes in the washer until she left.  So AITA for taking someone's things out of the washer, I've seen and done it before in college but maybe real world etiquette is different?",

I was happy! But then, some months after that, she started popping up on his screen again, something I would see if we were e.g. browsing reddit together. Her profile was the first suggested one on his intstagram searches. He said it was nothing but I thought he seemed a bit guilty. I was uncomftorbale but tried to just forget about it and trust him. I am not forcing him to be in this realtionship so if he doesn’t want it he would just end it, right? \n\nThe night before I left we got high, and he was in the shower. I don’t know how I suddenly overcame that boundary but I checked his instagram. And of course, the next to last person he wrote with was his ex. It went something like him writing that she looks hot in this picture she posted and her replying «Dont you have a girldfriend?» His response was «Nah we’re on a break.» I felt so bad for invading his privacy like that so I put the phone away and said nothing. I think I will have to admit it when I go back home tho, as it still bothers me. ",

I mean, they feed me and keep me clothed, but they've never spent time with me. My earliest memory is me just playing with toys by myself while the T.V is on. So yea, not very attentive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when my sister was born, they would realize their mistake and be better, right? \n\nWrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will admit fully that I don't really sit her down and teach her math. I mostly just spend time with her by playing tag, make-believe, and all other games you play with kids. My parents, were absent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently they've began to complain. They're always emotionally abusive but they found new ways to be abusive. They say it's **MY** fault for not spending any time with her. They say the reason she gets bad grades on her homework is because **I'm** not attentive. When I try to adress this, they say that They're busy and they work hard for my sister and I. Come Saturday, They'll leave for a shpping trip and come back at 10 or 11. \\\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my sister has a speech disorder and is a **VERY** late bloomer. I try to help her, but I'm only 13. I really can't do much. Maybe I should be more attentive and my parents are right. Maybe my parents just aren't attentive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm the Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Alright, im quite sure im doing right but i want some other perspective on this particular event.\n\nI have a good friend since around 10 years. \nWe always hang out and did alot of stuff. But mostly we chilled, smoked alot of weed and drunk.\nNot only, we had quite a normal life too, skiing, go swimming and stuff.\nSo i had my first girlfriend around 6 years ago, i made a big mistake then with having no contact for around half a year, well he also never called me. We got back together and everything was good. \nMy gf then cheated on me. It was not that heartbreaking for some reasons.\nThen a year later i had my next gf. Damn she was the love of my life, she was younger and yes, she maybe wasnt his kind of person, but also there he never really invited us two, always just me. Never asked and other things you do (like i learned the last some months).\n\nAgain, i got cheated, and damn it broke me, never had such pain. He was there to have drinks and calling her a stupid bitch n stuff. Had an other good friend who really talked with me for hours.\n\nAlright, we had a nice summer, made bbq and going on the lake like before.\n\nSo in october i met my now SO, she is the first one whos older than me and really stable in life with amazing morals. I learn alot from her like she also does from me. We want to grow.\nI had a very weird life till last year.\n\nSince then they met twice, both in disco and he, drunked.\nShe has ADS and is a very active personality, he on the otherhand is more the chiller and likes to talk stupid things. \"he hadnt a girlfriend for the last 11 years\"\nI learnd from the past and call him atleast once or twice a week. Yes i dont have as much time like before, but thats normal, isnt it.\nSo my SO told me, why he never asks about her, why he doesnt accept our invitations... She never was so bad intigradet from her ex's friends.\nI havent said anything against him, all these years, even he talks bad behind my back, and also always talking bad about his others friend. He cant say, listen buddy, thats fucked up from you. We all now he does that.\n\nSo i told him that he should accept her and give it a shot, yes i was high but that makes it count less.\nSo we went skiing last week and he again made 2-3 stupid comments about my relationship with my new SO. As he asked me what im doing tonight and i said im meeting with her, he moaned like he kinda does always.\n\nSo i sent a really long text to him, i never did that, guess nobody ever did that to him... I was friendly, not judging himbut showing these things and also critizizing myself for my past.\n\nHe didnt answered till two days ago, when his triangle relationship girl who he fucked with(she has a bf) and he always talks bad about them.\nSHE texted me on his whatsapp i should shame me and im not a good friend.\nYesterday i tried to go up on his home with some beer. He was at home, but didnt open.\nI let the beer there and now waiting till HE is answering...\n\nSorry for such long story, thanks for any reply.\n\n",

      "description": "I just turned 30 and since I was 11 I pretty much knew I was gay. With that correlation, I also knew there would come a time when my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles would start asking about wife, kids etc. Now, outside of my high school prom, they've never seen me with a women and I don't even talk about my friends with them.\n\nThe conversation of me being gay has never come up but they are very homophobic and have made disgusting remarks about gay people. I personally don't plan on coming out to them because it's a headache and drama I don't want. But I do plan on becoming as distant as possible and lowering the number of times I interact with them I order to have my won life.\n\nRecently, the subject of me getting married and having kids came up again and I bluntly had to tell them to stop asking about my personal life because that's a part of me I wont be sharing with anyone except the person I'm seeing.  That includes getting married and or having children. Some family members were shocked and upset by what I said but I don't see the big deal.",

      "description": "I live in a 3BR 1BA house with a couple. I have one bedroom, the couple has the master bedroom, and all other space (including the spare bedroom) is shared. I have 1 dog and they have 1 dog. I have a covered parking space on the property and they have an uncovered space. We agreed at move in to split rent $950 me, $1,250 them based on this.\n\nAfter moving in, the couple decided to have a baby (this was not discussed with me prior to moving in). They are taking over the spare bedroom for a nursery (72 SF of 2,200 SF of the house)\n\nThe couple only wants to reduce my rent by $50 for the additional space they’re using (this is less than the per SF cost of the guest room they are taking), and to make no rent changes due to the new baby. They argue that paying more rent on account of baby would be unfairly punitive to them, and that if I have anything major going on (like an exam to study for) they will try to take the baby out of the house so that I am not disturbed. I feel that I will regularly be disturbed (my bedroom shares a wall with nursery where the baby will sleep from age 6 mos. onwards), that this is a fundamental change to the occupants of the house/our living arrangement on which rent is based, and that my rent should be more significantly reduced because of this.

      "description": "For some context. He is 30, I am 24. If my mother hadn't told me that he turned 30 recently I doubt I would have been able to write his age down now. That is how little I care about him nowadays. In the past when I was still sharing a household with him until I was 21, he has been constantly annoying me. I have told him countless times that what he does, annoys me tremendously. I occasionally yelled at him when his actions drove me crazy. He was very possessive, tried to control my decisions, constantly criticizing the things I did in a non constructive way and actively went out of his way to interrupt me in whatever I was doing. To be honest, there is not a single positive memory I share with him. None whatsoever. \n\nNowadays, I live alone in my own apartment trying to interact with him as little as possible. Some years have passed since I lived with him together. I think if you had asked me whether or not I hate him a few years ago I would have responded with a resounding and immediate yes. Now I just dislike him and ignore him. \n\nNow to current day. Occasionally I visit my parents over the weekend and whenever he is there as well, he tries to talk to me. I usually ignore it. I have heard from my mother that he has been telling her that he tries to get close to me again and that I have been ignoring all of his attempts and that it breaks his heart a little bit. \n\nAm I the asshole for having 0 interest in trying to bond with him? Like I said earlier, I have no positive memory of him in the 21 years I shared a household with him. Not when I was living together with my parents. Not when I moved out and moved in with my other brother and him. \n\n",

If it means anything, I'm asexual and my brother and his gf know it\n\nI'm staying with my brother because the company I worked for went under. I spend most of my day applying for jobs, but shits hard in my city and I'm really grateful to my brother for letting me sleep on his couch (hell it's a comfortable ass couch)\n\nThe first week I was there I got 'home' and grab a beer and relax and my brother comes home. We make talk about our day and later his gf comes home (they live together) and grabs him by the shirt and basically caveman drags him back to the bedroom. Since then they've fucked 3-4 times a week I don't really keep track, but I feel so fucking awkward. it's weird when you know what your brother is into..\n\nanyway I asked after a couple weeks of this if they could do it when I'm not around and he apologized but told me he's not gonna change how he does stuff in his own house. Fair enough, I guess. I know your girl makes you shine her boots (??is that actually a kink) and tells you to slap her so hard she needs a neck brace and I'm not judging but it's really LOUD. it doesn't even sound like sex, she says something ridiculous like that and all I hear is giggles from her it's so weird\n\nHe's been with his girlfriend for a year, she's a real sweet girl but she has the mouth of a sailor, it can really give a guy whiplash tbh but I don't really have an issue with it, I think she didn't mean to be so harsh because it's just the way she is but she came up to me the next day and called me an asshole. Said I don't have the right to dictate what she does \"in her own fucking house\", said I'm not her fucking dad, told me to gtfo if I don't like it\n\nI told my brother his gf was out of line and she basically had a meltdown and told me she has plenty of dildos if I need to replace the stick in my ass with \"something better\" and said I need to get laid and not \"fucking worry what she's doing with (brother)\"\n\nI don't fucking care what they do!!! the problem is I can hear everything!! how can i stay out of their business if they make it my business??\n\nMy brother stepped in and told me he'd get me some headphones, but then his girlfriend went off again about how this is her house too and she didn't want \"your asshole brother\" here (it isn't even her house, my brother bought it) Now they're arguing over this and I feel bad but I don't think I was being  an asshole\n\ntldr brother's girlfriend is really mad that I asked them not to have loud sex while I'm in the house",

      "description": "At school today. During lunch I was talking with two of my friends, let’s call them Diego and Marcy. Diego has a sister, let’s call her Dora, who runs a mildly popular YouTube channel. We were talking about said channel, and from the conversations we’ve had it seems Diego isn’t very fond of his sister.\n\nSo I stretch my face around to look like Dora, and make fun of her intro. On normal occasions, I shouldn’t be mocking people, but we’re a group that mocks each other constantly.\n\nDiego immediately says, very angrily,\n“What did you just say?”\n\nI didn’t want to start any conflict, and it seemed Diego didn’t find it very funny, so I just kept my mouth shut. He asks three or four more times what I said, until Marcy says “I think he made fun of her intro.”\n\nDiego freaks out a bit. He says stuff like “Don’t make fun of my sister, shut up, it’s stupid to do that.” And all the usual stuff he says when he’s mad. I keep my mouth shut, but keep a smirk because I thought it was comical how much he was freaking out over it.\n\nDiego goes downstairs for something, (I thought he had finished classes for the day) so I Snapchat him, saying “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were so sensitive about it.” \n\nI kept thinking, and I thought it was unfair that Diego was basically gonna end our friendship just because I mocked his sister. I Snapchat him, “Let me say my side.” I begin typing, but before I finish he comes back upstairs, and absolutely flips his shit.\n\nDiego goes on for several minutes, saying most of the same things he said before, but yelling everything and making a scene in front of everyone there. I try my absolute hardest not to laugh or smile, and respect what he is saying. I can’t understand it because this is coming from someone who would has mocked disabled people that go to our school, and is always antagonizing the local homosexual furry. \n\nI also don’t know how Diego expects me to respect what he’s saying, when he never listens to me when I tell him to stop annoying other kids, or stop making fun of me or things I do. (He doesn’t do this often, but enough for me to get annoyed.)\n\nHe leaves. Marcy is upset with me, and only one teacher overheard the whole thing.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I’ll try to make this as short as possible. \n\nA few years back I met a wonderful guy (we’ll call him Henry) who had come to my city from another country to do an internship. We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can’t sponsor him bc it’s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we’re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn’t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we’ll call him Jake. Now I’m the type of person who doesn’t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don’t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I’m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that’s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He’s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I “lied about being married.” I explained to him many times why I didn’t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I’m a liar. Is he right? AITA",

      "title": "AITA For Causing Conflict in my Girlfriend's Family?",
      "description": "My (21M) girlfriend's (21F) parents are both from Lebanon, and since she was young, have wanted her to marry a Muslim, Lebanese man. I'm very much not that - I'm white as snow and irreligious. She doesn't want to follow their wishes and was able to break off a marriage her parents tried to arrange for her in the past.  \n\nCurrently, she's making a half-hearted attempt to keep our relationship a secret from them. They know when we're out together and pretty much every time she says she's going to hang out with me, they ask her if we're dating, and she's been denying it, but they essentially know. I'm not 100% comfortable with this, but in my mind it's her decision how to deal with this, and because I don't know her parents or their culture I've just let her do her thing. I've told her that we may as well just come clean at this point, but I haven't pushed the issue.  \nOf course, her parents aren't happy about this. They've yelled at her a few times over it and have generally expressed their displeasure. Thankfully they've never been violent. The worst that's happened is her dad tried to block her from leaving by standing in the door, but she just left through the back door.  \nShe says that she doesn't really care what her parents think or about her relationship with them, because as she has said, they try to control her and don't respect her. She's currently trying to move out but that may take a few months. Essentially, she's trying to avoid the drama of her openly dating a white guy until she moves out.  \nNow, my parents know all about this, and my dad has essentially labeled me the asshole for causing conflict in her family. Basically, he's told me that, unless I expect to marry her, I should break it off, because family is everything. I have no idea if I'll marry her - we've been dating for a solid four months. In my mind, if I don't marry her and it's not me who causes conflict, it'd be her next boyfriend, unless he's a Lebanese Muslim. (A relevant detail is that I'm her first boyfriend since the guy they tried to get her to marry, who lived on a different continent for 90% of their engagement)  \nSo I guess my question is twofold - AITA for facilitating her not telling her parents we're dating, and AITA for dating her in the first place when, even if it were open, it would cause conflict with her parents?  \nTl;Dr I'm dating a girl whose parents are Lebanese. She's trying (kinda) to keep it a secret, but her parents basically know, and they are not happy. AITA for helping her keep it a secret, and AITA for dating her in the first place if it causes conflict?",

      "title": "AITA for being angry about my partner’s plan to do drugs while I watch our kids?",
      "description": "So, my partner and I are not what you would call burners, by any stretch, but we do enjoy a drug-friendly lifestyle within reason. We have, on rare occasion, taken LSD or MDMA. We have a son and have always tried to make sure that he is safe and out of the house when we do it. We have not partaken in anything but a little bit of weed in over a year, as we had a new baby. Our daughter is now 8 months old and very attached to me, so she is with me 24/7.\n\nWe have had a pretty tough year and, when my partner lamented about not getting to take acid or MDMA recently, I suggested he buy some. He agreed and asked me to make contact with someone, so I did and worked everything out.\n\nHowever, my partner has now decided he wants to do this New Year’s Day. Our daughter is exclusively breastfed and we have no childcare so I cannot do it with him. We have plans with a friend in the morning, so his plan is to drop acid right after they leave around 1:00 PM and I will take care of the kids.\n\nI am very not okay with this. I don’t particularly want my 8 year old son exposed to it nor do I want to babysit my partner through his trip while also caring for our kids. I have demanded that he sequester himself to our bedroom, which he has agreed to do. \n\nI am very upset that my partner expects me to do this. He works 6 days out of the week, often 12+ hours a day, and we barely have any time for each other. It is the winter holidays so we have had family in and out of our home all week and it’s extremely anxiety-inducing me and I need some recuperation time with him, which I can’t get if he does this. I also am uncomfortable with him doing it without me, because we have nearly always done these things together or been with each other the whole time if one of us did it alone. Plus, I am a stay at home parent and spend the majority of my time with our kids and could use a break, or adult companionship at least.\n\nI hate the idea of being unable to spend time with my partner, whose behavior aggravates me when he is high and I am not. I hate the idea of not being able to sleep in my own bed and wrestling with a wiggly infant, who co-sleeps with me, on our sofa. And I hate the idea that I have to take my two kids out in the cold in an unreliable vehicle to drive an hour to pick up these drugs and an hour back. I could barely stand to talk while I drove him to work this morning, I was so angry at him and myself. I know it will likely put a sour mood on our plans with our friend, which is supposed to be a relaxing activity and will only further my resentment. Also, I am very paranoid about what this kind of recreational drug use might invite now that we have 2 children; I don’t want to do anything that might endanger our kids or land us in hot water. \n\nBut I do see that he needs and deserves a break. I don’t want to dictate how he spends the little free time he has and I know the family company we’ve had was also bad on his anxiety. It was also me who suggested the drugs in the first place and I feel shitty that I am having second thoughts about it now that he has made a plan. When I’d suggested it, I didn’t know he would want to do it on New Year’s Day. Also (and I haven’t brought this up to him) I bought him a very expensive gift for Christmas that I am still making payments on and he did not get me anything. I have reassured him that I did not need a gift for Christmas, but it would be nice if I could use the money to get something small for myself. I feel that’s petty to bring up, though.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting this? I can’t help but feel like I’m being unreasonable.",

      "description": "A bit of background - Me (27F) and my boyfriend (38F) have been together for about five years. Our relationship started while I was getting out of a physically abusive marriage - my SO was incredibly supportive through the criminal trial and divorce, and we went from being friends to having a very committed relationship quite quickly.\n\nFor the first few years after we got together, we talked about marriage as a definite thing that would happen, not immediately but some time after my divorce went through. Neither of us were in a rush but it was definitely on the list. \n\nAs a result of this understanding, I never changed back from my married name to my maiden name. It didn't seem worth the huge administrative hassle (and having to explain my divorce to work contacts etc.) of going through the change, and honestly my Dad isn't much better than my ex-husband so I didn't much want to carry his name around either!\n\nThe longer my SO and I have been together, the less it seems like we have talked about getting married. I didn't get why, so in August 2017 I asked him about it, and it turned into a massive row about how he doesn't want to get married and thinks the whole institution is stupid. He eventually backed down on that, and said that he isn't particularly bothered but was happy to get married to make me happy. He said he wanted to sort a few things in his life first, and we agreed that he would propose within a year - August 2018.\n\nAs it happened, that year was pretty busy and to some extent, life got in the way - we moved house (we own together) and that took up most of our time, money, and emotional energy. So August came and went. I left it until Christmas, when I brought up marriage again. I had had too much to drink and was very emotional about it, so I didn't handle the conversation well - it turned into a massive row. He reiterated that he doesn't  believe in marriage and doesn't what to do it at all, and said that I don't love him and just want to get married to anyone for the sake of it. I told him I felt betrayed that he had changed his position on marriage, and I would never have gotten into a serious relationship in the first place of he had told me how he felt. I also brought up how horrible it is to have to carry round my ex-husband's name, which he is very aware of.\n\nHe said he had been planning to propose in April of this year, but didn't want to now as I have sucked all the joy out of it. I don't think that's fair, and as we never properly discussed it again after making up from the argument, I now don't know if he is planning to propose in April, at some other time, or not at all. I don't want to bring it up again as it always ends up in a screaming match, and we have a great relationship apart from this issue. I wish I would just be happy, bit marriage is really important to me and I what to make this commitment together.\n\nWhat do you think, AITA?\n\nTL;DR my partner doesn't much want to get married and keeps putting it off, I keep bringing it up as it really matters to me.",

Management gave him the whole afternoon to pack up his desk after he resigned. \n\nI empathize with him (I've been in the same situation before as we live in a province with a volatile economy); but I've told him that I'm unhappy that he chose to quit. I explained that, either way, he would've been out of a job; but getting fired would mean that we have at least some money coming in.\n\nWe have 2 kids and a mortgage and there is no way I can pay for it on my own with my salary.

      "description": "I just had a flash memory of when I was like 12 about 4 or 5 years ago. It was only a few months after Christmas and I have a big family so I had lots of money, normally my mom wouldn’t let me use my money but we were traveling so she made an exception (my mom only let me hold 10 dollars of it at any given time)\n\nAt the funeral for my cousin, I never really knew her but still felt sad, I got a little emotional and hungry and went into some kind of a gift shop in the place where we were all eating. To this day I’ve only gone to a couple funerals, don’t know what to call it, but we were just in a big room somewhere that was catered and everyone ate in remembrance of my cousin it was interesting\n\nAnyway ya I went to this gift shop place with ten dollars and bought a big bag of candy. I come back to the table I was stationed at, sat down. My younger cousins showed up after I sat down, the daughter and son of the cousin I had who died. Twins, a boy and a girl. I just met them a few months before, didn’t even know my cousin HAD kids until then. They were probably 5 years old. They couldn’t even remember my name.\n\nThe boy has the audacity to reach into my bag and grab a handful of my gummy bears, the girl has the decency to ask. \n\nThey then ask if I could buy them candy, I probably didn’t have more than 4 dollars left at that time but knew my mom had a lot more of my money, at least a hundred dollars. I yold them something like “no, ask your dad for money”. My dad then punches me under the table, and whispers something like “they’re mom just fucking died and all they want from you is candy, but it for them”\n\nSo I walk to the gift shop area with them, I have them wait outside, I walk inside and wait for about a minute and play on my iPad mini, then I walked back out. I told them they were all out, then I let them split the rest of my candy I had so that to my dad it looked like I bought them candy. I only had about a quarter of the bag left at the time.\n\nI don’t think it was wrong because I’m just a twelve towards old at the time and didn’t have any responsibility for them, they just met me. I guess they viewed me as some sort of an older brother figure because I read them stories and played with them when their mom was sick a few months earlier, but even so I didn’t just magically have responsibility for them. Plus I let them have the rest of my candy, albeit I didn’t really want it.",

I get a knock on the door and almost don't answer it but then remember I've got a book on order so I jump up and go to the door. \n\nThere is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. \n\nI go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes \"is that a dog?\" And is looking behind me into the house where he then sees my baby in her boppy pillow and starts to ask questions \"how old is she?\" \"will you have more?\" Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.\n\nNow this is when I started to get the creepy vibe - that and he kept looking at my chest. I felt like he was asking if the dog would attack him if he came in basically. I lied and said he doesn't like men, apart from my partner and then half closed the door so that if he did try to come in I could have a fighting chance of slamming it. \n\nI think he got the hint and went back to his non descript van (no company name or anything) and sat in there for a while before driving off. \n\nOne one hand I feel like I've just judged a guy simply for being a guy cause I wouldn't have reacted that way if it was a lady.

These surgeries aren't massive but leave me with lots of pain and a massive lack of mobility, meaning I can't to P.E. (gym) and I need a pair of crutches.\n\n\nSo there is a kid in my year (grade) who is a dick, I will call him James. So before class started everyone is talking in the sports hall and just messing around, however given the fact that I was on crutches at the time due to surgery I was unable to partake in P.E. so I just sat on a bench at the side with my crutches on the floor next to me. Anyway James comes along and the two second conversation goes like this:\n\nJames: Can I borrow your crutches?\n\nMe: Why?\n\nJames: I wanna mess around on them.\n\nMe: No.\n\nJames: Please!!!!\n\nMe: No.\n\nJames: Okay thanks!\n\nAnd James takes my crutches leaving me unable to really move (but I was sat down so it wasn't a missive issue). Anyway James is running around with my crutches and I am saying stuff like \"give them back\", by the way I am pretty introverted and I am pretty unpopular with only a small friend group, most of them are girls and my only guy friend is still getting changed for P.E. meaning there is no one to back me up.\n\nSo this goes on for about 30 seconds and I start to get pissed at him, so I stand up using my other leg which actually works and scream at him,\n\n\"GIVE ME BACK MY CRUTCH OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL DRIVE IT THROUGH YOUR FUCKING STOMACH\"\n\nIt was at this point a teacher came in and James turned white as a sheet. I turn around and look at the teacher and say calmly,\n\n\"He took my crutches\"\n\nMy parents get called but they don't really care and James gets excluded, I get no punishment.\n\nAITA for screaming at James and getting him excluded?",

I tell her that I probably shouldn’t because she and my dad are divorced and if he wanted her on the chat he would’ve done it.\n\nShe freaks out.  Tells me to show her the chat.  I tell her again, I shouldn’t for the same reasons.\n\n“Fuck you,” she says.\nI’m thrown.

She says: ‘my daughter is refusing to tell me what was said in the chat,’ and I call out so the person on the phone can hear me ‘she said “fuck you’ 3 times to me!”\n\nIf looks could kill, I would’ve been dead a long time ago.  This would have made me extra-dead.\n\nShe loses it.  Still on the phone, she yells “FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU!”\n\nI hear dad’s caretaker gasp and my mom starts rationalizing what she just said over the phone while I run up to my room and type this out.\n\nShe’s still on the phone.  I’m writing this.\nI might have been being a bratty teenager.  I’m not the best at holding my temper- never have been, either.  I think me saying that she was just the ex wife was mean, but she said bad stuff too.\nI don’t know.  Am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "AITA for thinking it is inappropriate for my husband to buy diamond earrings for a coworker?  I (41F) am married to a (38M) military service member that is deployed to an overseas location where he operates with a team on male and female military and contract personnel. \n\nRecently, he was briefly away from his deployed location and sent to a base where there was an exchange (like a mini mall with stores that have all kinds of things not available at the deployed location). Since he had access to an exchange he offered to grab things to take back to his coworkers at the deployed location when he heads back. One of the items he purchased was a set of diamond earrings for a female coworker. Apparently a pair she had broke and she asked for a replacement. My husband has never even bought *me* a pair of diamond earrings but he purchased a pair to take back to her so am a little frustrated to say the least. \n\nThe reason I know about this is because he told me that he would be buying things to take back to people where he was at. To his credit he gave me a heads up that he was going to be taking pictures of some of the things he planned to buy, just so that he could send those photos to the people downrange to make sure he got them what they wanted. I do not recall him saying that he was going to buy *diamond earrings* for someone however. The reason I know he bought them is because there was a photo of them included in our shared family photo stream of the items he purchased. \n\nAITA for thinking this it totally inappropriate? Honestly am really upset about this and don’t get why: 1. someone would ask another person to buy them diamond earrings to wear at a deployed location and 2. why my husband wouldn’t push back and say something like “I’ll grab smaller needed items but not something like that...” we have been married for over 10 years and not had any issues with infidelity.",

I have been here since 8 AM (it's 11:30 AM). This is  my twelfth beer and I have this towel wrapped around it (implying this was to keep it from slipping).\" We conversed a little more uncomfortably, and he made it clear he thought this towel solved everything.

The topic shifted towards the heavy end and we started talking about the holocaust. One of the boss (let’s call him joe) started saying how the holocaust happened for a reason, and Hitler did what he thought was best to eradicate the problem (that Jewish people are monopolizing the legal systems and many other industries bla bla). Joe said hitler isn’t a bad person for carrying out the holocaust because hitler believed in his logic and his method, as nobody could’ve done it better. I do not know anything about history and culture of Jews or the proclaimed monopoly of any systems, so I said that I really don’t agree with you because monstrosity like the Holocaust should not happen for any reason whatsoever and no one or race deserve to suffer from it. He condescended me and indicated that I don’t understand his argument. Joe said he made his argument from a place of empathy, where he is trying to empathize with the decisions and actions of Hitler. I disagreed with him again but we seem to be on different pages, so I turned off completely and was on my phone for the rest of the dinner.

It was immensely helpful and it helped me get medicated and start becoming more normal and not a wreck all the time. Fast forward to now, I had therapy tomorrow but my boyfriends parents are coming over a couple hours to celebrate his birthday early. I thought it would be okay to cancel this appointment to spend time with them and clean before they are over. However, my boyfriend got mad at me when I told him. He said “we’ve talked about this” (referring to when I hadn’t been medicated yet and would cancel appointments just because) and when I responded that I’ve been doing better and I have tools to help me here for the time being, he just said sorry and that he understood why but he definitely looked extremely disappointed in me. One session isn’t going to break me, especially since one particular incident that made something in my head click into place and made things easier to accept and move on. I’ve got all the tools available that I learned in therapy and handouts that were given to me so if I have a hard time I can read through them to help me calm down. \nIdk...\nI just wanna know, am I the asshole for cancelling my therapy appointment?",

So my friend looked at her account and saw that she had someone else on her bio with hearts and kissy faces on it. I was fucking livid, I was pissed, I gave her a 2nd chance and she fucked it up again.\nNow, I knew her in real life, and she's avoiding the problem and ignoring it. I know how she is and she trys to play the victim card saying that \"Everyone I date abuses me!\", when shes actually causing the problem and making it worse for herself.\nSo I exposed her to my friends and told her she was a Liar, a cheater, and a manipulator ((she tends to use her emotions as an advantage.)).\nI then told the current boyfriend of hers that she cheated on him with me, he didn't listen though. Although I know she'll do the same shit to him as well.\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I know this girl, P [22F], who I’m not really close to, but I spend a lot of time around due to mutual friends. She’s always talked about one of her close male friends who she has the most obvious crush on. She doesn’t hide it from anyone and has even revealed it to him a few times which he has seemingly ignored. Not to be mean, but objectively the male friend is out of her league. She in the past has always made really aggressive comments about how she wouldn’t be able to deal with him having a girlfriend even saying threatening things in regards to this hypothetical relationship/girl. Well, sure enough he has a new girlfriend as of 3 weeks ago and it’s all I’ve been hearing about. \n\nI personally can’t stand when girls tear down other girls and it’s been infuriating me that she is basically bullying this girl who she hasn’t even met just because she’s dating her crush. I don’t know how to respond when she says things about this girl/the situation because everyone else is just trying to make her feel better by agreeing so I just go along with it, but honestly the things she says are so toxic and she sounds like a middle school brat. I don’t get how someone can be this jealous and disillusioned. The girlfriend is gorgeous and seems really sweet, but P downplays her appearance and makes assumptions that she’s a bitch and is constantly comparing her to herself.\n\nSo basically, would I be an asshole if I called her out on this? On one hand, I know that she’s just venting to people outside of the situation and probably wouldn’t act that way to her actual friend and this girl; she’s just hurt and needs a target for her frustrations. On the other hand, I hate having to be a participate/bystander to her jealous rage to this innocent girl and think she needs a wake up call. I want to tell her that she should just give the girl a chance and be happy for her friend next time she brings it up.",

Because I don't want to get him sick, I didn't ask my boyfriend to come take care of me or anything. I only asked him to drop off my phone charger that I had left in his apartment (he lives 2 blocks away).\n\nHe showed up with my charger, which I'm grateful for, but he didn't even enter the apartment and when I stepped closer to him to give him a light hug, he stepped back as if he is disgusted, then he made excuses to rush back to his apartment. I called out this manner of treatment, and he wrapped it up as a joke, yet still made it clear that he has no intention of being near me while I'm sick and contagious.\n\nAll I wanted was a light hug or gestures that he cares and worries about me, but he still feels it is reasonable to avoid contact whatsoever because of the tiny chance that he might get sick from a 2 second hug. Am I the asshole here for getting upset and hurt?\n\nUPDATE: The same weekend, he got sick from his roommate, who also was sick, and decided to blame it on me, because apparently the new years eve party that I brought them to got us sick, then got him sick. He then started to go on about how he's going to fail this busy season (he's an auditor) because of getting sick and from the stress that I put him through on the first day of busy season by getting sick and upset. I guess I was the asshole :/",

I was really excited because this is the only real date we have ever been on for the entire four years of our relationship. The most we have done is gone to the movie theatre and we usually hang out at his house and chat. And yes, he considers these to be dates.\n\nAnyway, today, two days before our concert, he tells me he's not sure if its gonna work as the band we want to see starts at 10 pm and play until 1130 pm. I'm immediately irked because so what? Its a friday night, and you have nothing to do on the weekend at all. He says its because of health concerns because he doesn't want to get sick for his exam because he stayed up too late. His exam is on Wednesday. At 11.\n\nSo I snap. I get angry, yell, and long story short, I ask him for the tickets so I can go alone because I spent my money on a ticket to see a concert for our anniversary. He said that, since he paid for the tickets, he has to go too because they check ID. So I can't even go by myself.\n\nAnd yes, I know health concerns are valid, but he and I have the same health problems, its how we got close in our friend group.\n\nSo now I'm not talking to him because I know it'll just end in disaster and I'm furious and hurt and honestly, I just feel like crying out if frustration. Am I the asshole in this?\n\nIf someone could also tell me a better way to convey how I feel over just yelling and getting angry, that'd be appreciated.\n\nTldr: boyfriend offers to take me to a concert as our only date in 4 years, i have to pay for my own ticket, and now he says hes not sure about going due to concerns about staying out to 1 in the morning. I yell at him, now am refusing to talk to him.",

      "description": "I have been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?",

      "description": "A little of a backstory. I'm 31 non-native english speaker, have a 8 yo daughter, who lives with her mother. I have helped raise her, tho, been at her house, and all that, so I've been a part in her education/manners. Also, she spends every saturday with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago, a friend of mine from school got in touch with me via Facebook (we were classmates and good friends in school, but after graduation we went our separate ways). She tells me she moved back to town, she's got a kid (6 yo), got married, got divorced (husband cheated on her) and stuff. Since we've got kids who are around the same age, maybe we could meet up and the kids could play while we catch up. Sounds OK to me and my kid agrees, so we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey came to our house and they get along, playing until it's time to eat (tea time). So we are eating, and suddenly this kid farts. I look at him, and so does his mom, but we don't say anything. The kid then rips another one. My daughter looks at me kinda shocked, and the kid starts laughing and lets another one out. I look at my friend and she just looks me back and says \"kids will be kids\". So I look at the kid and say \"you shouldn't fart on the table, kid\" in my friendly-yet-firm dad voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't respond and starts eating his sandwich. He eats with his mouth open, talks while eating, and I can notice my daughter is annoyed. Suddenly, the kid farts again and starts laughing (again, mouth full with his sandwich bite.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got annoyed. He's 6, but he should at least apologize. So I tell him \"Hey, \\[blank\\], you shouldn't eat with your mouth open. And if you're gonna fart, at least apologize. I know farts can sound funny but we are eating. It's not polite.\" His mom tells him to listen to me, and he kinda does (he still eats with his mouth half open, but no more farts.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finish eating and the kids go back to play, only my daughter now doesn't want to play with him. She asks if she can play with my phone, and the kid wants to play smash bros (wii U) so I put him against the CPU. Eventually, they have to leave. They live close so we walk. We let them at their house and everything seems normal, except is mom was silent the whole walk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got tome, I text her saying my daughter and I got home safely. She texts me back a \"that's nice\" and then proceeds to tell me she liked the visit but was kinda annoyed of me lecturing her kid. That she get's it not the best behaviour but I should have overlooked it, and that the kid said he would like to come by again to play but didn't like me \"acting like a dad\". I tell her that I get her point, but in my house, and in my table, we behave, and that at no moment was I rude or harsh to her kid, I was acting mainly because my daughter showed concern. She responds that's ok, but to remember that \"kids are kids\". My daughter said she liked playing with him but \"didn't like him while eating\" (her words)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA here?",

      "description": "TLDR: My wife doesn’t want me to go to Texas to buy the car I want because I bought another car first that I’m fixing to sell so I don’t spend more than I have in my personal fun money account.  \n\nI have been saving my blow money for quite a while to get a convertible.  I’ve been looking for a while and finally settled on getting a Nissan 350Z.  I’ve shown a bunch of to my family to see what they like and found one in Texas that everyone loves for about $4000 less than I can find around me.  I’m in Indiana.  I asked my wife if she would be ok with my flying there to get it and driving it back and she said ok.  It was going to be about two weeks until I could go get in.  In the mean time I paid for them to go get it inspected and bought a non refundable plane ticket.  \n\nThen this Monday a crazy deal for a 350Z showed up on Craigslist.  I’ll end up paying half of what it is once we finish fixing it up.  But it’s older and has more miles than the one in Texas.  After much internal debate I decided what I wanted to do was sell the one I just bought and still get the one in Texas.  I have money from “side gigs” I’ve done so I can pay cash for them both of them and all money from the one I sell will make the Texas car cheaper.  \n\nBut now my wife thinks ITA for still going to Texas when I just bought a car.   She’s worried about every scenario that could go wrong (It is a 1000 mile drive).  And she’ll have to take care of the kids for two days herself (just like I am this weekend when she is working).  She thinks I should eat the plane ticket $300, and what I paid for the inspection $140, and tell them I won’t do the deal even though they have taken the car off the market for two weeks. \n\n",

We'll name her Claire. I've met Claire before and think of her as a very nice/funny person. I've also found out, from my sister, that she usually doesn't have places to go for the major holidays. So, overall, I think it's completely fine that she's around. For our backgrounds, she is of Indian descent  and I'm half Japanese/ half Caucasian.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're all having dinner and everyone is making conversation (it's around 12 people, but my family can be fairly loud when it comes to holiday dinners). The table is sorted by age so I'm sitting on the end with my older and little sister and their SO's and Claire  at the \"kids\" side (we're all mid 20's) while the \"adults\" are on the other end. The conversation starts lulling and my little sister sneezes. My dad, uncle and aunt all say, at staggered times, \"Bless you!\" Then, after a beat, I say \"hey, screw you!\" and get a pretty decent laugh from the table.  My little sister and I have a good relationship so we start bantering and (now that I have everyone's attention)  I get into a bit about how if you want to do a similar joke in a elevator, wait until someone sneezes and say \"hey, shut up\" or \"shhhh\" or something in the means to quiet them. Claire then speaks up and says \"actually, if you were a brown person you wouldn't be able to make that kind of joke.\" This essentially silence me/my family for another beat until someone quickly changed the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know explaining jokes makes them not funny, but to me in the context of the situation, saying the opposite of what is expected/conventional is classic joke material. To Claire's point, I'm a mixed kid but have been described as \"white passing\" where she has darker skin so it is something on her mind more often than mine. However, I got really agitated by that situation. I was essentially privilege checked on something that I personally do not equivocate as to actually being generally offensive/race based. I also (and after some thought this is definitely an emotional piece of it) do not think it's very respectful/fair to do something like that when you're a guest at a holiday. I lean liberal and have worked in fields involving minority issues and while I'm no expert I've never been called overtly racist or prejudiced. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I've had many conversations with friends (not family) over the last week and honestly it's been hard to find the real truth. The best I've been able to come up with is \"I'm not right really for what I said, but she's also not right in her response.\" So any input on this situation is deeply appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hi AITA!   \n\n\nI work a club on the weekends as a bouncer. We have a $9 cover on Saturday nights, and while it's high, a lot of people still pay it. I was working our side entrance (which has 1 bouncer and 1 register clerk) when a group of college students got in line. I checked IDs for 3 of them, and continued down the line. 2 women (1 of which I checked in), stopped for a second at the register, and then proceeded to take advantage that we were really busy, and decided not to pay. I saw this and ran past them, and they also started running. They tried losing me in the club, but I caught back up to them, and told them they needed to pay. One girl said \"yeaaaa... sure we do\", and then sprinted off again. I lost track of them, but got one of their names from our system.   \n\n\nWhile she's banned from entering the club, her name is very unique, and it didn't take but a quick google search to find that she's a PhD student researching at a nearby university.   \n\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I called her department and alerted them that of her actions last night? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "My roommate (we're in our mid 20s) has an abusive and shitty bf ...so three months ago he gets \"them\" a dog. I'm not exactly sure how the \"them\" part of it is going to work out because he never comes to visit (for one) and for two she works 8am-8/9pm every day and I get home at 5.\n\nI told her from the very beginning that I wasn't okay with a large pit/lab in a 600 sq ft apartment and that it wasnt a good time for me to take care of a dog after work as I'm often pretty busy with friends after work and I didn't want to feel like it was my obligation to come home and take care of a dog that was not mine. She rolled her eyes at me but didn't say much.\n\n2 weeks after she says that she needs to watch it for the week and asks if I can help. I told her no, I'm sorry but every afternoon was booked that week so I was unable to help out with it as I had previously said. She got upset because I should be able to come home after work to at least take the dog out and that I was being rude and unkind to the dog. \n\n6 weeks has gone by since the bf got the dog and he decides that it is too much work for him to take care of it and wants to give it up. She FLIPS out and refuses to let him take the dog to the shelter. She claims that she knows someone that wants to take the dog, but the dog has to be out of bf's house because his landlords are also threatening to evict him for breed restrictions....So I say fine, bring it back here as long as it is going somewhere this weekend. 10 min after she walks in the door she's crying because the family fell through that was going to take the dog. Great. Now there's this dog here which I was adamant about not wanting in my apartment and not wanting to take care of and I've been roped into it anyway. It's been here now 4 weeks &amp; she's given up looking.\n\nI feel like I have been disrespected from the start, and that it shouldn't be my responsibility to take care of this dog for 4 hrs until she gets home from work. To her, I'm selfish cuz if it were her in this position she would be doing anything and everything to help out with the dog.\n\nBasically this whole situation has completely ruined our friendship because she doesn't see how I feel disrespected. I feel like a stubborn b\\*tch because I'm standing my ground after having bluntly said what I was comfortable with for our living situation and I'm not quite sure how she's so oblivious to seeing that she did anything wrong.....which makes me second guess if I am in the wrong or not.",

      "title": "AITA for saying, my ex-boyfriend, cheated on me?",
      "description": " \n\nOkay so all of this takes place back in September, and our relationship is long over (I broke up with him). A little bit of backstory first. I was dating a guy who lived over a thousand miles away, and we only had the chance to meet up for a few weeks in July. We had been dating for under a year when we meet up (10 months) so it had been an entire year by September. Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the important part.  \nThis girl (who I'll call Zoe) asked him to homecoming and what he told me is that he thought it was as friends, but then realized it wasn't and I asked him if she knew he was already dating me. He said no, and I kept telling him to make sure she knew and he kinda just dodged it. He told me he was going to homecoming and I asked if he was going with Zoe and he said yes, but as friends. He refused to tell me if she knew that or not. He said afterward he was hanging out with friends and then he completed stopped replying(not that I was spamming him, but I just wanted to know what he was doing) for several hours late into the night. A few days later I found out from his friends that Zoe was telling everyone that her and MY boyfriend were dating and when I asked him about it, he totally denied it at first. I was with friends at the time, when he finally emitted that he made out with her and gave her hickeys (probably more but idk). I had a pretty bad panic attack in front of my friends (they were also his friends) and I told them that he cheated on me.  \nLater on, he told me he was really drunk when it happened and that I was an asshole for telling them that he cheated on me because when he did it he was just drunk and that Zoe forced herself on him. He also said he didn't tell Zoe he was taken because he was afraid of her killing herself if he did since she was apparently really fragile. Like a complete idiot, I apologized and tried to smooth things over with my friends but they didn't buy it.  \nWe dated for another month before I broke it off because of us constantly fighting, as well as the fact he wouldn't let me talk/hang out with my male friends(I don't mean alone, I couldn't go out with groups if they even had one boy in them). Not to mention that from then on he told me to never talk to his friends and he wanted our relationship to be completely private from then on, which felt a bit suspicious.\n\nEven though this all happened a while ago, I'm curious as to if he was actually right that I shouldn't have done what I did, or if I was right. I don't really understand a lot of basic concepts of human interaction, so I'm bad at judging situations like this haha. This is my first Reddit post btw, so I hope you enjoyed it &lt;3",

      "description": "Tl;dr I'm 17 and uber TOS says that only 18 and older passengers can ride without an adult present. I was essentially stranded in a city I didn't know my way around with uber being my only means of getting home. Someone called me out on r/uber saying I'm scamming drivers because I was breaking TOS for being underage and riding alone. I disagree with the notion that I'm scamming drivers. Though I agree I broke TOS. AITA for this?\n\nI'm a 17 year old girl. I just got off the train from Ottawa into Toronto. The train was about an hour late so it through my whole plan of schedule. I was planning on taking the public transit train home, but because of the time I had arrived that train was no longer running. \n\nI texted my mom and asked her to pick me up. She sad she couldn't because it had just gotten dark. She can't drive at night because all the lights just become one big blur so it's really unsafe for her.\n\nI looked at my options. There was a train that would be way to expensive for the journey. And the other two options I wouldn't be able to get to in time because the station I was in was huge and I had no idea where anything was.\n\nThe only options left were Uber, Lyft or a taxi. A taxi would be way too expensive for us a d we had only planned to pay around 13 dollars for the train and buses home. Lyft would cost around 40 dollars to get home and uber was around 33. A bit more than I would have liked but better than the ~80 dollars it would cost for the taxi. So I downloaded the app used my mom's account and after a couple of cancelled trips and people claiming that I was in the car when I wasn't I got home. No trouble, no my phone was charged and I was ready to contact 911 if need be.\n\nSee I didn't think there was anything wrong with that until I went onto r/uber asking if it was normal for people to claim they picked you up when they didn't. Someone said that I was scamming the drivers because I was 17 and uber is an 18+ app. I'm turning 18 this year and I'm tall so I don't think the drivers would even have noticed that.\n\nApparently I broke TOS because of that though I honestly don't feel bad as long as the driver doesn't get in trouble or anything. This was an emergency, at least to my standards. I don't think uber drivers are babysitters that should have to handle people's kids but I didn't even talk to the guy besides a \"hi\" and \"Thank you\". Morally did I do anything wrong?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry, English isn't my best language. \n\nOkay so here's the context: Every year around christmas, my family and I are going to see a ballett production. It's a tradition for us. At the production last night (nutcracker) there was a small family seated next to us. The hall in which the event took place wasn't very well heated and because of recent terrorist threats no coats or bags were allowed inside. \n\nSo we all sit in the freezing hall and the family gets next to us. They consist of a mother, father, older kid daughter and a very, very sick baby. The baby was so young that it didn't even have its own seat, it was always handled from parent to parent during the play. \n\nAnyways: during the whole first act the child cried and cried and coughed without pause. Moreso: once the rat king in his terrifying costume showed up he got really upset and started screaming. The mother did not leave the hall with him but instead calmed him down (very loudly), earning a lot of annoyed looks from the other guests. The whole first act was ruined for us because the baby's cries prevented us from enjoying the production. Once the break between first and second act started and the lights came back on I could see that the child's face was red and glowing and the hair on his head was so sweaty, it got stuck on his forehead, meaning the child definitely had a fever as the hall was freezing as mentioned before. I got over to the mother and asked her to leave the production since her child was obviously sick and upset and did not enjoy the ballett, which caused half of the hall to not enjoy the ballet either.\n\nShe got very very angry with me, saying that I should not question her parenting if I wasn't a parent myself and that it was none of my business how she took care of her child. The father came over and scolded me as well, saying that I was rude for constantly giving them dirty looks during the production. A third, not related older woman also told me that I had no right to ask them to leave since they payed their tickets just like I did. \n\nI once again told them that a sweating, coughing baby does not belong into a freezing hall but should instead go lie down in a bed and that it was rude to the dancers to have the attention taken away from them because half the hall had to be annoyed by their crying coughing child.\n\nThe second act was just like the first with the exception that the child got very upset again and did not want to sit still anymore. The father then actually did decide to take him home. The mother touched my shoulder and very loudly and very rudely asked me if I was happy now and that I had ruined their first ballett production as a family.\n\nAITA for wanting to enjoy a family tradition that we payed a lot of money for in peace??

      "description": "My two roommates and I recently had our fourth roomate move out. It’s a very inopportune time since few people want to move in the middle of winter. So needless to say, its been a bit of a struggle to find suitable candidates.\n\nWe had one guy who would’ve been great until he said “So i’m a vegan, and I can’t smell people cooking meat” which immediately disqualified him since the three of us are omnivores who cook often. \n\nBut anyways, I put up a facebook marketplace listing with a very detailed description of the place. This included the expenses, what the room and apartment has in it and the location, specific demographics for our ideal roomate, mentioned that NO pets are allowed and that we don’t want children here either (we’re a couple guys in our mid 20’s-Early 30’s, no kids pls), and I also added that I don’t speak Spanish since most of my inquiries were coming in Spanish. \n\nMy inbox BLEW up because honestly this apartment is a really great spot, low rent for a nicely renovated place near a state capital city. In my inbox were tons of messages just asking me the most idiotic questions that easily could’ve been answered if people took a minute to read the two paragraphs I wrote. Questions like “how much is rent” and “what utilities are included?” But aside from that were people who very clearly did not fit the criteria for what we needed and would’ve understood that if they read the damn post. Even though I wrote that we are only looking for young professionals, recent college grads/grad students, my inbox was full of 50+ year old men and women, and then lots of middle aged single moms with babies/toddlers. Also surprisingly plenty of messages from 18-20 year old sound cloud rappers. On top of everything, some people just were flat out rude. One guy FIRST messaged me and said “what’s the address, i’m coming for a tour tomorrow”\n\nNow I’m not an elitist in any sense, however when it comes to the people I live with, its important that we have common ground and can get along well. I’m a professional photographer, my other roommates are an aerospace engineer &amp; a social worker. Aside from myself, they have M-F 9-5 jobs. We like similar music, all love to cook, can talk about politics and social issues civilly, relatively active lifestyles and are roughly the same age. \n\nI feel like i’m an asshole for being so picky with my selection process but why should I give someone a chance living with me if they can’t be bothered to read a bit before wasting my time with bs.

      "description": "I'm honestly not sure if I'm the asshole, I just feel guilty about it. Anyway, here we go.\n\nThere's three people in this story and I am currently the only legal adult. Both of my friends are close, I'm just older by a few months. \n\nSo, Friend One has wanted a pet mouse for awhile. She's done the research, saved the money, but she just couldn't buy it herself. I know she wouldn't be mean to the animal and would be a great pet owner. I was ready to buy this mouse for her.\n\nWhen we get to Petco I start to get uneasy. I haven't bought anything with an age requirement before. This was a spur of the moment decision, and what if it wasn't going to work out? \n\nAwhile later she has her eye set on one of the mice in the tank. Friend Two gets an employee and tells him how I'm buying a mouse and we've chosen which one. At this point I'm already panicking, and next thing I know there's paperwork being handed to me. I knew this was coming, but then the employee starts going on about how this mouse is a non-native species to our state and that this paperwork is being sent to the state that night.\n\nAll I can think about is what if something goes wrong? Could I go to jail over a mouse? What happens if my parents find out I'm buying her mouse for her? Paperwork is my weakness, and all I'm thinking of alleged legal repercussions.\n\nWe wander around the store and they're trying to convince me. I'm in the middle of an internal panic attack, trying my best to hide it, and just overall trying to diffuse the situation. Friend Two is off being obnoxious and Friend One is showing me how she was gonna prepare his tank. I was getting overwhelmed very quickly.\n\nIn the end, I did not buy Friend One the mouse. I think she was alright, albeit a little disappointed. I know Friend Two wasn't happy with me.\n\nPersonally, I feel like an asshole. I asked my mom about it, and she said I would of been fine. It's just a mouse. After we were all home I texted our groupchat saying how I thought about it more and decided I'm fine buying her the mouse. \n\nSo tell me, am I an asshole?",

It was simply that I couldn’t teach a singular topic *over and over again* with no results. I would get angry during the lessons, and I took many a break during these classes. \n\nI eventually gave up, and I told my teacher I wanted to move seats. My teacher said I needed to try harder and that I needed to be more accepting. I just can’t do it anymore.

I got a response from her mom saying how is this a trigger and a reply from the kid saying she is just trying to bring awareness to animal cruelty.I then tried to explain that this is really hard for me to see and think that it would be to some other people too.

Last minute he said he didn't want to go anymore, so I asked if he'd give me back the money for my ticket and he's refusing.\n\n\nNow a bit more detail— \n\nIt was a trip to a tournament for a card game he plays in Manchester, he asked me if I wanted to come as we could hang out in the city afterwards, and I said sure. He bought our train tickets and asked me to send £27.95 for mine, which I did.\n\nWe'd been planning to get a taxi to the station, but at some point last night (We were supposed to go today) he got his brother to agree to give us a lift. This morning however, about an hour before we were supposed to leave, the brother said he doesn't want to take us anymore. This wound my fiancé up quite a bit and he said he didn't want to go at all anymore. I Said I was still willing to pay for a taxi but he wasn't interested. He did try calling his dad for a lift too but no luck.\n\nI Asked him if he'd give me my money back, seeming as he was the one who'd decided we weren't going, but he's saying no. I Said he doesn't have to give me it straight away, he can wait until he's saved up, bit still no.\n\n(I Think some of you might say, 'His brother's the a-hole!' and I wouldn't completely disagree, but that's not what I'm asking about)\n\nLast time I posted here someone complained it was too one-sided, so I'm gonna include some of the defences he gave for not paying me back—\n\n•He's saving me money, as now I don't have to fork out for a taxi\n\n•He's losing out on the cost of his ticket too, and he can't get that refunded\n\n•He also bought a ticket for his friend who had been planning to come but cancelled the other day, and he's not paying him back, so why should he have to pay me back?\n\n\nSo, am I being cheeky by asking for my money back, should he be expected to pay me?",

      "description": "Let me start off with a bit of context:\n\n* My sister (let's call her Eve) and me live in the same city, on the same address during the week (Mon-Fri). We both study on different campuses in that city. My campus is 1.8 kilometres away, Eve's is right next doors (like 100 meters maybe). We only have one bike at our disposal and because my campus is further away, I use the bike basically everyday. \n* Last sunday, during dinner, Eve told me she would need the bike today to attend a certain job interview. She mentioned it would be before 12:00, so I agreed that she could use the bike and that I would walk to campus. Throughout the week, she didn't remind me of this agreement.\n* This week was pretty shitty. On monday, the bikelock got stuck, so I spent 45 minutes with a pair of pliers getting it off (still keeping it as a trophee on my desk). On tuesday, I got a flat tire and I had to go get it fixed at a bike shop. Both these days I had to walk to campus (25-30 minutes without retour).\n\nNow, the actual story began this morning. I had a class at 8:30, so I woke up at around 7:30. I checked my phone and there was a message from Eve, telling me that she would need the bike.  \nI totally forgot about what we had agreed upon last sunday, so I send her a text explaining that I had class until 12:30 and that she could use the bike afterwards, before starting my morning routine. When I was done, it was around 8:10 and I checked my phone again. Eve told me that the job interview was at 11:00 and reminded me that I had agreed to walking to campus on Sunday.  \nLet me remind you that walking would take 25-30 minutes, so that would mean that I was going to be late. Policy in my campus is that if you come late, you can't come into the class because that would disturb everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I explained the problem to Eve, also stating that I had already had to walk to campus 2 times this week, so it shouldn't be a big deal for her to walk to the job interview (approximately a 30-35 minute walk). Eve got mad at me, telling me again that I had agreed to leave the bike. I texted her that she should have reminded me yesterday so that I could have gotten up earlier to be on time in my class if I were to walk instead of using the bycicle, then I took the bike and went to my class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out that last message really pissed Eve off. She texted me that \"she should have known I would do this because I'm a man\" and that \"I'm a selfish douchebag for not going through with an agreement\". I repeated that walking this one time shouldn't be a big deal for her and that I had no choice but to take the bike, also telling her that her sexist remark wasn't being appreciated. Eve responded with \"it's about the principle\" and I told her that I didn't forget about the agreement on purpose. She didn't respond to that last message.  \n\n\nI won't see her until tonight, but I'm torn between apologising to her or sticking with my gunsa and telling her that she was overreacting. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I apologise for using the bike?",

It was of the ex wife of my brother. We kept close over the years, but my son never met her. Anyway, the funeral was at 3 pm, my younger kids get off the school bus at 4:15. So, i wanted to have him watch them before we got home in case the funeral lasted longer then expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, on the way home, i was too tired and didn't feel like cooking so i picked up dinner from Burger King, and i took my niece out for a quick bite. It was only about 5 pm when i got home and when i got there, my oldest son was mad at me. I told him about the funeral and everything, but he was rude and dodgy, i told him i got home as quick as i could, but he told me \"If you really wanted to get home as quick as possible, you wouldn't have gone out to eat\". Then he started talking about how  he doesn't want to be left alone with \"my little demons\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, my younger kids are a little rambunctious. They act up and they get into everything. He's mad because he had to watch them for not even 45 minutes. I was horrified, i thought he'd be happy i got him food. I got him the burger he's always gotten, exactly the way he wants. But it wasn't good enough.  He kept telling me about how \"I'm not your full time babysitter\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am i in the wrong here for taking a few minutes to go to Burger King and not coming straight home?",

      "description": "Throwaway account just in case.\n\nSo I play this mmo rpg game where I am a member of a guild. This guild includes me, my friend Tom (not his real name) and 5 other members. Then we have John, another friend of mine (which I'm also seeing IRL now, but we don't have a relationship yet) that has no connection with the guild at all.\n\nTom and I were the new members of the guild. The others having played this game for years had collected a nice amount of money (about 9 000 000 coins) and put it all in the guild-bank. Because Tom and I were new, we couldn't contribute any good amount to it.\n\nAnyway, recently the guild got into some drama (me and Tom were not in the drama), but everyone started leaving until it was just me and Tom. The guild-leader who also left put me in charge of everything including our base and the money. Basically, I was the leader of this dead guild. For the money he said (I qoute) \"Just share it with Tom or something\"\n\nClearly that was just a suggestion. So I thought it would be nice to give John a bit of it too (he never had a guild and was also new so why not?). I kept 4 500 000, gave 3 500 000 to John and 1 000 000 to Tom. Considering I was in charge, it was my money so I had the rights to it. If Tom had contributed something, i would take that into account, but he didn't.\n\nWhen Tom noticed the amount here received he messaged me saying it was quite  a small amount from the total (only that but I know what he impled). I said it was a fair amount and that he should be happy because I could also give nothing. Then he told me it wasn't fair to keep 8 million and just give 1 million, to which I replied I shared it with another friend (John) outside the guild. He got upset by that and told me John had no input to the guild at all and I just said again that I was in charge of the money and I can use it as I want and that he should just be happy. He clearly got upset and doesn't talk to me anymore which is an overreaction.\n\nSo, AITA for sharing money of our non-existing guild with someone from outside even though I was clearly put in charge over it?",

      "description": "Here is the context:\n\nI had a very busy day at work yesterday and Tuesday’s I also go to the gym after work. My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he’d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was “go go go.”\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some “alone time” to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn’t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there’s anything else he’d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he’s sure because I’m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It’s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that’s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he’s suddenly asking me if that’s how much is left, and I tell him I don’t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can’t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn’t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?",

She was playing and I didn't mind, but I did notice she hadn't washed her hands at that point. I figured when her mom came out she would tell her daughter to do it. Then, however, the girl started rubbing her hands on the door handle to simulate leaving the bathroom (even though her mom clearly couldn't see that) and it grossed me out so much I just said \"Maybe you can go to your Aunty *after* washing your hands?\" The girl blushed and stopped touching the door. I walked out very grossed out because kid germs are not any less dangerous than adult germs, specially when waste matter is involved.\n\nAnyway, when we left, my sister said that was very rude because I have no right to say that to a little kid and that she was probably just playing.

      "description": "First things first, I'm from Brazil and tips here work very differently. In a restaurant where you go in, sit down and are waited on, every table's bills come with a gratuity of at least 10% (some trendier restaurants take it up to 13%). You don't have to pay it, but it already comes with the bill and a vast majority of people do, only ever really declining in cases of EXTREMELY poor service. Any other type of restaurante (self-service, fast food) there is no tipping whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's the situation: i just finished lunch at burger king in this mall I was at with friends. I had noticed earlier that there is a burger joint around that i don't particularly like, but that has an AMAZING milkshake. I decided to go there and order one for dessert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, this is a fancy burger joint, where the prices are exorbitant, and they charge 13% gratuity. I went in, ordered with the host, payed for it and waited for the milkshake to be ready while i was standing up outside. When I noticed she had charged the 13% extra I thought about saying something but ultimatly just paid for it and never mentioned it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel i haven't really received any service. It was the same as a fast food experience where I just stood there and waited. Should have said something? Am I wrong to think I shouldn't have paid that tip? I know it's a very minor thing that no one was really the victim of, but AITA?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, I mostly need to vent, but please smite me with your judgement if you feel like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Let's start with some background.**\n\nI am a freelance game developer with multiple years of experience, and I work full-time on my own projects. I have a friend, who currently studies VR and UX design in uni, let's call him M. He has a girlfriend, who is a first-year gamedev student, let's call her L. L and M are also artists, kind of. We are all about the same age, around 20. I also want to emphasise that 'friend's GF' is not necessarily equal to 'my friend' in this case.\n\nL has a task for this semester - to make a game trailer. She decided that she doesn't want to throw away (???) the idea and the art after she completes the task, and wants to make a game. Us three have agreed to team up and work together. Now, this is important: during the initial meetup, L said things like \"this is **my** project\" and \"**I** have the rights for this idea\". I explicitly said that since this is her project, she will be responsible for the workflow and design, and I will only code and build. This will be a good practice for her, and the game is very simple, so this shouldn't be a big problem. We all agreed on that.\n\nI'm not going to go into the details, I'll just say that it's a simple mobile game. I also want to clarify that the basic workflow of making a game is as follows: take the idea you want to work on, make a game design document, make a prototype, refine, test, deploy (repeat 4 and 5 if necessary). It is generally considered a bad practice to freestyle things and work on later stages before the earlier stages. E.g. you make the music and high-quality models for the game, and then end up not using anything because the game gets reworked six times in prototyping.\n\nSo the next thing I talk about on this meeting is the GDD and the importance of making design choices in the beginning. I also mention multiple times that I, as a person who builds everything, need to know what needs to be done and how it should look/feel/work before I start working on the prototype. I ask her if she can compile everything into a single document as she did before, and advice her to use google and ask her teachers if she struggles with something.\n\nThis spring, L was making a project for her university entrance exam. The task was to basically design a game. This is important since she was capable of making a design document and other necessary things to show off and describe a game idea, therefore she knows what to do and how to do it. She periodically asked for help, and I helped where I could, without getting too involved, since this was her exam, not mine. Before that, I helped other people with their projects and ideas, all for free (there is a certain tendency here).\n\nThis time, I expected to be able to finally work as a part of the team. Not to do everything myself, not babysit everyone, just do my part and make a game. Oh boy. Was I ever as fucking wrong as this time. I mean, what can be easier than writing a few pages explaining the basic ideas? Core and meta, how to monetize, how should the menu look, what SFX and VFX we might need. The answer is, many things, but making a design document is not the most difficult part of making a game. Mind that is is also not final, you can and have to make changes to the GDD, but it's oh so difficult to work without it.\n\nWe \"started\" two months ago. L tried to make me write this thing a few times, and I kept sending her to google things and/or ask her teachers. She also kept feeding me with small, random, unstructured blobs of information, maybe hoping that I will compile them myself. I was close to doing this myself a few times but kept reminding myself that this time, I'm not the designer, she is the designer. Therefore, I was patiently waiting for her to write a three-page document. For two months. Last week I received two paragraphs with no useful info and replied that this isn't enough.\n\nI might have skipped a few details, I hope that it's nothing important, if you need clarification - please comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now the real story finally begins.**\n\nThis part will be biased since I'm still rather angry. I'm honestly trying to be objective, but it's hard.\n\nAfter our last dialogue, I was afk for a few days. I had stuff to do, personal stuff, and I honestly think I have a right to do my stuff whenever I want to. So, I return, power on the station, and get quite a shitpost from L *in our work chat,* that is supposed to be used for concept art, file sharing, and discussion. Anyways.\n\nI come back, and send her one of my own old design documents *as an example*. Why should I even do this, literally google this, please, it takes 3 minutes, and you have a whole faculty full of gamedevs! L responds, saying that it's my fault that she couldn't use google for two months, because \"if only I sent her the file a week ago she would've done everything earlier\". And she just keeps on fucking going on about how \"nobody is doing anything\" and \"you only do the code while I do everything else\" and \"it's such a shame that my amazing idea is getting lost because of you all\", and the best one is \"you are not helping me do my job\". I get it, you're a student, but I'm not supposed to teach you how to make games. I agreed to work for free. I think this is kind of enough of an investment.\n\nRegarding the code and stuff, it's a valid point, kind of. But we agreed on this initially, didn't we? Like, not taking into the account that code+build is 50% of the job, so it's a bit impolite to say this anyway.\n\nAnd here comes the fun part. She says, \"this is OUR game, it will only be MY game when I finish studying\". I'm honestly kind of taken aback by this. So, like, it's your game while it's easy, and then suddenly it's our game? What is this, some sort of conditional communism? Flip the switch and you're the boss, flip again and it's our job? So I'm confused and I ask her to calm down and tell her that if this load is too difficult for her, it might be a bad idea to continue studying/working in this field since it's only downhill from here (speaking from personal experience).\n\nNow, my opinion is that this is bullcrap. You can't call yourself the boss and then just shrug it off as soon as you have to do something. You also can't really say that you don't want to be the boss but keep talking shit. So I breathe in, breathe out, and logically explain to her that this is just workflow. You can't expect to get things done if you don't do them properly, and I have told her on multiple occasions what is the correct approach to this task. That I understand that this is difficult, that she also has to study, and maybe it wasn't the best idea to make a game at this point in time. If writing a small document is so difficult, maybe it's just not your thing, right? Fucken, wrong.\n\nAnd the shitstorm begins. If previously, the shit was just dripping from the ceiling fan, now the pipes of shit have burst full and wide, and the pressure is beyond imaginable. It's like Nurgle himself has arrived in our chat. \"You are lazy. You are a cunt. You don't do your job. You are not helping me. Oh, I'm just a beginner, and *this* is your motivational speech for me. Oh, I was hoping that you would do everything for me. You are acting so smug and grown up, why don't you guide me.\" You get the point.\n\nShould I spend my own time teaching and guiding a (basically) random person, because I know how to? Should I do L's job for her? Should I maybe do everything for her? Should I wipe her ass every time she takes a shit? Greatest minds of millennia still don't have answers to these questions. Keep in mind, M isn't really saying anything in this situation, and I understand that he is kind of between a rock and a hard place, and I don't blame him. I also want to point out that I haven't dropped the project yet, and I'm still waiting for the bloody design document.\n\nI personally feel like I should rush and help, as I always do, \"Take the wheel, Kuro!\" But I am so fucking tired. I help my friends and family because they are friends and family. I help my other half because she is my light and shadow. But I'm not there like a robot to complete requests from random people on a daily basis. I used to be stuck in this trap for a long time, doing things other people didn't want to do themselves, just because I can. Now I find it toxic, and I think it impairs personal growth and development in others. Am I the asshole?\n\nI might have missed things, but the general story is here. The post turned out to be twice as long as I expected it to be. I also might be completely wrong in my opinion that you're not supposed to talk shit to your coworkers, especially if they are working for free. I raise my glass to all of you who have finished reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** A person decided to jump over their head, I refused to do their work, got shit-talked and advised them to change the field of study, while it's not too late.",

      "description": "Throwaway because yeah. Had to resubmit with correct title format.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a few questions of whether or not I'm the asshole in this story, but I'm relatively assured I was mostly in the right regarding most the questions. The last question is the one I'm having trouble validating. Here you go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night I was out with a group of friends. I'm a guy and the group of friends included guys and girls. Among the group were two girls who haven't gotten along particularly well recently due primarily to political differences. They used to be good friends with each other and the group which is why they were both still invited. We'll call one Equality Emily and the other Conservative Cathy. As we proceed to drink and bar hop, the conversation turns to politics a couple times. People are able to reroute the convo for most of the night. Eventually, we got more intoxicated and tired of the bullshit so we all stopped trying to intervene. We're walking down the sidewalk about ready to wrap up the night when Cathy and Emily have basically gone full bore into the political convo. The tone seems edgy, but still in control.\n\nIt escalated pretty suddenly and they were fighting each other on the sidewalk. Hair pulling, name calling, a few punches thrown. Me and one of my friends go to break it up and it settles. My friend walks away because it's seemingly over. Emily  then lunges towards Cathy again and I'm right there in the middle of the two. Emily is trying to swing and grab at Cathy while Cathy sits on the other side of me taunting Emily. I push Emily back and she keeps charging Cathy, continually running into me in the process. This happens multiple times. Emily is not hurting me, but it's getting annoying that she's repeatedly slapping at me while trying to get to Cathy. After several rounds of me pushing Emily back from Cathy and her again charging I shoved a little harder with the hope she'd finally quit. In the process she stumbles backward, trips over a curb and falls on her butt. In the process she put her hand down to brace herself and hurt her wrist. This isn't the part where I question myself, because I feel I was still not the asshole here, but feel free to discuss this as well.\n\nI later found out that Emily had fractured her wrist on the fall. This didn't necessarily make me feel any worse about it because she's gainfully employed and, based on her previous comments, has a great health insurance plan. I also don't feel about this, but feel free to discuss this as well. The part where I question if I am the asshole is that I would have offered to pay for any out of pocket expenses if Emily wasn't so preachy about how men aren't any better than women. Even if her views were less \"men suck and are worse than women\" I would have offered. I've had convos with her during which she told me I was stupid because I commented that men are inherently physically stronger than women. I also noted in that same convo that women inherently have better processing capabilities than men, so it wasn't like I was just bashing on women. Regardless, she called me stupid and said that men aren't any better than men and, further, that men discriminate against women because they know this. It was for this reason I chose not to offer to pay for any out of pocket expenses she might face because if she believes this then she can pay for her own crap. AITA for treating her differently because of her comments to me and her general beliefs?",

      "description": "So, I work in a field where many people from the same field know each other.  There’s this new guy, let’s call him Tim, who’s been transferred to our team a few months ago. He’s been in the field for a few years, and has worked in other teams and departments. \n\nMy supervisor, let’s call her Amy, is a very nice single lady in her mid 30s. She’s been working here for years, and we all have pretty good relationship with her. \n\nSo, a while ago, Tim, a few other colleagues and I (Amy’s not there) were in the pantry having lunch as usual. Tim somehow decided to gossip about Amy’s past relationship. He claimed to know one of her exes from past jobs, and he told us details of their relationship and how they bought a flat together but Amy still broke up with him in the end, and how the ex is married with kids now blablabla. \n\nI was so disturbed by it. I didn’t know about this part of Amy’s past - and tbh I don’t think I should. But, god! He’s new here and he’s gossiping about her past as if it was some fun juicy story? Like, if they actually did buy a flat together and broke up eventually, it definitely sucked real bad. Plus, it’s 10+ years ago! Why would you want to talk about that to us behind her back like that? \n\nI was pretty angry about what happened. Amy’s the kind of person who has a kind heart and is nice to everyone. She’d willingly do extra work just to make other’s lives better.  She’s helped me through pretty tough times personally. \n\nI’ve been struggling if I should tell her - it’d probably make her upset, and does it help with anything? Idk. But given now we know this new guy is this kind of person, I think my supervisor should know and be careful around him. \n\nWIBTA if I said something? \n",

      "description": "Long story short my boyfriend's mother just died of cancer. He took a one way flight home last night(it's a 10 hour drive away) because he was told to come home to say goodbye. Unfortunately when he got there he literally found her not breathing when he went to go greet her. \n\nI stayed here for a number of reasons. He has two cats so I'm taking care of them, we just spent two weeks there at the beginning of last month because she was taken out of hospice. He didn't ask me to come with him because he didn't know how long it would be because of that last time, like he only got a one way ticket. He needed to leave immediately and didn't have time to prepare anything anyway, but I'm also afraid of flying so that's probably why I didn't go either. I'm looking for work here right now too so I would have to be here for any interviews. It's a shitty situation because I want to be there for him and have told him I'm here for whatever he needs. \n\nThis is all really traumatic for him and I can't imagine what he's going through right now. I feel super awkward talking to him because I don't know how to help and I wish I was just there for him. I haven't formally asked him because \"Should I go to your mother's funeral?\" is such an awkward question to ask someone and I don't wanna put that on him. I have outright told him \"I'm here for you and whatever you need or want.\" and all that. His family only recently found out he was gay and I know his extended family is somewhat conservative. I wouldn't wanna make a scene at such an important event if it's inappropriate for me to be there. I've never met them because they are from a different country, but I've met his mother and know his immediate family and siblings. I know I have to take care of his cats but I also know his friends have taken care of them before. However I don't know any of them closely enough to talk to them, like I don't have most of their numbers even though I've hung out with them in groups. We also *just* had someone stay over during our few week trip away to watch the cats so I don't know if those resources are exhausted because it's also exam season for them (grad students) and I'm not in school so I'd be the best to take care of them.\n\nIt's a shitty situation and I don't know if I'm just an ass for not directly asking if I should go or not or if it's like \"oh duh he's your boyfriend go obviously\" or if these circumstances make sense. If he asked me to come or to go then I would drive in an instant but I don't know if it's an asshole thing of me to want him to tell me. ",

      "description": "Okay so my roommate (f21) and I(f19) share a 2 bed 2 bath apartment about half a mile south of the local university. We have separate bedrooms and bathrooms but share the kitchen and living room as would be expected. I moved in almost a year ago when her previous roommate moved out to live with her boyfriend and over the last year my roommate has been around less and less. In January my roommate left a pot, bowl, strainer, and some utensils in one side of our double sink ( the pot is technically mine, we share cooking utensils. This will be important later) Over the past couple months occasionally she adds a cup to the pile of her dirty dishes but never cleans them. She spends most of her time at her boyfriends house which is just down the street and I can't remember the last time she slept in her own bed ( her parents pay all her bills as she is a student.) Last week it started warming up where we live and the dishes started to stink and I started to get worried about flies so I left her a note by the sink asking her to do them before flies infest the apartment ( she usually comes in when I am at work or school.) Last night she came in and then responded to the note with a text saying that she was never able to do them because my clean dishes were always in the dishwasher ( I do dishes every night) and that she had thought I would help her out because she's \"done my dishes and unloaded my dishes in the past\"  now for a while I would put her dishes in the dishwasher with mine when it was a cup or so here and there but it became more and more every time and she wasn't doing her dishes at all and she left these ones with dried cheese in them so I had just had it. I responded to her saying that there being clean dishes in the dishwasher was no excuse for not doing her dishes  and that even if she hadn't wanted to unload the dishwasher she could have don't them by hand and left them in the drying rack so there really was no reason for disrespecting our shared living space, after that she told me I was disrespecting the shared space by leaving oil in 'her' pan, which I had because with had used it for dinner and planned to clean it when the oils wasn't hot. After that I just stopped replying because I didn't want to make it into a fight but I work full time plus go to school full time I can't clean up after her. She constantly leaves her stuff all over the place and never contributes to the cleanliness of the apartment.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTLDR: roommate left dishes in the sink for 3 months I left a note for her asking her to clean them and she gave some bullshit excuses then tried blaming me.",

      "description": "Hi guys! So me (23f) and my fiancé (33m) have been together for two years. He’s honestly amazing and I’d do anything for him, hence what I did a couple months ago:\n\nSo he’s terrible with his money. He had a lot of debt and had no idea how to manage his finances. So he let me take over and become his accountant. \n\nI have a bank account I set up in both of our names that all his bills gets paid from. This includes our rent and utilities (that we split) and his bills like his car, car insurance, and what not. \n\nHe had a lot of credit card debt, but because his credit score was so terrible, he couldn’t get approved for a no interest balance transfer. So I put it in my name. (I KNOW I KNOW but hey I’m gonna marry him so does it matter anyway??)\n\nSo whatever money is left from his paycheck after all the bills gets direct deposited into his own bank account. This ranges from 100-200 depending on how many hours he worked that week. \n\nSo here’s my problem.. he smokes weed a lot. No big deal, it’s legal here and I don’t mind. Except it’s his number one priority when it comes to his money. He overdrafted his account last week to buy some and due to the overdraft fees and not the greatest paycheck this week, he didn’t have much this week and overdrafted again. (It’s only Sunday and he has to make it until Thursday)\n\nNow the reason I’m really upset is because I added him to my AMEX and told him he can use it whenever he’s in a bind. He uses it all the time. And it adds up, so now I got myself in some debt. He also kept his own personal credit card during this time for emergencies and racked up a balance on that, which he can’t pay for because he keeps overreacting his account to buy weed. \n\nSo all my hard work in getting his credit score up is for nothing because of all his missed payments on the other credit card. \n\nI’m just defeated and as much as I love him, I don’t know how I can go further with someone like this. \n\nPlease help.

It's not a constant occurrence, but it's not out of the ordinary.\n\nSo, I'm sitting on a bench waiting for my bus to arrive.  I'm having a phone conversation with a family member when this guy dressed kind of oddly walks up to me holding a selfie stick and talking into it (clearly filming himself).  He walks up to me and asks me how I'm doing, angling the camera to film us both.  I realized later on in this interaction that he was livestreaming, not that that particular detail necessarily matters.\n\nAnyway, at this point I tell him (admittedly sounding a bit annoyed) that I'm on the phone and can't talk right now.  This part of the interaction genuinely wasn't his fault - I'm talking using a Bluetooth earpiece, so it's entirely understandable not to notice that I'm on a call.\n\nAt this point, the guy extends his hand and says \"I just want a handshake, man\" along with a few other things that I couldn't make out since I was mostly focused on my conversation.  At this point I just ignored the guy since I was trying to listen to the person I was on the phone with telling me a story.\n\nThis is where the interaction gets a little weird - he keeps his hand extended and just repeats himself, louder, a few times telling me that he wants to shake my hand.  I'm a little weirded out by the fact that he's filming me this whole time and I finally just snap and, without raising my voice, tell him \"I have no interest in whatever the fuck this is.\"\n\nThe guy looks surprised, mutters something to the effect of \"Well fuck you too, then,\" and walks off.\n\nIn retrospect, I realize that this was mostly a misunderstanding and if I'd processed the situation better at the time I probably would've just shaken his hand and hopefully that would've been the end of the interaction.  My gut reaction to how he approached me and the fact that he was filming me was that he was just some weirdo approaching me to ramble about politics or get me to debate him™ or something.\n\nAnyway, I think my response to him alone makes this *at best* an ESH situation and at worst, well, I'm the asshole.  I've been thinking about this all day and I'd appreciate some input.",

THEN SHE gets his dad to call him and beg him. \nthey guilt trip him into doing things.\nthey show up to his apartment unannounced and sit down and make themselves at home.\nshe even took marcus’ car because she got hers totaled, and refuses to give it back. even tho marcus bought it with his own money. she promised to buy him a car, its been 8+ months now.\n\nso, am i the asshole for being upset that my boyfriend can’t come to terms with his mom? theres been times we dont see each other for weeks (we live an hour drive away from each other, in a big city) because hes busy with work and gets called in often, goes to college, and his mom begs him to do chores that his two younger high schooler brothers are capable of doing. i know for a fact he can find at least some time to meet me half way somewhere and grab food. i also know i deserve time with him but his mom prevents that from happening. what am i supposed to do?",

      "title": "AITA for subletting my rent controlled apartment to a new roommate instead of an ex who moved out 2+ years ago?",
      "description": "I've known my ex for 13 years, we dated for 8, lived together 7. He still comes by maybe 3 times a week. When I ended our relationship I gave him the option to keep our apartment and I'd move out, but he couldn't afford it. I was the one covering 60% - 100% of the bills each month. So instead, I took over the apartment, and he eventually moved back with his family. We live in a city where the average 1 bdrm apartment is now over 2k a month, but because of rent control I currently pay half of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 4 months ago I made a goal to move to another continent. I tried talking to my ex about taking over the apartment when I go, but it was always a bad time and he never came with a good time to discuss. He had mentioned that he tried to bring it up to his new gf about moving in with him but she wasn't super interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago, a close friend of mine found out he was being evicted from his apartment and needed a place to live. I thought about having him move in with me to help me save up to move, so once again, I tried to bring up the situation to my ex. He didn't have an answer or any objections. Being as my answer was time sensitive, I had to make a decision, so I made an arrangement that my friend would move in at the start of May and pay half the bills until I eventually made my big move. Once I move, I'd have one year to decide if I needed to come back home. In that case, I'd get to move back into my apartment, and my friend would start looking for a new place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we're 1 month out from my friend moving in, my ex has finally found the \"right time\" to make it known how upset he is about this whole situation. So I offered him the same 12 month deal as my friend. He's mad that I'm only willing to give him the place with that condition. He's argued that hes entitled to our grandfathered rent and it's totally unfair of me to not just give him the place under no conditions. Hes been texting things like \"I don't understand how you feel I'm trying to take advantage of you when I have nothing left.\", \"I feel so sad I'm standing on the street in front of work crying, but that's not your problem.\", \"I just can't make you understand how I feel\", \"I just want a little life for me, and not for free. I'll take it over fair and square.\" I'm assuming that last message was meaning that he'd actually pay the rent this time and not leave me on the hook for it (like our past). Now hes just saying he gives up and he'll collect the last of his things and disappear from my life for good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnowing hes hurting because of me is killing me. I'm ready to just give him what he wants and tell my friend he has to move out when I do. But, if I do that, not only am I going back on a deal I've already made, I'm basically sacrificing my safety net so I can give it to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole if I don't give him the apartment condition free?",

      "description": "I was supposed to go to this cafe in the next state over with them, but I stayed up until 6 am. I have insomnia and I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression, and I was having a lot of issues sleeping that night. I woke up at 1 pm and we were supposed to leave around 3.\n\nI told them that I was gonna go, I just needed to get ready, but after I text them I just started feeling really sad. I wasn’t really able to pinpoint what the cause was, but I felt empty on the inside. I started crying, and I couldn’t stop. And I’m talking ugly crying. I felt awful, and I was trying so hard to compose myself, but I couldn’t calm down.\n\nI text my friend and told him I wasn’t going because I was still feeling sick from a cold I had, and I would pay back our friend for my ticket, but he kept trying to find ways around it to make me go.\n\nI had told the other friend I wasn’t going cause I was overwhelmed and needed a day to myself and she just said “Okay, I hope you can work things out” and that was it.\n\nI didn’t really want to tell this friend that I was struggling with depression. He’s got so much on his plate as it is, and he sees himself as the parental figure of our friend group, I didn’t want to burden him with that. Plus my cause of depression isn’t as bad as his, I don’t want him to see me as whiny, but I know he’d be upset about me lying to him about why I wasn’t going.\n\nI finally told him that I just needed to be alone for one day. I felt like an asshole for saying that to him, but he backed off after that. I feel like he should’ve known it was serious cause this specific cafe had like 15 cats there and I’m a huge cat lady. I wouldn’t have missed hanging out with my favorite people and a gaggle of cats for anything, especially after making a non refundable $10 reservation on a fast food salary, I’m basically paying to have alone time at this point. I just needed to be alone. Now I feel like he’s mad at me, I think he’s annoyed cause we have plans today, and I’m not skipping those ones.",

My associate steals like 7 more on top of his free one. So when I get to the table and see 6 empty biscuit wrappers I’m triggered. I jokingly say welp I found the rest and ask for one. He then says my dawg i only got two left I say well you had 7 already. I even offer him my cereal and he refuses.

      "title": "AITA for pointing out how dysfunctional my family is during a visit?",
      "description": "My mom has always gotten under my skin and easily annoys me. She interrupts meaningful conversation with inane questions (like about food or gossip). She talks really loud too, and sort of parrots people when she's amused. She'll also talk at you about inane and painfully basic stuff, and you have to tell her eventually to stop talking, and that still often doesn't shut her up. She literally can't seem to tell when she's annoying, and I worry a lot about my brother and dad, who have to shoulder most of her annoyances. I worry about their stress levels as they both work long hours (my mom doesn't work) and my dad (not blood related) is getting up there in age. My dad's father committed suicide, and I worry about my dad taking his own life, but he's never hinted on it.. He just looks so tired and ragged, and my mom is the opposite of a relaxing person to be around.\n\nI have lots of unresolved issues from the past with my mom. Most of those issues involve her not being loving, being inappropriate, and being cruel to pets and other animals (getting amusement from putting clothes pins on the tips of cats' tails, and putting socks on animals head for instance). She also would get rid of pets impulsivity. She would get amusement when my brother and I were visibly annoyed or disgusted. She also would walk around naked, or be splayed out on the bed nude and laugh after calling us in and seeing us upset.\n\nAnyway, back to my visit. I tried to go through the superficial niceties and enjoy my time there for my benefit and theirs. But my mom, being who she was, would still impulsively talk, and at one point interrupted the conversation I was having with my grandmom (who I hadn't seen in six months). I snapped something. My Grandmom said that she didn't know what I changed (medicine wise) but that I should stop it. I take 100 milligrams of Zoloft. My grandma a little later asked if what she said hurt my feelings, and I scream/cried to her that of course it did. I said that I was tired of not being able to talk about our family's dysfunction, and how mom needed help, and that it's frustrating that nobody believed in mental health care in our family.  I told them both that I wanted all of us (my dad, mom, brother and I) to go to family therapy.\n\nLong story short, we made up but I didn't hear anything else about therapy. My family basically said \"hey nobody's perfect\" and that I'm on a different \"level\" than my mother. We all hugged, said we loved one another, and I flew back home. Fast forward to a month later and it's my birthday. Everyone who normally calls me does, my mom included, except my Grandmom.\n\nTl;dr: Visited my family for the first time, was annoyed at my mom who doesn't have regard for other people's feelings, blew up in front of my mom and grandmom, and now my grandmom ignores me on my birthday. I'm older so it's not a huge deal, but I'm thinking she still harbors resentment towards me? AITA for pointing out that our family is dysfunctional?",

      "description": "Pretty much how it sounds. I am a full time student in med school with my board exams coming up in less than two months. I spend most of my time studying for school these days. I told my spouse that I didn't want guests coming over until after I take my exam in May. I do most of the cleaning/housework, so when company comes over, the brunt of preparing for that falls to me and adds to my stress. Should probably mention I'm 5 months pregnant, another good reason to keep my  stress as low as possible. We also live in a smaller apartment, so when people come over, we are all on top of each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy spouse's friends are coming in town for the evening and we were all supposed to get dinner and then their friend was supposed to stay with family. Last minute, something comes up for that family member and my husband says they're coming over to our apartment after dinner, to hang out until they leave for their early morning flight. They're technically not spending the whole night and I wouldn't have to entertain them, but now this means I can't unwind before bed like I normally do. There is no wandering around pantsless, singing in the shower, etc. I know that they are going to spend the majority of the evening playing video games until they leave for the airport. I have to get up and go to school tomorrow for a full day of class and other obligations and I don't really want to come out and tell them to be quiet a bunch so that I can sleep. I ended up telling my spouse that if they are going to come over after dinner, I'm going to stay at a hotel so I can still get sleep. Spouse responds snarkily saying to not worry because no one will be coming anywhere near our apartment, making feel like a giant douchebag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting spouse's friends to stay for a better portion of the evening?",

      "description": "Great start to my Spring Break. I’m 21 years old and go to school far away from my hometown so I only come back home during extended breaks.\n\nAt college I curse like a sailor and admittedly may have a slight problem with it but I’m usually on top of only using it in the right situations.\n\nSo I got back on Saturday and immediately my sister starts annoying me with the normal harmless kid stuff, just bombarding me with questions, again nothing that really bugs me but just kind of getting annoyed at answering all these pointless questions. \n\nShe started doing Karate while I was gone and then really started to bug me by kicking, punching and chopping me. Again nothing to terrible because shes only 7 but after she doesn’t stop after I tell her to  I start to get really annoyed and just go to my room for the night.\n\nYesterday we were at a family BBQ and everything’s going fine until she finds a Nerf gun in my Grandpas basement and starts shooting me with it (all of us grandchildren in the family usually hang out down there and talk and even though I’m the oldest I still hangout with them out of habit more than anything, since I’ve been doing it for years). At this point I’m starting to lose my shit and repeatedly tell her to stop before just going outside and helping with the BBQ with all the adults outside.\n\nEverything’s going well again and I’m cooled off but then she sneaks up from behind me and shoots me with a Nerf bullet right in my ear. I hear the adults start to laugh but reactively scream out “FUCK OFF” loud enough for everyone there to have heard it. I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying. My mom goes in to talk to her and everyone else outside just kindof acted like it didn’t even happen.\n\nI feel really bad about it because my sister is usually such a great kid and I realize she could just be in the middle of a phase but I just boiled over after everything added up. I’ve since apologized to her and she accepted it but I can tell she’s still kindof in shock that I said that to her and my mom is definitely still upset I said that to her.\n\nSo AITA?",
