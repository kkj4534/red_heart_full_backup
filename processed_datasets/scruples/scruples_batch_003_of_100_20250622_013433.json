      "description": "For context, we are both in our mid-late 20's with a toddler. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBF has a drinking problem. He is a few months sober now, but not doing anything generally recommended for alcoholics to stay sober long term. He says he feels guilty about what happened while he was actively drinking. He says that it haunts him every day. He tries to gain my sympathy by saying how it only happened because he was \"terrified\" of becoming a parent. Here's why I think that's BS and he deserves no sympathy from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I offered to disappear, he could tell his family whatever he wanted about why I left and I wouldn't even come for child support. He chose to stay and be a father.\n\n2.  Every fear he had about becoming a parent, I also had. I didn't know if I even wanted kids at all. But I had the added fears of actually \\*giving birth\\*. And since he was always drunk and my family lives far away, I was also afraid of not having anyone for support while giving birth. When I asked him to at least cut back on his drinking when I was close to my due date, he refused. He didn't care if he missed the birth and said worst case scenario I could call a taxi to get me to the hospital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. I got put on bedrest to prevent premature labour. Sometimes the short walk to the bathroom would cause contractions. So I asked him to pick up groceries. He would promise to do so, then go out drinking instead. Leaving me to choose between going hungry or walking to and from the grocery store. Meanwhile he would disappear sometimes for the night and entire next day, and I would hear nothing from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. When baby was born, the drinking got worse. Sometimes to the point of him being delusional, once even convincing himself our baby was \"a psycopath with dead eyes and no soul.\"  He was constantly endangering our baby, and it was a constant fight for me to keep baby safe. I thought about leaving but thought I couldn't prove he was unsafe for our baby. I was genuinely afraid that if a judge allowed him unsupervised access, my baby would die or be seriously injured. At least if I stayed I could protect my baby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, he had alcohol to cope with his fears, while I had nothing and no one to help cope with mine, and his coping mechanism turned him into my biggest fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now that he is sober and I'm not afraid for mine or my child's safety, and he is actually beginning to have a relationship with our now toddler. AITA for not feeling bad for him, and for expecting more from him than just sobriety?? I know sobriety is a HUGE deal for any addict, but I feel like in our situation it really is the bare minimum.",

      "description": "Honestly, \"friend\" is too much of a loaded term but...\n\nWe have a lecture class together twice a week, and for the past three weeks I've noticed a pattern with him: on Thursday he misses class, just doesn't even come in or try to come in late. Tuesday he comes in, asks me if I can share my notes with him, and he falls asleep. Occasionally, he wakes up and looks over at my laptop screen to make sure I'm taking notes. Keep in mind, we do about five minutes of review in this class and the other hour and fifteen minutes is new material that he just sleeps through. At first I was fine with helping him out, shit happens we all miss class. But at this point it's getting ridiculous and I feel like he's just using me to get information so he can skip. I wanna tell him no but I'm too nice to just say it to his face. Advice/help would be appreciated. ",

      "title": "AITA for feeling that getting into a hot tub at a party (that has girls in it) without my girlfriend is not disrespectful towards her?",
      "description": "So last weekend my best friend had his 30th Birthday party at his family's beach house (massive mansion is a better term). He invited about 25 people to come over to celebrate/sleep over. The house has a heated pool and a hot tub, so we brought swimsuits. \n\nMost of the attendees are close friends of mine. My girlfriend of nearly 2 years has met many of them on multiple occasions. They're all super nice, respectful, &amp; intelligent adults...but, this group does like to have fun. In the past my gf has been uncomfortable in certain situations she isn't as used to as I am, so I explained to her what she might encounter at this party. I warned that things like people getting naked in the pool and MDMA use were a possibility. \n\n I said if she wasn't comfortable she didn't have to come. But if she did go, as I rarely get to see these friends, I just wanted to enjoy the party without worrying about her being offended by everything. She promised that she would be fine and wouldn't start any arguments.\n\nWe get to the party, everyone has a great time. Some people do end up rolling but its mostly pretty tame. Around 12am I tell her I want to go in the hot tub. She didn't really want to go in, so I suggested I could just go in without her.\n\nThats when she says: \"if theres half naked girls in there you're not getting in\". I protested, its just my friends in the hot tub. And if people want to get naked thats on them, we're all adults.  To which she responded, \"I don't want you perving on any naked girls. If you respected me you wouldn't go in\". I assured her I wouldn't be \"perving\" and didn't see the big deal. She was welcome to join, and should trust me regardless of whose in there. (To be clear, nobody was actually naked). She then got upset and went into the bedroom alone. She later changing her mind and went in the hot tub with me (probably to \"babysit\" me)\n\nThis isn't the first time we've had a hot tub disagreement. About a year ago with friends on a ski trip, some of the girls didn't have suits so they just went in in their bra/thongs. Nobody else cared. But my gf started shooting daggers at me and was angry the rest of the night. She later told me \"that was so inappropriate, those girls have no respect doing that around people's boyfriends\". I disagreed, which sparked an argument.\n\nAlso later at the 30th bday, a bunch of us were talking in one of the bedrooms. Two of the girls (who are bi) started playfully kissing each other on the bed. I glanced over but didn't stare or anything. My gf gave me an angry look and said \"what do you think you're doing?\". I was confused. \"You're really not going to look away?\". She walked off upset.\n\nAITA for not finding these things disrespectful?\n\nTo preface...she's always known I had a bit more of an \"alternative lifestyle\" during/post (lots of music festivals, burning man, psychedelics, etc). I was always open with her about my liberal views &amp; experiences. Shes always *claimed* to accept that about me.\n",

      "title": "AITA for dating my son's friend?",
      "description": "Backstory: I had my son when I was 17. His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?",

      "description": "**Background:**\n\nSo I went out with 4 of my friends to grab some dinner, and we decided to go to this new restaurant that had recently opened. It was a theme restaurant, so every employee had a costume on, and made supposedly funny remarks about whatever, to entertain the customers. The environment was very loud, with music and people talking, a bit chaotic even, but it was part of the experience I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What happened:**\n\nOne of the employees was walking around the tables and taking pictures with those who asked him to. After a while he stopped by our table, he was in character, so I fugured he was going to tell jokes or whatever.\n\nBut then he asked me to stand up. I asked him why, and he said \"come on, just stand up\", so I asked \"why\" again and he said \"I wanna take a picture with you\". I said I didn't want to take any pictures, but he insisted, so I decided I'd go along with it and send him on his way.\n\nAs I'm standing up and a friend is grabbing a phone, he moves his arm like he's trying to put it around me to pose for the picture, but he does it mid-air just above my head, and said \"come on, take the picture now\". Everyone at my table started laughing, because I'm an adult man but very short for my age, and he clearly did that to make fun of it.\n\nSo I sit back down and just said something like \"man, you must think you're so funny\". I remember saying that politely, but I was very serious and I think I couldn't hide the fact that I was offended, because the guy was clearly upset that I didn't play along. He didn't apologize, he only kept saying \"It was just a joke\" and walked away.\n\nAfter that, no one said anything, but I felt I kinda ruined the mood, because everyone stopped laughing. It was their idea to go to that place, they were excited and having fun until that point. My friends quickly changed the subject and started to talk about other things, but then everything was kinda awkward and we didn't stay long. Sometimes I think I was an a-hole and should have played along, and laughed about everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAn employee at a restaurant made a joke about my height, everyone thought it was funny except for me, and I killed the mood when I didn't laugh and told the guy that it wasn't ok.",

      "description": "Let me give you some backstory on my cousin he's 21 and every day of his life for the past 2 years at least he's screamed at my nan and his mum for money for weed, and they give it to him. Over the past 18 months without my permission he's sold all of my PS4 games for weed, sold my bike for weed, and then sold all of my Xbox One games for weed. He's also suspected of selling my little cousin's 2 Nintendo DSs and other stuff. Each time there's been murder and screaming, and I've never been fully compensated for my losses and it makes me furious.   \n\n\nNow for the past 10-15 years I've been in possession of my cousins GameCube controller and games, and I've played them regularly on my Wii. That's mine and his childhood and all the games are rare and expensive, but now he's told me he wants to sell all of these for drugs. Do I have a right to deny my cousin his games because I don't want them being sold for weed? They are massively sentimental to me and I've kept them and played them for over 10 years, while the only reason he cares about them now is so he can get a little bit more weed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do in this situation, imo he's not getting the games so he can sell them for drugs, he's sold everything else of his and mine, and other peoples all for drugs, he has no emotional connection to these games like I do, and only cares about them now because he wants more drugs, he's not getting them.  \n\n\nAITA? I don't give him them right?",

      "description": "Earlier today I was flying my TELLO toy drone around my yard having lots of fun also taking some pictures of the ocean as I live close to the beach. After about 3 minutes of flying I get hit with a gust of wind way too strong to fly my tiny toy drone and it ends of flying a few houses away. I managed to change to a faster fly mode and somewhat get my drone home but the wind was far too bad for me to have any control of it.\n\nLong story short I ended up smashing my drone into the side of my house and it ended up upside down facing a wall. Almost immediately after the crash  my drone begins to move and I see it go into my neighbours house and then she turns it off. In disbelief I go around the house to look onto my roof and sure enough the drone is gone. *Also just to be clear I landed on a lower level roof of our house and the way my neighbours house is set up they have a side stairwell that goes above our roof and is literally 6 inches away from our house so they literally went out their door and grabbed it from MY roof. \n\nAs my fiancé I were trying to work up the nerve to go ask for it back my neighbour comes stomping up the staircase to my house with my drone. She then proceeded to call me a creep and peeping Tom and absolutely lost her shit. I offered to show her the pictures directly from my drone *no way to delete anything as she turned the drone off long before I knew she was upset*  and she refused to look and instead continued to accuse me of attempting to spy on her. She then gave me my drone swore some more and then left, I was very upset by the way she chose to handle it so I immediately went to her house to try and clear things up as I take that kind of accusation very seriously, unfortunately she chose to not answer her door. \n\nAs she didn’t answer I left a note in their mailbox trying to explain that my fiancé and I were purely looking at the beach and ocean and that we have no problems showing them all the recorded things from any of the 3 times I’ve flown my drone outside also the note included my contact info. My relationship with this neighbour has been very good sometimes when it snows I shovel their sidewalk and her husband also does the same for me if I am not home, He has also gone out in a blizzard at 1am in his pyjamas to help me get my car unstuck. so I’m not to sure why all of a sudden she has labeled me in such a disgusting manner and chose not to discuss it.\n\nExtras info: drones are legal where I am and not once did I break any local laws I never went onto her property even when my drone lost control. When she stole it she took it off of my property. To add my fiancé was literally sitting next to me the entire flight also taking turns flying, she was clearly with me when my neighbour approached us. Lastly I have my name and phone number written in big shiny letters on the top of my drone in case I lose it as I am truly just your average nerd who’s recently become obsessed with drones.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to help out my dad and his wife?",
      "description": "Throw away account for reasons.\n\nSome background information:\n\nAbout 6 years ago, my dad had an affair with another woman which ultimately led to my parents separation. He impregnated his mistress, and eventually got married. Our relationship has been rocky ever since.\n\nMy dad seems to be the primary taker of his child (now 4 y/o) due to her mother working long hours nearly everyday. Although I have a rocky relationship with my dad, I still spend time with my younger half sister and treat her no different as any of my other siblings. Recently, my dad reached out to me in need of help to watch younger half sister while he goes on vacation for 3 weeks. Unfortunately, the time he's leaving falls around the time of my busiest school quarter, and then Spring break- which puts me in a situation where I'd have to sacrifice pretty much all of my spare time to watch half sister. I usually wouldn't mind, however, my dad has failed to ask half sisters mom to sacrifice any of her time in order to take care of her own child. She refuses to take time off work, or even work fewer hours, and insists I take their child for nearly 13 hours each day in order for her to get sleep and feel energized for work. I feel this is completely unfair to not only me, but their child as well, who is put at the butt of both their priorities. I told both dad and half sister's mom I would only be available 4 times out of the week to baby sit (which is nearly everyday) and received hateful comments about my inability to reciprocate any kind of help my dad has given me throughout the years. Although I feel bad about not being more of help to both of them, I can't help but feel like I deserve to put aside some time for myself in between working and going to school full time, instead of sacrificing nearly every second of free time to watch my half sister while her dad goes on vacation and her mom spends all her time working. So, AMITA?\n\nI should also mention: younger half sister is ill-mannered, very bratty and cries almost constantly, and both half sister and her mom are in a financial situation where she does not need to be working as much as she does.",

      "description": "This was a while ago, so more of a \"was I the asshole,\" but I just discovered this sub so bear with me. I was talking to my best friend about a convention or whatever and somehow Ed Sheeran came up, and she said she liked him. I poked fun at him and brought up some dumb Twitter beef he was involved in as the main reason I disliked him. She got really upset and said I \"always say that\" about stuff she likes (which I admittedly used to do pretty often). I just sort of apologized and moved on, but it's still bugging me for a few reasons.\n\n1. We used to tease each other all the time, and I thought it was good-natured but apparently she didn't. I'm very careful not to insult stuff she likes anymore but she still roasts me a lot, in much more drastic ways. (Telling people I'm into tentacle porn because I watch anime, making fun of my physical appearance and my voice, telling people about embarrassing shit I did in middle school and inviting people to make fun of my yearbook pictures, etc.) It's all lighthearted but it's annoying that I can't do the same, because she's fairly insecure and I worry about upsetting her. I thought the stuff she enjoyed was fair game.\n2. This wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't feel so unequal. I'm an easy person to tease -- I sort of invite it on myself sometimes, so I'm often the butt of jokes. I also don't like responding in kind because I worry about taking it too far, unless I know the person really well. She was pretty much the only person I felt like I could joke around with without making myself a target, but now I can't anymore without worrying about her feelings.\n3. We used to be part of a friend group that often took teasing way too far (to the point that I broke down in tears in front of them multiple times when they put hands on me or started group roasts of me that got too vicious), and she is pretty much the only one I'm still in regular contact with. Things have gotten much better, but she occasionally participated in or encouraged this dynamic so I feel like I deserve a little payback.\n\nShe's normally very conflict avoidant, so this must have been upsetting her for a REALLY long time. I felt bad about it, but I still think she was overreacting and being hypocritical. Am I being a petty bitch or is she the one who needs to get over herself? Or are we both just melodramatic teenage girls?",

One employee on my team showed up in the office at about 9:50 this past Monday. I spoke to him privately about this afterwards, and he said that it wasn't his fault that he's late, it was because the subways were delayed. I asked him what time he would have gotten to the office if the subways weren't delayed, and he said \"before the meeting\". I asked him again, for a specific arrival time, and he said 9:25. I told him that he's cutting it too close to the start of a meeting, and because of that, it's his fault. I explained to him that if he had planned on getting to the office at 9, and the subways were so bad that he didn't get in until the time he did, 9:50, then he could blame the subway, because that's a very significant, genuinely unexpected delay. He's adamant that he's done nothing wrong.\n\nI'm generally pretty lax about my teams hours, so long as they get the work done, but missing this meeting counts towards not getting work done, as far as I'm concerned. This meeting has been held at this time for over 6 months. What do you think, Reddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off my (25M) girlfriend (26F) of 6 years, causing her a mental breakdown on her birthday, because of a girl (23F) I’ve only known for several weeks?",
      "description": "TLDR Broke w/ GF of 6 years, but we remained on good terms, started dating another one three days later and new gf said she won’t keep it going unless I cut off ex totally. Ex was devastated when I cut her off. The story happened 3 days b4 ex’s birthday and when on birthday her friend called me on whatsapp saying ex was having a breakdown and needed me to comfort her, I hung up and blocked that friend’s number. Gf made things worse by updating her IG and I let that slip too. AITA?\n\nWhen I went to college I started dating a girl from my study group and... well, it’d been a rocky relationship to say the least. I’ll elaborate in last in comments, if needed but for now I believe this info isn’t crucial for the story.\n\nEnd of year 6 and I meet the other girl. We went to the bar once, next day I went to business trip in which I decided to dump my gf for good which was long overdue and then take a shot with that girl. The day I come back I break up with ex and she handles this surprisingly well, not crying or screaming as I expected but wishing me good riddance. Three years later I date the new girl who seems perfect in every way.\n\nAnyway, since our breakup was amicable, I didn’t cut off my ex like I used to do. We kept texting and she would often call me to have a chat. I never planned to get back together because I was more than happy with my gf, but out of respect for the six years I kept helping her during her breakdowns, consoling ger when she was complaining about how she will never find another boyfriend and she wants to love like it’s her favourite song and I talked her through it. My gf knew I dated someone for 6 years and she knew I’m on good terms with my ex and I thought it was ok because she herself remained friends with her ex and it never made me jealous. She never knew the nature of our conversations with ex though. \n\nLast week I went out for snacks leaving gf alone at my apartment and when I came back she was unhappy to say the least. Turns out, I left my laptop open and she saw an incoming message from an ex with sonething like ‘I’m feeling blue again, let’s talk’. She dug through our message history and said that she thinks I’m still up to smthng w/ my ex because we speak very intimately. I said that theres nothing sexual/romantic going on between us but she didn’t believe and said she needed time think it over.\n\nNext day we met and she said she was really into me to the point that she surprises herself, so she is willing to give me benefit of the doubt on condition that I stop communicating with ex whatsoever. Not even asking anything work-related (we’re employed in similar fields). I agreed. She was surprised, saying I knew her for a few weeks and I’m already forgetting about a girl that I loved for 6 years. I said that my ex is my past and my gf is my present and hopefully future. She seemed still confised but we decided to give it another chance. Then she also asked me to tell my ex I have a new gf before cutting her off. I said I was hesitant to do it because it would wreck her. She saud she “couldn’t give two flying turds about what [my] ex would feel as well as [I] didn’t give two turds about [her] feelings while calling [my] ex pet names”. I reluctantly agreed. \n\nNext time my ex called me I told her I had a new GF and boy did it go bad. She started crying and calling me a jerk and saying my gf is ugly (I didn’t tell her the name but her friend probably told her who that was after seeing us together in a parking lot). I said I no longer want to contact her and hung up. That was January 23rd. Her birthday is on Jan 26th. And it was also the Homecoming day in our college. I couldn’t attend but I dropped my girlfriend off and when she went out to get tea, I wandered around the hall to say hi to people I knew. Now, to make it clear. They had some kind of a concert so everyone sat down at the conference hall. I noticed a guy I went to hockey team with, sitting in the seat on the edge and started small talk with him. What I didn’t notice was that my ex was sitting just behind him. When my girlfriend entered, she saw me going down the stairs from my ex’s general direction. She didn’t say anything but the seat behind my ex was empty and gf used that opportunity to sneak on her texting.\n\nIt went like this. \nEx, texting me: why did you ignore me? It’s my birthday and you didn’t even congratulate\nMe: I didn’t see you\nEx: I was waiting for you so much, I even wrote a poem to you\nMe: Stop, Holding. That. Against me.\nEx: Ok, I’ll get to the caffeteria  now.\nMe, still in the building, thinking of a cup of coffee to go: which one?\nEx: the one on the 2nd floor.\n\nSo I avoid 2 floor and get coffee on ground floor. That was all our messaging. When I pick up my gf from the Homecoming, she’s infuriated. She is screaming because she saw my texts to ex and we made an agreement before that. I’m trying to say that I was trying to get off the convo and there’s a good reason I used iMessages - cause she is blocked everywhere else. GF don’t wanna hear, she says it didn’t look like rejection and was all like  “You. Talked. To. Her.” It took me three hours to convince her not to cut our relationship right here and by that moment we were in my apartment and 1 hour later had consensual make-up sex. \n\nBefore we ended arguing, she said that she doesn’t want me to talk to my ex in any circumstances at all, not even telling her to get away from me. So, she is in the shower and I get a phone call from my ex’s roommate and she’s like “OP, it’s [ex name] birthday and she can’t stop crying because of you, could you please talk to her for a while?” I said no and hung up and blocked her number. Then I received an e-mail fron ex’s address saying she just wants to talk it out one last time so she’s comin to my place. \n\nThis is where my girlfriend comes out of the shower asking who called me and I tell her everything as is. Then I unblock the roommate and ask her to convince my ex not to do that because I’m not there and it’s a remote suburb area and she doesn’t know the address cause I only recently moved in. Roommate says ok. Girlfriend, knowing ex is stalking her IG takes a snap of the view from my window, posting it with a location (and nobody else me or ex of gf know lives here) and writes “this is gonna be one hot night”. When I asked her why would she do that, she said that my ex’s behavior made her cry so she’s gonna make her cry twice as hard. I should have been bothered by that and her reading my messages (she herself admitted that was messed up), but I just couldn’t bring myself to, despite her behavior deeply hurting the person I loved for 6 years. \n\nAITA for the way I treated my ex?\n\n\n",

      "description": "New account because main includes my name.\n\nThis was a couple years ago (2015).   \n\n\nSo this was my first relationship and it had been going on for about two years at the time. I was part way through the fall semester of my sophomore year and as per usual during that time high school homecomings were coming up. I had been setting up plans with my girlfriend at the time (a senior) on the events that would occur. Where we were eating, pictures, etc. After plans were put in place, I started to question if I was happy in the relationship. While not an extreme distance apart, it was still a fair commute. On top of the stresses and new experiences that college was offering I was finding that it wasn't worth sacrificing my happiness to remain in this relationship. However, I came to this conclusion just about a week before homecoming. At this point I was torn, I could've easily called her to let her know, but suddenly all the plans that were in place would fall apart and she would be left without a date on short notice. I could also just try to let her have one last week of happiness and then let her know after the dance. Out of these I chose door number 2 because i had already made a commitment to these plans and felt obligated to follow through with them.   \n\n\nSo the week goes by and I head home to prepare for the festivities. I do my best to act like nothings wrong. We go to dinner with some of her friends, have some laughs, eat decent food. Then we start making our way to the school. Apparently I'm not as good at acting as I thought, and she started to ask some questions. The usual, \"Are you OK?\", \"Is everything alright?\", and then finally as we pull into the parking lot and put my car into park she asks me in a scared voice \"Are you breaking up with me?\" In that moment I knew I was fucked. I had to answer honestly because if I lie and break up with her afterwords I'm a piece of shit. I told her that I didn't want it to happen like this, that i wanted her to have one last night where everything was alright and then tell her. Looking into her eyes I could see the pain she was feeling and I couldn't do anything to help in that moment. After a short conversation explain the why's and when's, we went inside and had as much fun as you could possibly imagine with a group of high school girls trying to kill me with their eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling I know a prevalent question that will be asked.\n\n\"So Pope, were there any other women you were romantically interested in or involved with?\"\n\nNo there were no other women involved in this decision. Just figured I'd save some typing for those who would ask.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Had a girlfriend, made plans for homecoming, week leading up to homecoming realized I wasn't happy, conflicted on how to break up, did it in person before her homecoming rather than a week earlier over the phone.  \n",

After a couple years down south, I met my husband. He’s also not from where we are now, but he is from the south. Early on in our relationship, I told him that I wanted to move back to the Midwest. I missed the snow, I missed my friends, my parents. I told him that if that was a dealbreaker for him, then we shouldn’t date. He said that he was fine with that. \n\nWe’ve been together for almost a decade now. We’re married, have a good friend group, a house, a dog, a kid. The plan of moving was pushed back repeatedly due to various reasons. Once, I even got a job offer to move back, but he told me that he wanted to establish his career a bit more before he moved so I turned it down. Every time we talked about moving to the Midwest, there was some reason or another for delaying the move. \n\nLast week I saw something about my hometown and I talked to my husband about moving to the Midwest soon-ish. He brought up the idea of staying down here forever. I was floored. I always assumed we would move, it was just a matter of when. He said that he’s not a fan of the cold, he dreads the thought of driving in snow, he doesn’t know anyone up there, we’d probably get pulled into occasional drama with my family, and we would both have to take a significant pay cut. This is all valid, but none of this is any different from when we first started dating. He told me that he went along with it at the time because he didn’t want to lose me. He figured that eventually he’d be okay with it. As it turns out, that didn’t happened.\n\nI feel like I’ve gotten a bait and switch. I was so clear about my end goal of moving back, and now it feels like I’ve gotten it taken away. But am I the asshole  for wanting to uproot my family from everything we know? My husband’s complaints are true. He doesn’t know anyone there. It sucks shovel snow at 6am in the winter to clear out the driveway. We have better job security down here due the demand in our field. We’ll be taking a ~40% pay cut. There’ll be more traffic, more crowds. But I feel trapped in a place that I don’t want to live for the rest of my life... \n\nTl;dr: Wife wants to move back to her hometown, as she had explicitly said when they first started dating. Husband thought he would be okay with it, but now realizes he doesn’t want to go. \n\n",

      "description": "Current situation: I am 18 and in my final semester of high school. I have been accepted into my dream university for a Bachelor of Science (with potential direct admission into medical school!! Super excited, sorry lol!!) and it's about a 3 hour drive away. I've lived in my current city my whole life and have had my three best friends since elementary school, and one of them turned into my boyfriend somewhere along the line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my friends so much, we have been through thick and thin. Grown up together and all that. But I definitely noticed that around 15-17 years of age that we started to have conflicting interests, which is to be expected since kids who get along great can grow up into very different adults. \n\nThe first friend called Olive has gotten a drug dealing boyfriend who is 23, unemployed and lives at his parents house. Now she lives there as well, despite being only 17. She doesn't like school, has always struggled with it (she's got a really bad learning disability) and is really close to dropping out/being expelled if she continues to skip it. She often skips school to work as a cashier at a grocery store. She is a really sweet person and it's hard to watch her life go downhill like this, especially when school is such a top priority in my personal opinion (alas, certainly not hers). I want her to get a high school diploma and I've always thought she'd be amazing at working with children, like in a daycare, since that was her plan before she met her boyfriend. All she ever wants to talk about now is her boyfriend, sex and how awful everything is. Her life problems are now much different than mine, so if I vent about something like not having enough gas in my car, I always end up feeling guilty because her problems are much worse. \n\nSecond friend, Scarlet, is not very interested in education either. She just wants high school over with so she can start working as a photographer and start her own business. Which is great, her boyfriend is in college for film and animation so they are very artsy and I hope they become successful in their entrepreneurial endeavours. But me being sciencey and her being artsy we don't really have much in common anymore either. She also likes to smoke a lot of weed and I really don't (gives me panic attacks) so since she pretty much never wants to do anything sober it's a little difficult.\n\nNow for my boyfriend, Russ, who is much too long of a story to tell in full. To summarize: I do not feel romantic attraction, never had. He very much does, and says he's in love with me. I feel bad about it, but hey we are happy and we have lots of great sex. Unconventional relationship? Yes, but we've made it work for 3 years, and have been best friend for much longer. However, now I am going to uni and he is taking a gap year after high school to play video games in his basement. Unlike my other two friends, Russ and I still have very much in common. We are the kind of relationship you see in movies, we finish each other's sentences and argue like an old married couple. But he wants to get married and have lots of kids, and I definitely do not ever want to get married and I maybe want to adopt one kid when I'm well past 30. So I realize I should not hold him back from meeting new people who may be down for the whole marriage/kids thing by dating him for as long as possible. It's just not right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I pretty much predict that I'll drift away from Olive and Scarlet as I will be in uni and they'll be in the work force so we won't have much in common, and I'll be 3 hours away. We will all be very busy and we'll meet new people. As for Russ, I feel I need to end the relationship even though we are each other's lifeline because long distance would be rough and I don't want to prevent him from meeting someone who will want to be his wife and have his kids. So one night Olive, Scarlet and I were hanging out (no Russ) and this came up in conversation. I mentioned something along the lines of \"yeh, well we'll all probably drift apart next year. That's sad, isn't it?\" and they got kinda defensive, telling me I shouldn't assume that. They were a little mad. \n\nLater I mentioned to Russ that long distance would be hard and maybe we should start talking about what we want to do when I leave. He was totally against ending it, saying he reaalllly wants to try and make it work. I know he still hopes I will cave in one day and agree to his ideal lifestyle. I won't. I will come home on some weekends and holidays since I am lucky enough to have a car, but idk I still feel selfish and like I am anchoring him down. I also know I might meet people who I'll want to have sex with, etc. at university and I would never cheat but I'd end up wanting to break up with him then, you know? So it seems cruel to keep it going when I think there's good possibility I'll want to have sex with other people eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, both my friends and my boyfriend are appalled that I assumed we'd drift apart once I left for uni. I want to try and stay in touch with them but just didn't think we'd be close anymore. Tbh I really think that in a years time we will all have met many new people and changed a lot. Am I the asshole for being ok with the possibility of losing my closest friendships and relationships?  Idk, maybe I should put time and energy into preserving them?",

      "title": "AITA for “friend-zoning” one of my best friends?",
      "description": "Here’s some backstory. We will call my friend Mike. Also, I’m a female. Just clarifying. \n\nMike and I met when we were both in High-school, although I am a bit older than he is. We shared a class together and when I first saw him, I knew I wanted to be friends. I usually got that feeling when I saw people who ended up becoming a close friend. I love having friends, and ended up making some life long friends in middle school and high school. It’s been over 10 years since I graduated, and “friend zoning” wasn’t a big term yet. \n\nI met Mike when I was a senior, and he was a sophomore. I was in a serious relationship at the time and had already been so since I was a junior. Things were going great at this point in my relationship, and life seemed to be great as well. \n\nWhen Mike and I first became friends, I only ever had platonic feelings for him. We became fast friends, having tons\nof things in common and generally making each other laugh out asses off. I wasn’t the type to cheat or even emotionally cheat, and I should have spotted the signs that Mike was interested in me but I honestly thought he cared for me just as much as a friend. \n\nFast forward a couple years out of high school, and I had left my long term relationship. I had just turned 21 and wasn’t ready to be tied down. There was more out there for me to discover so I\nbroke things off, and it wasn’t easy but I had good friends including Mike that were there for me. I eventually started\ndating... a lot. I never once considered Mike an option to date. \n\nIn my earlier years of school and after my 4 year relationship, I had quite a number of small time boyfriends. I liked to make out with boys but that was about it. Sometimes I would make out with a random cute boy at a party, even if I didn’t have feelings for him and wouldn’t even feel bad about it. I still never thought of doing this with Mike. \n\nI had grown to love Mike deeply,  but only as a friend. Have you ever loved someone so much and wanted the best for them, but not in a romantic way? That was totally it. I genuinely cared so much for this guy. We eventually became room mates and this is where things got bad between us. \n\nAt that point we had been friends for 6 years already and no romantic connection between us. After we started living together, everything was\ngreat because we had amazing times partying with our friends, getting stoned or watching movies, going out, cooking dinners, getting drunk, all sorts of shit. We had crazy good times. \n\nUntil I started bringing over guys I was seeing. He would become cold and withdrawn, give me the cold shoulder, start acting like a brat pretty much. Mike also had one serious girlfriend while he was in high school, but nothing else after that. He never dated around\nlike I did. \n\nI found out why because he eventually confessed that he was in love with me\nand had been since high school. And as my heart sunk, I had to tell him I didn’t feel the same. Things were awkward after that since we lived together. \n\nEventually we moved passed that somehow and I got the impression he was over it. \n\nOur lease ended and we decided to move back into our families houses, and for awhile it was still sort of awkward but then we started hanging out again more and more. I kept exploring the dating field and basically trying to live my life. \n\nOne night he was hanging out with me at my parents house, who he was very close to as well, and he basically erupted because I was talking about a guy I was currently seeing to my Mom. When Mike and I got back to my room to chill, he got mad and confessed he was still feeling the same about me and that it wasn’t fair that I never gave him a chance at love. \n\nI was starting to get pissed off about the whole ordeal because I had never given him any sign that I was into him like that. No kisses, no flirting, no touching, and no leading on.. and here I am losing a great friendship that I valued, trusted and cared a great deal over. He didn’t think it was fair that I didn’t love him back?! When I never did???? \n\nThen he said this. “I should have kissed you when we first started hanging out. You would have fell for me. “ \n\nSo I had to hit him with some cold facts. \n\n“You and I never had a chance to start. I was already in a serious relationship when we met that lasted years after that. I grew to love you as a brother and I’m sorry if that’s not enough, but it will never be more than that. I don’t love you. “ \n\nHe left my house, extremely\npissed off and we haven’t been friends since. I think about him everyday. I miss my best friend so much but I understand if he can’t be around me. It hurts to be around the one you love, but doesn’t love you back. I wish him well still. \n\nBut I always wonder if I’m an asshole for how I handled things. I know I was being honest to myself but should I have looked deeper for those signs and prevented a 6+ year friendship from\ncrashing and burning? AITA for never giving him a chance? I just don’t think I could have done that. \n\nTL/DL: 6+ years of being just friends,\nTurned down male best friend twice,\nWalked out on after confrontation and truth being spat out. AITA for never giving him a chance? ",

      "description": "I live in another state from my extended family and rarely see them. I have had a lot of issues with them in the past when I lived in the same city. Most of my issues are with my uncle. \n\nOptional backstory: \nWhen I had a severe spine injury two years ago and was unable to work (or walk) for over a year Uncle loudly said at dinner with my entire family that I was leeching off the government and was a drain on society. The government money didn’t even cover my physio therapy costs. I still raked up 15k in medical debt. \n\nAfter my surgeries Uncle offered me an “easy relaxed office job” at his company only a few weeks out of surgery, which turned out to be a total lie and was actually lifting boxes in a warehouse. The contract I signed said data entry position and at no point did I use a computer or sit down. I quit after one day and he told my family I was just being lazy and I had multiple family members chew me out for quitting. I ended the day in excruciating pain to the point of tears from all the bending. He also routinely insulted me for my weight (I was on a lot of pain medication and couldn’t move let alone exercise) and my paleness (I’m usually very tanned but couldn’t leave my bed so I got very pale)\n\nSTORY: \n\nRecently I went down to visit them in their state, it was the first time seeing them since the incidents and I had never received an apology. I told myself I wasn’t taking any shit this time and would stand up for myself. The very first day my uncle and two cousins started a few harmless jokes that I am gay, I’m no longer overweight and am in far better shape than all of them and I’m very tanned so they had to resort to random untrue insults. At first I laughed along, but for the remainder of the day it was essentially all they would talk about, just constant jokes for hours on end about how many guys I fuck, how much cum I’ve swallowed, etc. \n\nMy entire family of about 10 people went to dinner on the first night at a very formal restaurant. After 30 minutes of  gay jokes I just kinda exploded. I stood up and yelled at all three of them that they are a bunch of immature jealous cunts that need to grow the fuck up and get a fucking life. The tirade went for a while and it’s a bit of a haze, I know I swore at them a whole lot more before storming out of the restaurant. I made quite a scene. \nSince then I’ve had other members of the family tell me I owe them (particularly my uncle) an apology, but I don’t think I do. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\n",

We had a nice chat and she was going to sleep. Texts me a little later saying she's having a panic attack. I offer to come over and she's not against it, I get a £41 uber to the next city cause I'm drunk af to go and comfort her. We meet, chat, go up to her room, go out to smoke, go back again. Everything is really chill and I've made it clear already by straight up telling her that I only came to help, and that if we do have sex (which is implied, but not expected) then that's just an added bonus.\n\nWe go back up to her room and talk again, both go to sleep in the same bed together, she tells me she doesn't want to have sex, but we've made out a few times already. I tell her \"You just don't want to have sex right?\" and affirms that, so I start making out with her again. I tell her \"tell her if you get uncomfortable\" before going further. We end up going all the way and there's even pause for me to put a condom on and she's going with it.\n\nI get a text a couple nights after after checking that things are okay on her end cause she got so many issues. She tells me she didn't really want what happened that night and that she regrets it. I'm so angry at her, but should I have been more cautious? Checked more? Just respected it when she said no sex?

We usually have online dates where we watch movies or shows at the same time. One day she mentioned how she's so tired of watching movies and wants to go on a real date. Which I don't  blame her for, but it's just something to consider. Although I must add, she has always been incredible towards me and our relationship. \n\n\nAbout a week later, aka today, she is asking me if she can go out for tacos with her coworker alone. I mention I'm uncomfortable with it when she asked me &amp; she said that she will try to get other coworkers to come but if not then she's going to go with him alone after work tomorrow.\n\n\nI do trust her, but it's likely just my own insecurities getting in the way from me feeling okay with this. I don't have a problem with her going out alone with some other guy friends she has because I've grown comfortable to them. But this guy I don't know well &amp; I'm not sure how to feel about it. Although, he does have a girlfriend too.\n\n\n I'm not one to tell her what she can and can't do in her life, but I think it's important to communicate our concerns. I want more opinions to help me think more clearly. Therefore, I'm asking Reddit if AITA for not wanting her to go? ",

      "description": "I work at a pizza place as a driver, it's nice, I really love this job. The only problem I have is with a coworker. She works hard, is honest, and the customers like her because she likes to have a lot of small talk. I usually don't mind it either, what bothers me about her is that she touches me without my permission (I've told her not to), blatantly interrupts things I'm doing to tell me some boring, long story that I don't care about, and often interjects herself into conversations that are completely unrelated to her. It seems like she doesn't comprehend the idea that people don't care about her stories or her anecdotes even though they visibly seem annoyed or bored with it. Last night everything ended up coming to a head. For context, I have a dissociative disorder that's typically brought on by stress. I run on autopilot and end up with a lot of my actual thinking being more drawn into trying to recover. When this comes up, I go off to do dishes alone to help recover until it's time for me to take a drive. She decided she wanted to help me out, and I told her \"No, it's fine.\" No one at my work knows about my condition.\n\nShe didn't budge, but I was in no position to argue as my mind began to disconnect. She started rambling, and I was tuning her out while I phased in and out of reality like I was an ethereal being. I was trying to ground myself. Eventually she poked me kinda hard and my body recoiled, I just stared at her like 'what the hell?' She asked if I'd heard her, and I shrugged, telling her, that I would if she had anything of value to listen to. She was offended, naturally and called me rude and told me that I should at least listen to what she's saying. She proceeded to shove my shoulder lightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decide it's time for the hard truth. I explained to her bluntly, that her touching me made me incredibly uncomfortable because she's my coworker, not my girlfriend. I went on to tell her that her anecdotes and stories weren't interesting in the slightest and that her obnoxious humming to the store music grated on everyone who could hear it. I finished by telling her that she wasn't terrible to be around, but that it'd be great if she was self aware enough to understand that people find her really annoying and if she could recognize that she'd be much more tolerable. I was frustrated with her, honestly, fed up with the touching and her constant babbling about bullshit that was always stacked onto stress from rush hours or from being incredibly tired and not wanting to deal with her. She just was so obliviously unaware of people despite the fact that we were visibly tired and vocal with our feelings. I just kinda let it all out on her and part of me felt bad because it was harsh, but I felt like it was necessary to make her understand. She left the dish pit and avoided me for the rest of the night, which I have to say made the night easier.",

At the same time, he dosen't have many friends and I think it'd be a bitchy move to suddenly ditch him over something thats not even his fault. \n\nAnother problem is that he's friends with my next door neighbor, so we'd run into eachother all the time.\n\nBtw, we do not go to school together.\n\nWe have not seen eachother since we stopped dating almost two weeks ago, but he wants to hang out soon, so my question is, would I be the asshole if I stayed friends with him?

      "description": "I’m going to be honest and upfront here. I’m 30 years old. My hometown is so small it maybe has 5 traffic lights. The running joke is that there are two types of people who grow up there, either you’re type A who leaves and is able to go out into the world and explore what it has to offer or you’re type B who is still doing the exact same things you did while in high school just while slowly growing older, \n\nAnyways, while I was in school  my best friend lived next to this guy, we’ll call him bob. Most people loved bob because he was brash, loud and blunt. He’s the guy that makes fun of others and everyone  joins in and has fun until they are on the receiving end of it. I wanted to get along with him because my best friend was in love with his Friend and I’m of course wing girl. Lol. Well bob made it seem like we were cool until one day he gives me a letter (back when people used paper and pencils instead of phones to communicate) saying the person he liked was me. I laughed and said he was lying and had to take off because I was late to my next class. Looking back it’s like that the minute I knew it all messed up. \n\nSince that time to .this. Day. He was such a dick. He made my life hell, I was a hoe, a whore, a bitch, everything under the sun. He would stand and yell in the cafeteria in front of everyone that I’m all these ugly things. He would tell his friends he lied about the letter because he wanted to get me alone and videotape me wanting to sleep with him (I have no idea where he got that I would) and then record him rejecting me.  It was fucking hell.  He’d follow me from class to class. People would tell me that they knew I was in love with HIM because that’s what was going around. (Lookingnback im like...small town mentality for the win, way to make up your own minds people)\n\nA close friend and I lost contact because he and her got together after high school and I wanted to avoid the drama of being around him and I didn’t want to hang out while they were together. she said I needed to get over it. But mutual friends of ours would say he’s always saying I’m a life ruiner.\n\nI had a party once and I didn’t know this guy was one of his friends was there. I let him know a lot of people might be showing up and that he needs to be careful with his belongings. Turns out that night he got jacked because he put his wallet down on the table and someone stole it.  He in turn relayed the story to bob and of course, it’s my fault. \n\nIt wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t constantly brought up as if it happened yesterday instead of ten years ago. Then they add onto it and say the worst types of things. \n\nWell. It’s the holidays. I want to go back to my hometown and visit but I have such massive anxiety when I think about running into him or anyone he knows. All my ex’s are best friends with him. All the friends I had are now like buddy buddy with him. It’s so freaking weird and I don’t know what to do. \nI don’t want to be around the crazy crazy drama but im slowly shutting out more and more people.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to avoid drama and  avoid my arch nemesis?",

We were chatting for a while until I heard one of them constantly sighing. I don't know if I was reading too much into it, but I thought that it was supposed to be a sign that we were bothering him, so I told my coworker, \"Hey, let's move to your desk.\" And he replied, \"Uhh why?\" I said, \"Some people are working.\"\n\nSo we moved, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that saying it like that made me come off as an asshole both to my coworker and to the people who were working. Again, maybe I'm looking too much into it, but I'm afraid that I...\n\n1. made my coworker think that I was trying to point out that they were being inconsiderate by having to point out that we were bothering people who were working.\n\n2. made my working coworkers think that I was angry that I had to move because they were working, which is not true at all.\n\nNow, of course, I don't know if this is exactly how they feel, but the words that I chose just make me feel like I made both parties feel bad instead of good. Did I do something wrong? Did I pick my words right? Or am I just being over-analytical?\n\nJust for clarification: they never really gave any sign that they were bothered at all. It's just something that I consider to be a possibility (that is, that they were somehow offended by what I said).",

      "description": "This just happened on vacation with my wife. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is a type 1 (juvenile) diabetic and has been since she was 10. We were in a tourist-heavy city walking around and taking in the views. Unfortunately, while walking around, she started getting light-headed. She pricked her finger to test her blood sugar and saw it was a fearful 41. Additionally, as far as she recalls, that is the lowest her blood sugar had ever been as well. For those unfamiliar, while it varies person-to-person, anything under 70 is considered very bad. Usually it results in the form of dizziness, weakness of muscle, and a slew of other bad symptoms. Even worse yet, she didn't realize it until we were in the moment, but she didn't have anything to bring up her blood sugar either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur options were limited, but thankfully, we were right next to a McDonald's and we figured it would be easy to go in, grab a soda, and bring her blood sugar up. Needless to say, it didn't quite go as expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where my assolhery comes into question. We got inside and all the lines were long and the room was flooded with people. I sat my wife down at a table at their bar area and skipped to the front of the line. I frantically asked if I could have a cup for a soda, as my wife is diabetic, and that I would gladly pay after she can bring her blood sugar up. The employees, as well as everyone I skipped in line, seemed noticeably irritated at me at this point. The employee agreed to giving me the cup, but I would have to pay first, as it was policy. I quickly explained that this was urgent and that my wallet was in the backpack my wife had, but he was having none of it. I ran over, grabbed my wallet from the backpack, and went back to the front of the line. As all the employees were tied up taking orders, I waited what felt like minutes (but in reality was maybe a minute or two) for them to finish up so I could purchase the soda. As he rang me up for the soda, admittedly, I angrily and loudly was expressed my disgust with the way they handled the situation. In retrospect, most everyone in the restaurant probably thought I was an asshole. I even think I could have handled the situation much better and feel bad for the employee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the question is, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

I made 250k for the calendar year for 2018 and got a huge commission cheque in December that pushed me there. In celebration of that I bought a pretty nice vintage Rolex for 10k CAD last week, I've been eyeing it for a while as I'm trying to step my watch game up. When I brought it home I whipped it out and my GF was like wtf how much did you spend on that, and got super mad once I told her 10k. She said that I should have asked her first, and it was disrespectful that I would spend that kinda money behind her back. Also said something how couples usually talk about spending that type of money on something especially on a piece of jewelry. I was kinda shocked and said, ahhh I spend my money on this not \"ours\" but she still insisted I should have let her know still. I feel like it may have something to do with the fact she makes like 40k a year and felt like I was trying to show off to her? But I was just showing her how cool it was etc. She's been moody since and said it was a dickish thing to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my bestfriend to make time for me?",
      "description": "Right now my bestfriend(F) and I(M) aren't talking to each other. The reason is:\n\nFor about 2-3 months every time we met up, she would ask me \"is it okay, if I leave in 1-2 hours to meet up with another friend of mine\" or cancel on me to meet with other friends. I usually said okay, because I can't force her to hang out with me. I personally didn't like it, because it makes me feel unappreciated, but I didn't voice it, since I don't want to pressure her.\n\nWhat broke the camel's back, was that she canceled on me again one day before we were supposed to meet up. Her reasoning was, that she has stuff to do the next day and doesn't have time to hang out. Sure whatever. I can understand it. Since I didn't have something to do on that day, I decided to grab some snacks from the supermarket and watch Netflix for the night. \n\nIn the parking lot a person started to run up to me and I thought \"do I have to kick a bitch into the face?\". To my surprise the person was my bestfriend. She hugged me and apologized, that she couldn't make it today. It was strange to me, why she was at the parking lot, since she lives in a different town. So I ask her, what is she doing here. Her response: \"my friend invited me to a birthday party of [some dude she hardly knows]\". I was pissed because she didn't have time for me, but for a dude she doesn't know. I just responded with \"okay. Have fun, bye\" in the most passive aggressive way possible as I walk away.\n\n Shortly after this, she messaged me, saying, that I was an asshole by being indifferent towards her. This pissed me of more, so I responded \"well I think you are an asshole for rather going to a party of a dude, you hardly know, than spending time with me\". She called me an egoist, to which I said \"for wanting to spend with you? Sure.\" She said, that I shouldn't message her.\n\nFor context, she does this a lot. Every year I've known her, she would tell me, that I shouldn't contact her for a while. Usually the reasons were \"you are too close to me\" and/or \"there is too much going on In my life. I need some distance\". Every time this happened I made the effort to be there for her, even while keeping distance, by telling her, that she could come to me whenever.\n\nThis is the first time, this happened because of me. Since I didn't think, that I was  wrong, I didn't plan to do the same effort or apologize. It's been one month since we last talked with her and I start to miss her. I'm starting to think, that, what I did, was egotistical and possessive, but at the same time, I think, she should contact me first.\n\nSo I'm thinking, whether I should apologize or not.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend of about 2 years and I have been going through a rough patch lately. One of the ongoing issues between the two of us is that I feel like I'm not a priority, especially when it comes to his family and even more specifically when it comes to his mom. We've been working on it though, but I've told him repeatedly I'm sort of at the end of my rope with coming in last in terms of priorities.\n\nRecently we decided that it would be best for our relationship if we only lived together part time. Last week we set \"our\" days (Friday, Saturday, Monday and Wednesday) that we would be together. The other nights he stays in his mom's spare bedroom (this was 100% his choice - I'd also be happy to switch on and off the nights I'm at our apartment, but that's what he wanted to do.)\n\nSo this is the first week we're really putting into practice the whole set days together and apart thing. On Wednesday his mom texts in him in the morning saying that she needs helping moving some things in the spare bedroom, and that Friday night is the only time she can do it. He explains that no, he can't because we have plans. But then she texts him saying that she feels like she can't rely on him anymore. \n\nThis is again an ongoing issue. I really like his mom, but she does have a nasty habit of asking for things at the last minute, or asking for things at a very specific time and getting kind of passive-aggressive if he doesn't do it exactly when and how she wants. \n\nThey talk it out, he explained why he couldn't do Friday, his mom said OK, and they came to a compromise. I thought that was the end of it. After that, we made plans to see some of his friends who are coming from out of town on Friday night.\n\nThen yesterday, he messages me in the middle of the day saying that something changed from his mom's perspective and he does still have to help his mom on Friday, but maybe we could meet up with our friends afterwards. \n\nAITA for being super pissed about this? It was one thing when he was bailing on what was supposed to be \"our\" night. But then that night opens back up, we make actual concrete plans with other people, and he bails AGAIN.\n\nHe keeps saying he didn't make the decision lightly, but I do feel like I always come last. Seriously, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So, a little backstory. My friends and I play games together, but it's often only 2 or 3 people playing a game out of 5 or 6, because the others don't have said game. The one game that we all have in common is League of Legends, which as those who have played it know, an incredibly frustrating game if taken too seriously. Most of us are fine with losing, because in the end we have fun regardless, but one of my friends clearly takes the game far more seriously than us, and after losing one or two games, regardless of how many we've won before, he'll quit the Discord server and leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I have no problem with people who take the game seriously. It often leads to them trying very hard to win, which is fine because I like winning as much as the next guy. But this friend, he just completely shuts down, doesn't talk to anyone for hours, and is just demoralizing/disappointing when this happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night was the last straw for me. He loaded into the game late, which resulted in him being slightly behind compared to our enemies. After playing for a few minutes and dying a couple of times, he left the game, the voice channel, and we didn't hear from him until the morning after, which is when the A-holery began. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not particularly confrontational, so I never know what to say in these types of situations, which is why I think I may have come off as way more rude than I intended. When I told him about how pissed I was the night before because he just left the game, essentially ruining everyone else's fun, and guaranteeing that we'd lose in a 4v5, he went silent and left as usual. I then messaged him, saying that I get that he's an emotional person and takes this type of stuff at heart, but it's a f'ing game, and if he gets this upset over losing he should just stop playing, because otherwise he ruins the fun for everyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? Although I don't regret telling him what I told him, I kind of regret the way I told him, which might have been a bit too aggressive. I understand why he does it, but I also firmly believe that if given the choice of playing a game that might make you upset and just not risking it and not playing, he should definitely not play. On top of that, if you have to suffer through a 20 minute game which you hate to avoid pissing off and ruining the fun for 4 other people, 1 or 2 of which are your actual irl friends, you should do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, tell me Reddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not speaking to my father with stage 4 cancer?",
      "description": "I’m sorry in advance if this turns into a long winded or poorly written post, I’m just very emotional right now...\n\nTo preface, a couple of months ago my dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Thankfully, it was operable and he just underwent surgery last week (it was successful) and he is currently recovering (2 week convalescence) in the hospital.\n\nMy mother (who works part time) stays in the hospital with him for practically the whole day while I go to school and study for exams. \n\nNow for the fun part, \n\nA couple of hours ago, my phone was getting pinged (through find my IPhone) every second. I knew this was my dad (because he thinks this is an acceptable way to get someone’s attention, not call or text them), so I give him a call.\n\nHe immediately starts screaming at me for a good 10 minutes about how I never call him, I never visit him, I never text him, and how I don’t love him. He then says how I’m terribly immature, how I’ll never amount to anything, and how in 10-20 years I’ll still be as stupid as I am now.\n\nThen my moms comes and starts telling me the same things.\n\nTo me, this is unjustified because,\n\n\n1. I was told that he would call me if he wanted to speak to me, and that I was not to disturb him.\n\n2. I’m always available, no matter how busy with school, to come visit him. A couple of days ago, I just dropped everything on a moment’s notice and took a cab to the hospital (a good one hour journey). But when I got there, I was only with him for like 20 minutes before I was basically told to leave. I barely even got the chance to talk to him because my mom (who I suspect is a total narcissistic) was mainly just ranting about how her mom (who also had and died from cancer) had it harder than my dad, how her mom’s friends were much more supportive than my dad’s current friends, how her own friends (who dropped by once for 10 minutes) are doing so much more than my dad’s main friend (who comes by multiple times a day to check on him and bring him things to decorate his room/talk to him) is doing “the bare minimum of what would be excpected of him.” Or, she was just saying how hard my dad’s sickness was on HER, or how she was SO disappointed that some friends didn’t drop by within the first two days.\n\n3. I always respond right away when my mom sends me updates, and I’m always ready to meet her at the hospital.\n\nThis also isn’t the first time that my parents complained about me, it’s probably their favourite pastime. Think of them as tiger parents who are too lazy to actually get their children to do stuff, so they just complain\n\nEx: \n\nThem: Hey J-JG, our friend Jason’s son is captain of his school’s hockey team? Why don’t you play sports?\n\nMe: I’m still physically active, I walk to and from school (40 minutes each way) everyday, plus I go hiking, biking and skiing with you guys. \n\nThem: Yes but organized sports are so important (ignoring the fact that my mom was a vegetable till she met my dad, who’s very sporty)\n\nMe: What about the fact that’s Jason’s son started drinking at 12, got suspended 5 times, and is basically failing all his classes, whereas I’m the top student at my school.\n\nThem: Well I guess you both have your flaws (!?)\n\nOr, how about:\n\nThem: J-JG, (insert whatever kid they’re obsessed with this week’s name here) is doing Model UN (or whatever extracurricular activity), you should to!\n\nMe: Well I’m already captain of my schools trivia team and one of the best in the province.\n\nThen: that’s good, I guess, whatever\n\nThat was a bit off-topic, sorry (I just need to vent)\nSo basically, AITA for “not communicating” with my sick dad, even though on multiple occasions I dropped everything to be with him at the hospital, and the only reason I didn’t text/call is because I didn’t want to disturb him and I didn’t even know if he could use his phone (he’s very weak right now and he never texted or called me). Also, he or my mom were supposed to contact me when it was convenient for them instead of me calling them.\n\nI sort of fell that this is just part of my parents weird behaviour where I’m never adequate to them.\n\n*Forgot to add that most days I can’t even see my dad because my mom invites 20 of her shallow friends to see him, and then he’s too tired to even see me after I’m done with school :(\n\n",

      "description": "TLDR – Best friend borrows my motorbike for extended periods of time, crashes it and refuses to assist in getting my money back\nOk I’ll try and keep this short and sweet, but there are a lot of details to cover. Also, first ever post so apologies for poor spelling, formatting etc. And if this isn’t suited to this forum then I apologise.\nSo this happened around July last year and goes on for about 3 months.\nSo me and my best friend at the time decide that we want to pursue a big dream of ours in getting our motorcycle licenses and buying our first bikes. So, I immediately go and get my learners license within the month (I live in AUS which has a graduated license scheme for motorbikes called LAMS, important for later on). To begin with we both get these two dinky little 125cc runabouts but they soon become too slow for our needs of getting to work and blasting back roads.\nSo I decide to bite the bullet and go and buy a brand new KTM RC390 ($6,000) with some financial assistance from my parents. They bought the bike outright and I paid them back $500 a week till I paid off the bike. This is majority of my pay for that time so it was such a good feeling when it was paid off. And I enjoy the hell out of it for the next couple months, loved every second of having it.\nMy mate sees this and decides that he needs a bigger bike as well, he then proceeds to buy a full blown dirt bike (Yamaha WR450F) with the intention of putting road tyres on it. This doesn’t happen.\nAnother important detail in this is that I also own a car and have my full license and he does not have either, so his only option is to ride his bike, on knobby dirt tyres. As you can imagine this is not the safest option for riding on the roads. After a couple of months, he asks me if he could borrow my bike to go and visit his parents, who live about 100km away. There was a chance of rain that weekend and he wanted the security of the road tyres and ABS that my bike had. I of course said yes.\nOver the next couple weeks he asks me again, citing bad roads, weather etc etc. And me not thinking anything of it say sure you can borrow it for the weekend. It gets to the point that he is using the bike so often that it lives at his place for a week or two at a time. At first I didn’t really think anything of it, but after a while I began to feel taken advantage of and asked for the bike to be returned. For some context, at the point where I had asked for it back the bike had 7,500km or there about on the odometer, of which only 2,500km of those were ridden by me. And whenever I got the bike back it would always be dirty and he never offered to service the bike. But it always had a full tank so props to him.\nJump to July last year and two main things come up. I am about to fly out of country to attend a wedding in England for a few weeks, and my learner license is expiring in a few days.  In AUS you have 12 months from receiving your L’s to then go for the next level of license you red P’s before it expires and you have to retake the L’s course. In a combination of bad organisation and lack of confidence riding because I haven’t ridden my bike all that much I hadn’t gone for my reds. So before I leave my mate asks if he can use my bike while I’m away since I wont be using it, things were a bit strained between us at this point cause of other issues, but I agree on the proviso that he takes it in for a service seeing as he’s used the bike for so long.\nAbout two weeks into my 4-week trip I get a message from him, he’s been in an accident on my bike. Wasn’t his fault he assures me but someone clipped him going around a round-about. I never hear the full story but the damage wasn’t that bad, broken clutch lever and gear peg, so I don’t think much of it. At this point I’ve decided that I’m taking the bike back after its been serviced and he can find some other way to get around. So, I get home a 2 weeks later and ask him if he’s had the bike serviced, no he hasn’t. I tell him that I need it done asap as I’m going to get my license again and frankly, I’m sick of him mooching off me. He agrees and tells me its booked in for a service next weekend.\nAt this point I should mention that we work together at the same job and that’s where some of the other issues are coming from. I wont go into detail but in short he was not in anyone’s good books at the company and a few people were refusing to work with him. Anyway, I get to work the Monday after the bike is supposed to have been serviced, haven’t heard from friend all weekend. My boss comes up to me and asks if everything is ok with said friend and if he is alright. I have no idea what he’s talking about and he then informs me that my ‘mate’ has been in a serious accident on Friday. Keep in mind it’s a fairly small company I work for and most of the other staff are on the same site. Also, most of them have heard about the accident already. I was the last person to find out, so I ask if he’s alright. Oh yeah he’s fine, just a fractured arm, nothing too bad, but the bikes fucked. Turns out most of the guys on site had pictures of the accident, I only found out there was an accident 5 minutes ago. Now I’m not normally given to losing my temper but finding this out second hand was too much for me and I snapped, in front of everyone. I sent him a message asking him what the hell was going on and didn’t get an answer. I call my dad and have a massive rant over the phone about it and ask what I should do. He tells me to take a walk and that he will sort it out, he and the  father of my friend know each other from way back and he says he will call him.\nThe next day I get a message from my friend finally, he gives me a sap story about how it wasn’t his fault and it was someone else etc etc I think expecting some sympathy from me. I was still irate at having found out second hand 3 days after the fact so I ask him why the hell didn’t you call me and let me know what had happened, why did I have to find out from the people we work with what happened. He responds with, oh I sent you a text but it mustn’t have gone through. I’m pretty angry at what I deemed a fairly limp wristed reason so I don’t reply for fear of saying something stupid. Now the bike did not have insurance on it at the time because I wasn’t able to afford it, but there was an agreement that “you break it you buy it” whenever we used each other’s stuff. I get in touch with his dad and say that I wasn’t involved in the accident and have no details, your son needs to sort this out and find a way to repay me the value of the bike, whether that be out of his own pocket or through the courts. He agrees immediately because he has seen his son use my bike basically every weekend and doesn’t think its fair for me to take a hit like that when I wasn’t using it.\nThis has been a lot longer than I expected so ill cut to the chase, after a number of back and forths between me and my friend, in which I tell him I don’t care how you pay me back the value of the bike but that’s your problem to deal with. He comes back and says that there is nothing he can do through the courts and I need to pursue this on my own. At this point it has been 3 months since the accident and I don’t have any details of any kind so I can’t effectively plead a case in court. After 3 months of this im tired of it and decide to drop it after losing my best mate and a number of other friends in that circle because I couldn’t stand to be around him.\nSo I ask am I the asshole in this? Should I have dealt with it differently? I’ve tried to be as impartial as possible with the info but at the end of the day I’m human and I can only see it through my own lens.\n \n",

(Hes also like 6'3\" 230 and is pretty built) This kid arbitrarily sorts people into good and evil the first time he sees a new person. There is no rhyme or reason to this. He is super friendly and nice to the good people. He likes to scream at and attack evil people because as he says \"Its fun!\".\n\nThis applies to staff and other students. He's kicked a 7 year old before, because the 7 year old said \"hi\" to him and he didn't like him.\n\nOn friday, this kid attacked one of his TAs in the morning, he was restrained, and seemed to settle down as the day went one. Later that day, at lunch, he began hitting another staff with his plastic lunch tray. As staff went to restrain him again, in the process he bit off a decent part of a staff member's finger. Which he thought was \"super funny\"\n\nAfter, when we had a staff debriefing about it, I said something like \"I know he's autistic, but he attacks people just because he doesnt like them, that makes him an asshole\"\n\nNow several of my coworkers are upset with me for saying that and think Im an asshole for saying it. (As I was saying earlier Ive worked here for years and love these kids and am usually very understanding when I or someone else gets attacked)\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So my mom got a phone like about a month ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that phone was from a public bathroom at her work where someone left it.\n\nMy mom wants me to try to reset it so that later we can use it or something.\n\nI inspected it and it says that the iPhone is lost and I need to return it to a certain police station.\n\nSince I don't have time to do it, I said I will take the phone and give it to a friend who live near that station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said no and that we should just keep it.\n\nI was confused as hell, why should we keep it for?\n\nShe said that she was afraid that they could track back to it and think that she stole it.\n\nSo I rubbed the phone clean of fingerprints and whatever to assure her. She was still like no no no.\n\nI insisted anyways but then she said that she will just take it and drop it near bathroom then.\n\nI denied that because it will be suspicious, and it will be easy to find who 'did' it because only the workers at the place are suspects. I said the best will be just dropping it at train station or something, and someone else will handle it. Then my mom say that there are cameras. So I said drop it inside the trains, which have no cameras. But she still say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on arguing with my mom more but she just wouldn't agree so we called in my uncle.\n\nMy uncle agrees that we should just keep it.\n\nSo I asked him what's the point. And he said that maybe after a long long time it will be usable. And I told him that day will never come but he insists anyways. His logic is same as my mom but only more stubborn.\n\nSo after a really long time of repeating same stuff around and around, I conceded.\n\nIn the end, they think that I should've give up earlier, and that I was kind of a pain in the ass for not giving up sooner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So, there is a mean old lady living two floors below me.  She'll be \"mean\" in this story, because previously we had rather good relationships, albeit never really spoke. I knew where she lived, that she had a small cute dog, I held doors to her, said hello, helped to carry anything heavy - that sort of neighbory stuff, but we didn't even know each other's names.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have moved to my recent apartment a four years ago and got a dog, and the story takes place about two years ago. Now, early morning one day, someone starts ringing into my door. I try to ignore it - I work nights, so it's my beauty sleep at that time. But they kept ringing, and ringing non-stop, so I shuffled to the door at last, and opened it. It was the mean old lady, and right from the doorstep she starts screaming at me because my dog \"made a smelly puddle\" in the hallway. I am groggy, and have no idea what she is talking about, but she insists that my dog sh@t on the floor a few floors below. Now, my dog is a very behaved pupper. She cannot and will not do her things anywhere but grass outside, and even when outside - never near the place we live. She'll yell, and bark, and scream if she has something wrong with her stomach, but she'll hold till she'll explode, but not do her business inside. Not only that, she was at the time scared of the new place she was in, so never left my sight when we walked out, so I always see what she's doing, and she didn't do anything in the apartment complex. Which I explain to the woman: she must be mistaken, because she's always in my range of sight, and she cannot really do her business not on the grass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman, however, insists, and when I ask why does she think it's my dog, she replies \"Because you're new here!\". Excuse me, lady, I ask, is that a reason enough to claim my dog shat in the apartment building? The fact I'm living here a few years less than you? \"Yes.\" she replies. \"Because I know everyone else in here, and no one would do that!\". Which is a weak argument, imo. Well, I tell her, she is mistaken - I kept a close eye on my dog, she didn't do it, so it must be something else. She continues to insist, tries to force me to apologise to the neighbours (tough luck - I'm a stubborn sonofabitch), and tries to drag me out to clean after \"my dog\", saying that everyone does that. Which I refuse because a) i'm in my PJs; b) that was not my fucking dog!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go home, lock myself, and go to sleep, only to be woken up a few more times by her for the same reason, but those times I did not open the door - just pressed a pillow over my ears, and slept to my heart's content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon the landlord came for the pay, and I asked him if the lady is even sane and should I bother about her? He said, no, but just motivated that she's a lonely old woman and a single mother with a forty-something daughter who is obsessed by cats... which is not a reason at all to call a woman crazy! Still, the landlord - spaghetti monster bless him! - likes to get to the root of any conflict I might have with anyone, and after a while he calls me, and tells that he spoke to the lady, they made a sweep of the neighbours, and it appeared that the guy next door was doing some renovations, changing pipes, some mucus and rot spilled out of the pipe he was carrying outside to dispose of, and that was the \"smelly puddle\". Alright, I think, the woman next time we meet would admit to her mistake and if not apologise, stop giving me The Look she has been ever since. But she did not. She did not apologise, she was continuing giving me The Look, she continued treating me and my dog as if we were the bane of the complex's existence, huffing and puffing, screaming at my dog whenever she approached (after a while the doggo adjusted and tried to be friendly with every person, pupper, or cat in the building), and continuously scolding me for not having her on the leash and muzzled at all times (which is not required for non-fighter breeds over where I live, and my doggo is just a happy, friendly mutt with some collie in her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for some reason i took that to heart. I stopped helping her, stopped holding the door, saying hello (which pisses her off - I hear how she grumbles about \"young people having no respect\" when i don't greet her), and other common courtesy. I just filter her out. But recently this cold war got to the point when, if I walk home, and see her walking from the store, I will deliberately walk slower, to get into the apartment building with a really nasty, hard-opening door (the magnetic lock misbehaves), to close it right in front of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all wouldn't have happened were she only to say \"sorry\", or at least treat me decently. But it seems like the reveal of her being wrong only intensified her dismay, which I decided to mirror back to her. Not a very manly thing to do, I admit, but I am too stubborn to give up (not to mention it is kind of entertaining). Maybe **I** am the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** old lady neighbour claims my dog shat on the floor in the apartment building because I'm a new tennant (her words), and tries to force me to clean up and apologise to the neighbours; later finds out it was another person's fault, but still continues treat me and my dog as if we were ruining the complex; I decide to be petty and start slamming the doors into her face instead of holding them for her, and things like this.",

      "description": "My friend is Muslim. I was raised Christian but I don’t practice the religion and I don’t have a strong belief in God. My friend is very choosy in what elements of her religion she practices. For example, she doesn’t eat pork but on occasion at parties she will drink. She is also very vocal about her sexual experiences and fantasies in a TMI/Cringey way. I feel bad saying this, but she is really dependent on a male attention so she says and does stuff to get it in anyway possible. But then on other days she will go to her mosque and then make a long preachy post about being closer to God and making the right choices and stuff. Sometimes she will “jokingly” call me out if I’m eating pork or drinking or if I say something inappropriate by calling me “haram”. Like I said, I’m not religious so I’m not judging her for her personal life choices or for not being 100% with how she practices her religion. The other day, she posted a partially nude picture on her finsta story and I sent her back this meme  as a joke and she got mad and said that I “can’t police how she practices her religion” and that “just because i’m not religious, that doesn’t mean I can judge her.” I honestly got a little pissed off that she got mad at me for that when she does it all that time to me in the opposite way. AITA for sending that picture and for judging her for being hypocritical?\n\n[The meme I sent her.](https://imgur.com/a/Evc51Hy)",

      "description": "It's been a while since I've posted anything on Reddit but this happened around 2-3 weeks ago and I haven't told anyone about it because I'm very shy and not the kind of person who talks much to anyone except close friends or family, but I'll give you the full story from my perspective.\n\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon and as I'm in Year 12 (Grade 12 if you live in America) my school allows us to leave early if we didn't have anymore classes for the day, so I just finished my last lesson and decided to leave my school and head home. \n\nWalking for around 3-4 minutes after leaving my school, I hear distant shouting and screaming so I quickly ran to see what it was assuming that someone might have got injured and as I turned the corner I saw this dad grabbing his sons by the arm tightly and trying to drag him to his car (I knew they were related because I usually see them together in our city local town) his son (who was wearing the uniform from my school) was shouting at him to let him go but his dad kept dragging him while shouting \"You're getting in the fucking car whether you like it or not\". Then a women comes out of one of the houses which was on the street where this was taking place probably because of all the noise both the father and son were making and rushed over to them to see what was happening.\n\nThe dad slowly turned to face the women and tried to act like he had the situation all under control and he had a small conversation with the women which I couldnt hear as the guy was talking to the women very quietly so I only heard mumbling from the distance I was at but the man was holding something in his right hand and the women looked pale and like she was going to faint so she turned around and quickly walked back to her house. He then finally got his son near the car, opens the door and proceeds to violently force his son by punching and kicking him in the car which he was successful with and locked him in with his car keys. This made me decide to try and stop the situation.\n\nI slowly walked up to them and the car and shouted \"What the hell is wrong with you?!, why did you abuse your son like that?!. The dad again slowly turns around to look at me with this psychopathic look and says to me \"Do you have a problem with it?\" which I responded with \"yes, it's child abuse which is illegal\". He then walks up to me slowly with the same psychopathic stare and says softly \"Do you know what I do to people who try to mess with me?\" and proceeds to reveal a pocket knife in his hand [which looks somewhat like this one](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=knife&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=isnv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLu9Xy8OjeAhWHJsAKHSRMCnYQ_AUIEigB#imgrc=GggvzKVjuoIrJM)and threatens me with it. \n\nThis was the first time that someone has pointed a knife at me and threatened to stab me with it so I got very scared and backed off far enough so he couldn't stab me if he had the chance. He then proceeds to unlock the car so that he could get in the driver seat which allowed his son to open the door and get out of the car, he then started running down the street which his dad notices as shouts \"You can go live somewhere else if your not going to stay in my car!\" which he then goes into his car and drives away.\n\nAt this point, I was in shock as I haven't been in a situation like that before (however the city which I live in has many shady people who own guns/knife collections according to students in my year) so I picked up my bag which I dropped before confronting the man and walked home.\n \nFrom that day on I kept thinking to myself of how bad of a person I was for letting that whole situation happen in front of my eyes and as my phone was being repaired, I couldn't take any photos of the cars numberplate or the perpetrator so If I were to tell this story to the police, they'll need evidence in order to perform an arrest. I'm also not sure what happened to the son as he ran away quickly and when going home, I was looking to see If I could find which I couldn't.\n\nI'm sorry for how long this post was but this is how the full story happened from my perspective.\n\nPS - I'm also sorry if I posted this on the wrong subreddit, this was the closest one I could find that might of fitted in with the topic.\n\n\n\n\n",

The trigger was that she didn't even apologize, in fact, she got angry at ME reasoning that I shouldn't have put MY laptop on MY bed.  Keep in mind she's had an attitude the whole night for no good reason (complaining about a meal I cooked for her, etc.), so I sternly demanded at least an apology.

      "description": "So I live in Israel. We have army conscription, meaning every citizen is required to join the military forces. For boys, the period is 3 years, age 18 to 21.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people excused from this usually have health issues, or move to another country, etc... I and most of my friends are required, and my two older siblings already went.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really, *really* don't want to go. It's not that I necessarily dread the army itself, but rather fear of the fact that I'll be wasting **3 years** of my life. Arguably, some of the best years too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents, whom I've yet to tell about my unwillingness to go, sometimes talk about their friends' children that didn't go and how their lives went to shit. They say that with nothing to do after high school, they lack frame and a meaning. No reason to get out of bed in the morning, something along these lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I would wish to do is move out as soon as I can, to somewhere in Europe or US, and study. After 12 years in the education system the last thing I want is another 3 in a place where I'll be useless. I trust myself and I **know** I'll get along. I have goals and I can take care of myself. I want to create a passion, study and follow it with hard work, and I truly believe that what my parents are saying won't happen to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked with a friend about this and she said if I had the option and decided not to go, I'd be an asshole. I completely see her point. Joining the army is an agreement you have with the country for living in it, and it's a responsibility I need to take. But will I be that big of an asshole that I should give up, without trying, 3 years, just to be a bit of a more decent person...? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, it's not my decision to make, but should I even speak up about it and try to excuse a way, or am I a complete douche for even thinking about it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I be the asshole if I try to make an excuse to avoid going to the military?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for being skeptical and \"done\" when my would be lover just came out as trans?",
      "description": "I understand on principal the idea of turning someone down for being trans is a shit move. It's not that I have an issue with trans people. I have personally struggled with my gender identity in the past and after exploring the idea of being trans realized I'm most comfortable being gender non conforming in the lesbian community (which has a really rich history with that kind of thing). My issue here is that I have known and been involved with this person (who I have considered the love of my life) for two years throughout their journey with their mental health, and we've been very close to each other with a strong romantic pull. Within the last six months or so reconnected and confessed our mutual love (or so I had thought-- they are notoriously dodgy about stating their feelings directly). But because they really haven't been mentally well enough for a relationship in this duration and it's all long distance, I've kept my space, communicating openly about my feelings but sort of sitting on the idea that we had unfinished business in the future. We made plans to meet for the first time in March, and I've been feeling like maybe we finally will be able to sort out exactly what's going on. \n\nExcept that about a month ago they were suddenly consumed by these intense feelings of what they refer to as dysphoria. Two days ago they came out publically as trans and said they would be physically transitioning as soon as possible. \n\nI want to be supportive, but even beyond the fact that I personally feel like this has shattered all perception I had of our potential, I feel like this might be misguided and could be harmful for them. \n\n Now, they have a past history of extreme dysmorphia and eating disorders. They have expressed desire for cosmetic surgeries like a nose job due to feeling ugly. They have horrific childhood sexual abuse they have not yet tackled in therapy. They also have been very assertive about their repulsion from men and very passionate about women, queer women and brown women especially. In fact, they've struggled to even maintain civil friendships with men in the past because they couldn't relate to, trust or feel comfortable around them, going so far as to express confusion as to how the majority of my friends can be (good) men.\n\nThe way they are speaking about being trans also seems to be weird. They said something like \"I am not saying I Am A Man Now, because I look like and live the life of a woman\" and \"I'm going to look so weird as a boy\" which rang some bells to me as not necessarily something a trans man would say.  It just seems like to them gender is all about how you look. \n\nMy biggest concern is probably that this is an \"easy answer\" to all of the anguish they've been in for years, that physically transitioning will get rid of all the problems they have (they feel conventionally unattractive, ugly, because they're tall and brown and feminine etc BUT also conversely get a lot of uncomfortable attention from men on the street, which \"being a boy\" might solve). I genuinely feel like this could be the result of peer pressure, confusion, and desperation for internal change-- and while I am aware my pain and broken heart make this idea aversive to me in general, I have to ask, AITA for being skeptical that this is even true? WIBTA if I needed to distance myself from this person because I feel both hurt and like they're making a mistake, but not one I can point out for them?",

      "description": "I (21 F) met this kid (22 M) from Tinder at the beginning of December. We are both seniors in college, so we had a month break that started like 3 days after we met, but we texted the entire time. When we got back to school we continued to talk. It was clear from the day we met that he has very strong feelings for me. He always told me how easy it was to talk to me and that he felt like we had always known each other. I do really like him and we get along really well, but I did not feel that our relationship was any more special than any previous relationships I have had. He made me happy though, and I figured it was worth it to just call him my boyfriend until we graduated, even though when I initially met him I had no intention of becoming monogamous.\n\nAfter about a week I told him that I thought I knew what I wanted but it turns out I was starting to feel tied down and I don't think I'm cut out for a relationship. I told him we could still be friends, and I really wanted to be friends with him because he doesn't have any close friends here. I made sure to be very clear that I do not want to be with him and that I do not feel the same way about him as he does about me. He says he loves me, and I think I love him, but only platonically.\n\nLast night we hung out for the first time since becoming friends. He kind of invited himself over by offering to get me something from target even though I live out of the way for him, so I told him I didn't need anything but if he was just looking for an excuse to come over he could. I had no intention or plan to hook up with him. He came over and sat on a different couch than me and we started a movie, but halfway through he moved to my couch and things escalated from there. \n\nI feel like I am a bad person for hooking up with him even though I know he is in love with me and I don't feel the same, but at the same time I have been very honest and clear about not wanting to be with him, and he kissed me first.    \n\nAlso, I am the first person he has ever had sex with, but I did not pressure him into doing it and waited until he wanted to. I also made sure that there was no real reason he was waiting and he said he wasn't saving himself it just hadn't happened for him yet.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened last week when I was shopping at a large grocery store downtown. They have these tiny shopping carts for kids to use while their parents use normal sized carts.\n\nOne small boy (I'm not good with kids' ages, but I think he was like 8-ish years old) was pushing around one of these carts, being VERY annoying and VERY dangerous, running past customers, sliding and swerving from one aisle to the next. At one point he bumped into my shoe, and just kept on zooming. Some time later I was standing in another aisle and he nearly collided with a shelf full of jars right next to me. I had enough of it, so I grabbed his shoulder for a few seconds (not at all hurting him, but firmly enough to not let him get away) saying \"Knock it off! You're bothering everyone here, go find your mom or dad!\" He just looked at me, silently, and I went on my merry way.\n\nSure enough, at the checkout counter, I encountered him and his mom. The mom started making a scene, yelling things like \"How dare you lay a finger on my kid? You have no right to touch my kid!\" repeatedly. I saw her pull out her phone, I'm not sure if she started filming me. \"This guy grabbed my kid, check your security tapes! I demand you check your security tapes!\" Other people were looking at ME, rather than at the yelling woman.\n\nI couldn't get a word in between her yelling, I couldn't defend myself, nor did I want to, because it would just escalate the situation. I checked out my products quickly and quietly and got the fuck out of there, leaving the noisy lady and stunned bystanders behind.\n\nWas I an asshole here?",

      "description": "I have been in an LDR with my boyfriend for two years. We see each other about once every two months but skype almost daily. The reason we are long distance is because he got into a great teaching program in Japan (I am in the US). Once complete, he plans on coming home and marrying me. I have been keeping tabs on his recently added friends on Facebook. He has recently added some girls from his program. I am not a jealous type or anything and it is fine for him to meet other people, in fact I want him to enjoy a social life while away from me. While he has been away I decided to better myself by losing weight, eating healthy and attending a community college program. I am still living at home with my parents and have been working a job at a marketing company to help support the family. Money is tight, I feel like I need to be careful when purchasing anything. \n\nFor me to get to and from my job at the marketing company and then to the community college at night, I have to take public transportation. It is not glamorous, it is what I need to do. I know that my boyfriend will be making a decent salary as a teacher when he comes back to the US, but in the meantime, I have to take busses. Any time I am in public, I am at risk for a male talking to me. I disclose any flirtatious actions from men to my boyfriend as soon as it happens. So, I can usually tell the difference when someone is flirting versus making small talk. Well there was a nice underprivileged teenager that was riding with me and asked for my number. I clarified that I had a boyfriend and he said that he just wanted to be friends. So, I added him on snapchat to continue the dialogue in a similar way to how my boyfriend has been adding Japanese girls. I did not do this out of spite, but rather to try and be supportive if needed as his family is less supportive than mine. \n\nAnyways, I told my boyfriend once he woke up that I met a new friend on the bus and how I added him. He did not take this well. At all. He started screaming at me and accusing me of cheating on him. I felt like this was very unfair since I have been so supportive and trusting of his life while he has been away. He threatened to break up with me and instead I was able to push for us to go on a break instead. I didn’t do anything with anyone while we weren’t talking for three weeks. We just talked again last night, and I didn’t want to bring up other people because I thought it might trigger his distrust. I assumed that my boyfriend also had been loyal, but my heart was aching to know. He ended up bringing it up in a roundabout way and I told him that it was none of his business because he is the one that wanted the break. Anyways this resulted in him screaming at me. I told him if he buys me a car this problem wouldn’t happen on public transportation. He said that I need to get a job like everyone else. I feel lost. Was I wrong for asking for him to buy me a cheap car (his family has money unlike mine)?",

      "description": " You might be saying WTF at the title but it’s honestly the easiest way to describe my current situation.\n\nI was accepted into an Ivy League school. I don’t know how or why, because 1. my high school hasn’t sent anyone to one in at least 5 years and 2. my grades/test scores aren’t much to write home about (3.8 GPA 31 ACT if you were wondering). When I showed my acceptance letter to my parents they were so, so, so proud and happy.\n\nMy family is poor, to say the least. Neither of my parents went to college. They’ve sacrificed A LOT to ensure that I didn’t need to work during high school so I could focus on studying. They told me that I should go to the Ivy. But here is where it gets complicated. Mom got sick last month and Dad had to take on additional shifts at work to offset the loss of her paycheck. I was also accepted into a state university in my city, and I’m strongly considering going there instead because then I can work part-time and help take care of Mom. \n\nGuys what do I do? Even though my parents said I should go to the Ivy, doing so means that Dad will have to work twice as hard for God knows how long. They’ve sacrificed enough already and I’ll have to deal with the guilt of making them sacrifice even more if I go to the Ivy. I’m just so god damn lost.

He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?",

      "description": "Alright, some context here: I live with my mother, I'm only 17 and still in high school, and I'm a bit on the heavy side. \n\nNow, my room started to grow mold in it. This wasn't my fault-- The mold was behind a large, heavy bookcase which none of us could move, and we only noticed when it creeped out from behind said bookcase onto the open wall. Uh oh.\n\nSo, my mother decided that she has to move the giant bookcase anyway, she might as well rearrange my room. I protested, but she made it clear it was happening whether I wanted to or not. So, I stayed home from school to help her move the various bookcases and dressers in my room, since she often has trouble doing that on her own and I'm not so callous to let my mother get a hernia moving things. \n\nThen, my mother brings out the new bed. Now, for more context: My bed was a memory foam mattress on the floor. Rudimentary, I know, but it's always been comfortable, and I've slept relatively well. My mother doesn't approve of this, citing that I'm close to the floor, and that's why I get sick so much. \n\nNow, she asked the question earlier if I wanted her to get the bed. I refused adamantly. See, the new bed isn't as much of a bedframe as it is a large air mattress, easily the size of two normal mattresses in height. \n\nSo she brought it in and pumped it full while she said I could take a break, seeing as all the heavy lifting was done. So, I come back and she's making the bed for me, and having trouble. Once again, she won't let it go, so I help her. As an afterthought, she puts my previous mattress on top of the air mattress with a single sheet on it, before laying down and claiming it's the most comfortable bed she's ever been in. \n\nI do the same, and no. No, it's not. I sink deep in, I hate air mattresses, and I know I can't sleep on it. This is the part where I think I might be TA. After she set it up and I told her twice it wasn't comfortable and I didn't like it, she went to bed. \n\nI'd like to say I tried, but I need to get up tomorrow, the only pump to make it more taut is electric and it makes a lot of noise and I can't do that as everyone else is asleep, and that mattress just won't work for me even if I do. I did try to get the hang of it while I was awake, but I could barely sit, and lying down anywhere but the centre sent me tumbling off.\n\nSo, I deflated the bed. I didn't pop it, mind you, I just opened the cap and let all the air out. My mother doesn't yet know I did this, but I know she'll be **pissed** when she finds out. She said she spent upwards of $70 on it, and that she liked it, why can't I? \n\nI love my ma, but she's stubborn and I can't do this anymore. I won't be able to respond until morning, but can I have some advice?",

      "description": "Obvious throwaway, let me give some clarity for the situation.\n\nMy mum works in a high-level field, often with long hours. Dad's the stay-at-home parent who helps out at my mum's work; in any case, throughout early childhood, Dad's always been the one making dinner, doing drives to and from school and generally being present and active. Partly because of Mum's work hours and also due to a set of injuries she had sustained before I was born, I've not had the chance as a kid to really develop that same bond and trust; honestly, I feel like I've never had a connection with her at all. She's felt more akin to a step-mum than an actual mother, and I don't share many interests or connections with her (far and few between).\n\nI've developed a tendency to be needlessly blunt and harsh; I am trying to rectify that, but it has been difficult. During one particular point a couple of months ago, I've told her that (mainly) because I've never had a chance to connect with her, I don't feel any form of love for her. I often struggle with emotionality and being vulnerable, and I believe I've been too callous and tactless in this instance. ",

We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don’t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said ‘Have fun lads and Jane’. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying ‘lads’ and made her feel ‘othered’.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using ‘lads’ and ‘guys’ because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it.

      "description": "I’m (19F) home from school for the holidays and my mom’s (ex)boyfriend (52M) is visiting from up north for the holidays and to see his kids. \n\nThis morning I woke up to him scolding my 5 year old sister for throwing away half of a bagel for breakfast around 8 am. Around 11 she tells me that she’s hungry and I tell her to go ask her dad for lunch because it’s around lunch time. She comes back up stairs a while later and I assume that she ate. Comes 12, she asks me again to give her something to eat and I finally go downstairs to give her something to eat.\n\nI get downstairs and asks her what she wants to eat and her dad then asks me what I’m doing. I say I’m giving her something to eat, it’s lunch time. He tells me that he knows what time it is but she can’t eat yet because she threw away part of her bagel this morning and all she does is waste food. At this point I get really snarky because there’s plenty of built up tension that has been around for *years* along with the fact that she barely ate breakfast, it’s been four hours, and she ate dinner around 7. I ignore him and keep asking her what she wants to eat and he tells her she needs to go upstairs in her room. \n\nI explain to him that she rarely eats bagels, so the fact that she wouldn’t eat all of it isn’t surprising. He then blames that on my mom because my mom fixed breakfast for her. (My mom works nights and is basically running on autopilot 75% of the time).\n\nI tell her that she doesn’t have to go upstairs because I’m going to fix her lunch. \n\nIt then gets out of hand because he asks me who I think I’m talking to and I tell him I’m obviously talking to him. It escalates, he tells me that I’m out of place, that I’m rude and disrespectful and that I shouldn’t be talking to him anyway I want because he’s a grown ass man. \n\nIt eventually escalates to a bunch a fuck you’s back and forth. \n\nThere’s more to the argument. I know the reason for the argument seems kind of minuscule and silly. I’m aware that there’s obviously many issues that need to be dealt with regarding the family dynamics and the relationships BUT my sisters birthday is in a few days and Christmas is coming up and I’d like there to be as little tension as possible.  \n\nI talked to a few of my friends but they’re biased because they know how I feel towards him and they’re also all my age. So, am I the asshole for getting into an argument with my mom’s ex.",

Beforehand, she was in prison for who knows what, I don’t really care at this point. \n\nWhen she got out of prison, she basically strong armed the family courts into my life, because, frankly, she’s a woman. It was a rough choice for my dad, as it was either spend weekends and Wednesday’s at her place with other felons, or have her come into our house. He decided the latter. \n\nSince the moment she moved in there has been conflict, like giant fights that draw blood, me being kicked out for weeks on end, and her saying “I sold my soul to the devil” because I stood with my dad. Now that she kicked me and my dad out, and is threatening to meddle with my grandmas estate after her death, me and my  dad are living in a office, which we own and the land that it’s on. She lives in a shitty RV behind it. She constantly terrorizes us by banging and yelling at ungodly hours in the night, and threatening shit to get money from my dad. \n\nWIBTA if I cut her from my life completely, and get a restraining order + eviction notice on her?",

      "description": "Background info: My family has a long tradition of drinking socially together; it's a very acceptable practice in our culture as well. Whenever my adult siblings, parents, and I get together we almost always have a few cocktails together and talk and laugh and have a merry time. None of us will drive if we're impaired and we won't allow anyone else to drive if they've been drinking. \n\nIt's also common knowledge in my family that me and all of my siblings drank when we were underage. In my country the legal drinking age is 21. My parents would often give us a glass of wine with dinner when we were younger or if they were hosting a party they would often let us drink some wine or beer. They most likely knew that when we were teenagers we were drinking at parties with friends, but they turned a blind eye to that. \n\nNow my brother has two sons. He is very strict with them and tries very hard to control every aspect of their lives, not to be a dick, but because he really wants them to be safe. One of his sons, Ian, who is 17, has often expressed to me his frustration at how strict his dad is and how he feels like he can't do a lot of fun things that his friends get to do. A typical teen-aged complaint, I think. \n\nI've always been the \"cool aunt\" to all of my nieces and nephews and because of that they have an adult to turn to when they want to talk about things their parents may not approve of like sex or drinking. Ian has confided in me about how he has to lie to his dad (my brother) about where he goes out with his friends because my brother won't let him go to parties. Ian also likes to tell me about the fun he's had drinking with his friends. I always tell him to be careful and to never drive drunk and to never let a friend drive drunk. But I also laugh with him and share in the fun he has in telling me his \"going out drinking with the boys\" stories. \n\nSo my brother and his fam live in a completely different part of the country than I do and we only see each other on holidays a couple of times per year. So during the last holiday that they visited, we were all gathered at my parents' home. Everyone was there - my three siblings and all of their kids (in their 20s) and me and my husband and my parents. Everyone was getting pretty lit and drinking and laughing except for Ian who's only 17. So on the sly I asked him if he wanted me to make him a drink and he said yes. So I made him a vodka...and then another....and then another. Keep in mind that we were at the home of my parents, no one was driving that night as we were all planning on crashing there. No guests outside of family members were present, and we had no plans to go anywhere else that night. \n\nAs the evening progressed Ian started acting tipsy. Everyone, including his mum, noticed and thought is was funny. They figured out that I must've given him some drinks. My brother was the very last person to catch on. When he did figure it out, Ian told him that I had given him the alcohol. My brother was fuming mad at me, but we didn't talk about it because it was late and everyone just wanted to crash. In the morning my brother and his fam all left early to drive back to their home a few hours away.\n\nThe next week a get a call from my brother and he was absolutely livid that I gave Ian some drinks. He went on and on about how Ian had never tasted alcohol before I gave him some that night and that now his son is corrupted because of me and also how I've undone all the great parenting he and his wife have done with Ian and that because of me he's now destined to be some sort of hoodlum (he's at the top of class and a stellar student btw). He went on to say that I have no boundaries and that I've been undermining his family for years (not sure how since we've never lived in the same part of the country since he's had kids?). And now because of what I did, my brother has chosen to remain very distant towards me. He continues to hold it against me that I gave Ian alcohol. He doesn't invite me to his home anymore for holidays, though he'll invite the rest of my family members. My other siblings still maintain a relationship with him, but they almost keep it secret from me because they know that my brother doesn't talk to me socially anymore or invite me to his home, and I'm guessing they don't want me to feel bad.\n\nI realize that I exhibited poor boundaries by giving Ian some drinks and I apologized profusely many times to my brother and to his wife. I completely owned up to my poor judgement and made no excuses for it. I'm not Ian's parent and I don't make the rules for him. But I feel like the degree of outrage expressed by my brother is disproportionate to my transgression. Especially considering that my brother drank when he was a teenager. And now I don't have a relationship with my brother anymore and I really miss him. Is he over-reacting or AITA?",

      "description": "So some backstory to this is pretty simple, I work at a late night greek food shop on weekends to make a few bucks while I’m in school. Usually there’s two employees working so that when we close at 3am, we can get out relatively quick. \n\nOne of the co-owners lets call him G, pays himself hourly for the work he does, just as any other employee, and recently started taking the shift with me on Saturday nights since the guy I usually work with changed his schedule. This has led to him barking orders saying “we need to do the dishes” and “we need to clean this” etc but then going and sitting down waiting for me to do it all. It’s too much work for one person and often leads for me to stay until 4:30am while he leaves at 3. \n\nTonight I finally called him out and told him that if he is going to say we, I want him to help me, and if not then he needs to say me. I told him I don’t like working with a boss that isn’t going to lead by example, and that he may be my boss but if he’s going to also be my coworker I want him to do work with me. This lead to him yelling and creating a scene, calling me an asshole and saying I need to shut the fuck up and do as he says in the store with costumers present, while also telling me I’m no longer entitled to my breaks on 8+ hour shifts. Am I the asshole for wanting my boss to do equal work with me, and for calling him out on the matter?",

      "description": "A good friend of mine and I were chatting and I mentioned how my 12 year old stepson was slacking on homework and the steps that his dad and I were implementing going forward, such as getting him to *start* some of his homework on Friday evenings. My friend proceedes to say that should be illegal, and made direct comparisons to how his own parents who were borderline verbally abusive when it came to pushing him to do school work. (My friend also has ADHD and is visually impaired and his parents were very strict and not super nice to him; issues my son does not have). Anyway, I said any comparison between his parents (25 years ago mind you) and our parenting makes no sense. This was all by text so I concluded the argument by saying we could resolve it by having a conversation rather than texting.\nI left it alone and the next day he texted me, piling on even more criticisms about how i treat my stepson. I call him, and huge fight proceeds. My main points that I was trying to make was that he is a) not a parent and doesn't underatand the learning needs of my stepson b) he doesnt have the information to make the sort of broad generalizations since he only sees my stepson a couple times a year c) i didn't ask for his opinion and that only my husband should be the one who i am discussing this with and d) it's very hurtful to hear that I'm mistreating my stepson when I actually have a really good and loving relationship with him, that I've worked hard at cultivating over 6 years.\nMy friend stated that he feels bad for my stepson and sarcastically, \"oh you're so perfect you can't take some criticism?!\" and other really harsh judgements. It seems he wanted me to accept his judgement that I am mistreating my stepson. My husband for the record thinks this is absolutely ridiculous and knows how much quality time and love i give to his son, I (we) just have expectations for homework being done and trying his best (normal parent stuff, IMO). Its my opinion that my friend's traumatic experiences with his own very strict parents is what triggered this whole thing, and he is projecting. \nI'm having a hard time with this. We have been friends for more than 10 years. But i just can't imagine being friends with someone who says they feel bad for my stepson, like I'm such an awful person. And to impose their opinions on such a personal issue that should be an issue reserved for my husband and I. Plus, he yelled at me in a way I have never heard out of him. I had to repeatedly ask that he let me get a point in and let me finish. When he didn't after about 3 times, I ended up hanging up on him. That was the last we spoke. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey friends, this isn’t recent at all, but it’s always been a moral dilemma of mine.\n\nSo, a little background. I used to work at a well known smoothie shop a couple towns over from where I live. We made small (12oz), medium(22oz), and large(32oz) smoothies. Now, the pricing isn’t exactly in line with the sizes. For example, a medium “should” be slightly less than double the price of a small, but it’s really only about $1 more (so a jump from about $4 to $5). I also want to stress that this town is one of the wealthiest in the US. Multiple celebrities live there. If you google “wealthiest towns in America” it will be on most or all of the lists that come up.\n\nPeople quickly figured out that you could basically get 2 small smoothies for the price of 1+$1 if you ask for a medium in 2 cups. So people would come in, ask for this, hand me an AMEX Black Card to pay, and be on their merry way. My [least] favorite example of this is a women who came in with her two kids who excitedly looked at all the smoothies and say “I want x! I want y! Oh no I want z!” Only to be told by mom that they have to pick the same flavor because they splitting the smoothie. Queue child argument, the classic “if you two don’t pick then nobody’s getting anything!”, and crying. The lady orders, angrily puts her Louis Vuitton bag on the counter, pulls out her wallet, and hands me a $50 bill. I was seething through my customer service smile. I felt so bad for the kid that had to compromise.\n\nIt started to get a little too common, so my boss told us to stop allowing it and instead tell people they’ll have to get 2 smalls instead. Fine by me. I’m a very friendly person but I don’t mind saying no when I need to, and I saw where my boss was coming from. The way I saw it is if people brought their own cup they could do whatever they wanted with the smoothie they bought. If they can’t afford 2 smalls over 1 medium for your kids ($3 difference), then you shouldn’t really be there at all. On top of that a good amount of people in this town we’re extremely entitled and treated us like shit every time they were there so it was honestly satisfying to be able to be able to say no sometimes. (inb4 somebody quotes this part and says YTA). Most customers were cool, but not all.\n\nNeedless to say people weren’t happy. I was always *extremely* polite when I told people about the policy, mostly because that’s just how I handled customers but also because I genuinely felt bad, especially if they were nice. Some people were very understanding about the change, got their single medium smoothie in one cup and had their kids share. Some people got their smoothie, waited till we walked away, and reached over the counter to steal a second cup. A lot of people reamed me out at the counter, calling me a selfish punk on a power trip and other things of that nature.\n\nSo, AITA for enforcing my boss’s policy against a loophole in the pricing and sizing of our smoothies?

      "description": "Last week was given an opportunity to apply for an internal vacancy in the company I work for. I'm essentially being poached by another department. I'm quite eager to nail this application, because getting this job would be frankly life changing for the better for me (MUCH more interesting, better hours and almost double the salary). \n\nHowever, the deadline is midday tomorrow and I was only asked to apply on Friday, so it's been a right turnaround, given that application is unusually long, and effectively an assessment rather than a standard application - with the final segment requiring a 3000 word essay. After putting in the hours over the weekend and getting it all sorted, I just needed to write a personal statement (why it think I'm suited to the role, what I can bring to it e.t.c) then I would be done. I figured this would only take me an hour or two at most, so did a little last night, went to bed and decided I'd work through the rest on my lunch hour today.\n\nAnyway, I had forwarded a copy of my work so far to my work computer, waited until lunch and then got going on finishing it off. First of all, I admit that it was a stupid thing to do to be working on it in full view of my colleagues, but my desk is in the corner and it's kind of accepted at work that it's an asshole thing to do to check someone's screen, unless you need to (I.e you're the manager and you're checking everyone's not playing games or watching YouTube e.t.c). One of my colleagues saw what I was doing and loudly proclaimed \"oh you're leaving us are you?\" And my manager heard, came over saw what I was doing and called me into a side office and explained to me that what I was doing was incredibly unprofessional, that I shouldn't be using company equipment for personal business and that it was an insensitive thing to do to apply for another job in front of my colleagues. Of course, I also got the third degree about wanting to leave my current team too.\n\nIn my view, while I suppose it's legitimate to say i shouldn't be using a work PC for personal business, it wasnt like i was browsing the internet or playing games - I was typing out a word document. Plus, I never worked on it during work hours, only during my lunch break and I personally don't think it's any of my colleagues business 1) what i do in my lunch break, and 2) whether or not I'm applying for another job.\n\nTl;dr - worked on a job application on a work computer at my current job during my lunch break. Colleague notices and rats me out to everyone. Boss takes me aside and says its unprofessional to use work computers for personal reasons and that its rude / insensitive to work on a job application around my colleagues.\n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "This happened a few days ago and it's been bugging me (F30). \n\nSo my SO (M32) was playing PUBG late at night and I went to sleep. I was woken up by him flipping his lid telling me to help out with our kids (we have 3), who were up making a mess in their bathroom. So I drag myself out of bed to the kid's bathroom and find them all covered in blue stuff. Great fun getting into the conditioner and smearing it everywhere. 6 year old had it down the pants, even.\n\nNo sooner had I showed up in the bathroom than my SO went back to his computer to resume gaming. I was kind of shocked that he would wake me from dead sleep after midnight and leave me to deal with the kids and their shenanigans on my own. He never came to help bathe the kids or clean up the conditioner all over the bathroom. After I got them out of the tub, SO came out of the office for a few secs, put a diaper on the youngest, then ran back to his computer again. I brushed out the kids wet hair and put fresh pajamas on them, tucked them into bed, and didn't hear another word from my SO.\n\nHonestly, this kind of thing happens a lot. I feel like I am left alone to deal with the kids in a lot of situations, and I'm frustrated, but when I try to bring it up, he gets in attack mode and doesn't really seem to hear any of my complaints. He mostly talks about how I couldn't understand how stressed he is because of work and that he thinks I could do a lot more than I do. I am a stay at home mom right now, I worked for a while but it was too expensive to have the baby in daycare. And I just feel over my limit sometimes. Even on his days off, it's like he's just shutting himself away and doesn't feel any real responsibility towards helping with the kids or keeping house.\n\nShould I be more understanding that he was in the middle of an un-pausable game and it's his stress relief, or am I justified in being angry about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " \n\nHey guys to keep it as short as possible I'm somewhat of the PC guy in my friend group. All of us play PC, but I am one of the only ones who builds them semi-often. I guess I am seen as the most tech savy. Around a month ago I upgraded my own PC ran into multiple issues but got it up and running. At the same time a friend of mine built a brand new nice PC. He brought it over to my house because it wasn't starting up; he had spent a few days trying to figure it out. I fixed his wiring it booted up fine and he went home. He then the next day told me he couldn't figure out his drivers so he asked me over. I went over and spent around 2.5 hours installing his drivers and getting him setup( he has playing PC games for around 4 years now at this point). I left and though no more of it (no payment asked for or offered). A month later his PC starts blue screening constantly. He tries things on google and sends me the error code. I don't know much about software issues, and I couldn't offer him many solutions. I gave him and ideas I had even to the point of reinstalling windows etc. I made a toms hardware and Reddit post for him and forwarded him all information I got. The asshole part comes in as he asked me to come over and try to fix his computer. I tried to explain that I don't have and knowledge on this issue, and all I would be doing is trying solutions from google. He is now taking it to an expensive PC repair place and is somewhat upset at me for being reluctant to spend 3 hours at his house trying to fix something I do not know how to fix. I feel somewhat guilty that I didn't go over to tap around on google for him, but I am busy with school and life and don't want to become mister free tech support for any and everyone. AITA?\n\ntl;dr AITA for not fixing a friends computer issue that I don't know how to fix for free",

Just a note to explain this deadbeat dad behavior is recent. \nIn the last four or five months, he's seen her maybe once a month. He lives paycheck to paycheck and misses a lot of work for pre-existing health problems and some connected to his recovery. \nMy kid has influenza A-the top dog for contagiousness and for intensity. Out of school til next week, and I left my other kids dad if I can push off my time with her to keep the sister from getting it. \n\nHer dad acted like he wanted to stop by (which he often says he's going to do and doesn't), and I asked him to just wait until she was out of the fever. He works in a restaurant, too, so that's a factor, if he comes on his break and goes straight back to work. I told him maybe a video chat is better until the fever breaks.\n\nI get wanting to see her, but I'm super concerned about him getting the flu and not being able to afford to fix it, and being put in real trouble missing work...or starting an epidemic. \n\nYes, she wants to see him, she feels like shit and wants all the comfort. \n\nTL;DR: Kids dad rarely visits, and while she has the flu, I think he should wait.

      "description": " TL:DR at the bottom\n\nI’ve been with my wife for nearly ten years. It was mostly a long distance relationship we had maintained through PC gaming and the like. During our time together, I’ve been the emotional sponge for her venting about her disabled mother. This woman is not a nice woman. She caught something akin to Lymes disease 20 some years ago. Before then, she was an absolute nightmare, according to multiple sources. From beating and screaming when she didn’t get her way, to injuring herself to prove a point.  \nFast forward to 2015, I became homeless and had no choice to move to my fiance’s (now wife) home after she came down to live with me a year prior. MIL was capable of doing a few menial tasks like cook and put on her own clothes. However, she was incapable of performing basic human functions and relied heavily on my father in law. Over the years, it was obvious he was getting tired of taking care of her due to her daily screaming at him for being impatient with her or doing something wrong. He was a plumber and occasionally came home early because she incessantly called and texted him.  \nWe, being my wife, her younger brother, and I, tried to help her whenever we had the time. She more or less treated us the same way. She was an incredibly awful person to deal with. My wife and brother in law have confirmed with me that they do not hold their mother in high regards and she is the source of all of their stress. They don’t have a pleasant memory or even a desire to maintain a relationship. I was tired of it all too, so I started saving in order to move out.  \n3 months ago, my father in law died. That forced my wife’s two other siblings, both of which lived a state away, to get involved with their mother. After about a month and half of just my wife, her younger brother, and I taking care of her mother, we couldn’t take it anymore and moved out. We finally have a home of our own. I usually get off work late, 11pm, and am not able to cook dinner because it would wake up my MIL. I can cook in my own goddamn kitchen whenever I want.  \nAbout a week or so ago, my wife’s older sister started a group conversation in WhatsApp to discuss what to do about their mother and generally chat because my wife and her younger brother never really got to interact with their older siblings. In the chat, her sister and older brother just do everything they can to push it all on us.  \n“It was so much more convenient when you all lived in the same house.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExpected us to go 2 or 3 times a week to go take care of her mother. We agreed on the grounds that she would be coming down in a couple months to help us clear out some of the stuff left in the garage that were important to my wife and her younger brother. Childhood trinkets and other items. Meanwhile, since they started the chat, her sister keeps treating my wife’s mental state like it’s nothing to be worried about and is easily dismissed as “being angry all the time”. It's important to note my wife was raped when she was 7 by her uncle and was mentally and physically abused until she was 14 by her grandmother. Her family is ignorant or even flatout denies it. Her older sister doesn’t understand the weight of her past.  \n12am, a few hours ago from posting this. We get off later than usual and get called incessantly by her mother. We’re tired, cranky, it’s even my wife’s birthday, we did not want to deal with her. Her sister messaged us asking why we haven’t gone over there yet. So we go to her house to find out she has some sort of pipe burst or water leakage going on underneath her house. We couldn’t find any sort of valve or anything to shut it off. So what did she want us to do? Shovel 4-6 feet of snow, crawl underneath the house, and find the broken pipe. In the normal clothes and jacket we just got off work in. We essentially told her “No, what you’re asking is quite literally impossible in these conditions. We’re leaving.” Cursed us on our way out, basically treated us like we were still living there.  \nMy wife is absolutely livid while trying to calm down because her heart was palpitating from the amount of stress she gets from even being in the same room with that woman. She tries to vent to her sister, and she responds with “Just deal with it.” She uninstalled WhatsApp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR My wife, her younger brother, and I have decided we don’t want to deal with their bitch of  a mother after being asked to crawl in snow and water at 12am.\n\nSorry for any errors, this was all typed on a whim at 3am and needed to get this while it was fresh in my mind. Also a throwaway because I don’t know if the persons involved frequent reddit. ",

We have a daughter who is 4 years old.\n\nI recently (Beginning of December 2018) started working at a company that is about 30 mins away. We are a one car family, and my shift is mon-fri, 7am-3:30 pm. Our daughter attends pre-k, and normally I have to drop her off in before care hours. (6am) when school starts at 8:30 am, because of my schedule. My husband works a 1pm to 10pm shift wed-sun. \n\nThis morning we got in to a tiff because I was having difficulty with our daughter waking up. Not only was I trying to get ready, but trying to help our daughter aswell. When I woke him up to ask if he could help get her dressed while I made her breakfast, he immediately got defensive about how I'm always asking him to get up way earlier than he \"needs\" to be, about how I KNOW how hard it is for him to go back to sleep once he's awake. It ended up with me huffing and puffing and telling him to just go back to bed. I was late to work, again, because of this encounter and traffic. \n\nHours later now that I've cooled down, I wonder if I'm expecting too much of him and being as inconsiderate as he thinks. ",

      "description": "Burner account...\n\nThis happened a few years ago when I was in high school and I'm curious what the community thinks.  I was in an AP level science class and we were assigned a project and randomly assigned 3 other people to work with.  Bad luck for me, the other three were slackers, and one, I'll call Alex, was a real dick.  I was a very good student in school, graduated top 20 in my class, and the other three were average students who probably shouldn't have been in this class anyway.  So we start the project and I'm doing nearly all of the work, which I expected when I saw who I was paired with, but I was hoping they could do a little more.  At one point, I get fed up and point blank asked them for more help.  Alex straight up said to me \"we know you care about your grades a lot more than us and we know you'll do all of it\" and walked away.  I was PISSED.  We were graded as a team and technically speaking, he was right.  I wouldn't get a lower grade out of spite, and as C+/B- students, even a half ass effort on my part was better than they could do on their own.  It was basically a game of chicken that I wasn't going to win.\n\nSo I went to the teacher and explained the situation.  She had us all stay after class one day and point blank asked Alex if what I reported was true.  He was super embarrassed and half halfheartedly said no, but he was clearly lying.  The teacher put me on my own (totally fine, the project was 95% done anyway) and put the three of them together and required them to do the whole project on their own.  The only reason I feel a bit bad was because the project was due in less than a week at this point and they had basically no time, even if they were willing and/or capable of doing it themselves.  This wasn't my intention; that's just how it worked out.  They ended up cobbling something shitty together and the teacher gave them the lowest possible passing grade (probably to stop the situation from escalating, which could have happened if she failed them) and I did extremely well.  I feel like Alex deserved everything he got.  I'm a bit ambivalent about the other two, who seemed to be following his lead, but also had chances to help and didn't.  I would have been willing to do most of the work but there was still some \"grunt work\" that they could have taken off my plate, but decided that they had me snookered and elected to do basically nothing.\n\nOne last note, I know a lot of people oppose \"ratting\" in all cases.  If people wish to post \"YTA, never rat\" that's their right, but I'm not going to take those kinds of posts to heart if they don't have any substance.  Also curious what people think about the teacher's decision to split us up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My father passed away very recently. I won't go into too much detail but he and I had a rocky relationship when I was a child. He was prone to fits of anger due to alcoholism and was just a generally scary guy. We kinda reconciled as I grew into adulthood but by no means were we close when he died, I preferred for our relationship to be amicable yet distant. My parents divorced several years ago, dad never remarried, and I'm his only child, so the decision about what to do with his body rests with me. \n\nDad was sick for a while before he died and I repeatedly asked him what he wanted done after he passed away. He was in an accident as a teen where he was burned pretty badly, so he said he definitely wasn't comfortable with cremation and being burned again. However, he said he wasn't comfortable with being buried either and didn't like the idea of rotting away in a hole. Rejected a mausoleum for pretty much the same reason. I told him those were his only options and he needed to pick one. He always said \"I'll think about it,\" evading the subject forever and never gave me an answer. Now I have to decide what to do for his burial and none of the options available to me are things he would want.\n\nI've met with a funeral director and discussed the options, and a cremation is by far the cheapest way to go and that's what I'm thinking of doing at this stage. Dad had no insurance and was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy before his death, so I won't get anything in the way of inheritance. I'm going to be floating the bill here 100%. Due to his accident he very vehemently said he didn't want to be burned again, and I know I should be respectful of his wishes, but he never bothered to actually tell me what he wanted, just what he didn't want. And as far as being burned again, well, he's dead, he's gone, it won't hurt him since he can't feel anything. I've been mulling this over for several days and I just want to get his burial over and done with so I can move on with my life. I'm just struggling with how to respect his wishes when he never gave me any alternatives.\n\nSo, WIBTA for cremating my father?",

      "description": "Backstory is a must so please hear me out. I work for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. I handle over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with my supervisor. One of our buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months we have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence). \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I make my bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To my delight I find nothing, at first. As I get to the back of the building where the railroad is, I notice a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. I walk to where one of the service doors was spray painted and find a pile of blankets and more garbage.\n\nIt took me a second but I realized there was a person under the blanket. I wake the guy up and ask him if everything is alright. He goes on to say he's just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. I say not a problem, just so long as you clean up the garbage I'm fine with you staying here. I told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or my boss find someone at \"the scene of the crime\" so to speak. He said no worries I'll clean up and be on my way. I think nothing more of it and go about my day.\n\nA week later I do my walkthrough and what do I find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. I wake him up and ask about the beer cans scattered around. He says none of it is his even though I see amongst his belongings are 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, I explain to this guy the exact same thing I told the other man. You can stay, please clean up. He says no problem I'll do it before I leave. I say thank you, and ask him if he knows the other guy that sleeps here. He nods and I ask him to remind him about cleaning up.\n\nTwo days later I come back to more garbage. Now I'm upset. When our buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give us a warning and then begin to fine us. I find the second guy and give him one last chance. I tell him to clean up or next time I'm going to have to involve the police. I find the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explain the same. I told both of them I don't want to call the police but I can't just let you continue to stay here making a mess. Going on to state how if my boss found out I was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how I would be fired. Again the agree to clean up, so I leave.\n\nToday I find neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items are still there. So as promised I call the non-emergency number and explain to them the situation. I ask them if there is anything they can do and they say it's out of their hands unless damage is being done. The tell me that I am allowed to remove the garbage/items. I wait around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It's at this point I make the decision to move all of the stuff inside our building. I came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they don't come back.\n\nI didn't see either of them, however their items are safe and I do plan on returning first thing in the morning. I feel terrible for taking their things but I can't risk my job. Especially after I gave them several chances and was very polite and sympathetic. AITA for taking their things?",

      "description": "I am 21 years old (close to 22) and have been with my boyfriend since we graduated high school. I was extremely sheltered and therefore, expressed my sexuality very early on. My sexual awakening happened at around 11 or 12 years old. Now, I have an incredibly high sex drive, have some kinks, and absolutely love sex. I consider myself pretty sex positive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, like many women, didn't discover orgasm for a long time. It's not for a lack of trying. I spent my teen years masturbating with just about everything I could get my hands on. I think part of it is my clitoral hood making things difficult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring sex, it's even more difficult. My clit is far from my vagina, making friction with my clit almost impossible in most positions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, all that being said, I have faked orgasms. I love sex and have never wanted to discourage my partner, I am his first girlfriend, and what started out being a white lie to make (who I thought was just a fuckbuddy) feel happy, has turned into an elephant of a lie to the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. I partially did it, because I have such a higher sex drive than him. I didn't want him to think I don't love having sex with him. When we first started dating he had a lot of insecurities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sex is honestly amazing too, that's what's so hard. I've came a handful of times with him, which is honestly shockingly amazing. I've told him a partial truth, and I think I'm going to come out and say it. I think he's going to be crushed and angry (understandably) I guess I know that I am somewhat the asshole, but to what level? And WIBTA if I kept it to myself for longer?

I didn't think to much and stuffed it in my pocket of my pants. A few days later when switching laundry around it fell out of the dryer and my husband found it. He asked what it was, and I told him it was some ring I had when I was a baby. When he suggested I put it somewhere safe I just shrugged and asked what's the need. He seemed rather shocked, saying I needed to hold onto it because it was \"special\".\n\nI've never had a good relationship with my bio mom (leaving when I was a baby, never being there to raise me, causing so much family strife), and I think her bringing this is her way of trying to connect with me, I really don't know.

Over the summer I started to notice small tendencies like blaming everything on others and decided I couldn't have that in my life.

      "description": "Well long story short\nMy ex-best friend started dating my brother, thing that I'm fine with because they both seem happy, but I told her that I didn't wanted to be a thirdwheel because it's really awkward to be in that situation and I don't feel comfortable with them making out in front of me (just like with any other couple).\n\nShe usually comes over to my house on Christmas and new years, but since she started talking to my brother she stopped talking to me unless it was about him, like if he didn't answer her she would text me in order to make me send a message from her to him and when I asked her if she was coming she was dodging the question with \"depends on your brother\" and more things like that.\n\nEven one time that I was using my laptop, and I couldn't lend my brother my charger because I was finishing a final project that was delivered the next day and my laptop didn't had too much battery, she texted me to ask for the charger, and when I told her that I couldn't lend it to him until I finished using my computer she started telling me that I was a bad person and that if she was in the same situation she wouldn't do the same, and that drove me nuts. Since that day our friendship started to fade away a little bit, even though I forgave her I didn't felt the same, because that would be the future of all the discussions about my brother. \n\nWhen she finally came we spend the first day together because I was hanging out with some friends and everything seemed good (note1: she spent the day with me because my brother went to another city) but when my brother came the same day she only wanted to be with him, and I'm not mad about that, I understand that they're a couple now and that they love each other, but what makes me mad is that she didn't wanted to give me a single hour to talk and do things if it wasn't with my brother (note2: we were best friends for over 3 years and she was dating my brother for a week). She only uses my room to change herself(note3: she sleeps with him) and barely talks to me, only to say hi and I decided to let them do their thing and started to make my own plans with other friends, thing that she didn't seem to mind except for my brother that tried to make me hang out with them all the time.  I didn't talked to her unless she did first. \n\nAnd on new years she received a call and when she was away answering my brother told us that her best friend was calling(note4: at this time I was with the idea that we still were best friends, and she never told me that we weren't), and that hurt me a little bit but it didn't surprise me, after her attitude towards me, and when my father asked me about it I only said that it didn't matter, (note5: at this point our friendship was already broken, so even if it hurt I accepted and got over it) to which she didn't reacted that well, and the next day she gave me a gift but didn't change a single thing on her attitude, she left after giving me that gift and we didn't talk the whole day. (note6: I hugged and thanked her when she gave it to me, I'm not a cold stone, but I can only see her as my brother's girlfriend, not my best friend anymore, and a gift isn't going to change that if her attitude stays the same)\nSo am I the asshole here??  I'm just over exaggerating things and need to apologize to her?\n\n",

      "description": "I(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it’s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don’t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn’t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it’s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn’t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn’t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I’m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting “triggered” and thinking he’s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n",

      "description": "I have an extremely sensitive nose. I can smell if someone has opened a bag of chip even if they’re in the other room with the door closed. Luckily, I’m able to deal with most smells, unless it’s extremely concentrated (perfumes, EOs) or a couple particular food smells. When I do encounter these scents I feel nauseous and dizzy and it becomes hard for me to focus. I find it easiest to cover my nose to block the scent the best I can, and go about my life as we do not live in a scent-free world. I use either my hand or a hat/bandana like a handkerchief and cover my nose. I know I will get odd looks from strangers but I already have a limp so I expect it. Most of my friends and family are aware of the extent of my scent sensitivity. I have assumed they don’t mind until today when my boyfriend told me otherwise. \n\n\nHe was eating a store-bought soup that he had originally heated up for me. Something in the soup tripped my scent trigger, so I gave it to him. He ate most of it and then stopped, so it was sitting on the coffee table half-eaten. The smell started to permeate and make me nauseous, so I nonchalantly tucked my nose into my sweater. My boyfriend stood up very angrily and stormed into the kitchen and dumped his soup down the disposal. He sternly told me that I need to stop acting so passive aggressive and say something when I’m being bothered. I was SUPER confused because it’s never been an issue before. I explained that I don’t do it to be shitty, I do it because it’s easier than expecting the world to bend to my whims. \n\n\nIn the end, he apologized for overreacting but told me that I need to consider how I come off when I sit around covering my nose. Obviously I would never have a conversation or do an interview while covering my nose, but I figured people close to me would understand. Now I’m paranoid that everything thinks I’m weird AND rude.

I was expecting to go away for a few weeks, and then come back to look after exgf, whilst also looking for jobs. \n\nSo in conversation yesterday I suggested I reorganise my holiday and flights so that I can some back in time for the 16th (op day). However, before I booked anything I just wanted to confirm what and when she expects to need help. At this point she started tearing up on the phone with lines like “if it’s so much trouble then I’ll sort it out myself” and “just go away and don’t come back” punctuated my long silences and a confused me trying to explain I just want to get the fine details sorted - as I am going to have quite a lot riding on these dates (In terms of flights, connections ect....) \n\nShe’s now totally ignoring me, except for the odd “I will do everything myself” and “I don’t want anything from you” and “fine go away on your holiday I’m not your concern”. \n\nSo really I think I probably could have been a bit more delicate with the way I worded my enquiries initially but it feels to me this is just way Over the Top, and in a strange way I feel I’m being punished for trying to help - but not quite helpful enough.

Finally, our HR interview happened in September and therein I had talked to the HR guy about the fact that my skills, interests, and projects are all in the field of Data Science and hence I would only join if I was put in that department. He agreed and said they had many analytics and ML projects I could work in.  \n\n\nAlso, our college has a  one student one job policy so, I could not sit in any other campus placement, even Google.  \n\n\nFast-forward to January. We finally receive our joining letters and the same is 2 weeks from then (22 Jan). There would be a 6-month training followed by absorption as an employee.  \n\n\nHowever, our compensation post training had been decreased from 450k INR base to 400k INR Total. On joining, I was put in the department that has all the analytics projects, but on our second day, I was switched to a different department that handles deployment, configuration, and IT services.  \n\n\nI talked to the HR execs and one of them advised me to try and continue here for 6 months post which I shall be switched to the department I was promised. But, I frankly don't buy that at all.  \n\n\nAlso, there is a service bond system in India which means that if I leave before 1.5 years after taking their training, I have to pay them the training costs amounting to 150k INR.  \n\n\nThe college is probably not gonna support my decision and won't let me sit in any other on-campus companies but that's another story altogether. I can put that in another post later if Y'all want to hear.\n\nSo, Reddit am I the asshole for quitting my first job because they didn't give me the profile they promised?  \n\n\nTLDR - company hired me in Sept for a certain role. on joining in Jan, switched me to a diff one. I wanna quit.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay, a little background info. I’m a 26 year old female and I work for a hospital. The hospital has a large gym affiliated and at the same location. I work out everyday, and have noticed a few times my nipple piercings are visible through my shirt. I always wear a sports bra, but sometimes they still show through my shirt and bra. I’ve tried bandaids (which is hilarious and unhelpful). The only thing that consistently “works” is padded sports bras, which I wear occasionally but prefer thinner ones as they are more comfortable to workout in. The gym usually isn’t super busy, and I don’t think the piercings are obvious (but they are visible at times). I am not trying to show them off. But I’m a medical professional and my coworkers and patients are at the gym sometimes. AITA if I let my nipple piercings show when I workout?",

      "description": "Whenever my family decides to go out, I’m usually the last one to head out the door, not because I take too long getting ready, but because I choose the last 5 minutes to do so. \nWhile I accept that I prevent them from being on time, this never exceeds being late by more than 10 minutes, and it never ends up being a serious situation.\n\nWe recently had a chat about it, and I was told that my level of remorse and interest were null, and here I quote (not in english, but a translation) my dad saying “you simply don’t care that we arrive late. When prison inmates spend half their sentence, they get interviewed to check whether they feel any remorse for what they’ve done, or if anything has checked. You simply don’t care.” \nHe then was about to mention something about drug dealers, which I then just said that I didn’t think the comparison was appropriate at all, and that if he really was comparing me being late to an act punishable by prison time.\n\nTo make the story short, I agreed that I could improve my interest in preparing and getting ready, but the choice of comparing me and my behaviour to a prison inmate in such a scale was a terrible choice of wording. Both him and my mom said that it was an example, and “it was my choice to be offended by an example, as I was victimising myself.”\n\nI think they are great parents, and that specific instance of trying to make me less disinterested in getting ready (which, in my opinion, is not a big of a matter as they make it to be) seems like the right path. The way they thought would make me understand is just awful. Should I apologise for being offended? \n",

Until one of the girls starts filming and now I’m curious. Someone from the balcony above starts pouring beer down into one of the girls’ mouths while the other films it. They miss completely and the girl starts taking off her shirt in front of my window and patio. So, I’m annoyed at how loud they have already been and ask them to not do that outside my patio. They snicker and walk away. Said nothing to me. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nShould I have just ignored them? I probably would have until she took off her clothes. That’s what irks me. I’m 25F and this is not a college town or party place. Families live here. \n\nIf anything it’s trashy and I don’t think it’s funny.

Id say no but he would keep pushing until I gave in. Each time it was the same boring stuff but what caught my attention was the unsettling feeling Id get around those people. So I started asking questions and my husband said he will not tell me anything if I wanted to know I should look online. So I started months of  research and shit is just getting more and more bizarre, I couldn’t take it anymore so I asked him again to tell me what they are for and what they do. He exploded telling me he will never tell me anything about it especially the initiations. Needless to say I was shocked and very hurt, but I had NEVER said anything about initiations. It wasn’t even on my radar, but now it was. So I started my research again and was sickened by what I found. Never would I expect that my husband would allow such things to be done to him. Yes I admit I lost my mind with him. At this point he says he is just going to quit , which is for the best but even then I don’t think I’ll ever look at him the same. He'd rather quit then tell me the truth. Perhaps its because of how the are forced to be submissive and in real life he is not regardless he should be able to tell me anything and everything like he tells me I have to be an “open book\" for him.",

I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?",

      "description": "The reason I ask is, I know I’m partially doing it because I am an asshole. But is it justified is the question.\n\nI got divorced last year after my ex committed a felony and I needed to protect my kids. We are on better terms now and I’m helping him work on visitation with his kids. This weekend is only the third time in a year he’s taken them overnight. Which means it’s also only the third time in a year, I’ve had any kind of break from 4 kids. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my kids, but I’m fucking exhausted. Plus caught a nice case of walking pneumonia. Not how I wanted to spend my two days off.\n\nSo the ex comes to pick up the kids this morning. He tells me his parents drove in from out of town without telling anyone except his sister. They called her when they were 6 hours away (they live about 13 hours away) to let her know they’d be arriving and staying at her house that night. My Ex-FIL also declares that my ex should ‘round every up Saturday’ so he can give my oldest a watch for his birthday. (My oldest’s birthday is on Tuesday.) I’m annoyed as fuck. Who does that?! Anyway, the ex, knowing I’ve been sick and knowing I’m not going to be thrilled about changing my plans at the last minute tells his dad that today won’t work but maybe tomorrow. \n\nI thought about it for a minute. Part of me is like: well I should be nice and accommodate them. They live really far away, etc. But then my bitch side turned back on and I said no. Told my ex that he can tell them I’m sick, he can tell them whatever the hell he wants, I’m not coming. It’ll probably be another 3 months before I get 48 hours to myself and dammit, I need it. \n\nSo, internet world, help me know if I get to squish that little voice in my head that says I’m being an asshole and enjoy my weekend. Or if I should back down and join the “party.” Party is in “ because obviously it’s just going to be the Ex-FIL congratulating himself in getting such a great gift. \n\n*if you’re wondering how my oldest feels about it, he doesn’t care. He’s excited to see his grandpa, already knows he’s getting the watch, and couldn’t care less if I was in the room when it occurs. He’s on the spectrum if that helps explain why he doesn’t have ‘feelings’ about it. ",

They told me to come in for a trial shift and then I was rostered on for the rest of the month! I was asked for my bank details but the employer/payroll officer provided none of the finer paperwork for my payroll to be processed for tax, and didn't bring it up until a solid two weeks later.\n\nI'm only a casual but I'm working near full-time hours when I was promised lunch cover shifts, and any request to have a day off has been met with being given a full day shift on the one day off I had. Maybe a few months from now I wouldn't mind, but at this point in time I physically cannot handle so many long shifts when I was initially promised 'maybe up to 17 hours a week'. Later on it wouldn't be so bad, but right now it's a struggle.\n\nMy last job only lasted seven weeks (fulltime, emotional breakdown due to stress, thus me wanting the casual position). I feel like that experience could be making me take all of this out of proportion. I want to at least try and find a new job this time before cutting ties but I actually do not know if I'll be fired before then thanks to some staff who told me their experiences.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I quit?",

My husband and I both work long hours at fairly stressful jobs during the week, so lately I've started wishing that I had more of our own / my own free time to relax on the weekends.

I'm happy for him to continue seeing her for a full day every weekend, and happy to join them for the occasional day or meal. But I don't really want to have to join them every single weekend anymore, as I would like some weekends for my own time.\n\nMy husband is a bit upset by this and thinks it means I dislike his mother, but I really don't, I just don't want to be forced to spend that much time with anybody (apart from my husband).\n\nSo - AITA?",

      "description": "My relationship with my dad is extremely rocky due to his negligent parenting when I was a kid. I don’t like interacting with him because he likes putting me down when I don’t understand concepts in school and pretty much unsupportive of my education. When he’s angry, he would hit my sister and I because we weren’t smart enough or we did something that upset him. Sometimes he would threaten to hit us if we do not do all the chores, which is unreasonable since he doesn’t help out around the house at all.\n\nAs a result, my grandma(his mom) ended up babysitting us during our toddler years. She never spoke up about his parenting skills even though she knows what he does. She’s very sympathetic and lacks a backbone because she believes in karma. Due to her relationship with the rest of the family, she is financially dependent on her children.\n\nIn recent years, my dad is upset my mom is constantly away for business trips and coming home late from work. He is also angry that the family doesn’t have enough money to go on vacations. So he would ask my mom for money to go to casinos and when she refused, he lied about going on a tour instead. His increased spendings cause my mom to refuse him allowance (since his salary isn’t enough to support his leisure and the family). He now has an extra job which he uses to save money for personal spending.\n\nSo here is where the issue starts. I do not like interacting with my grandma because every time we meet, she gives us money. It makes me feel like she’s bribing us to see her and I don’t want that type of relationship. She is also very doting in my dad and takes his side of things. When my dad got kidney stones, she blamed my family and I for not taking care of him. He also has an issue with his weight and we all tried to put him on a diet, which he gave up on after a few months.\n\nAll the interactions I have with my grandma can be summarized into: \n•take care of your dad\n•remember to go out on walks with him and remind him to eat his fruits\n•he sacrificed a lot for you\n•remember to take care of your dad when you grow old because he loves you and you’re his child\n•he took up the extra job to send you to college (false, he tried to talk me out of college and told me he would not support me financially)\n\nI don’t like my grandma for trying to mend my relationship with my dad. There’s a lot more things he did to me as a kid that I can never forgive. I love and appreciate her for what she’s done for me when I was a kid. I want to spend time with her without the topic of my dad coming up, which is not possible.\n\nTLDR: I don’t get along with my dad and my grandma tries to mend our relationship forcefully. So I don’t like talking to either of them.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A few months ago the tenant for my apartment knocked on my door to ask me, very politely, to help with cleaning the common stairwell because they had received complaints about dog hair. \n\nMy dog sheds a lot so I was not that surprised. He said that they didn't want to up the frequency of the current cleaners they have because it would cost more money and asked me to perhaps buy a small handheld vacuum cleaner and remove my dogs hair every now and then.\n\nI know it's their responsibility to keep it clean but I also recognize that as a dog owner I probably make more of a mess than others so I agreed. I looked at a schedule where the cleaning crew sign every time they clean and noticed it was every other week. So I decided I could perhaps also clean every other week essentially making it so that it gets cleaned once a week.\n\nToday I noticed a note on the main door downstairs from the tenants organization saying (translated):\n\n\"Please clean up after your dogs for everyone's comfort.\"\n\nThere was also a picture of a bunch of cleaned up dog hair, so much that it was impossible that they had taken the picture after I started cleaning every other week. I now have a good grasp on how much there is every week. So I thought that it was kind of passive-aggressive, but perhaps I'm reading too much into it.\n\nI looked at other main doors in the apartment complex and it was only in mine this note was found so I suspect this issue will come up again because somebody is probably still complaining about it. Which is why I want to know if I have a leg to stand on here or not.\n\nSure, there is dog hair (not ONLY from mine, there are others but they are much smaller than mine so they don't make nearly as much of a mess) but there is also gravel, and dirty smelted snow etc. so it's not like it would be spotless if it weren't for my dog. I don't think it's too much hair but I'm a dog owner so maybe I'm desensitized to it?\n\nSo, now I want to know... AITA? ",

      "description": "About a month ago, I was a house party with my classmates (I’m 17, grade 12). The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I’m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who’s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I’m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I’m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram’s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she’s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she’s smoking a joint and in a third, she’s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn’t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber’s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she’s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend’s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald’s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend’s mom and tell her what’s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don’t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe’s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who’ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she’s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a “fucking life ruining asshole” because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren’t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn’t done anything, I’d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven’t talked at all which kinda hurts. ",

      "description": "Rachel's (best friend) birthday was not long ago.That day, an anonimous person called her to wish her happy birthday, and he also said that he's her classmate's (also her ex's) aquintance. At first she thought it was kinda funny, but got mad pretty quickly at the fact that someone gave her number to a person she doesn't know. Her ex (let's call him Tom) then texted her and apologised for his friends's prank, and also told her who that person was. I'll call him Jeff. (It was a boy who was following some of us on instagram and also messaging one of my friends) Tom has a whole group of friends in our class, so we didn't know which ones he was referring to. He said he didn't know either. (He only knew that it was his friends's prank because only he and some of his friends knew Jeff) I have a small group of friends too, it'll be important later. We agreed that it was one of Tom's guy friends, because they are the ones who do stuff like this often.\n\nA few days later, Rachel saw another classmate's instagram story, in which was the date my best friend got the call, the username of Jeff, a screenshot of a game, and a text that said something like \"we should do it again\". This girl was also one of Tom's friends. I'll call her Brenda. Because of this, Rachel thought that it was Brenda who gave out her number to Jeff, and inmadietely wrote her theory in our groupchat. Some of our friends agreed with her, one didn't say anything, and I was disagreeing. I said that it was barely an evidence, while she kept insisting that it meant that it's 100℅ that this girl did it. I said that it didn't make much sense, because Brenda had no reason to do it and she wasn't someone who liked to prank people either. Rachel then called me an idiot and said she doesn't care if it's logical or not.\n\nThis pointless conversation dragged on until I got fed up with them accusing someone of something with barely enough evidence. So I texted Brenda and asked if she knew who gave out Rachel's number, and that my friends were blaming it on her. She told me she didn't even knew about the prank and that she would tell me if she found out something. I don't think she was lying to me.\n\nThe next day, Brenda asked one of my friends who she was close with about why they were accusing her, and of course told that friend about me texting her. The news about us texting got in the ears of the whole friend group. Then they confronted me about it, and asked me how did I dare to do that. So I told them that it was wrong to accuse Brenda like this, and I wanted to hear her side of the story too. They were also angry at the fact that I told her they were accusing her, saying I had no right to do it. As if they had the right to just pin the blame on a random person. They were throwing all kinds of shit at me (not literally), including that if they weren't so nice they would have dumped me out of the group for this.",

I always kinda of chocked us not hanging out much because she’d give him shit about it and make his life miserable. Through it all I asked him to be a groomsman in my upcoming wedding.\n\nRecently he decided to divorce her and confided in me a good bit through it. I thought that we’d finally become the friends I had hoped we’d be all along since we live so close and I mentioned that I hope we do now that he is free from her.\n\nBefore his divorce was even final though, he met a girl on a dating app and just doesn’t give me time outside of hockey even though he hangs out with her 5-6 times a week. I mentioned to him that this kind of makes me mad and I feel like he’s not really acting like a friend and it wasn’t his ex wife at all. He apologized and told me he’d make more of an effort to return texts and maybe watch a hockey game or grab dinner from time to time.\n\nIt was cool for like three weeks. He was returning my texts and we even grabbed dinner and caught a hockey game together. However, he started reverting back to blowing me off and ignoring my texts claiming he’s busy. I know it’s bs because he’s the type to make time for her 5-6 times a week and always responds to her texts. \n\nAITA because I’ve gotten fed up with him and no longer want him in my wedding?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are in a very loving relationship. We get along very well, this was just a minor spat that I'd like a different perspective on. Even if you do feel that my girlfriend was in the wrong, please do NOT attack her or call her names. \n\nI recently did a local show that required sitting next to other people and answering lots of questions. I brought two chairs, one for myself and my gf, plus a table.\n\nThe lady next to us, lets call her \"Sara\" who we have met before and is very friendly to both of us, had forgotten to bring a chair. My girlfriend was leaving for an hour or two, so I offered to let the lady next to me use the extra chair. Sara said that she would give it back as soon as my girlfriend came back.\n\nI spent more time standing than sitting, so as to get closer to people asking questions. After an hour and a half my gf came back, sat in the remaining chair, and said she missed me and wished we could sit next to each other so we could hold hands and lean against each other. She said this quietly, Sara didn't hear.\n\nA few minutes later Sara, as promised brought the chair back. I felt bad about sitting while Sara had to stand, especially since I had to stand 80% of the time anyway. So I gave Sara back my chair. I instead sat on the edge of the table between conversations.\n\nMy girlfriend was upset with me and I said I felt really wrong sitting while Sara had to stand. My gf got upset, and left to go visit her parents until the show was over (about 3 more hours).\n\nIt's important to note that this was on a Friday night. Later on my girlfriend explained the reason she was upset was that Friday nights are our date nights. My girlfriend had already worked all day, and chose to spend the evening with me at the show. She wanted to at least be able to sit close together and was hurt I gave back the chair after Sara brought it back.\n\nI see her perspective, but I still would have felt wrong sitting while a friend of ours had to stand the whole time. I at least had a table to sit on.\n\nSo, am I?",

      "title": "AITA for surrendering a puppy to a no-kill rescue due to separation anxiety?",
      "description": "Background info, I did post a while ago about my roommate not paying rent, etc. This is a totally different topic. \n\nMy SO and I adopted a puppy, who we will call Koda. He was part of a litter of five large breed mixed puppies found right before Florence hit. He was from Kentucky, and we were in contact with the rescue and explained our situation--I work from home most of the week and My SO works Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday. We puppy-proofed the house, bought a lot of toys, talked to our vet to prepare for him, etc. We originally asked to foster, but were denied, and after speaking to his foster, we were told he would be fine as an only dog but could also have other dogs in the house without a problem. We have fostered with them before, but never foster failed, so we are experienced dog folks. \n\nWe fostered two dogs when he came to us originally, but within one week of Koda coming to us, our adult male foster dog who played with Koda regularly went to a foster to adopt situation, and Koda threw a fit. He cried, barked, did not eat, did not sleep, did not play. Just laid in his crate all day and barked. He had barked before this, and was mourning his litter mates for about 24 hours after leaving them, but settled quickly. When the male foster dog left, it lasted days. Our female foster cuddled up to him, and played with him and was his buddy. When they were together, I could leave him unsupervised for 20  minutes without a problem (in a puppy proofed room). He was 12 weeks when this all happened. \n\nFast forward two weeks, all is well, but then our female foster gets adopted. Koda goes through the whole routine again, and we talked to the rescue to see if they could give us advice on how to help Koda with the transition. We are basically told that if we love him enough, we will figure it out and find a way to make it work for him as a single dog. Koda makes himself sick over the loss of Jill. The stress of it literally made him ill--diarrhea, vomiting, not eating, etc. Took him to the vet and she agreed it was basically acute stress though we had done our best not to change his routine. We nurse him back to health slowly and we are encouraged to keep him quiet for a few days till he feels better. \n\nEventually he does. We wean him back onto his normal schedule, diet, etc. We think he is going to be fine as an only dog, but suspect he would be happier in a house with kids or other dogs. We bring it up to the rescue again and again. Due to my job, I couldn't adopt another dog until March, but I am very worried about him since he seems less energetic/happy ever since he was an only dog. Also due to my job, I wasn't in the position to foster again at this point. \n\nOne morning, we put him in his crate to go grab breakfast one day--we are gone forty five minutes or so. It is probably the first time he has been home without me since the female foster left. My roommate is home, so he isnt alone. I come back and he is throwing up and in distress. Take him to vet, same thing, stress response. I talked to the rescue again (fourth or fifth time) and say that after talking with my vet, it is agreed that he needs another dog so that he wont be so distressed when we leave the house. After explaining, I am told that I am a horrible owner and that I need to consider his needs before my own, and that \"who was I\" to make the judgment that he was so stressed out by all of this? Vet ran blood, urine, and fecal, and besides a bladder infection and one roundworm in his throw up (which didn't show in the fecal), he was healthy. \n\nI love this dog and am very attached to him. But due to the health issue, doggy day care isnt willing to take him.\n\nThings have devolved to the point that if he is alone for more than 30 seconds, he is in severe distress, and we are concerned he will self harm. We also do not want him to make himself physically Ill every time we leave the house even for a short time. This also applies to when he cannot see us, such as showers.\n\nWe have exhausted all possible ways of keeping him with the resources we have and felt like surrendering him so we could get him into a home was the best thing to do for him. This is a first for us, since pets are for life in my house, but we also tried to put his needs first--and he needs someone home all the time, and another dog, or he will make himself sick. \n\nTL;DR: we do love the dog and are not wanting to surrender because it is \"convenient\". We want to do so because given the separation anxiety, confirmed by vet, we feel we do not have any options because he is making himself physically Ill if my SO, another dog, or myself aren't there. We do have a potential adopter lined up for him that would meet all of his needs that is pre screened through the rescue. We agreed to surrender him and foster him so we could find him the perfect home and we think this is it and the rescue agrees. Are we the assholes for making this decision? ",

      "description": "Ok here’s the situation. I’m a 27 (M) married and have a good job in a cubicle. Completely self sustainable, and absolutely not a ‘fuck up’ by most standards. My parents are in their upper-mid 60’s and both retired. \n\nEvery week, I go over to see them at least once. Being so much older the me, my parents kind of always treat me like I’m still a boy when it’s me and them one-on-one, this frustrates the crap out of me. If my dad feels like giving me unsolicited advice, he does so by getting extremely serious and and lecturing me like Clint Eastwood  in Grab Torino or some shit. Like I said, fucking annoying. \n\nI’ve called him out on this kind of tone/behavior before and it always results in terrible arguments where I’m wrong in every way imaginable. This situation will be no different...\n\nFlashback to last Sunday night. My wife and I go over to my parents house for a thanksgiving dinner since we will be out of town visiting her parents on the actual day. We have a fine time, eating, drinking, and being as merry. We say our goodbyes and go on our way. \n\nFlashforward to the present. I’m coming down with a cold and on my way home from work decide to stop by and say hi. Haven’t spoken or heard from them since the other night. No big deal. I show up, dads watching tv, moms in the kitchen, and we start shouting the shit..’how’s work’, ‘what’s new’, all that jazz. I mention i haven’t been feeling well, my mom comes in, we all talk for a minute, then I get up to use the restroom...\n\nWhen I get back in the room and take a seat, dad pulls out the remote, turns the volume wayyy down and gets this super serious look on his face. Dad:“You know we love you son.. We need to talk...”\n\nMe: *Oh Fuck* *Minds racing* *Feels like I’m in high school again. What could this be? I haven’t done anything! I’m an adult FFS!*\n\nTurns out, that the other night I was eating like a total slob. This is unacceptable behavior. Dad proceeds to lecture how embarrassing it would be for others and my career if I continued along this path of mannerless mayhem. He is VERY serious, and pissed. Towards the end of his rant he realizes I’m not taking this seriously which he calls out immediately.\n\nWe go back in forth about how I think this is basically the stupidest argument they have ever started and I kind of go overboard and blow up about how they are always stressing me out by treating my like a child. This leads to more back and forth arguing and circles back to reference lots of arguments we have had over the last couple years. We are very heated. \n\nAfter about 30m of this I tell them that we are not going to resolve this and they agree. I tell them I love them, they say the same but dad adds that he is disappointed as I’m about to leave. I tell him that I am disappointed too.\n\nOuch.\n\nTLDR:\n\nDad is an authoritarian style lecturer and called me out randomly for having poor table manners. I didn’t  appreciate this attitude and got into a heated argument. It was not resolved. We are both still pissed. I could have just kept my mouth shut but had had enough of being talked down to.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "For some background- this kid, about a year older than me back in freshmen year, fucked with me for the entirety of the first semester without EVER stopping. \n\nJust about every day he’d make some snide fucking remarks, always giving me that look like I was literally a cockroach in the dirt, a piece of dog shit scraped onto his shoe. I get it- you bully freshmen in highschool, it’s what you do. \n\nBut I was sick of it.\n\nSo one day, I grabbed his wrist, and I told him to quit it. We locked eyes for about twenty seconds, him calmly saying “…let go. Hey, let go.” \n\nThan he slammed the side of my head into the seat, and punched me on the other side. \n\nI stumbled back into my seat. Tried playing it off, him keeping up that look, acting like he’s got this foot long motherfucking dick and he just slapped it across my face. A wannabe Alpha who picked on the literal bottom of the social hierarchy to prove how fucking macho he is. \n\nBut I had a case in my hand, big one to. I was about to shove it straight into his chest before I arrived at my stop. \n\nLooking back, it would’ve been great. To wipe that look off his face, chip a tooth maybe. Fuck him up to the point where people were talking about how he got his ass beat by a freshmen.\n\nI struggled to walk home. I sat in front of my desk, and played a game on my desktop for about thirty minutes. \n\nWhen I tried to stand my leg buckled. \n\nTurns out that motherfucker gave me a concussion, which I had to go to the emergency room to take care of. My mom was pissed that I didn’t tell her anything about it until 10:30 that night, and holds it over my head till this day. \n\nThe school gave us both a Friday detention, since I initiated it. We had to ride on the same bus and still do even today- but we don’t talk, sit in different sections. \n\nI can still hear him talking about it with his friends on occasion. I’ve been going to weightroom though, and while starting this shit up again would probably ruin my record, snapping one of his arms would bring me so much satisfaction. \n\nIs it wrong that I want revenge so badly? I don’t obsess over this- but when it’s brought up, I get mad. ",

      "description": " My best friend Jake's wife died about a month ago in a car crash and he's handling it terribly. He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to invite my brother-in-law to our wedding?",
      "description": "  \n\nA couple of years ago I would have called my fiancé’s brother my best friend.  I met James after I had been dating my gf for a few months. He transferred to our college and needed a place to stay, so me and my roommate let him crash on our couch until he got a place. It was a fun time—we got along well, I ended up getting him a job where I worked, and when he moved out we continued to hang out a lot.\n\nAfter my current lease expired, my girlfriend, James, and myself got a place together near campus. Somewhere along the way, James became my best friend. We hung out all the time and had serious conversations about life, politics, religion, etc.  I had never had a friend before (besides my brother) who made me think or pushed me like that, and I thought I did the same for him.  We also joked around a lot and made tons of jokes. We could loosen up and make the sorts of jokes that really are only funny to family. We watched shitty shows together and played video games. The point is that we got along really well for a couple of years.\n\nMy girlfriend and I graduated college and moved to a different city a few hours away so I could start a grad program. Around this time, I decided to propose to my girlfriend and I heavily involved James in the entire process. He was all for it.  At some point, he told his friends (jokingly) that he was jealous of his sister. I told him that he was really important to me and that he would be the second guy in line behind me at the wedding after my brother.\n\nAfter my fiancé and I moved to the new city, our life became pretty hectic.  I had to spend a lot of time on my classes and she was working terrible hours at her job. During this time, I routinely played video games with him online (typically the best part of my day). One day while playing, we were having a political discussion—these had become pretty popular with Trump being elected—and he said something that I knew to be false. I interrupted him saying “No, no, no, actually…” then corrected him. I can get fairly antimated when I discuss politics, although I never intend to be me mean. In this case, my mind was preoccupied with the video game so it probably came out harsher than I realized. I did not know this for quite a while, but apparently this exchange upset him pretty badly.\n\nFor the next couple of months, he never initiated text conversations with me, and did not respond well when I would. I asked to talk about what was going on, telling him that his friendship was important to me and I wanted to understand what was happening. He responded a couple days later agreeing to talk the next time we saw each other. \n\nThe next time we saw each other was when I was on Christmas break. We were over at their family friend’s for Christmas. I was trying to set up a fun activity for me and some of our college friends to do over the break, and I texted James while the older people at the house were talking and the younger people were all pretty much on their phones. I watched him basically screen my texts and not respond until I told him “check your phone” in my most non-confrontational tone. He agreed to go and our group had fun.  I ended up paying for him to go (he didn’t offer to pay me back and didn’t say thank you) but it was fun. \n\nAfterward, I wanted to drink like old times. Everyone else (6 of us) were down but James did not want to. We still had not talked but I thought if we were a little bit looser it would be easier to broach an uncomfortable subject. I am terrible with uncomfortable conversations but last time that he was mad at me we made up after a couple of drinks. But he refused.\n\nMy fiancé’s cousin was getting married and me and her entire family went on a road trip to go to the wedding. Before we left, they decided to open up Christmas presents. I did not know we were doing this then and did not bring my presents for anyone. He had gotten me a nice, thoughtful present, and when I opened it, I gave a fairly muted reaction because:\n\n1. I did not have my present for him\n\n2. I was wondering why he was giving me a present at all when it was so uncomfortable between us, and\n\n3. I have always hated presents. I know that they are very meaningful for other people, but I typically been of the opinion that if I wanted something I would just go get it.\n\nAnyway, I did say thank you, and did not realize that I gave a bad response at the time.\n\nWe left right after, taking his car for the road trip. He spent a lot of the trip doing or saying passive aggressive things to me. He would do little things like lock me in the car at gas stations, or say “no shit” to me when I was trying to make conversation. At one point, I was joking around with their mom, who I have always had a great relationship with. He accused me of being disrespectful, which caught everyone off guard. \n\nLater that night, we were staying at a relative’s house, and my fiancé and her mother were talking about a personal issue that really upset her. James walks in, hears 10 seconds of their conversation, and then tells my fiancé that it’s not a big deal and to get over it. At this point I had enough and I told him that he was being a dick.  This really upset him and he told me that I was extremely arrogant “I take too many liberties with his family” and that “even though I am marrying his sister I am not part of the family.”  In retrospect, I appreciate the irony of being called arrogant by someone that heard a tiny bit of a conversation then had to interject his opinion, but in the moment I was pretty upset and told him once again that he was being a dick. This was probably as dramatic as it gets in this family.\n\nAfter it cooled down, I tried to talk to him, but he refused. We made the trip back home in the most uncomfortable ride of my life. I was filled with anxiety. The whole time, I was expecting him to want to talk about it but he never did. I gave him a couple months after that to reach out to me, and when he didn’t I texted him. No response. We saw him again one time later and he basically side-eyed me the whole time. My fiancé had a long, unpleasant conversation with him that night where he basically said that he knew he was right about me and that I would never change.  After that, I tried texting him, calling him, etc. I just asked to talk. I told him that his friendship was important to me. I apologized for my actions. I couldn’t believe that he at some point decided I was horrible and rather than talking to me about the problems, decided to basically ruin his relationship with both me and his sister. I lost sleep over this for months, and I still think about it often. No one in his family is impressed with him.\n\nSo yeah, after all of this, I definitely don’t want him to be a part of the wedding but I also don’t think he should even be there. Of course, if he ever talked to me or answered any of my calls, I would feel differently, but it feels like he has built up a huge wall between us. My fiancé still wants him there but I know that if I see him on my wedding day it will make me have some combination of strong, negative emotions. I know that we will probably end up inviting him but AITA for really not wanting to? \n\nTl;dr: future brother-in-law were really good friends but had a falling out that I don’t totally understand. He has refused to talk to me for almost a year and has been a jerk to both me and my fiancé (his sister). AITA for not wanting him at the wedding?",

      "description": "Okay hi, first time poster here but long time lurker. Also sorry in advance for the format I’m on mobile. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nSo let’s start the situation. I (19F) have been living in an apartment complex with my two other roommates for almost 6 months now. Everything is not bad except the upstairs neighbors. We live on the ground floor which is nice but the upstairs neighbors and RELENTLESS! They have three kids and two parents which itself isn’t bad but their kids are always running, jumping, hitting the floor so they make my roommates dogs bark. \n\nAt first I was very civil. I went upstairs and explained I was trying to sleep and they were being very loud. The mother said, and I quote “Yeah sorry our young kid is autistic and I’m autistic so we can’t really do much.” I’m not joking. I then told her that she should get skills to deal with that because it’s unfair to blame your kids and your disease because you can’t stop stomping around at 12 am. \n\nEven after that, I continued to go upstairs and tell them they were being loud nearly every night. They always said the same thing. “Oh sorry our autistic child isn’t going to sleep.” And I didn’t say anything mean but I just said, “That’s okay but it’s late and my roommates and I need to sleep because we have work tomorrow.” The mother said they would try and put him down. I said okay and went back downstairs. Their noise continued until 3 am. \n\nFast forward to like a few months from then and I’ve grown very tired of going upstairs so I’ve gone to the office and they said I can email this one assistant and the office and document my noise complaints. Now I’ve been doing that for about two or three months. Nothing has changed. So I’ve gone to just hitting the ceiling really hard to tell them to be quiet because I’m completely over their kids running around at 3 am because I’m directly under the autistic kid’s room. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for hitting the ceiling every night to try to quiet my neighbors?\n\nTLDR; My neighbors are always loud at odd hours and after trying to be civil for months they won’t let up so I’m hitting my ceiling every night.

So she met them. \n\nHis parents apparently really liked her, saying things like 'we didn't like his ex, she trapped him in a marriage by becoming pregnant on purpose, but you won't do it bc you have your life in order and a good job!' (thankfully not in front of the girls!!).\n\nJane asked Tom later what they were talking about. Tom said that it was all true, that the ex got pregnant on purpose because she didn't want to work, and then she cheated so he left her.\n\nIn two months she has been at his house practically everyday. They usually do family stuff with the kids (like family restaurants, kids movies ecc.). I know because they post everything on fb. Jane said she has to because Tom says the kids want to see her every day. The couple of days the girls were at their mom's she met all his friends (the mom sees them rarely).\n\nI asked if she sees this relationship as long term, and she said she doesn't know.\n\nNow there are a couple of (what I believe are) red flags. First the jumping in the role of a surrogate parent so early in the relationship. I think kids need stability in life. Is meeting his girlfriend so early and treating her as a parent healthy? What if they'll break up in two months? A year? Will the new girlfriend be their new mom? I don't really know bc I don't have children and bc I didn't have a let's say normal childhood.\n\nAlso is it really wise to go so fast in a relationship where your boyfriend and his parents are ready to shit on the children's mother to the first person they met? I mean maybe she is a monster I don't know but they had known Jane only for 10 days at that point! That's too much drama if you ask me.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I say I think she's making a big mistake, that could hurt her and two innocent children? Or am I too judgmental?",

      "title": "AITA for estranging my older brother?",
      "description": " \n\nLet me premise this by saying that I do not think IATA, but from time to time I still think about if I may be the asshole here.\n\nMy family never grew up religious, I can count on one hand the amount of times I have been to church/synagogue etc. My parents never really talked on the topic growing up so we were left to our own devices. I became agnostic as I believed there was no sure way to tell if a god existed or not, but I didn't put a lot of thought into it. Fast forward to my older brother leaving for 1st year college -- he was late on his residence application so he had to find an apartment to rent instead. He lived alone, and being a pretty big introvert himself, it's safe to say he did not make many friends if any. Depression set in due to this isolation, although he was very good at hiding it from our family.\n\nSomewhere in his first year at college, he met this girl and they clicked. Both philosophy majors and smart in their own ways they started to see each other often. I feel that my older brother got attached romantically although this was never her intention. Her intention was to recruit my older brother for their Catholic Organization at the church. At first, she just invited him to come to church on Sundays, see what it was about and make a decision for himself. He got accustomed to this ritual and started going regularly. Before our family knew it, he was canvassing door to door, babysitting for free at the church for Sunday school, and had joined and bought into this cult-like organization.\n\nMy family did not find out about this, or the organization, until the next year. My older brother was in way too deep by this point and there was no sense in trying to talk him out of it. He felt as though there was a void in his life and that finding Jesus helped him. My parents did some more research into the church and the specific organization and found some disturbing information. They have their recruiters, such as this girl , target people at risk such as my brother; people who are lost. The other thing is that they support conversion therapy for homosexuals.\n\nMy parents tried and tried to get him to realize what he is involved in. He did a good job of just staying under the radar and finishing his degree. Well that all changed when my younger brother came out as gay, and not long after my older brother announced (regrettably at the birthday dinner of my Mother) that he was going to start the process into being a priest through this church and organization. My mother cried, father extremely upset, and me and my younger brother just felt confused.\n\nMy family has barred him from coming to the house and holiday get togethers. I tried to stay in contact occasionally with him, birthday meetups, texts at Thanksgiving etc. Then I started to see the situation from my younger brother and my parents POV. I haven't spoken to him in a little over two years. AITA for not trying harder to keep this relationship going?",

      "description": "So I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. \n\nBasically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? ",

My girlfriend is very annoyed at me.

The feelings are gone, I would definitely have bought something for my girlfriend if she wouldn't flip out, and I feel like her view of guys and girls being friends is outdated.

She had really long working hours (60+ hour work weeks) and wouldn't be able to talk or reply whilst at work.

      "title": "AITA for thinking my \"best-friend\" is actually a fake friend? (LONG)",
      "description": "I'm in my 4th year of University, and i've been living with the same 2 guys since first day of residence. Ill refer to the first guy as Rob, and the other as Marcus (neither of which are their actual names). Since 1st year Marcus has had a girlfriend that he spends majority of his time with, which is not my problem, it's how he has always been, and I understand it.\n\nMy problem is with who I really thought my best-friend was, and that was Rob. Since 1st year all the way up until the ending of 3rd year, I had no doubt that me and Rob were best-friends and that both of us had felt this way. We had been through a lot together, whether it be having each other's backs at parties when people started fights, countless talks on life and our career's whether it be drunk, high, or sober. We had both seen each other go through break-ups, and I feel like we both did what best-friends do when someone is in need of support. This started to change at the end of 3rd year, and it's been a struggle ever since.\n\nNow i know the first response is \"people grow apart\" or \"your just not his best-friend anymore\" and i get that. I've gone through that experience and understand that although its shitty, it's what happens with friendships sometimes. But this is different.\n\nI'm someone who deals with anxiety, but it's a functional anxiety. I go through most of my day without people knowing i'd ever have an anxiety problem, as i'm sure is the case with many others. While Rob is an extremely confident person, he is also aware that i deal with anxiety and has been helpful in the past at talking me down when i'm nervous about something. Since Marcus is always busy with his girlfriend, Me and Rob have always talked about how we are much closer with each other then we are with Marcus, even though we all live together. Since i deal with anxiety, i struggle making new friends, so knowing Rob was my best-friend was always very comforting for me and knowing he felt the same way.\n\nThis year has been different, and is starting to seem like Rob is more of a fake friend, then a best friend. After living with someone for 4 years (breaks during summer etc) there is obviously going to be arguments, and i expect that. But this year every time me and Rob argue, he goes and play's best-friend with Marcus. This is frustrating for me because Rob talks a lot of shit behind Marcus's back, whether it be about his girlfriend, intelligence, fashion style etc.. and then all of a sudden he goes and is buddy-buddy with Marcus after Rob disagrees with me on something. He knows i deal with anxiety and wouldn't want to expose him to Marcus for what he says, cause then the entire house would be so awkward and impossible to deal with in our last year. I hate making a big deal about things, but I also hate people being fake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a while i'd put up with this, Rob would eventually get tired of Marcus (he is kinda boring lol) and would then come play best-friends with me again. Although it was a clear cycle of Rob using whoever is most beneficial to him, i put up with it for a few months knowing its my last year and it'll be over soon, and when he would pretend to be my best-friend again, it wasn't so bad. But its getting to a breaking point now. Him being fake friends with Marcus to try and annoy me when we got in fights was petty, but tolerable to an extent. It is now getting intolerable.\n\nWhenever Rob wants to do something; go to a party, a bar, watch a certain UFC fight, etc. It is always a huge deal, and he expects me to go with him or else i'll be guilt tripped into it and i usually end up going anyway. I know he enjoys these things, and if he went alone then it wouldn't be as fun. So thinking as a best-friend, i go with him. Even if im not feeling like going out (which is a big deal for some people with anxiety). But whenever something is important to me, Rob always says he is down, we make plans for the weekend, and then everytime by Friday, he says he is going home for the weekend instead, to usually party with friends from his hometown. If i was to ever bail on him like that, he would chew me out, and then go play best-friends with Marcus to annoy me. But when he does it, since he is so confident, he just talks like it's no big deal and gives excuse after excuse and then pretends like nothing happened. This has resulted in countless nights of me watching Football games, Hockey games, or attempting to go to parties alone. And being alone sucks. And being alone with anxiety isn't any better.\n\nI understand Rob has other friends, and him hanging out with his friends from his hometown has been common since 1st year so its nothing new. But this year, whenever I want to do something (i.e. go to a party of someone i know), he gets me all hyped up to go, and says how down he is, and then bails last second. Sometimes even denying saying he was down in the first place. And then he goes home on the weekend, and comes back like nothing happened, and pretends to be friends again. This is because there happens to be a party HE wants to go to this week, and wants me to go with him since Marcus always goes home to visit his girlfriend on the weekend and is never around for parties. If i even talk about going home on the weekend, he gets all defensive and mad that he doesn't want to go alone and if im his \"boy\" then I should come. I try and explain to him that he has left me to go alone several times and even though it sucks, i've had to do it. But he doesn't understand. He only ever understand's something if it has happened to him, or relates to him.\n\nThis usually causes a fight, and you guessed it, he plays best-friends with Marcus, and i'm left alone in my room with anxiety. I can't take it anymore. Its a house full of fake friends pretending to get along, while in reality Rob just talks shit about Marcus and then uses him when its beneficial to him. I cant take the fakeness anymore. It's so blatant, but its my last semester of school, I have 3 months left and ill be moving out. I dont want to ruin any friendships before I move out, as i have trouble making friends and I dont want to lose the ones i have now. Even if they aren't the best, it's pretty much all i got.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long read. It's half me venting and half me asking for advice on who is in the wrong. Maybe my anxiety is too much for him sometimes and i expect too much but i dont know. If you have any advice or thoughts, it would be appreciated.",

The amount of effort to hire someone to watch our animals while we're gone, take time out of our schedule, and parent outside of our home does not seem like a vacation whatsoever. It would cost us a lot to eat out each meal for 2 days and would be completely draining trying to get a 3 and 2 year old to sleep in a hotel room with us. I see it as putting in all the work so my parents can take a few pictures and have their memories. The better gift would be THEY take the kids to GWL while Mom and Dad have a weekend off.",

But he was pretty firm that the settlers were wrong about so much that they did without acknowledging the wisdom of local peoples. I pointed out that Native Amercians got a lot wrong too, like having a dance to create rain. I was more focused on trying to point out that 300 years ago nobody really knew what was going on around us and humans from all cultures were just blundering around trying to make the best of things. \n\nThis was the part where he called me a racist. Pretty out of character for him and I feel like I really hurt him but I'm not sure I'm can honestly admit that a rain dance isnt just another old superstition like blessing a house or people who call psychic hotlines. \n\nI can appreciate that it's a cultural practice and may have significance there but it is empirically ineffective.

      "description": "My partner and I have been together for five and a half years and he has a 10 year old daughter, whom he shares custody with her mother. She is an amazing,  beautiful girl and I love her like my own.\n\nAfter being \"dad's girlfriend\" for a year or two,  we became more like a family unit.  Initially, the arrangement was for me to be a part of everything - picking up from school, being a support, getting her to do homework, light disciplining etc. \n\nSix months ago we realized this arrangement wasn't working,  and we decided that i wouldn't do any disciplining or telling her what she needs to do (like have a shower etc), and that this would be left to dad. Although I initially resisted this,  I've accepted it and saw that it has had the best outcome for her, and us overall.  \n\nAround the same time,  my partner has become more closed with what information he gives me about her, and the arrangements/ \nconversations he has about her with her mother. Her mother is not an amicable person,  and he talks to her about logistics only.  But he's stopped having open communication with me about what's going on with his daughter and the things he decides with his mother. During this change six months ago,  I struggled with not having any decision making influence on anymore, but I've accepted that her dad and mother are the ones to decide what goes on with her.  \n\nHe tells me now that he doesn't need to tell me what he decides with her mum,  and it's at his discretion what he tells me,  and he has zero responsibility to tell me anything.  My stepdaughter was seeing a psychologist recently and they had the follow up appointment with dad and mum a while ago. He said that the psych said some concerning things (which he told me) but didn't go any further to tell me what strategies they put in place, or how the mother took it.  He never wants to talk about it. \n\nThere have been a few times where i would find out about my daughter through his conversations with other people.  Eg we'd be out and he'd mention to someone else what extracurricular activities she's doing next year,  and that would be the first time I've heard of it. That really hurts.  \n\nI've spoken to him about how I feel quite a few times, but he is adamant that he doesn't need to tell me anything he decides with her mother, and I should just support him anyway.  I would feel more connected as a couple if he asks for my opinion about decisions he makes so we can feel more like a team,  but at this point in time,  I just want to get more information.  I feel that as a family unit,  it's assumed that he would be open with me (at least on the important stuff, like the psych appointment) to ensure we're on the page on raising this amazing girl.\n\nAITA for wanting him to be openly communicative about this, and being hurt when he isn't? \n\nTldr; partner has stopped being openly communicative about his daughter, I'm hurt and feel like I should be informed about what goes on.  \n",

He’s moving permanently from the city he stayed in, but he has no ambition. He does not work and he gets money the illegal way, but since this is unfamiliar territory he really can’t do that. Also, we have a 2 bedroom and he has nowhere to place his stuff and I generally don’t need someone staying with me for an extended period of time knowing they aren’t going to help me in any way with rent, food, etc. Anyways, like I said he has no ambition so it’s basically gonna be like he’s going to stay with us for a good while for free. So onto the good part... I visit my roommates sister to get his new phone and some food she made and then I go back to his house to get my phone charger and then he tells me why he’s moving and I’m just sitting there like why did you agree to this roommate? and then I’m about to leave and he asks, “what are we going to do for cash flow” as if I was going to give him money (as I said this dude has no ambition to get a regular job or better himself). Also this guy has no respect for rules and assumes when he gets here he’s going to be able to do whatever he wants. What should I do in this situation and AITA?",

      "description": "When I was in high school, I was pretty lonely and would spend most of the time by myself. I ended up joining a club so that I could meet new people. One of my classmates was also in that club (I’ll call her Roxy for this story). Roxy is a pretty nice and kind person but she is also very gullible and quite a target for bullies. Roxy’s cousin (Betty) also attended the club. Betty is about a year older than us and is known to everyone as a nasty troublemaker and a bully. I was warned by friends to stay away from Betty but she was actually really nice towards me and I haven’t witnessed her being awful to anyone so I chatted to her from time to time. \nSometime after joining the club I found out that Betty was actually being horrible to Roxy but after upsetting her, she would bring up the fact that they’re cousins, make up and then bully Roxy again. I don’t know how long this went on for but it sounded like it’s happened multiple times. \nSince I talked to both Betty and Roxy in the club, I tried to comfort Roxy when I could and talk to Betty about being nicer to her. Of course this didn’t help. When I was hanging out with Betty, I heard her talking about pushing Roxy down the stairs. I told her not to do this but just to be sure, I texted Roxy, told her what I heard and to avoid Betty. \nThe next day, I walk into the club to find Roxy and Betty standing with linked arms. Betty has this smug smile on her face and Roxy tells me that she doesn’t want me to talk badly about Betty because she’s her cousin and to never talk to either of them again. Despite chatting to them, I wouldn’t consider them close friends so I wasn’t that bothered. I left the club and went back to spending breaks by myself in the library. Not even a week later, Roxy comes up to me apologising for everything she said and that I was right all along and that she wants to be friends again. I thought about it for a while and refused. I had my own problems and bullies to deal with and I didn’t want to additionally get involved with the dramas between these two girls. Roxy ended up crying and I never spoke to her again. \nI feel a bit bad from time to time thinking about this because I don’t think Roxy had many friends but at the same time I’m not keen on the idea of getting myself into trouble for the sake of people I barely know. I already faced a lot of harassment in high school and I don’t feel like I needed anymore. ",

      "description": "I'm graduating highschool at the end of May, and it's been a really rough road for me. I don't want a pity party or be like \"woe is me\", but I've had a difficult high school experience. I have some major medical issues that have caused me to miss a little over a year and 3/4 of high school total due to high amounts of pain. I had a home bound math tutor part of sophomore year and part of junior year, but I taught myself everything else that I missed. Some AP classes included. I'm proud of myself for being able to do this despite being at so many doctor's offices and being in pain most of the time throughout this, and it's a really big deal for me to be graduating on time with the rest of my friends.\n\nAnyway, my mom wants to celebrate my graduation along with my uncle's birthday, my grandpa's birthday, AND father's day all rolled into one. I don't want to be ungrateful, but it really bothers me that so many things will be going on and I feel like no one really cares about me graduating. It's being treated like a thing that comes around once a year when it took so much effort and time to do. Plus, I don't know how my uncle, grandpa, and other dads in our family feel about it being lumped together too. I'd hate to be lumped in no matter what was happening, but I'm especially upset because it's graduation for me.\n\nI told my mom about my concerns, and she said, \"well the weekend in June we're celebrating on is the only free weekend we have, so it makes sense to do it all at once\". I told her \"I get that, but then I can't invite my few friends to the party because we're doing a bunch of family things. And what about grandpa and uncle xyz; they probably won't feel special being lumped together with me. I know I don't being lumped in with them.\" She kinda brushed it off and said we'll just celebrate as a family and to get over it, we're still celebrating.\n\nI feel bad asking for extra work to be put in and another party separate from everything, but I really don't think it's fair to lump my graduation with things that happen every year, especially given how hard it was for me. Am I the asshole for asking to have a separate graduation party?",

      "description": "First post ever, so please go easy on me. This has been weighing on me and I need to vent. I have this best friend - we will call her F and my ex - let's call him N. I have been close friends with F since my birthday in 2017. We are like twins and we got along great. I love her dearly. At that time, I was in a relationship with N, a man who was all in all just great. \n\nF and I have been through this and thin in the coming years since we met. All until the circumstances that placed her living with N while he and I were still dating. I lived in another city. Distance dulled the relationship. I should have seen it coming, but N broke up with me. I never suspected anything. F was my best friend who I trust dearly. And I still do love and trust my ex. I wasn't bitter towards him, even if I was taken by surprise of the break up. \n\nF and N continued to live together while I lived in another town. Time went on and I had a gut feeling that they were dating. I didn't mind that at all, however it was a hard time for me. I was hoping they would tell me so that I can at least get some closure during hard times of losing my relationship. They never said anything. And the feeling only got worse and sickening. I became depressed.\n\nI didn't want to visit them even if they wanted me to. I would make up excuses to avoid the awkwardness. I had to process the hurt, all while suppressing the temptation to ask F if she was dating my ex. I did visit them a couple of times and I had a blast. We hang out and get along like family. I still love them and they're still my best friends that I hold dear to my heart.\n\nWhich is why it's so painful to finally have a confirmation that they have been dating for almost 6 months and wouldn't tell me out of fear of losing me. I understand that completely. Shoot, posting this is probably proving their point. But that's why I'm doing it, I guess. But it does still hurt. I personally believe I could have moved on and grown much more effectively with knowing from the beginning.\n\nSo I have approached them and told them how I felt. I still love them as friends, but AITA for being so upset over this?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So I'm selling my Grandpa's car for him (he stopped driving due to age). I was originally planning on selling it for $1500 (It's a good car, luxury package, but needs about $2500 in work).\n\nBefore I posted it anywhere, an elderly neighbor approached me asking if I was selling it and for how much. (Never met this neighbor before that). But he was really interested in the car, and is desperate for the lumbar support.\n\nThis was late-April 2017.\n\nFor the last 9 months, it's been back and forth with this guy. First, he wanted me to pay for getting it towed/inspected (I said I was selling it as-is). I didn't have time or cash, so I slowly began backing down the price until I was down to $750.\n\nConversation has been slow. While he will talk on the phone, he insists on mailing me letters covering all the same questions/answers again. (Snail mail. So even with decent mail service, it takes 2-3 days).\n\nHe doesn't live far, and while I appreciate wanting stuff written down for reference, I've offered more than once to have my kids come get/drop off letters.\n\nNope. He just wants snail mail.\n\nSo I tried to push closing the deal before Xmas, and he said there was no way for him to make it happen.\n\nFinally, last week I said I was going to start posting on Craigslist because I just want this done. I did, and I got several interested responses, with someone wanting to come look at it this weekend. (At the original prices of $1500)\n\nThe neighbor left me a voicemail yesterday saying that he was sorry that he didn't realize it had been 9 months, and he was making arrangements to get it towed to a shop and to finalize this shit.\n\nI feel bad because he's a nice guy, and has been dealing with a lot of Drs appts and illnesses etc. And I can sympathize with the back problems he struggles with (which is why he wants this car: the power/massaging lumbar support)\n\nAITA for wanting to tell him tough cookies and that I'm going to sell it to someone that's willing to pay full price and not dick around for months to put cash in my hand?\n\n\nTL;DR:\nElderly neighbor wants to buy used car. After 9 months and negotiating the price down by half, he has only started getting plans made to take it after I've started posting on Craigslist. At this point, I've had a lot of interest at full price, and would rather just tell him it's too late, but feel bad because he's a nice old man with health problems.",

Immediately after finding out the news, my mum travelled to my grandmas and has been there for the past two weeks. My grandma lives over 4 hours away from home, so as a result I (19 year old girl) have had to take care of my younger brother and cook for the family.\nI completely understand my mum is helping her family, but my grandma already has 8 other children who live near her and I really need my mum to come home.\nI'm currently a university student, and working a part time job whilst completing so many assignments I'm overwhelmed, and I feel like it's unfair that I'm expected to balance this alongside cooking, cleaning, and picking my brother up from school every day. My dad is at home too but he has to work every day and I feel guilty asking him to pick up my brother. \nMy mum called me today and said she's planning on staying another week, I said okay but also make a few comments about how we need her at home. It upset me to hear that my aunties were saying in the background 'what use in an older sister'.

We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "description": "So a friend of mine, likes to dump her issues on me. I'm fine with that, because I actually enjoy giving advice. We don't see eye to eye however, because I am a half-full type of person who believes in the power of human interaction and trust, and she is more cynical and leans towards safety through trepidation. \n\nUnderstandable.\n\nTo be clear, we are both victims of sexual assault, and both of us have recent encounters with toxic relationships. I got out of my relationship and began working in improvement, and her first toxic relationship was before I met her, but she nearly immediately got into another. This is where the issue starts. She continually unloaded how she was unhappy and did not trust her boyfriend shortly after we met. Being male, I don't like to give advice on this particular subject, because the perception it can cause. I try to take neutral positions but it quickly became apparent that the relationship was toxic, looking strictly from the side I was hearing. Anyway she struggled to leave after finding out he was cheating on her and yesterday let him back into her life.\n\nToday she told me she didn't trust any men except this boyfriend, not even her brothers she trusted \"not to rape, murder, or harm\" her. So I explained that from an outsider perspective that seemed to be a bit much, and I wasn't judging and I don't have her memories or expieriences, but she is making a sweeping generalization based on her abuse with one which can be harmful to others.\n\nI believe in the effect trauma has, but I also find it very pessimistic to see no flaw in thinking that \"all men want to rape me\" because someone posted lewd pictures of you online once.\n\nI did not vocalize that specific line of thinking, as I didn't want to make matters worse but I told her I didn't believe the way she did and she said my opinion does not matter because I've never been a victim. Now depending on how you define assault, it's debatable whether she's a victim of assault or harrassment. I say assault, However having been physically assaulted in my home at 15, for her to make the assumption that I had no clue or validity, upset me and I told her that I had been assaulted. she said this is the reason she doesn't trust men and why she still doesn't trust me. \n\nI feel that I let my emotions get in the way of tact and I came out as a bad person in the situation. At the same time I do believe every person has a right to comment or hold opinion if you present any statement to them.",

Tbh I could of probably phrased that better.  They reply saying “alright I have things to do every day”. I say “Ok but how much longer” then they message me saying “You would of spent however long in the bathroom and I would of been f**cked so what does it matter.”  They leave the bathroom a minute latter I take my shower and now it’s awkward in the house and we haven’t spoken all day.

When I seemed reluctant because it was last minute. She guilted me by telling me that I didn't like my nephews and I was a bad godmother. \n\nAnyway, I caved and we met up at my town's Mcdonald at 11h30. Her youngest started acting up, shouting, crying and shoving everything in his path. I didn't mind his actions because he is 18 months old but I was pissed at my sister for not doing anything and just laughing it off even though he was disrupting other tables. I calmed him and served him his food. Some minutes later, a mom sat next to us with 3 kids, the youngest being almost the same age as my youngest nephew.  \n\nSo, the other kid began to throw a tantrum quite similar to the one my nephew did. Everyone was trying to stare away awkwardly except for my sister who exclaimed :\n\n- For f*ck sake, you don't have kids if you don't know how to raise them! Why isn't she (the mom) going away? Usually I leave when a little sh*t like this acts out!\n\nI was so mad and could see the desesperate mom trying to pull her child and calm him. I told my sister not to say that three times but she kept saying it louder. Every one was giving her the stink eye. I finally told her that I didn't like how she was acting and would leave if she continued. She did so I left. I kissed my nephew who were playing in the games area and went home with my car ( she had her own too). She went home some time later I guess.\n\nI am here because now my sister and my mother are telling me that and overreacted. My sister also told me that it would be a while before I see my nephews again and that they wouldn't come to my bitrhday which is in two weeks.\n\nSo am i the Asshole?",

      "description": "Busking is very common in my town, with some street performers having it as a full-time source of income. Some, on the other hand, will only do ot for dun and won't earn very much at all - it's all for the experience of performing. Nobody is required to give money, but it's common courtesy that if you stop and enjoy a perfomance or otherwise interact with the busker, you should give them some change for their troubles. \n\nThere is one such performer who doesn't rely on it for a job - he does it in his free time as a side project. He wants to be the first autistic person to travel every continent using only the funds earned from busking, which is a very lofty goal seeing as a normal donation for a busker would be a dollar or two, but I admire his determination. It's worth mentioning that he is quite severely autistic, it's very obvious when talking to him.\n\nHis act is to tell jokes and do stand-up comedy. He honestly isn't very good and I wouldn't normally give money to somebody for the act, but he seemed sweet enough and I know it can be very hard for autistic people to put themselves out there and do what they love, so I stopped to listen.\n\nHe told a few jokes and such, but when I went to give him some change, I didn't have any coins on me, only a 10 dollar note. I wasn't willing to give him that much so I apologized and offered him a voucher for a free hot chocolate at a nearby coffee shop since I still wanted to give him something for his efforts. He grabbed the voucher, asking if it 'was something good', then started to get visibly upset, raising his voice and telling us that he isn't damn homeless and that vouchers won't buy him plane tickets. I apologized and told him again that I really didn't have any change on me and that I only wanted to show my appreciation, but he started yelling and said \"dont give me that that, you're just like the rest of them, I come out here and perform for you and you give me nothing but stupid vouchers, if you really wanted to support me you would give me the note.\" I talked to him trying to explain myself until he eventually looked really sad and dejected and told me to just go away.\n\nObviously if this had been a neurotypical person I would have been disgusted by this entitled behaviour but really I just feel awful for upsetting the busker because he is known for struggling with a lot of mental issues and is more like an innocent child than anything else. I feel really bad for causing him to meltdown like that. AITA?",

Both male.\n\nOver those three years I could count on one hand the amount of times we hung out with my friends, and he never once took up any interest in them or hung out with them when I wasn’t there. My parents thought we weren’t a match, and so did a few of my friends.\n\nYet...he made me feel bad for having a smaller social circle than him.  He felt uncomfortable that we hung out with his friends more than mine.\n\nWas this a red flag? What does that say about him? Is it okay if I think that it was a fucked up thing to do? Should I allow myself to be angry about this? I ask myself that because I have a really hard time being angry at people. I give them too much leeway and I often blame myself for any conflict.",

I understand that it would be inconvenient for Job 1 if I left immediately after getting hired, but I believe the pay to be too low (it's 1.5 dollars above minimum wage, and is about 3-4 dollars below other comparable positions I have seen). The commute isn't bad, but 1hr/day is worse than 20min/day commute by a long shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thought process is that I gotta look after myself above all else in the job world, but it goes against my sense of loyalty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I don't *need* the extra money of Job 2 I believe I should be paid more money for Job 1.

Job 2 would also give me time to study and I'd earn more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(If I jump ship from job 1 I don't plan to put it on my resume as I'm already unemployed so what's another 1 week gap).",

I end up feeling bad the entire trip and there’s always a huge argument between my husband and I.

      "description": "Relevant bg: My mom is full Chinese; expects a lot out of me. We live in the US. I graduated less than a year ago and had started a decent full time job at 21. I still live with her because I didn’t want to leave her alone. My father died three years ago today and she has maybe one friend here. I give her a grand a month to help with bills and whatever she needs. She does have a job and she saves some of the money I give her. She is the type of person that expects the kid to pay for everything. Because she gave birth to me, I am expected to pay her back. And being Chinese, you’re expected for filial piety. Now, I don’t mind helping her because I want to be a good daughter, but it’s been one of the factors of many many fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since I graduated college, I've been growing out of my Asian overprotected shell. Now that I’ve gotten everything important out of the way, I’ve been going out late, having fun. She thinks I should come home 12pm everyday and I’ve argued with her constantly about treating me like an adult. Then the money comes into play and she says you think a grand is a lot? You think you’re giving me so much? You’ve been disrespecting me, yelling back at me ever since you started giving me this money. No, I’ve been standing up for myself and trying to show her I’m an adult with my own life and choices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to last night. I was out late. She was outraged I didn’t come home early because of the occasion, that it's my dads 3 year. She never told me to and I was planning on doing things with her on the actual day. I come home late and she asks “am I a dead person to you?” Like no of course not. But she started to yell at me and say I didn’t care about her or my father and how I’ve been talking back at her for everything. Then she proceeds to say she wants to cancel our Hawaii trip for her bday, which I’m paying majority of. She was appalled/offended I asked her to help with some of the costs because she never asked her parents for a dime and gave them so much money. Well, her parents don’t talk to her unless they want money. Then we proceeded to argue about the grand again. I let my tongue slipped and said I wasn’t her retirement fund. She flipped out so hard, banging her hand on the door and screamed I raised you for all these years. She ended up driving out at 3am and muttered “I’m going to join your father” and I tried to follow her but she left already. After some panicking, I ended up finding her in my neighborhood and went back home when she did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for making my mom flip out because I said I wasn’t her retirement fund? I love her with all my heart and I want to support her always. But it just seems like nothing is ever enough because I disrespect her for wanting to be treated like an adult. ",

      "description": "We’ve been married for 3 years and together for 2 before that. We live in Chicago and there’s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I’ll give it to one of them. Or I’ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She’ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I’ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said “you said you give about $125 a month right babe?” I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says “I outran you this week!” I didn’t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe’s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I’m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn’t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. ",

      "description": "I know the title seems really inflammatory, but thats the best I can describe it. He was a Ranger back in Desert Storm, and from what he told me about his military service, it was highly decorated and very colorful in the 4 years he was in. However, one of the things I've observed him do ever since he became comfortable with talking to people about his experience is using it to sway people into his direction or to garner favor from it.\n\nOne example I can think of is when he was talking to an employee at an optometry shop (hes extremely charismatic, so it isnt necessarily awkward) about his combat experience and went into great detail on his final mission that got his buddy killed and him wounded. It netted him an employee discount instead of a military discount and he was extremely happy with the final result, bragging to me when we got back to the car \"isnt that great? Your dad knows how to seal the deal\" or something to that effect. He also used this during our custody battle when I was in middle school to garner favor from the judge, which, while it was beneficial for my growing up, I dont feel it was appropriate for the context of the situation (a custody battle) nor was that necessary to mention.\n\nHe's done this multiple times, and while I know he values and cares for the men he served with, it feels really crappy to me that he uses their deaths for monetary gain and personal favor. If it helps any, I'm a currently transitioning soldier who hasn't ever deployed (I was stationed at Suwon AB in Korea for a year, but that's not all that much) so I feel I have a LITTLE bit better of understanding on why he would do this, but I also do acknowledge that combat and PTSD isnt something I'm aware of, and in that this may be a thing I should just accept and move on from, for I will probably never know what it is like to go through what he went through.",

I'm an A student in every subject and work hard to get top marks and I plan to go to delft University to study computer science and my friend wants to study medicine. Anyways he asked me if I was aiming for a scholarship and I told him not really. I said if I got one it would be nice but if I didn't i would still be cool. I told him my parents would pay for my fees even If I don't get a scholarship so it didn't matter for me (my parents have been talking about University to me since I was 7, they are very serious about it)\n\nAnyways after I told him this he made this snarky face and said something under his breath then called me privileged and lazy and a \"rich boy\" and how I take things for granted and that he can't go to uni unless he gets a scholarship and I was an ass because my parents were going to pay for my University fee. I called him jealous and he told me to stay away from him",

      "description": "Been with my girlfriend for about two years. She’s never had a big butt but lately I swear it’s been flatter. She pretty much has no curves at all and I don’t find it very attractive. \nI kinda upset her one time when we were getting intimate because I made a comment about how her butt has changed and how it’s basically not even a pancake at this point–more of a crepe ass if anything. Obviously I worded it differently, I just said that her butt doesn’t look how it used to and that I’d like it to be bigger. She got upset and now doesn’t want to be intimate anymore. She won’t show me her ass anymore and is hesitant to take her clothes off in front of me. I guess it made her feel insecure but I feel like I have a right to bring up my concern about physical attraction. Obviously it’s important. \nI suggested that she do squats and she doesn’t want to do it. I told her that I would do it with her if it made her happier and she said no, I also said I could change something to make her happier and she said she didn’t want to change anything. I don’t think I can really get her to change my mind but I don’t find her butt attractive. It’s pretty flat and squishy but I’d prefer a larger and firmer ass. I don’t think it’s worth breaking up over but it is kind of annoying. Aita for having preferences because she makes me feel like one because of how upset she gets over it. ",

      "description": "(throwaway because my wife browses reddit and she’ll know this about her straight away, sorry for any formatting errors, I’m on mobile, TLDR at the end, etc)\n\nFirst of all, I know I’m not perfect, but please hear me out. I don’t know where to start so I’ll just get the elephant in the room out of the way:\n\nI’ve (29/M) been cheating on my wife (31/F) for a little over a year now, with another woman (20/F) that I think I love. \n\nMy wife and I met in college (UK - I think that’s high school in America?) and dated for about two years before I proposed. Things were smooth for almost a year, before my wife seemed to change. She was constantly rude, nagging at me for anything, making belittling comments. I began to spend more time at work to avoid her constant negativity. She was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. Still, I was sure we’d work through it, so I stayed with her. I believed I still loved her. \n\nTwo years after her diagnosis, my dad died in a car crash. While I was distraught, I couldn’t help but notice that my wife seemed almost glad. She’d never mentioned an issue with my parents, but any time I seemed sad about it, she’s say something like, “It’s for the best,” or “You should get over it soon.” \n\nMy brother took his loss harder than I did and turned to alcohol. As a favour, I took him in when his landlord turned him out. I work a lot, but my wife owns her own business and often works from home. I (wrongly) assumed that I could leave the two of them alone together, but while I was away, they would have sex. I found this out from a neighbour, who walked in on them when asking for a parcel. I also later found out he had been stealing from us as well. \n\nAs any sane person would, I kicked him out of my home. I tried to file for a divorce, but my wife went through an awful depressive episode, lasting almost a month. I dropped the ideas about a divorce. \n\nFor a while, things seemed to go back to how they were when I was 20. Things were going great at work and I was climbing the ranks. We’d just moved into a new house closer to my work. My wife had begun branching out and now owned two or three shops in the city. She was on a new medication that made her a much more pleasant person. Our sex life was great. \n\nAnd then we found out she was having a baby. I was ecstatic - I love kids. My wife and I had always wanted a kid, but every time we’d tried it hadn’t worked. Soon enough, our son was born. \n\nOver the course of his first couple of months, I began to have doubts that he was really my son. I put this off as first kid worries or whatever and continued with my life. Until one evening, my wife sat me down and told me the kid was my brothers. Her reasons were that ‘she knew I’d always wanted a kid’ and that ‘our DNA was too close for it to make a difference’. Never mind the fact that meant she was sleeping with my brother again. \n\nAgain, I distanced myself. I tried to file for a divorce again, but my wife returned to her depressive state, so once again, I dropped it. One night after an argument, I left the house with no intention of going anywhere and ended up in a bar. I got talking to a girl and we had a one night stand. \n\nI couldn’t help but think of my wife the whole time, and yet a week later I slept with her again. She told me things about herself - she was living with her cousin, she worked two jobs to put herself through uni, she felt like she was alone in the world. Our one night stand became a whole relationship and I realised that I was cheating on my wife. \n\nIt became a lot easier when I made her my secretary. I don’t want to explain many details about our relationship. She was by no means at fault. I didn’t tell her I had a wife until a month or so before I gave her the job. I didn’t tell her about my son until our first argument. \n\nI was spending a lot more time at work, and my wife began getting suspicious. She stopped taking her meds, telling me they ‘clouded her thoughts’ and refused to speak with her psychiatrist. Still, she doesn’t know about the other woman. \n\nReally, I know I am at fault for a lot of this, and a tragic backstory or whatever doesn’t let me off. But I really do think I’m in love with the woman I’m cheating with and I don’t know what to do.\n\nTLDR: my wife, who suffers from multiple mental illnesses, has put me through numerous hardships and now I’m cheating on her. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "About an hour ago I received the below text from my mom:\n\n“I need a big favor. There is a chance that me and [sister’s name] could go down to [coworkers] house in orlando for 5 days. Could you stay at the house with Cookie?  It would be in late march or april. Not around Easter. I dont have anyone else to watch her. Otherwise we cant go now or on any small vacation.”\n\nI was shocked and immediately hurt and upset because I haven’t been on a family vacation in two years, or any vacation. I had also just talked with my mom a couple weeks ago about how disappointed I was that my boyfriend has no PTO time to go on a vacation with me this year (no fault of his own, he doesn’t get a lot, and has to help his parents move this year). \n\nso, my mom already knew that I have an excess of PTO that I can use, and nobody to use it with. \n\nI have always felt like my mom favors my sister more than me, because she’s the youngest, she’s 21 and I’m 24. My sister also lives with her at the moment because she dropped out of college and doesn’t work. My sister claims she has an anxiety disorder that prevents her from going to school or working, but has still not been diagnosed after about 2 years of this, IMO she’s a hypochondriac, but that’s not the issue here. \n\nThe dog, Cookie, is also my sisters dog.\n\nMy mom has taken vacations with my sister before and excluded me for other reasons, “it was your sisters birthday” , “she has school break, and you work full time “ etc..  my mom always says she wants to do a vacation with the three of us, but hasn’t since I was in high school. \n\nMy sister has no income and my mother buys her new clothes, electronics, and gave her money for a new car after she crashed her old one ( also paid for by my mom) this year. \n\nI could go on, but the point is my sister gets a lot from my mom, whereas I have been financially independent from my mom since the age of 17 when I went off to college. I don’t get her health insurance, I pay for my own phone, rent, utilities, clothes.. you name it. \n\nI have a good relationship with my mom despite all of this, we see each other often, and talk in the phone every day. I guess that’s why I’m so hurt. I was really blindsided by being excluded from this.\n\nFinally, it would be very inconvenient for me to stay at my mom’s house because it would add another half hour each way onto my commute to work, which is already a half hour. So a full hour of extra drive time, extra gas, every day. \n\nI also do not have a bed or bedroom at the house anymore, and she has not offered to pay me. \n\nI know this has been super long, so if you got here, thanks for reading!\n\n**TL;DR : my mom &amp; sister are taking vacation without me and expect me to dog sit at their home for 5 days without payment while they go**",

      "title": "AITA For Ghosting My Best Friend?",
      "description": "**This is my first reddit post ever, let me know if I messed something up!** \n\nBackstory: I met my high school best friend (Ash) about halfway through our sophomore year. We grew close pretty quickly with my family almost immediately adopting her as my long lost sister. (Her family never really liked me, I'll elaborate if anyone feels they need the details). Aside from myself, Ash had another best friend she'd known for about a year longer (Em). Em is white and from a strictly religious and conservative family (again, I'll expand if needed), Ash and I are both black. Despite her family's views, Em always seemed to be a liberal and open-minded person - the three of us would often talk about politics or current events and even though we didn't always fully agree, there was never any serious conflict. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward two years, about a month after Ash and I's graduation. A friend of Em's is throwing a house party that we've all been invited to. The plan is for me to drive the three of us there and then back to my place afterwards since I didn't drink at the time and my parents wouldn't be home. However, the night of the party comes and, for some reason I don't remember Ash tells me that she can't go. At this point I've known Em for a little over two years and we've hung out alone for maybe ten hours of that total. In those ten hours or any of the countless others we'd spent with Ash, I'd come to consider her a good friend - we weren't as close to each other as we were to Ash but we had plenty in common and got along great. For that reason I decided it wouldn't be a big deal for us to just go to the party ourselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get to the party and it turns out to be pretty small, more of a get together really. There's about six of us in this kid's backyard with me being the only black person. I become uncomfortable pretty quickly (again, details), but decide to give the group a shot as none of them had ever shown themselves to be anything but nice. Then they started drinking. Things started off relatively tamely with a few guys insisting I play them some rap music and telling me all the reasons they love \"ebony women\". This goes on for maybe an hour or so, but I continue to try and stick it out as Em is now pretty drunk and I'm both her ride and alibi. The situation devolves rapidly though after someone says \\*pause for Dramatic Effect\\* the N Word. I'm not completely sure why, I'm guessing it was in whatever song we were listening to. The point is, I asked them not to and explained that it made me extremely uncomfortable. Now everyone in attendance, Em included, has gravitated over to take turns asking me questions *\"Why not?\" \"Why do you care?\" \"Why does it matter, it's just a word?\"* With that last one, I guess to demonstrate, they all start to say the n word repeatedly. It then turns into the... other n word (-er) as they laugh and I stand there absolutely horrified before grabbing my stuff and leaving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward one more time to a few months ago, I'm now a junior in college and haven't talked to Em since that summer or Ash since my freshman year. Frank Ocean had just made his instagram public, and being the fan that I am I decided to make one of my own just to follow him. Shortly after doing this I start to get suggestions on people to follow, many of whom are people I graduated with. After stalking a few pages, I come across a joint page for Ash and Em to promote their new youtube channel. Of course I check it out and the first thing I see is a series on friends they don't talk to anymore. I'll mention now that I've felt guilty about the way I ended my friendship with Ash for some time. After the incident at the party, I tried to explain to her that Em was very much not the person she seemed to be but Ash considered her family and accused me of being jealous. While the accusation was hurtful, I never actually came right out and told her exactly what happened. Only that she'd said... *that* word and I'd left her to find her own ride home because of it. Despite her not knowing the full story, Ash accusing me of lying over something so petty and childish was about my limit. I mentally washed my hands of the situation and let the relationship go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the youtube channel: there are several videos of them telling the stories of how they were ghosted or dumped by various friends. Others were maybe 10-15 minutes long. They talked about me for a solid 45 minutes, in my own video as well as in tangents in videos meant to be about someone else. In those 45 minutes they discuss how overly sensitive I was, how difficult/annoying it could be to put up with me, how shitty of a friend I was in general, and of course how jealous I'd always been of *their* friendship. Being the person I am, I of course sat through all of it and got quite a bit emotional at the thought that someone I'd considered my family had always thought of me as a back up friend with a grating personality. I'm not too sure anymore whether I was completely wrong for walking away from the situation the way I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I ghosted my friend after she accused me of lying about her other friend's racism as a way of getting her to myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

      "description": "A while back, I worked on a project with a difficult coworker. This person works in a support role for people who do my job, sort of like how a lab technician conducts tests for healthcare providers. I generally don't have issues with him b/c I'm careful to plan for extra time, be polite &amp; patient. When people ask him to do an assignment he's the type to tell them not to tell him what to do &amp; how he has more experience working than them, so it takes some time. It's only somewhat true because he doesn't really have the education/background to lead those types of projects, but he tends to tell people how to do them anyways. Still, I know from around the office he's prone to conflict and sometimes resorts to the silent treatment, so I keep this in mind when I have to work with him. \n\nThe day of this incident, I spoke with this coworker about an unrelated topic and as I was leaving, he brought up a theory on a technical aspect of one of my projects. When he asked if his explanation was possible I said \"Yeah, maybe. We'll see if it's likely. Thanks\" and went to leave. \n\nHe stopped me, asked a bit about the other work involved and repeated his question. I explained briefly because I had some urgent work going on as well. He does this again, asking about checking his theory, so I finally am firmer, saying \"Maybe\" then explaining I had some priorities to follow on the issue and had to get going. \n\nHere's where it got weird- he suddenly got pissy and practically spat \"You're missing the discussion here!\", which I found odd because, frankly, I'd been handling him and his theory with kiddie gloves. I was trying to be appreciative of him offering his insight, but truthfully it was a basic thing and wasn't really central to what we were researching. I mustered up my patience and a decently calm tone (though this is still the part where I wonder if I was too dismissive) and said \"No, I don't see how. I've listened to you explain this theory and said maybe it's worth looking into 3 times now. I can't imagine what else you'd want me to say.\" I'd even taken the time to explain how and when it could be checked, so this seemed weird to me. \n\nAfter that, he was still clearly upset, saying \"You know, you're not the easiest person to talk to; I'm not either, but I've seen more XXXX than you ever will... There's no reason to be upset\" Now, this doesn't bother me because it was a weird flex, like a lab tech bragging about seeing the most blood samples, and I don't really have trouble with friends or coworkers. BUT I didn't like him telling me not to be upset while I was trying to consider his feelings and get back to work. Since he was still prattling on I just excused myself and walked away. \n\nI got the silent treatment for a few weeks. Was I incredulous about his outburst and annoyed at having to pat him on the back to get back to work without being lectured? Sure. Still, was I the asshole for being too quick to say it's possible, thanks and move on?",

      "description": "*Am I the asshole for arguing about my husband's immunization form and making him call the clinic and schedule the shots?*\n\nSo my husband is doing clinicals for a medical field and his college gave him an immunization form to complete before he starts working at a large hospital. His records are at multiple clinics and one of the doctors wouldn't give him the Tuberculosis (Tb) and Tetanus (Td) shots because they said he didn't need the Tetanus within two years like the form says and it is not their policy to give the Tuberculosis test to patients every year like the form requires. The doctor signed the form and told him he is good to go and to fill in dates for the immunizations he needs. The doctor gave him proof of some of the vaccines to take home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to help fill in the form so the dates are at least not in my husband's handwriting. I looked at the paperwork the doctor sent him with, and the Tb and Td shots were not current. When I asked my husband about it he said he trusts the doctor and was going to fill in a current date because she said he was good and he can't find any other expert justification for having the Tb or Td on the required timelines. He believes she is the expert in the immunizations and I should trust the doctor's judgement. He did finally schedule the Tb test because that one is more commonly required, however, he is mad at me for making him get the Td shot too. He believes I like to challenge authority and need to trust the doctor's opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe the school's requirements are there for a reason and it is unethical to put in falsified dates on the form even if the doctor is the one who put their name on the signature line. If he has a problem with the Tb or Td requirement on the form he should take it up with the school rather than make up dates. He is making me feel like a tyrant for not trusting expert opinions so I am not sure if I am the asshole or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So about two months ago I began talking with my psychiatrist over the possibility of having an emotional support animal because I am a trauma victim and I have nightmares every night because of it. He stays in the apartment with my roommate and I. Once we began the process of getting the papers and having them processed by my landlord, I told her about it. She’s never had a cat before so she was iffy, but she said she didn’t mind if I got one. \n\nI took her with me when I went to get\nmy cat to make sure she liked it. She seemed okay with everything so I had no idea anything was going to be weird. That night, she made me sign a contract saying that all responsibilities regarding the cat would go to me. I found it unnecessary because I mean, it’s my cat, I had no intentions of making her do anything regarding his care and I made that very clear before I even got him. She won’t let me store the cat food on the bottom shelf of our storage rack in the kitchen because she’s convinced everything in the kitchen will taste like cat food. \n\nA few days ago she decides she doesn’t want him to come out of my room. So he is confined to my bedroom, bathroom and closet which isn’t very big. Whatever, I just keep my door shut. I’m not happy about it but my roommate and I used to be very close so I didn’t want to get on her bad side. \n\nYesterday, she decides the entire apartment smells bad because of my cat which is “exactly what she was afraid of.” She made me go out and buy a $5 wall plug in and a sprayable air freshener for the living room. She opened all the windows to “get rid of the smell.” I’ve had cats my whole life so I know I’m mostly used to the smell, but if it truly smelled bad I would know and I would take care of it. \n\nI’ve been trying to do what she wants so I don’t piss her off or anything, but I feel like this is getting ridiculous. I’m only mad because she had a month and a half to speak up and say she didn’t want this to happen, and now after I get the cat she decides she doesn’t want me to have it. I have legal documents stating that I can have this cat, so I’m not getting rid of it now. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm visiting the city my cousin lives in, and I invite her to dinner. I hadn’t seen her in a few years and she recently graduated from college. She was working in the hospitality industry so I ask her for a restaurant suggestion and she chooses an upscale place with a nice wine list. I make the reservation using the Open Table app.\n\nMy cousin is a pretty, blonde and polite young woman; basically the opposite of me. Our server turns up the charm to the point where it's becoming obnoxious. He’s not bad looking, but it was obvious that he was flirting. I’m about 15 years older and will be handling the bill, but I was immediately invisible as soon as she sat down.\n\nMy cousin and I order our meals and start to catch up. He interrupts us to ask what she does and she tells him she’s in the wine industry. He starts asking lots of questions because he’s interested in \"getting into that line of work\" (or so he says). Then, to my jaw-dropping surprise, he flat-out asks her how much she makes! Then he asks for her number in case he has any questions about \"getting his foot in the door\". I'm appalled but I lay low because this is my cousin's turf.\n\nHe returns to fill our waters (again) and instead of walking over to the other side of the table to refill her water, he LEANS over her, REALLY getting into her personal space. We wait for a few seconds until he finishes hovering over her to refill her water. It’s awkward.\n\nOur food arrives, and it’s all wrong. There was no apology from the server, almost like he didn’t want to admit his error, and we end up just eating what we were given. The bill comes and there’s no acknowledgment of the mixup. I pay the bill and leave a measly tip.\n\nThe next day I wrote a gentle review on Open Table. I merely outlined the events that had transpired (surely they spoke for themselves) and suggested that the server may need additional training. A few days later I get an ENRAGED text from my aunt pleading with me to remove the review. She said it was embarrassing to my cousin, who had connections with the restaurant (even though I didn't use any names). I apologized profusely. I didn’t want to make things more difficult for my cousin, I just wanted to stand up for her and thought the restaurant should know about their creepy server. In a text to my aunt, I said something like “You would have spoken up too if you saw the way this man treated your daughter.” It made me sad that society has taught my aunt and cousin to sacrifice their own dignity and safety for social acceptance.\n\nTL;DR Went to a fancy dinner with my young and pretty cousin and our server was a creep towards her. He asked how much she makes and for her phone number. Brought us the wrong food and gave us terrible service. I left a negative review online and my aunt asked me to remove it bc she said it reflected badly on my cousin who is in the industry and has connections with the restaurant.",

      "description": "I (24F) have known this guy (22M) since I was in first grade. We grew up next door to each other and I considered him my brother. Even after moving away and going to colleges out of state we always kept in touch and saw each other to hang out over breaks. He was most definitely my best friend and we always joked that he was going to be my man of honor at my wedding.\n\nCut to 2 years ago when he starts dating this girl. She is absolutely perfect for him and is everything I would want for him and more. But slowly as their relationship got more serious he stops responding to my texts. He is always busy and can never hang out anymore. I try to be understanding that I could be intimidating to a new girlfriend since I’ve known him for so long. So every time I invite him out I always make it clear that she can come and hang out as well. Unfortunately we kinda grew apart but I still considered him a very close friend, so when he announced he was engaged after dating her for a year I was absolutely thrilled for him.\n\nFast forward to the past 6 months. I also got engaged (I invited him to my wedding), my father got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and my father passed away. Not once did he text or call to say congratulations, show concern about my father, or even show his condolences. I know he knew about all of these events because my father was still living in the house I grew up in and he still lived next door. To me these are not the actions of a friend. People I had not talked to in 10 years were messaging me asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Just shows how much a girl can change someone.\n\nHe got married yesterday and I did not go. Am I the asshole? Am I being too petty about this?\n",

I got home and just wanted to relax (9pm on Friday) and couldn't even hear my TV over his band. I sent him a message asking him to turn it down, which he read but ignored. After about 30 more minutes, I went downstairs and knocked on the door and asked him to quiet down. He seemed put off, and I told him I wasn't trying to be a bitch but I just wanted to hear my TV. He then finally stopped playing. \n\nI feel like I was justified in the moment  but of course now I'm worried I've antagonized my neighbor which is never a good idea. What's the reasonable expectation to hearing your neighbors in an apartment? AITA for expecting my neighbor to keep his music at a reasonable volume?",

So I'm trying to present as objectively as possible.\nFirst backstory, every week myself and 4 friends try to get together for board gaming with a legacy game, a game that changes as you play it you are expected to play with the same people as every time but it has finite number of plays, so if one person can't make it we postpone for that week . We had established a week ago that we were going to play today. Upon following up earlier in the week all was still good. Today one of the players lets me know he can't make because instead he is going to a movie with a family member. \nNow this movie is not old and just came out. While he doesn't often get the chance to hang  out recreationally with his family member he still sees him everyother day sometimes even daily. \nAm i the asshole for being pissed at him for canceling last minute for a movie he could have gone to at another non spoken for time?",

      "description": "Firstly, I am quite a petty person, so I want to be sure I'm not over-reacting for what I'm paying for.\n\n----\n\nI live in a large-ish apartment building, easily there are 12+ units on my building alone.  There are parking spots in front of the building and across the lot by some trees as well.\n\nI've lived here now for roughly 3 months and have already towed one car who repeatedly parked in my spot... twice within a 4 day time-span.  One of which was right before a sleet/snow storm. And what really pissed me off was that the individual went out sometime in the night (after 6pm when i got home and they were parked there but before 9am when I left for work and were still parked there) and lifted their windshield wipers so they didn't get frozen down from the sleet/snow storm.\n\nMy girlfriend who lives with me overheard people talking about it, so I guess word spread that I tow peoples cars from my reserved spot.\n\nBefore I go into more venting on the matter...\n\n\n----\n\n**RESERVING A SPOT IS ONLY $10 ADDED TO YOUR RENT**\n====\n\n----\n\nThis new Tahoe, just started seeing it about 3 days ago and has local state plates, is parked in my spot which my Girlfriend shoveled out from the 7 inches of snow we got last Saturday.   It's been pretty cold and We are not expecting more snow till Saturday again, But it seems my spot was one of the only ones shoveled out, because me and maybe 1 or 2 others on a stretch of 20+ parking spots have paid for reservations.\n\n----\n\nThe sign is unobstructed by snow, though one day it was covered and a Jeep parked in it not knowing it was reserved, so I let it go and just uncovered it from the snow that was on it.   Should I give them a written warning/notice taped to their car, I have already alerted the office, to which they'll alert the individual if the car is registered to the apartment via lease/paperwork\n\nI'll end saying I know none of my neighbors and do not wish to ever meet them.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR;** Cars keep parking in my paid reserved spot, other spots are open, often directly next to mine for a few cars, but mine is the only one shoveled *remotely* out to make parking/entering and exiting easier.  AITA for having them towed or should I just give them a one time pass as I did the other car a few weeks back?\n\n[Picture of reserved sign](https://i.imgur.com/5m7qbSE.jpg) in front of car that was cleared since Sunday after Saturday's last snowstorm.  And in case it gets asked, Yes, I have clear notice from the leasing office, though no stickers or placards, that the spot is reserved for me.",

      "description": "So my wife (31f) and I (33m) have been together for about 4.5 years and married since October.  The friend I'm mentioning will be called \"Mary\" (31f).  My wife has had a group of friends since we met that are a mix of childhood friends, college friends, and friends of friends.  There are maybe six of them and they get together for monthly book clubs and stuff like that.  Since meeting me, however, she's integrated with my friends and hangs out with them on a regular basis without me.  Conversely, I never hang out with her friends unless I really have to.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis context is important because I generally dislike her friends because they are objectively catty, judgmental, and extremely gossipy.  To keep this post somewhat short, I'll just give a couple of examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  When planning our wedding, my wife got into a fight with Mary because we had strongly considered Memorial Day weekend because it was one of only two available weekends for our chosen venue.  Mary called her crying saying that she would be 7 months pregnant at that time and couldn't understand how we could do that to her.\n2. When my wife chose to have her bachelorette party out of town in Texas, Mary called her to tell her that she would \"try\" to make it, but if she couldn't go out of state, Mary wanted to throw her a separate party in our home town.  My wife specifically said she didn't want to do that, but ended up caving and having two parties.  In contrast, none of the book club girls went to Texas - three of the friends she met through went with her to Texas.\n3. When Mary got pregnant with her first kid, my wife and her were constantly fighting about how Mary kept breaking promises and changed their routines because of \"baby on the way\".  This conflict never really resolved itself, but when I asked Mary about it, she said \"well you will understand when you have kids\" despite the fact that she  knows that we don't want kids.\n4. The book club girls all live in the suburbs.  We live in the city in a really nice, fun neighborhood.  They came over for book club one night a few months ago and thought I couldn't hear them.  While in the other room, I heard them talk about how they could never live in \"the ghetto\" like us in such a small house.  For the record, we just remodeled out entire house this past year and will have it paid off in 4 years.\n5. We went out to a football game one night and on the way back, decided to stop at one of my favorite bars from grad school  Mary tells us that she wants to leave before we even order a beer because the neighborhood is \"pretty diverse\".  Take that to mean what you think.\n\nAnd that basically brings us up to the event in question.  There are a lot of other similar incidents like what I described above that are either judgmental or even bordering on racism in some cases, but about two weeks ago one of the girls broke up with her long-time boyfriend.  At their monthly book club meeting, this girl was silent on the reasoning and just didn't want to talk about it.  My wife comes home from book club a little tipsy and starts talking about how she found out the real reason they broke up:  the girl cheated on the guy and couldn't stand the shame.  I basically told her that that story sounds like gossip and that unless you heard it from the source, just be a supportive friend and try to help her friend mourn the loss of the relationship.\n\nWell this past week, we found out that the break up was for a completely unrelated reason and my wife admitted that the cheating story originated with Mary.  Yesterday at my wife's birthday party after everyone else left, I straight up told Mary that being loyal to the absent is one of the best ways to support your friends, that I heard about the cheating allegation and that her and my wife should show more empathy for a friend going through a break up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife comes back today and tells me that apparently I really hurt Mary's feelings and that I was way too blunt with her.  She also said that everything she told me about the cheating allegation was told to me in confidence and that I shouldn't have mentioned it since it wasn't my place.  I know I was blunt, but I think that spreading lies and judging people is something that shouldn't be tolerated at all.  In this case, it was so abundantly clear that the allegations were made up and it should be an easy point for her to introspectively say \"Yeah, that was kind of a dick move on my part.  Maybe I shouldn't have said that stuff\".  Now my wife wants me to apologize and Mary isn't answering my calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?  I frankly wouldn't care if I never saw any of these friends again, but my wife likes them and I don't want to make her sad.",

      "description": "Throwaway just in case.\n\nSo I’m a year 1 university student living in a dorm right now (it’s not really a dorm, but close enough, so I’ll leave out the details to be extra safe). It’s quite well known in our residential block that this other guy (we’ll call him M) has had a thing for this girl (we’ll call her C) for quite some time, since last year. I personally didn’t have any feelings for her at that point, so I just left it at that. \n\nOver the past few months though, I’ve started to develop a crush on her as well. However, since I knew about M’s feelings, I didn’t do anything about it right away. Last month, a group of about 10 of us went out to a bar for some drinks. M was there, the girl was not. We didn’t get drunk, it was just a casual drinking session to wind down on a Friday night. While we were talking, the topic of crushes came up, and M asked me if I still had feelings for this other girl that I initially had a crush on, to which I said no. So to kind of get back at him, I asked him if he still had feelings for C. He responded by joking that he is currently not in the financial situation to be in a relationship right now. I probed a little further by asking if he still liked her or not, to which he said ‘Less than before.’ \n\nSo, fast forward to yesterday, when I finally mustered up the courage to confess to C after weeks of pussying out (this is my first time actually confessing to someone hahaha). She seemed fairly taken aback, saying that she did not see this coming at all. We talked for a little bit about it, she said that she would need time to process it, and that we’ll come back to this topic after finals (Better than I expected to hear honestly, cause I thought I would just get straight up rejected). Then, the topic of M came up. C said, ‘You know that I know about the situation with M right?’ I was a little surprised by this as well. C continued, ‘You know how we’re in a group project together and stuff, and he’s been messaging me almost everyday, just talking about random stuff. He hasn’t confessed to me or anything yet though, and I don’t think anything’s gonna happen.’ \n\nI did know about them being in a group project together, but obviously I did not know about the almost daily messages. To me, it sort of indicated that M was trying to keep things alive with C. I’d seen them talk to each other before, but it was mostly about their group project. I’ve been thinking about it ever since, and I’m not sure if what I did was right or wrong. So, AITA here?",

      "description": "Hello Everyone. I like to play large board games. Board games that take 4+ hours to play and involve sitting down with 5+ players for an afternoon of shenanigans and strategy (Risk, Diplomacy, Twilight Imperium.) At the beginning of August I decided I wanted to host another one of these big board game days. I created a Facebook event and invited all the usual suspects. I set the date of the event for a Saturday at the beginning of September. This gave everyone a month to plan their game day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got four responses. Players A and B said that they were for sure coming. Player C said it depended on their work schedule. Player D said absolutely...as long as we start at 6 PM since that's when they would be able to get to my house after work. This is a bit rough since the game we were going to play was Twilight Imperium. A game of Galactic diplomacy and war that can take 6+ hours to play. We usually start our games at noon. However, everyone agreed that 6PM would be OK, if that player would be able to make it. Player C messaged me a week before game day stating that they would not be able to attend due to the aforementioned work schedule. \"That's fine.\" I said, knowing that this was a possibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJump forward to the game day. 5pm rolls around and players A and B show up to help setup the game and get a refresher on the rules. We are all sitting around chit-chatting waiting for Player D to show up. 6PM rolls around and I see that Player D is on Facebook. I send them a message asking for an ETA. After about ten minutes I don't get a response, so I give him a call. It rings and rings and goes to voicemail. I leave him a message. It is now 6:45 and there is no sign of him. I had setup the board game expected to play with 4 people (These games can take a LONG time to setup.) I am now scrambling to rearrange the game so that we can effectively play with 3 people. We aren't able to start playing until about 7:30. I check Facebook one more time. Not only have I not received a phone call or a reply to my facebook messenger, but Player D is now posting videos and memes to their account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis incredibly pisses me off. Not only does player D just blow off 3 of his friends with no word about why they aren't showing up, but they go so far as to dick around on their facebook account and ignore my messages. I refuse to reach out to this person ever again. I haven't spoken to them in over 2 months and I have absolutely no intention of ever contacting this person again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for still being angry about this and still holding a grudge? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Setup a game night of Twilight Imperium for 4 players. A game that takes an entire day to play. 3 players arrange their schedules to line up with the 4th player... who ends up ghosting with absolutely no word about why they didn't show up, leaving me to scramble to plan B.  I haven't spoken to this person in 2 months because I'm still pissed off. ",

On Friday we were picking up and I ask him if he can do the cover page for him. He says he got it but when we got to school Monday he says that didn’t finish it and he would finish it tonight. I get a little mad at him but I just brush it aside until the next day he comes into class and says that he STILL has not finished it. The project is due tomorrow and I’m freaking out because we don’t have a cover page. Friend says he got this under control and will have it finished tonight, he also asks if he can finish the last two parts of the presentation so we will have equally done parts of the presentation ( I’m at 7 and he is at 5). When I got home I got an email from him with the finish cover page. I don’t question about the other stuff but around 5 I got bored of waiting for him to finish so I do it myself. The next day he is furious because he had a orthodontist appointment and couldn’t get to the other two parts until 6. I told him that it’s not my fault that he waited so long to do his cover page. He then gets really mad because he thinks he will get a bad grade while I will get a good one.  AITA for not trusting my friend to finish his work and just do it instead.",

      "description": "Last night was one of my closest friend’s 21st birthday. He invited me to his party on New Years Eve and I was excited to come. I really love spending time with him and his girlfriend. He said the party would probably start at around 10, so I figured I could go to another party beforehand. On the way to the first party my car breaks down and my friends and I end up there at around 9:30 so we decide to stay a little later. \n\nAt 11:15 we realize that if we left right then we would get to my friend’s 21st birthday party at around 12:15 because it’s about 45 minutes away from the second party and people asked me to drop them home on the way. I told a few friends we were leaving and they were all trying to convince me to stay. ImWe weren’t sure we should leave because we didn’t really want to spend New Years in a car. I text my friend and ask if it’s ok if we come to his house after midnight. I was worried about this because NYE is his actual birthday and if we went later than 12 we would be missing his birthday. But he said it was ok and not to worry.  \n\nAt 12:03 he texted and said that him and his girlfriend were getting tired and that they were going to go to bed, so we shouldn’t come over. I apologized and he said it was ok and that it was not a big deal. Leading up to the party he stressed multiple times that it was a low key event and that we could come when we want etc.\n\nHowever now he isn’t replying to my texts and all of my friends that did go to his party aren’t replying to my texts either. I realize that in hindsight I could have corralled my drunk friends earlier and we could have gotten there in time. I feel terrible. On one hand his party did only start at 10 and was two hours and I figured it would go later. On the other, it was his twenty first and he is one of my best friends and I only get to see him every few months. Am I the Asshole? I would be pissed at me if I was him. He is going back to college this weekend and so I feel like I wasted my chances to see him. \n\nTL;DR one of my closest friends had a NYE 21st birthday party that started at 10 and my friends couldn’t get there until past midnight. When midnight came he told me the party was over. Now he’s not replying to any messages. AITA? ",

      "description": "Obligatory first time poster here\n\nI live in a college dorm. It’s a double, which means me and a roommate share a bedroom. We have to share quite a few things, and it’s never an issue. \n\nI have a nice car (subjective opinion, of course). BMW 3 series, tinted windows, the whole getup. I don’t use it much other than to run to the store or drive home and see my family. Although it’s nice, I worked hard to get it, paid in cash all on my own, and pay insurance and gas all by myself. \n\nHere’s to the point:\n\nAs everyone knows, gas prices in the Midwest US are subject to change at any moment. In the beginning of the year my roommate used to piggyback and ride with me to Walmart, Best Buy and wherever. It was maybe 2 or 3 rides before gas started hiking. Close to $3 a gallon which is a lot for a millennial driving a gas guzzling bmw. \n\nMy roommate needed to go to Walmart to pick up some things for himself, but I had no need to go. I told him for a small fee I’d gladly take him there (it’s about 2.5 - 3 miles from campus) and I said I’d charge him just a couple bucks to make up for the gas. At this point he got upset and told me he’d be “wasting his money” and that “the bus is free”. I explained I have bills to pay and he said he’d give me pocket change for the small distance I’d be driving. He then had a cold demeanor towards me and was sarcastic towards me the rest of the day. \n\nI didn’t feel like I did anything wrong, I pay a phone bill, car insurance, and gas money each month and he has no bills to pay as his parents are paying for his college.

      "description": "OK so I work at a retail chain (have for almost 3 years) and my department has a group of people there’s probably like six or seven of us at a different time. I have a coworker I’ll call him Ed. I’m a minor and Ed is say.... between 23-25 (this comes into play later) I work my ass off. I always have. I work 40 hours a week on the books and then i babysit on the sides. I pay for my own car payments, insurance, gas, and pretty much everything else I have. Ed graduated college and still lives at home with his parents while they pay for everything. He always talks about these crazy drug binges he goes on and how he never has any money but can afford to go to a different rave every weekend. He totaled his BMW in a DUI accident that he feels no remorse for as he “wasn’t drunk and fell asleep behind the wheel” with a BAC of .1. Now he drives his dads car. I know these may be pointless details but he brings them up ALL. THE. TIME. Anyways, Ed is always on his phone at work, and he literally never does any work. Basically, i’m salty because I always work the shift after him and I have to pick up all his slack. After about six months of dealing with this, I started to call him out on it. Well he takes it personally and starts freaking out because i’m a “child” who doesn’t understand how it is to be an adult and I can’t talk to my superiors like that. To be clear, he’s not my supervisor or anything. He’s been working there longer but I technically have a higher position than him. So I defended myself and went on this whole tirade because i’m sick and tired of his crap. I work way too much and hard to deal with it. My boss said he’s gonna sit down with the both of us but honestly even though it was in the heat of the moment, everyone feels that way about Ed.  \n\nI understand I might be taking it personally because I don’t have the luxury of being babied by my parents and I don’t feel like I can ignore customers because i’m talking to my gf through my airpods. \n\nTLDR: Shitty coworker doesn’t do shit so I pick up his slack. He says i’m in the wrong for being upset. After months of this I blow up on him and freak out. ",

      "description": "Apologies; this is going to be long. Also, this is a throwaway because most of the people on this quote are on Reddit. I will try to be as objective as possible and not exonerate or vilify either me or the other guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth me and the guy are in first year university right now. Most of the stuff in this post occurred when we were in grade 12 (in the same school). Letters are hard to keep track of, so let's call him \"That Guy\" (DnD players, you will see why if you read on). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI first met That Guy when we were both in grade eleven, and although he never fully integrated into my friend group, I was pretty friendly with him and we often talked about random stuff like history (we were both interested) and games. I noticed that he was not the best at some aspects of communication; he would do things like interrupt people (I also had that habit but I fixed it after realizing), lying about trivial things, needlessly bragging, pretending not to hear people if he didn't want to hear what they had to say, and being slightly disrespectful to teachers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome examples: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe always lied about his grades; one time I literally saw that he got around 50% for a math test (by accident, since he left it on a table) while he bragged about a 96% to everyone. I later heard him complaining to the teacher about it. He boasted that he had many weapons at home (this might not be a lie, but I doubt he does because some of his friends went over to his house and didn't see any) and that his house's fence was \"impenetrable\" after sending me a picture of a fence that was from Google Images. He also pretended to know about things that he didn't, and one time, when I was clearly correct in an argument, he put on his headphones and pretended not to hear me. I tested him by asking what music he was listening to, and lo and behold, he could hear me and answered. He also didn't pay attention in class and refused to apologize to teachers when they called him out for it, even when they got legitimately angry. One time our English teacher (whom I liked, since English was my favourite subject) got pretty upset with him and his response was to discuss how English should be removed from the curriculum at lunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying I'm perfect either. Often, I continued to provoke him when I knew it would escalate a debate further, and sometimes I purposely asked him questions that I knew about but he didn't just to see his reaction. Still, we were on relatively good terms with each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problems began after two separate incidents. One was when he ruined a long-running DnD campaign that included me and one of my close friends by adding overpowered characters that completely derailed the plot and attempting to control other people's characters (he tried to kill most of the other PCs then got angry when his was put into fatal situations). Both my friend and I were quite angry about that. Remember that friend; let's call him Cool Guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second was quite ridiculous when I look back on it. I helped him for a physics project even though I was not part of his group, and he began to ask me for help on his other assignments as well. I was fine with this until it got to his personal profile for university application. It was horribly written, was based on the standards from the wrong year, had blatant lies about his achievements, and included him claiming to own the DeviantArt account of a talented artist who was most definitely not him, since the artist had a twitter account that contained his photos and the fact that he lived in America (we live in Canada). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found this hilarious and openly mocked him about it. That was probably a douche move. He reacted by telling me not to tell anyone, which I promised to, but when I jokingly mentioned his personal profile offhandedly in a Discord server, he forced the owner of the server, whom we knew irl, to ban me from it and not add me back. I was quite pissed off about this because I never planned on showing anyone, but now I did. I showed everyone in my friend group, and they secretly showed other people they knew. That Guy was clueless about the fact that his personal profile got distributed like so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, I got interested in the life of a Nazi official, since he was the only high-ranking Nazi to be successfully assassinated and I love assassination stories (especially when they're justified). That Guy got very curious about this and tried to figure out who the man was - I would have told him, but he somehow got the conclusion that I was in love with the man despite the fact that he was evil, dead, and married. I am also asexual and almost aromantic. I tried to explain this to him multiple times, but he believed that having interest in someone's life meant that you had to have a crush on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, he offered to tell me who he had a crush on if I told him who the man's name was. I agreed; since he was also telling me something, I could get him to promise not to tell other people. Less than a week later, the guy that he had a crush on (whom I was also acquainted with) asked me if I was in love with a Nazi. After I told him that this was not true, I asked him where he got the information from, and he told me that it was That Guy. I then told the dude that That Guy had a crush on him, and he ended up telling a lot of people as well. That Guy was clueless again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then privately confronted That Guy and told him that I would leak his personal profile and also the identity of his crush if   he ever talked about this again. As far as I knew, he didn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been avoiding him after that, but he keeps approaching my friend group whenever he sees us around campus. One time, I was drawing random stuff with Cool Guy when he appeared, and he told Cool Guy to draw a face based on his description. After Cool Guy did that, That Guy turned the face into an anti-semitic caricature and laughed at it for a solid minute before I left the room. By the way, this was in my sketchbook and in pen, so I had to scribble it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also keeps asking Cool Guy for his homework so that he can copy it, and Cool Guy was so nice that he agreed until I persuaded him to stop helping him at all. In context, it's a CPSC assignment and he refused two people's (one of which was Cool Guy, the other was another close friend) help to actually explain it to him so that he could do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is annoying and all, and I have been very curt to him whenever I see him, but perhaps I am in the wrong since I blackmailed and lied to him. However, he also slandered me and broke his promise. Who is the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this long-ass post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I leaked sensitive info about this guy after he got me banned from a Discord group, then leaked a secret he told me after he told everyone my secret and also slandered me. I blackmailed him with information that I already told everyone. He is not the best person, but neither am I.",

My sister and her bf went a little “wtf that’s just insensitive”, but her bf usually jokes about 9/11 and such. A got really mad and told me privately that they are really butthurt, and all I said was that you guys have different senses of humour.. just let it go for your own sake? His reasoning was that his friends all find it funny, which I understand, and responded with “different strokes for different folks”. A then went off at me for being unsupportive of him and says i’m not on his side. He said that he would have been fine if I just said some words of support. Am i in the wrong here?",

      "description": "My best friend of 8 years whom I met in college is pregnant and it’s been a tough pregnancy for her. \n\nShe briefly battled with fertility issues and is in a high risk pregnancy. She ended up in the hospital twice due to prior health issues that were exacerbated by the pregnancy. She recently lost her job and is going through a bunch of drama with her in laws. This baby is currently the only thing holding both sides of her family together. \n\nFurthermore, she is one of those women that absolutely loves kids and always knew she would be a mom. She even minored in child development just to prepare. \n\nThe problem is I recently accepted a position back in my hometown that is halfway across the country from my college town. This job came out of nowhere and was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I officially start next week and I’m staying with my parents while I work and save up. I’m broke and the baby shower is next week. I can’t afford a plane ticket so I’m borrowing $150 from my sister so I can make the 8 hour drive back to my college town. Aside from the financial issue, I’d have to request a day off at my new job so that I can make it to the baby shower. \n\nFYI This job isn’t integral to my career but it’s a good job with great benefits and it pays the bills. \n\nI planned on visiting after I worked a bit and could save up for a plane ticket but making it next week would be tough. I just feel especially bad because I knew about the baby and the baby shower from the very beginning. Just to further illustrate how close we are I was the first person she told about the pregnancy before anyone. I know she would understand if I explained it to her but I can’t handle being yet another source of stress and disappointment for her in this time. \n\n",

      "description": "So for context, this happened awhile ago but I’ve been mulling this over for a little bit. So I had been friends with this girl “Sandra” for three years and we by absolute chance ended up attending the same college and summer program together. She met this guy in our program, “Hank,” who was honestly a total jerk. She originally had liked this other guy and was starting to see him but Hank won her over for a bit. \n\nSandra and I had been hanging out for awhile when Hank started to get jealous and wanted to come hang out too, so obviously there was no problem with it and he came over. He then decided that he wanted to make some food, Sandra and I agreed, but we would have to go to CVS to get some ingredients (CVS because it was the only place in walking distance and none of us had cars). \n\nSo we get to CVS, get our stuff, and we are at the checkout line. A nice woman is the cashier, whom Sandra and I had a few days prior and gotten friendly with, and there was an older woman behind us in line. Hank gives Sandra a little grief over money and then pretends to shove her. The cashier gave us a wide eye look so Hank backtracked immediately and said, “Nah don’t worry, I’m abusive and all but Sandra loves me.” The cashier was *not* cool with that and told him how it was not okay to joke about that and that she was a survivor of abuse. (I also knew that Sandra had gone through abuse previously and knew she was uncomfortable with the “joke”). Anyways, we all leave with him refusing to apologize. \n\nWe are in the parking lot, about to walk back to our dorms, and I just do not feel right about leaving. I told Sandra and Hank we should go back in and apologize and they both said we shouldn’t. They then proceeded to wonder if we should go to this convenience store on the way back, so as they’re discussing this I say that I’m going back into CVS to get a drink. \n\nI go back inside and see that the cashier is checking out the woman who was behind us, I awkwardly walk up to her (the cashier) and just say I’m sorry for my friends’ actions and that I do not agree with them and wish I had stood up in front of them in the moment. \n\nThe cashier said she understood and thanked me and the older woman started crying and said how it was “fucked up” what Hank said and how she was also a survivor of abuse and how she was so upset and angry when she heard him joking about it. I apologized again and she said I had nothing to be sorry about but thanked me. I felt awful for not stopping Hank in the moment. \n\nI said goodbye to them and went outside to Hank and Sandra, who were like “what took you so long? Where’s your drink?” So I told them the truth and said I apologized for Hank’s statements. Hank got really quiet and angry and Sandra said I should not have done that because Hank felt bad enough already. She also said now she feels an obligation to go apologize. \n\nWas I the A in this situation? Should I not have gone back in?",

I know that we don't have the money for me to use it exclusively so I intended to use that money for all of us to go on vacation in Japan over the summer. I've been planning this trip for upwards of a year now. However, my mom just called me letting me know that she wanted to invite one of my childhood friends to come along with us. I like the kid but I really didn't want to have to take care of a guest, especially since he was going to stay at my apartment over the summer after the vacation to take classes at my college anyways, so I told my mom no and she agreed. 1 hour later, she calls back saying that she has just helped them buy the plane tickets. Worst of all, she said that she was thinking for me so that I would be better friends with my friend. Keep in mind that I had got him an autographed poster of his favorite anime and a switch for Christmas. I'm just so mad since I told her that I didn't want my friend to come along with us, but she still insists that she is thinking for me even though I am in my twenties now. AITA for being mad? Maybe I should just be blessed that my mom gave me $10000 for travel in the first place?",

      "description": "This is my alt account as this post got pretty specific.\n\nI went on a week-long trip to a foreign country as a part of a study abroad program with my school. It was my first time traveling without my parents and I would be free to actually explore a major city with my classmates. A few months ago, I chose \"John\" as my roommate since he was the only one I knew going on the trip.\n\nFor the most part, I enjoyed the trip and the experience but John was an excessive drinker and honestly a DICK the entire trip. John blasted music until 4am (we had to wake up at 6am since this was a school trip), was late to class activities, took a personal item without asking and temporarily refused to return it, toxic language and attitude the entire week followed by being an ASSHOLE on the final night. On the final night, I went out with a group including John to a club. At the club, John landed several punches to my shoulder and gut, and shoves that I only barely avoided landing on the floor because I braced myself each time. The punches weren't full power but they added up.The verbal abuse included telling me to go home because nobody liked me. This started at a first club where John was kicked out. We all went to the a different club, where the abuse continued. A few people tried holding John back but there was hate in his eyes. I was able to convince \"Tim\" to leave the group and come with me to a different club.\n\nAs for why I didn't tell our instructor: Most of the things I could handle and I didn't want to taddle tale. I thought I only had to tolerate it for a few more days. It was the last night of the trip that John went too far. As for why I didn't leave the group earlier: It was my first time clubbing ever in my life and I was in a foreign city where most people didn't speak English, so I wanted to stay with the group. This was all while I let him use several of my things that he forgot, called Apple Support to help him find his phone, and made sure he got out of bed on time multiple mornings.\n\nOn the way home to our college, I told John what all had happened the previous night. John apologized and asked that I not tell people what happened. I wish I could never see him again but we have the same career goal so we will likely have a class together again and see each other in the business library. While we don't really share close mutual friends, most people pursuing our career goal at my school know each other. Several people on the trip know what happened but since my school is so big, they aren't associated with people in my specific field that I hang out with. I don't want my classmates to think I'm ignoring/being impolite to him for no reason. \n\nSorry this was so long but I had to get it all out. So, WIBTA if I tell my classmates how shitty he was and ruin his reputation. How much do I tell our instructor? Any other advice?",

      "description": "I am the only woman in my house who has a period, my dad has a girlfriend but she is no longer fertile. I have a period, but I recently started using a divacup which is reusable so I dont use tampons anymore, and I occasionally use pantyliners which I wrap up well with toilet paper so that they dont come undone and place them in the trash. It is well known in our household that I have my own chores and my brother has his, I am responsible for the dishes, he is responsible for the trash. Yet my brother threw a fit when he saw a tampon in there a few months ago (again, I dont use them anymore). My dad was apparently shocked by the fact that I use the bathroom trash to dispose of tampons, and he insisted that I instead take my tampons out and put it into the kitchen garbage so that he will never have to see it (not sure exactly how putting it in the kitchen garbage would hide it?). So I responded by saying \"you want the kitchen garbage to smell like blood?\" And he was like \"IT SMELLS?\" i was like \"um yes? Its blood...Blood smells??\" so he insisted I take every tampon i remove and dispose of it like its toxic waste and take it outside straight to the garbage bin. Obviously, i told him I was not going to go outside in the cold every time I removed a tampon. That meant that I would be going out every 2 hours or so on heavy days. So ever since they have been saying it's my job to get rid of the bathroom garbage, and are acting disgusted to touch it. Even when I'm not on my period they make me empty it as if they will die if they see one. I just feel like they are exaggerating, you know? I know it's not lovely or anything, but they have done several things in the bathroom that is straight up disgusting and I dont complain. I dont see why I have to be made to feel like a disgusting monster for something entirely normal. I'd be fine with it if they didnt act like it was the most disgusting thing ever, but every time they have me take the trash out they make a grossed out face and have to act so overdramatic about it.

She doesn't want to get up early to support me, which I kind of get since the races are long, and there's little to do in the meantime. \n\nThis time, she said she wasn't able to find the finish line, and was wandering around downtown, and subsequently did not meet me until later or take any pictures at the finish.\n\nI feel like this is a stupid excuse, since it was well marked, and a rather large race. She claims someone told her the finish line was in a building (it was the awards ceremony) which doesn't make any sense. ",

I understand that it happens and so we became really good friends. \n\nA few days ago she mention something that made me confused, because she wouldn't have known about it. Only my friend knew, that was the first time I thought about looking through my friends phone but I thought, thats a crazy thing to do. \n\nThe next day he had left his phone on the counter and it went off. I looked at the notification and it was from her, and the text mentioned my name. curiosity got the better of me and I opened it. I started reading, and I read everything. Turns out he's been shit taking me for months, saying things like how he doesn't think i'm right for her, how I mess up every relationship i'm in, and then goes on to talking about how he would be so much better. Trying to go behind my back to get with her. she has been very resistant to his attempts.\n\nNeither of them know that I've done this. I've looked at his phone now 4 times.

      "description": "(Ive been waiting a lot reddit videos so I feel like its my turn to give you guys a story to read, if you lovely people can help get this post read by a youtuber that would be much appreciated. P.S. I'm writing at 3 am so I might edit for grammar and spelling)\n\n(A little background) So my mom and lets call him \"Punk\" (as was his favorite word to say when he went on his rampages) were dating for 5 years and but the situation lasted an additional 2 years after the break up. He was an ex-felon and an AC/roofer. His family besides his older brother are all trainwrecks. His little brother is an alcoholic and his mother was a heavy smoker \n\nFor a good 3 years their relationship was pretty nice. He was a good stepdad back then but it all changed once his mother died in the hospital. After that he would disappear for weeks only to come back for a day or 2 and repeat. When ever he was home he was rather sleep all day, as tweakers do to come down from the high, or he would be getting into arguements with my mother. Not a great environment to live in to say the least. Most of the fights would last until 3 am. My grades slipped and I was never due to my house not feeling like home. \n\nHe broke phones, stole my mom's car twice and broke the radio console and broke the oil pan causing over 3000 dollars in repairs. And found about 2.5k in meth shard in the house, slwe flushed it 😂. The worst of it all, he cause Me and my family emotional trauma through all of this. He would call my mom an average of 80 times a day while working. She would work 12 hours shifts everyday to keep us a float. \n\nHe always had the mentality that he could easily beat up Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson with one arm. He would often try fighting me in my own house. He never did anything but after the first time he tried fighting me I learned quick how to be a man. A good man, I had to defend my mother against this crazed tweaker....Punk wasnt a man, but a child stuck in the body of a man. \n\nDue to his action we had made a good connection with the police since they were called more often then we like. The police didn't like Punk, the neighbors didn't like Punk, My family didn't like Punk. The only one who did was my mother. I felt powerless and alone due to her constant enabling of him. \n\nI had to act so I did. When he came over last year during fall time to pick some stuff. Painting equipment, his works shoes and a 9mm pistol in the safe. W hen I heard was picking up the gun I called my mom and I was yelling at her over the phone that she would allow him here with a gun. He was in the garage waiting outside but decided to let himself in without my permission. I did was any sane would do. I gave him the gun after I cleared it and took the clip out. I was trying to get him to leave asap but I knew he can't be trusted with a gun. Hes a felon if you forgot, he is not allowed to own any fire arm. I am forced to give him the clip and I make sure to lock him out. \n\nI pick up the phone and dial 911 immediately. I tell them there a felon walking south bound from my location with a gun. 8 cops pull up in less then a couple minutes. I live in an alright area so having this many police cars all at once meant there were already trying to caught him, I tell the officers where he went to the best of my ability and I filed a report on him. He was caught a couple weeks later with the gun, making his current charges being pressed him go up to 8 in total. I cause him to get federal agents involved and everything. He is currently in jail serving 8 years in county jail. \n\nI never told my mother that I called the cops on him for the gun. Am I an asshole for doing this? Every person deserves a second chance in my book but for him I'll make an exception. Sorry for the long post but I can tell you guys more stories about the \"Punk\" if youd like too. ",

      "description": "For context here is some back ground:\n\nWill be married a year in June right before our daughter is due. I am filing for divorce this month even though in my state it will not be finalized until after she is here; I moved home from his military duty station (3000+ miles away) to my family, to escape a mentally and emotionally abusive marriage. There has been sexual harassment from him that has fueled most of the destruction of our relationship. Combined with (my speculation of) him having BPD and refusal to get treatment, abuse of alcohol, physical violence like punching holes in walls when he was politely turned down from sex &amp; the fact we could not agree on counseling or therapy until I had already decided it was best for me to remove myself from the situation. \n\nHe makes me cringe. I have had nightmares of him sexual assaulting/raping me. The thought of even seeing him at her birth fills me with dread and anxiety. He acts like it’s no big deal. He is very entitled and narcissistic. \n\nI am considering not letting him be in the actual room while I am laboring/giving birth. At first I figured I would just do it all by myself and have only doctors/nurses in the room. But since I have decided I would probably only like my mother and my step mother in the room. As I feel they would be the most respectful, helpful and calming people to be there with me on that special day. I fear if I let stbxh in the room, he will make things uncomfortable and it will make me very anxious and ruin the special day. I feel sometimes I am being selfish, but then again giving birth is a lot of trauma and I feel like I deserve to be comfortable. Help!",

      "description": "Tldr at bottom\n\nI used to hang around this one friend for a couple of years and over time we got really close to the point where we would only hang out with each other, but during this friendship she told me that she has history with cancer and that she used to suffer from it, she also had told me that her father was really abusive to her and she would come to school every other month with bandages over some part of her body. This lead me to get very protective over her which pushed me away from some of my other friends.\n\nFast forward a year or so and I find out that she has boyfriend who is also very abusive, but whenever I would try to meet him he wouldn't show up and she would give an excuse for why, I didn't think much of it but I knew that if I ever met her boyfriend I would have fought him. As much as I hated him I was also informed of a friend of hers that would treat her like shit and sometimes fight with her, I tried meeting with this friend of hers as well, but just like before the person wouldn't show up and she would give another excuse as for why.\n\nThis went on for about another year and after that I was starting to get a bit skeptical of everything she has told me so far because none of it would match up. She would say she got abused but had no bruises or marks, she would say she went out of the country for the weekend but people say they saw her in the city. So I am starting to have my doubts with most things she says.\n\nFew months later she starts telling me that she is suffering from a disease that could kill her, but nor she or the doctors know what it is. This starts getting me and some of my other friends worried again but this time we thought of a plan. She would usually bring a note from the nurse that was caring for her every so often, so I thought that if I kept one note and compare the handwriting to one of her hand written assignments for school then I could tell if she was lying, I checked the handwriting and they both matched perfectly. This basically confirmed my suspicion that she was lying through all of it and had made me lose sight of caring for myself and others and made me focus only on her, so I decides that instead of taking any drastic measures I would just stop talking to her no matter what,even if she talked to me directly I would stay dead silent.\n\nThe plan was going well and I already noticed improvements on myself and my academics, but now she has been hanging around my friends alot more and forcing us into the same room, now my friends are starting to tell me that it's getting awkward whenever the both of us are around because they dont feel comfortable ignoring her (which I understand and its their choice if they want to hang out with her). So now I ask you Reddit, am I the asshole for making my friends uncomfortable whenever the both of us are around?\n\nTldr; friend lied to me for years about abuse and cancer, which has caused me to give her a long term silent treatment, but now she hangs out with my current friends and they say that it's awkward and they feel like they have to pick a side which is what I dont want them to do",

      "description": "We've been thinking about moving in with together for the last month or so but I've been on the fence about the whole situation. After giving it a good amount of thought, moving in with them wouldn't be the best idea for myself or for my relationship with my gf. \nFinancially, I'm currently the only person with a stable job, which was my first red flag. My second red flag would be that I would be moving over an hour away, whist still keeping my job in the current city where I live. That would add over 10+ hours of driving per week! It wouldn't be the best next step for our relationship either. To be moving into a place with her, her sister and her nephew, wouldn't be the best at all. Her sister and kid are great, but I don't think moving in with them is something I want either.\nSo after a month of us looking for a place to move, I had come to my conclusion that it wasn't something I wanted or deemed a good idea for myself and let them know. I do feel bad for what seems like wasting a month of our time, but I also feel like I saved myself from a bad situation later on. AITA for doing this? ",

      "description": "A few months back, my dad had a massive heart attack and found out at the same time he has been a diabetic. For someone who has had relatively no health scares in his life, this was quite a shock. He had not been to a doctor in over 10 years, and these problems had been lying dormant in him for who knows how long. While we were in the emergency room, he was bawling his eyes out, apologizing to me for not being a good Dad (even though he has!), and for not taking better care of himself. It was a really strong emotional moment, and I just held him and said it was okay and that everything would be okay. My Mom died when I was 12, so I think him leaving me behind has always been a huge anxiety for him. At one point he asked if I would be okay if he died, and I said I would -- because he raised me well, and I'll be able to look after myself and my family okay. He didn't say anything at the time, but was still really distraught. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy aunt was in the room at the same time, and pulled me aside furious. \"You DO need him, and don't ever tell someone you will be okay when they die, that is just heartless,\" she said. \"You just made him feel worthless.\" Of course that was not my intention at all, but seeing it through that perspective, I feel absolutely terrible telling my Dad I'll be fine when he actually does die. I care about him, and I'll be absolutely devastated, but I know life will go on. I don't know if my aunt was out of line, or if it was me. ",

      "description": "Now hear me out please. Recently our relationship had been going downhill quite a bit. For the last few weeks we almost didn't have a day, on which we weren't arguing.\n\nToday I visited my father because I hadn't seen him for over a month. Originally I also planned to see her today for a few hours, which I still would, but only for about an hour. I only told her about it today, because I figured I'd need some more time with my dad.\n\nFast forward a few hours, I get to her place and she is very cold to me. She was angry about a previous fight, for which I apologised. Afterwards I ask her how she feels and she told me she was very pissed about me constantly changing my plans. We had a bit of a back and forth, at the end of which she told me, that half an hour was already a \"short while\" (my words, when I told her I wouldn't be there any longer). I ask her if she wants me to leave, to which she responds \"I don't care\". Obviously I left.\n\nAbout an hour and a half later she messages me about how hurt she felt about me not messaging her. I had gotten home, made food and was eating at the time. I tell her exactly that and also tell her how I'm sorry about that and how I feel with the situation (not too great). We seem to be getting somewhere, despite the fact that she still is angry and hurt.\n\nI tell her we might talk this through in person on Tuesday, a day she initially proposed. She then says, Tuesday won't work, because she has to go babysitting. Okay, so some other day then? Maybe?\n\nA bit later she tells me, she would come over (We only live 20 minutes apart), but that it would be pointless with how I behave. I can't answer her, cause I'm eating with my family. I answer her, once we're done. In the meantime she wrote messages about how I don't care for her at all. I apologise for not answering and tell her I can't, as my family and I were watching a film together.\n\nNow she starts berating me how everyone she knows would prefer making up with their partner over watching a film with their family. I tell her I'm sorry, but I made those plans before she offered to come over. She starts about how I didn't care for her, how she's hurt and exclaims, that she doesn't want to see me for a few days or maybe forever. I then ask her if that means she's breaking up with me, but she dodges the question, telling me how I would need to make steps for us to stay together because she wouldn't.\n\nReading through our messages and giving it a good long thought, I realise we need to break up, because we only hurt each other. I spill the beans on her and tell her how I think we would need to break up. I still love her and I want her to be happy rather than be together with her. I only did it at this point, because even though she agreed with me that we should talk in person, she didn't stop making accusations about how I didn't care.\n\n\nI Know, breaking up over text is shitty, but otherwise this rollercoaster would've kept on going until we would see each other again (probably a week or so), at which point, I would still tell her the same thing.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nNo TL;DR, because holy fuck, how?\n\nPS: We're both 18 and going to university if this somehow helps. I'll gladly answer questions as this is terribly one-sided, but I'll go to sleep first. I'll answer in about six/seven hours",

      "description": "Background info: I'm about to turn 19 and I'm halfway through my 2nd semester of college and my parents still track me through my phone via the Life360 app. Them tracking my phone made sense to me when I first started driving because I was in high school and maybe they wanted to track my driving habits. But now since I'm in college, I'm realizing it's a little ridiculous.\n\nTheir reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a \"goody two shoes\" I was and still am.\n\nThey're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.\n\nSo to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday). It's not like I want to do anything bad or illegal, I'd just like a little bit of freedom.\n\nI've expressed this to my parents but they're adamant on tracking me. When I try to explain that I'm 19, my mother says that she's a grown adult and \\*she\\* still has the app on her phone.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just turned the app off even though they told me explicitly not to?",

He chose one but mom was fuming because of my decision and tried to take my credit card to buy both of what my brother wanted. I of course said no and then we began an argument in the middle of the store. She began saying about what she did for me (even though she ain't done shit in the last 20+ years) and she said that I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'M HER PROPERTY!?.\nI of course refused and she bwgan going haywire, but after everything happened, I bought my brother Splatoon 2 and my mom was speechless the rest of the way. When we arrived home she just kicked me out with nothing so my sister took my things and I slept at her house (I love her).\n\nBecause I won't admit I'm her property\nI couldn't come home for Christmas and she will not talk to me until I admit it.\n\nI was honestly surprised when i received a call because I expected her to be sorry but she wanted me home because she wanted to show me off to her friends basically. So I declined her invitation and ended the call by her first name.\n\nThere was much more dialogue about her dissowning me and screaming at me, that i posted on r/entitledparents a couple of weeks ago but I don't want this to be too long.\n\nTl;dr: Mom wants for me to come to her birthday even though she thinks I'm her property...",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 years now and everything is going great, like stupidly great; to the point where I'm considering entering a long term engagement with her. In fact, we are planning to move in with each other after college is through (1 year from now) However, in the last 6 months she's started to really get into tattoos and piercing, about 3 months ago she impulsively went and got a tattoo of a cat with a witches hat on her ankle, she didn't even have a design in mind until she got to the shop, but it's small and lacks detail so it really isn't all that bad, kinda cute tbh. Now though, it's opened up the rabbit hole, here's a list of things she wants to get\n\n1)\"Photorealistic Harry Potter dragon baby\" on her left thigh, covering all of it\n\n2)\"A dragonfly and fancy design\" on her lower back (it's a tramp stamp guys) \n\n3)\"a TARDIS\" from doctor who on her right shoulder\n\n4) Two \"button\" piercings on her lower back, above the dragon fly \n\n5)Industrial piercings \n\n6)Collarbone piercings \n\n7) Chandelier style undercarriage (under the breasts) tattoo\n\n8) inner ear piercings\n\n9) some quote tattoo'd on her left shoulder blade  \n\nIt's progressed past talks now, I've always mentioned my distaste for this kinda thing but also don't want to impede her autonomy. Now she's starting to look at designs and studios around our area. I honestly don't think I could look at her the same way should she just become a human sketchpad, to the point where I think I'd have to leave her. I do love her, it even hurts like hell writing this post. I also don't want to hurt her. So my question is this, would I be the asshole if I told her I'd break up with her if she went through with her plans? \n",

      "description": "Long story short I moved into an apartment back in July and started dating one of my roommates. Ever since it’s been crazy ups and downs, he’s cheated on me, he’s been emotionally abusive and has told me multiple times he would do everything to keep me off the lease in January once it renews. I figured out that he would kick me out when he would tell the other girl that she would move in.\n\nI made the decision to leave after I heard from the other girl that he drove five hours to see her when she didn’t want to be seen and then hit her and choked her. He’s never been violent with me or damaged my possessions but it scares me.\n\nI want to just leave him now and not deal with him treating this way or inevitably begging for me back days/weeks later. I want to move out suddenly and without warning. I paid my last month of rent to him already and I signed a paper stating I would not be signing the lease renewal, but I haven’t told him. He has other people coming in and I know he can afford the apartment even without my share (especially with others coming in January) but I would essentially be ghosting him, leaving the key, and moving all of my stuff at a time when he’s not around. I have been planning to cut communication with him after that because the abuse scares me, but he’s never actually done it to me and he’s been a good friend lately. WIBTA?",

      "description": "Context: [TL:DR at the bottom]\n\nMy boyfriend [19] and I [F18] have been together about a month and a half. We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?",

      "description": "My brother is in his early 30s (I’m in my early 20s) and my whole entire life he has made my parents lives hell, all the while he thinks that he is the one who is being targeted. He got sent to rehab when he was finished with high school, and has since become addicted to weed (you may think that’s not possible but he can’t go a single hour without being high now). My two brothers and I were lucky enough to have wealthy grandparents, so we have all of that money now, and he pissed his away on frivolous shit, and is now asking my parents for money. Whenever he gets asked any sort of question that makes him uncomfortable, he shuts down, plays the victim, and storms off. When this happens, he’ll yell, curse everyone out, all in all act like a huge baby. Yesterday, my parents asked how he spent $200 on his grocery order, and he went ballistic. He said, “this is absurd I don’t need to answer to you. Fuck you, I hate you,” to my parents... but the thing is they have every right to know because they are paying for his goddamn groceries. I drove him to the train short after that, and I flipped on him and told him to grow up and learn to have an adult conversation, yelling and saying the world is against you when people disagree is extremely unhealthy. Well... he lost it. He said that he knows now that I’m one less person in the family he can trust, he punched my dashboard on my car, he literally tore his book apart with his teeth, and he threw it out the window. The way he looked at me, I thought he legitimately was going to punch me in the face. I was scared so I followed him out of the car when he stormed off and hugged him to calm him down, but I have legitimate disdain for him because of the way he has always treated my family. I don’t know what to do because he broke down and said he’s a burden on all of us, and I said that’s not true, but he knows he is sort of the black sheep. AITA for feeling this way about him? He’s my brother but he has made everyone’s lives hell because of how he treats us, and I don’t know how to handle his victim mentality anymore",

I was planning on making a cream cheese crescent roll bar thing because it’s delicious and easy. I had school till 3 and I had to work at 4, so I didn’t have time to pick up the supplies to make it. My mom said she was going to the store and she would just pick up the supplies. I told her 4 separate times that I was going to make it myself when I got off of work at 11 because I wanted to discourage her from taking it upon herself to make it. I had a particular way I wanted to do it. \n\nWhile at work, I got a text from my parents saying that they made the dessert as well as some muffins that I wasn’t even planning on making. At this point I was upset that they didn’t listen to me, but I wasn’t going to make a big deal because they thought they were helping out. I get home and find out that my parents baked it wrong, so I could only use about half of it and they didn’t cut it they way I wanted to. Most of the dessert was ruined and they used all the supplies. \n\nI told my parents both that I was very appreciative that they thought they were helping, but I wished that they had listened to my wishes. My mom was very apologetic and legitimately feels bad. \n\nMy dad screamed at me about how I was ungrateful, even though I had stressed how I appreciated that they were trying to help. \n\nMy mom stuck up for me, but I’m still crying in my bathroom right now wondering if AITA and I should’ve just sucked it up and dealt with it silently.

The thought of a massive wedding is terrifying to me. Sounds like an entire day of 300 people staring at me while I do things im uncomfortable with, like dancing and giving a speech. I know my wife has been dreaming of the perfect wedding her whole life and I dont want to dissappoint her, but im sure I will ruin her wedding if theres any more than a few people there. I feel like either way she will hate her wedding day because of me and I dont know what to do.\n\nHer parents have already given her ideas of venues and things and they seem to be expecting to have a few hundred people there, and they seem to not care about the cost of it. I would rather spend the money on other things than hosting that many people. I know its her wedding and she should be allowed do have the wedding she wants, but I also want to have a say in it and am really worried about what she is planning.

      "description": "We have been dating for a year. I'm Agnostic and a firm evolution believer. He's a Christian, studies molecular &amp; microbiology, and believes in microevolution but *not* macroevolution for several reasons:\n\n1. He thinks that there are too many holes in the theory of evolution for it to hold true\n2. Humans haven't been around long enough to witness and document development between two species\n3. He used to be an Atheist and did his own research to come to his belief in Christianity/Creationism for macroevolution\n\nI tried to have this conversation with him multiple times over the last few months, and he gave me some examples like the Cambrian explosion and woodpecker tongue, which (I think) are classic examples of what Creationists use to argue against evolution, though they don't \"debunk\" the theory as a whole. I understand that evolution is not a perfect theory - and, like general relativity and many other theories of science, there are going to be holes. But I feel like that evolution's inability to explain certain events doesn't mean direct intervention from a higher being - and, instead, just means we need to keep refining and improving the theory.\n\nHe says that there are people with PhDs in the science and theological fields who debate this on a regular basis and that one side can always provide a rebuttal for the other's argument, that it's a never-ending cycle of arguments that is up to each of us to determine which side we think holds more credibility. Ultimately, he decided that it was Creationism. I decided it was evolution.\n\nI just think that you can't use theology to debate science (and he does - because he believes Christianity to be truth), but there is just so much overwhelming evidence for evolution in the science community, I just can't wrap my head around the fact that he is also a scientist yet believes this. We're both planning to work in the science field together in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... would it be narrow-minded of me to break up because he's a Creationist? WIBTA?",

      "description": "I moved in with a friend from college 4 months ago, after we got the same job right after graduation. I told him I was applying and he decided to apply for the exact same position as me. We both ended up getting the job, and currently we work alone in the same room. We decided to live together since we would save a lot on rent.\n\nAt first it was fine, we were carpooling to work and enjoying living together, but I cannot stand him any more. He is very into UFC and fighting in general, and always talks about how he wants to fight people. He shadowboxes in the living room and kitchen all the time, and even in the lab we work in. At some point, he started pretending to hit me and would direct his air punches and kicks at me even though I told him to stop. I don't like it and it makes me feel uncomfortable around the house sometimes, but that is not enough for me personally to break a lease.\n\nThe big issue I have is his lack of respect for the fact that I have a say who stays in our house. He has been dating his girlfriend for a few years, and they are planning on moving in together next year. She stays over 3-4 nights in a row at least every other weekend, usually a few consecutive ones. I've lived with people in relationships before, and it has never been a problem, but these two are possibly the most annoying couple I have ever known. After politely asking a few times, they have just recently slowed down on basically hooking up in front of me in the living room and speaking only in baby talk to each other all the time.\n\nI know that he has a right to spend time with his girlfriend, so I have only said no when he asked if she could stay over once. He has also only ever asked if she could stay once, I usually get about a 5 minute notice that she will be arriving soon or I come home to her already at my house. The only time I said no was when he asked if she could stay 10 days, after she had been here the past two weekends. I told him that was too long and it would make me uncomfortable. He didn't talk to me the rest of the day or the next.\n\nI thought he was just mad, but it turns out he had her over anyway. She got there when I wasn't around, and he hid her things and told her to stay in his room so I wouldn't know she was there. Someone was living in my house without me knowing for two days. I found out and I was pissed, rightfully I believe. I told him I was done, that I had started searching for a subletter already, which was true. I was planning on moving out after 30 days, to give him what I think is a proper amount of notice.\n\nAt first, he took it well, he said he thought it would be better for me since I wasn't happy living in the area we live in. But as the day went on, he slowly got more and more angry at me, saying that I was screwing him over. He tried to blame me for suggesting we move in, even though he suggested it long before I did. He also said that it wasn't fair that I felt uncomfortable and get to leave, whereas he has to live with a stranger and be uncomfortable. It started to get in the way at work, so I finally relented and agreed to finish out the lease until his girlfriend could move in and take over the lease when she graduates, still 6 months from now.\n\nI feel trapped. That was a few weeks ago, but I am still unhappy where I live. I'm tired of hearing the same heavy metal songs blasting through his door. I'm tired of him telling me that every good thing I try to do, like composting my food scraps, is pointless and that I only do it so I can feel better about myself. I can't stand being stuck in the same room for 40 hours a week with and coming home to the same person, especially when they don't respect me. It is starting to bleed over to work again, and we cannot have a conversation about anything without him trying to win an argument that I'm not trying to make.\n\nI'm afraid that finding a subletter would make him angry enough to potentially hurt my professional life. I no longer consider him a friend because I don't like how he treats me, so I don't mind that our friendship will get hurt by this. Is he right that I am screwing him over by finding a stranger to replace me?",

A few days ago my mum was incredibly drunk and for a reason in a bad mood, she gets drunk like this a few times a week (she has a substance abuse problem) but she usually doesn't really bother me. She was going on around about something stupid when she started banging something, I was trying to sleep so I open my bedroom door and told her to shut up, apparently that was enough to solicit a bombardment of harassment with lines like \"I hate you why don't you move out if it's so bad honestly\" \"I want nothing more than for you to leave\" \"both you and your brother can get lost for all I care\" and that's just the tip of the iceberg. She shouted some more and then went to bed, in the morning he came in my room and apologised and said she was drunk and the usual stuff she told me after nights like that, I just said I was fine and then I didn't care and it didn't matter because at this point nothing fazes me and I understand she has her own problems that she takes out on me. \n\nSo today she was ranting on about how I borrowed some makeup and that turned into her just running about me in general, I get it I'm not the best daughter in the world. I just wanted her to leave me alone I was feeling really sick and just wanted to sleep but she muttered something under her breath as she left and it really ticked me off so I said \"just like the time you said you hated me\" this did not please her and she said if I was going to hold her accountable for when she was drunk than that wasn't fair. She's been annoyed with me for a few hours now, so am I in the right or wrong?",

      "description": "So I had this very good friend, scratch that  she was my best friend. We'd known each other since high school, been  friends nearly ten years and recently it ended. We used to hang out all the time but around Hurricane Irma she started talking to me less. I hadn't heard from her in months and when I called her during that time to find out if she was okay as I was worried and had been trying to call  her for days her response was \"well this is the first time I've heard from you in a long time.\"\n\nI told her \"you stopped replying to my messages so I stopped trying but I was worried.\" \n\n Her: \"well I've just been busy living my own life and doing my own thing and if the people in my life want to follow me and keep in contact  that's cool if not then I'm better off with out them\" \n\nYes she said that to me. We talked for a while on the phone and I thought we were cool but she goes right back to ignoring me. Fast forward a bit to  later that year and I'm in a really bad accident. I rolled my car four times and almost amputated my left hand. I spent three days in the hospital and had to have major surgery. Not once did she reach out to  see if I was even alive. She couldn't even be bothered to text to me. I had reached out a few times only to be ignored and since then I have ended all contact with her and removed her from my contacts and all  social media.\n\nAs I said we had been friends for nearly ten years and there is more of this kind of behavior from her as well as her  taking credit for ideas that were mine and constantly trying to one up  me. People have told me I'm over reacting and being to sensitive about the whole situation as I'm really hurt. So I wanted to know am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for questioning my SO's wording choices?",
      "description": "  I (27F) have questioned my SO (39m)'s wording choices a few times in the past year. It started when I noticed him calling things \"gay\" when he thought they were uncool. He did it in front of my friends as he was meeting them. I brought it up and mentioned I used to say it as well, but ever since I reconsidered and stopped using that expression, I notice when people say it and it seems off. I think it's something people used to say a lot but it's getting obsolete. I know he's not actually homophobic, but he's also rather eloquent and I think he can find better suited words to express himself. He said he hadn't realized how often he uses that word and he understands how it can make people sound closed-minded... Fair enough! I was happy at how the conversation went, and he started saying it less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other times were about using the terms \"cuck\" (when he referred to my ex, whom he has never met), \"shithole\" (referring to a poorer neighbourhood in our city, I told him I understood what he meant but it made him sound like an orange man) and \"yellow fever\" (he was telling a story to some of my colleagues and referencing a buddy of his who has a tendency to date Asian women. We were at a dumpling restaurant. I didn't say anything in front of my colleagues but brought it up later when we were alone). I don't correct him everytime he says something like that because I don't mean to be nitpicky and I believe some it is contextual. Casual banter is fine (and can be extremely funny), and we talk shit together. However, I think that the way we express ourselves is closely linked to how we think, and we could all benefit from taking a step back and asking ourselves what the words and expressions we use actually mean once in a while (I do this with myself a lot).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that last week, he told me that he feels like he felt like he has to censure himself around me and it bothers him. He said I was being oversensitive. When I did approach the subject, it was very calmly and he seemed responsive, so I was surprised by this criticism. We ended up discussing the situation, and our conclusion was that it's due to a generational clash. I guess social norms and speech are things that constantly evolve. However, I think he missed the point with the censorship because I didn't say any of those things to protect my poor little ears.. I thought he understood my point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't agree with the whole \"we can't say anything anymore because people will get their feelings hurt\". Free speech is extremely important, but if you say something shitty, people should be able to use their own freedom of speech and state that what you said is shitty. It goes both ways. Freedom of speech isn't a free pass to say anything you want without consequences...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA? Ready to accept judgment if you think I'm a sensitive millenial snowflake!",

      "description": "Some context. We’ll start out with my first friend, Colton. Colton and I have always had a rocky friendship. First we hated each other but we grew up and now we’re closer. Sometimes he still annoys the fuck outta me and vice versa, but we always tell each other. Colton has a LOT of friends, but primarily female friends. He always keeps very close relationships with his female friends, like in the middle of hanging out he’ll be ignoring what our group is doing to text. Another thing that I should mention is I like a girl who he’s friends with (only recently he’s become friends with her) and he’s CONSTANTLY texting her. I text her too but I’ll be trying to talk to him and he’s ignoring me to talk to her. I asked him to set us up (she’s been asking him to set her up) yet he hasn’t done anything. I don’t know why either. He’s never said why. I’ve done that for him (it didn’t end up working) yet he won’t for me. It really does annoy me and I tell him “come on man can’t you just help a brother in anyway?” And I always get ignored and then told “if you ask me again I’m not going to do it”\n\nThing is he hasn’t even said he’s going to do it, and I know he’s not going to now. He’s straight up told me he has feelings for her too. It explains why he’s not done anything, but I wish he had just said something before it started to visibly annoy me. \n\nI’ve reiterated before I didn’t want him to lie to her about me. I’d rather she liked me for me and not some idea of me. Yet he still hadn’t do anything at all. At this point I just said “fuck it don’t do anything. Don’t say shit to her.” Because I’ve just been tired of this. \n\nI have this one friend from grade school, we’ll call her Mariam. Mariam and I were never close really, but we walked to school everyday together all throughout high school. After high school we lost contact until recently when i messaged her and we’ve become closer. She never liked Colton. Colton always asked me if I knew why, but she never said. He said he just wanted to be friends with her (he does not like it when people (girls specifically) don’t like him)\n\nOne day I asked her about Colton and said he’s different now and he’s a lot more chill from what she probably remembers. She took it into consideration.\n\nFast forward to a night where Colton and I were getting high in my car and I texted Mariam to say hi and she was also high. So I called her to say hi while high (I’m too funny) and I told her Colton is here with me. As I was talking to her, Colton started butting into the convo which was kind of starting to annoy me, since he was busy on his phone when I called her, but then he suddenly had time to talk. We all talked for about 5 minutes total. Seems insignificant to most but for Colton this was big because she even talked to him. (She also sent him her Instagram so they can talk about mutual things) He thanked me a bunch because he had another friend and she didn’t “hate” him anymore. I didn’t think much of it at first but w/e.\n\nFast forward to another hangout at my place with Colton, another mutual friend (Dalton) and I.\n\nMariam texted me to see what I’m doing and I told her I was hanging out with the guy, and I asked my friends if she could come. They said yes so I invited her to hangout. She came over, we all had a good time and she left.\n\nAfter she left Colton said “man I’m so glad we’re all cool now, thanks again man” to which I said no problem.\n\nExcept I started to see a problem. See I enjoyed the fact that I had a friend that was outside my current friend circle. Her and I would hangout alone and it was nice because we both got a break from our main group. Sometimes you need a group away from your main one. But now Colton started texting her more and more. I honestly just feel like he’s going to steal away one of my close friends. \n\nI realized this was my own fault so I don’t really blame him or her. But here we are during our Christmas break and I asked her if she wanted to hangout again sometime, and she suggested we have a smoke session together at her place. Sure! Why not? I suggested we could invite one or two people. I suggested 2 people who we mutually know from school and still both talk to, and she then she suggested to invite Colton. \n\nI kinda just felt sick because I liked having a group away from Colton tbh. I was NOT happy at all about that, but what can I say? No don’t you dare invite someone we’re both friends with to your place? So I just said sure and left it. \n\nShe ended up making a group chat with all of us saying to come to her place this Friday for a smoke session, and I said “eh I might be able to” so I could just not go now, when she called me out with “lol stfu %, you’re the one who had the idea for this 😂”\n\nSo now the group knows it was my idea and that I’m free to go. But I don’t want to go now. I liked having a group away from Colton. I’m just not going to go now. I didn’t want to invite him at all but I didn’t say anything about it. So I’m just going to remove myself from this situation. AITA for not wanting to invite him?",

We had dated for about 2 years and ended the relationship over 5 years ago. We remained friends. Talk to each other about new relationships without any jealousy etc. I took care of his dog while he was away. I had to put her down in May. \n\nMy boyfriend claims to be totally cool with my friend coming to visit and catch up while hes home/give him the dog's ashes and was aware of this happening at some point over the holiday. My bf comes over tonight which wasn't planned. He just decided he would stop by and sleep at my place and go to work from here. Cool. While were hanging out my friend calls and suggests we hang out tonight. I ask my bf, he says sure no prob.\n\n20 min into the get together my bf excuses himself to go to bed and proceeds to stew in my bedroom. He says I should have known he would be upset/ I should have shown more empathy toward him when I discovered he was angry.\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "I (M) and her (F) have known each other for two years. We have been pretty tame with each other and actually friends up until 3 months ago. I have never been mean to her and have constantly encouraged her. However, she hates me. I'm going to write you all the reasons why.\n\nReason 1. I constantly flirted with her sister. I complimented and flirted with her every time I saw her. I'm a horrible flirt. Her and her sister thought that I was weird and creepy. The last time I flirted with her was the third time I saw them. After that, her sister didn't want to see me. \n\nReason 2. Our mutual friend (and my best friend) had a crush on her and she rejected him. I told her to reconsider. She didn't like that. So after that, she has constantly been rude to me. After she started being rude to me, I told my friend to stay cautious around her and to keep everything platonic.\n\nReason 3. I am constantly a joker. It's a huge personality flaw of mine. However, I'm not a bully. I'm just a huge goofball and I'm okay with it. She isn't though. She told me my jokes are shitty and that everybody thinks so too.\n\nReason 4. We have opposing political, ethical, and religious beliefs. I am a Republican, she isn't. I'm a family guy, she isn't. I am a Christian, she isn't. \n\nNow I'll tell you what happened and you can decide if I'm the asshole. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was hanging out with our mutual friend the day before I went halfway across the country to take care of my Grandfather who is dying of terminal brain cancer for 3 weeks. She was also with us. I told everybody I was leaving for Texas. She asked why. I told her why. She started laughing. I was in shock. \n\nI was back early for reasons I don't want to disclose which means I was in town for Halloween. I called my friend to see what he was up to for Halloween and told me he was having a party. So I came. She and her sister was there with 3 other friends. They were gonna go trick or treating and I decided to confront her in front of everybody about why she laughed about my Grandfather's brain tumor. She kept denying it, but I decided to forgive her anyway.\n\nSo am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This has been happening for about half a year now. So a year ago an old friend of mine (B) got an Xbox and he introduced me to a friend of him (F). After about half a year he would suddenly just scream at me through his mic, some pretty bad stuff. His mother (BM) and F didnt really seem to care about the bullying overall. So what I normally just did was leaving the conversation and play on my own or with others. He would then start texting me, saying stuff like why do you have to be such a p*ssy, just leaving. I would always ignore this. After another 3 or 4 months I was DONE when he started acting that way again. The conversation went like this:\nB: Just shut up, nobody likes you. Honestly just go away, we don't want to play with you.\nMe: Oh now listen to me! You have been acting all wierd when I'm around, being mad for no reason and calling me names, even cursing with deseases some family members of mine have died of. I'm done with you and your attitude! I'm getting the f**k out of here!\nF: Okay, I agree with you about the whole cursing and stuff.. but aren't you overreacting?\nMe: Nah, he's been treating me so bad the last 3 to 4 months, I AM DONE HERE.\n*I left the conversation*\n\nAbout half a month after, he starts inviting me to play and about 2 weeks before I wrote this, he invited me to come with him on vacation. I obviously decline. We hadn't even talked in over a month. \nToday, his mother started texting my mom asking her to tell me that I MUST play with B, because he wanted to. My mother told BM that we were old enough to fix the whole situation if we wanted to. She told her that I wasn't resonding to him, and that that's the reason why she texted her. I did indeed not reply to him, because I told him I didn't want his company. But that was obviously not good enough. She passes me the phone..\nMe: Sorry that this has to go this way, but I told B that I do NOT want his company, because he has been treating me like absolutr garbage.\nBM: That is not true, he tells me that you have been bullying him, and that you need to play with him as a way of saying sorry.\nMe: No, sorry.\nI pass the phone back to my mother\nBM goes further..\nBM: You have been verbally abusing B, and you need to play with him, NOW!\nMom: This is *my moms name* I know he hasn't. I can hear him saying every single word he says, and he has been calling me most of the times BM started acting that way.  Please do us a favour and leave it.\nBM: I will tell him that he has done nothing wrong because I KNOW that he hasn't done anything wrong, F has told me anything that has happened, and that he is not allowed to talk or be around with him. I also demand that your son stops going to swimming practise because my son DESERVES it more than yours.\nMom: He won't quit going there and please leave us alone now.\n\nSo basically, they say that I'm the asshole, and her son is the angle... is she right? \n*keep in mind, B has autism*\n",

Then he sends me the rest to call him an uber. i say \"uh hey i thought your account was frozen\" and he said \"They froze my card that i use for online purchases\"\nWhich 1.) ive NEVER seen and 2.) what 19 year old boy has 2 cards one specifically for online purchases?\nNow, I may be paranoid but I feel like hes faking all of this to move in.

      "description": "Hey folks!\n\nHere's the situation: we have a 2 year old boy who likes to paint with pretty much anything, crayons, washable (thank god) paints, etc. Typically we set out whatever his medium of choice is and let him go ham on his coloring books. I admit his style is a bit van Gogh - not my taste but hey, he's 2 and enjoying himself. Recently though he's taken to using his crayons on one of the dining room walls. We expected this to happen eventually so it's not a big problem. \n\nMy wife took it upon herself to clean his recent mess. I offered to ta take over because I saw she was having a hard time but she was insistent she would get it done. Later on she complained about how it took almost 2 hours and that it sucked. She went on to suggest that we just paint the walls. This didn't make much sense to me and I admit I can be a bit dense but what's to stop him from just using his crayons over that?\n\nI told her as much and suggested it was just easier to keep his crayons and such out of his reach. She seemed hella upset over it and didn't offer much feedback. I know for sure she's pissed based on her lack of response and demeanor but I don't understand why. To me keeping his things out of reach is the simplest thing to do instead of  constantly cleaning or painting a wall.. I feel like an asshole because it looks like I missed something or said something she didn't want to hear..",

I asked if there was a closer toilet than the one a flight of stairs below, as I Did not want to wake the people sleeping on the lower floor. This toilet happned to have a huge  skidmark. After finishing, I made a comment a to my friend that it is normal to use the toilet brush to clean the toilet if you see that you left a skidmark. It sparked a huge argument with both of my friends arguing that I was a huge neatfreak, and Making a big deal about something unneeded. I just felt like it was/is something natural to do; to brush away skidmarks if you see that you’ve left them. Now I’ve been told I’m a germophobe and generally wierd, that normal people just flush once or twice extra, or clean it with chemicals at a later date. Am I an asshole for expecting people clean up their fucking shitstains before someone else uses the toilet?",

      "description": "My brother Carl brought home a girl the other day and lied to me about why he brought her. He said it was to meet our sister Jane. I asked Jane and she confirmed this. I felt like they were lying to me so I recorded (audio) my siblings talking and sure enough Carl spoke to Jane to tell her he wasn't expecting me to be home when he brought her over and thanks for helping him lie to me.\n\nI kept the recorder there and the following day they had some family friends and another friend round. Jane has been known to talk about my history and to talk badly about me to one of the family friends and her other friend. When I listened to the recording, I found Jane saying really bad things about me, things I was not expecting. Some of the things she said were lies. I am a 30 year old man and I cried listening to it and what she thinks of me.\n\nWhen I spoke to her the following evening about the audio and how upset I was knowing what she said, she couldn't get past the fact that I had recorded (audio) recorded them. I said I did not feel comfortable recording them but I knew they lied and know that I know what she has been saying about me, I feel like it is justified. To bring up my past and talk disrespectfully about me to family friends, people whom I visit and talk to, is just borderline unforgivable.  \n\n\nHer body language and attitude was just...blah. \"You recorded me and that is just unbelievable! \". Forget all the things she said. Or that she told lies about me to our family friends. I cried a little when I told her how upset I was. I told her I didn't think she was inherently a bad person. I told her that I love her very much. But I don't want her around me or my family anymore (my wife and son). She just said \"Okay then\". No real emotion. Just like whatever. I feel like she is trying to play the victim. Like I was the one pushing her away by telling her to stay away from my family because of her toxic behaviour and not her behaviour. She has done this before (speak to family friends about me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're wondering what she says about me it is things like talking about bad things I did years ago, calling me names, lying about things I've said/done or even what my intentions are. Just some really awful things She did not seem remorseful although she did shed a few tears (literally). Probably because I cried a little (I don't cry often) and she was moved and it probably made her shed a tear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I would like to know is, AITA for recording them and finding out what they have been saying about me?\n\nWas it like, I shouldn't really be spying on them but holy crap they have been saying some really nasty things about me so the recording is justified?\n\nOr was it like, you're an ass for recording them. You deserve to find out horrible things family may say about you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "So a bit of back story:\n\nI was asked to be a groomsman for my cousin's wedding a while back, and the wedding is coming up in about 7 months' time.  The other day we went in to get our measurements for rental suits taken.  The other groomsmen and the groom were there getting measured.  There was a deal where after six full suit rentals (socks and shoes, etc. included) the groom gets a $400 gift card.  Everyone was all for that, so we did the full rental.\n\nLater that evening, the groom texted me saying that he was wearing a specific pair of shoes to the wedding and the bride says that all of the groomsmen must have matching shoes.  So on top of the $200 suit rental, all of the groomsmen are required to buy a $100 pair of shoes (even though we paid extra money for the full suit rental package which includes shoes, so the groom could get a $400 gift card).  Furthermore, an additional requirement was added: I would need to cut my hair short.\n\nA bit about me: Currently, I have shoulder length hair and a pretty big (and admittedly unruly beard).  For about the last 10 years or so, I have always preferred my hair long.  I would grow my hair out until after it is long enough to donate for wigs, and then chop it off, and start growing it again.  Often times there would be a fundraiser attached to cutting my hair at the office where I work, so raised some money for charity as well as a donated my hair to make wigs.  I can safely say that by the time of the wedding, my hair will not be quite long enough to donate, meaning that I will be cutting my hair short (which I don't really like on me) and having to regrow a year's worth of hair over again.\n\nSo obviously I'm good with getting a bit of a trim, cleaning up the beard, and styling my hair to make it look nice.  That was shot down.  For me the problem is that someone would force someone else to alter their appearance for an entire year, so they look how they want for one day.  I kind of feel stuck right now.  I'm not a confrontational person, and I don't like making drama, but at the same time, this isn't some new look I'm trying.  I have looked this way since high school, and I feel like if he was up front about this being an issue, I would not have agreed to be part of the wedding party.  Currently, unless his opinion changes, I think I would rather not be part of the wedding party than cut my hair.  I would feel awful if I forced them to change plans, but I think 7 months should be enough time for them to adjust plans if I were to bow out.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background: in a freshman in uni and am in a pretty close friend group which includes my roommate. My roommate has a gf, however, which none of us vibe well with. \n\n\nAnyway, we are all playing a board game in our room, and his girlfriend comes to the room without warning and starts playing with us (which ruined the mood, but we kept playing anyway). Once we finished playing—around 11 pm—I asked if anyone wanted to walk to Starbucks with me, mostly because I wanted to get off campus since it’s a Friday night and Starbucks was the only thing open. \n\n\nMy roommates girlfriend then proceeds to talk about how much of a problem and addiction I have because I get coffee 2-3 times a day. She then calculates how much I spend on coffee in a year (2 or 3 cups at about $5.75 each), and yells at me saying I can donate that money to somebody’s tuition or charity. I will admit that I come from a privileged family in terms of finance, but she doesn’t realize that I only spend my money on coffee and my family donates thousands each year, in addition to me having thousands of hours of volunteer work every summer. \n\nShe continues by saying how much of an addiction I have and how it is such a big problem, but there have been many days where I don’t get coffee and I don’t have any withdrawals. I don’t necessarily get coffee for the caffeine, but because I’m usually with my boyfriend or friends when I get it, and it’s something that we can all bond over. It brings back good memories to me as well because my boyfriend and I went to the same high school, but now go to uni about an hour apart. She knows this, and asks if I only like getting Starbucks because I imagine my boyfriend is with me and I’m stuck in the past. \n\nI then asked why she started criticizing why I like coffee, and she replied saying that I have root problems that need to be solved, which did not make any sense to me because she barely knows me and she does not know my background at all. \n\nTL;DR: roommates girlfriend freaked out because I wanted coffee, and it’s not the first time she has started yelling at me before ",

      "description": "Sorry this is a mess, I hope its understandable, but I genuinely do not know if I’m the asshole here or not. \n\nI dated a coworker of mine for about 6 months on and off (yes, I know, don’t date your coworkers - that is a lesson I have learnt the hard way) we broke up, work’s now awkward, we were working on a normal work relationship, things were ok. Fast forward - it’s been 2 months since we broke up, my place of employment had a beer and food pairing event which I was lucky enough to be involved in, I was SUPER excited about my pairing, busted my ass off, and was genuinely pretty pleased with my product at the end of the day. \n\nSince I am now single, I’m back on Tinder. I mentioned this event with someone I matched with and he immediately bought a ticket, so I was like “haha, cool! Okay, that’s a vote for me! Not too bad!” I told him to bring some friends though as I’m working an event and I wouldn’t be able to socialize. \n\nI didn’t mention to my ex that I had a “tinder date” coming, as I didn’t/don’t want to talk about my dating life around him to be respectable. However, when I was talking to my ex, my coworker came up and told me that my “date” was looking for me. When she told me that I had an extreme feeling of guilt because fuck, now word has gotten out that I have someone here that I might be romantically interested in (it was a dud. no bueno) when my ex is right there. I can understand that that would be that heart stabbing feeling to hear that, as I would totally feel the same way if my ex brought someone to an event. However, I feel as if it were me, I wouldn’t take my feelings out on them because as I’ve mentioned, we broke up two months ago, they’re allowed to move on. \n\nI didn’t tell my “date” that I had an ex working there. Why would I? Turns out dude went up and socialized with my ex for about 5 mins (just talking about the food/beer pairing, nothing about me). I feel horrible, this was a big event, I didn’t want him knowing who came to see me, and I didn’t think he’d know exactly who it was, as it was a bigger event and I couldn’t go out and socialize. \n\nAfter this event, my ex blocked my number and gave me the cold shoulder. I couldn’t quite figure out why at first. He unblocked my number for unrelated reasons, then I got a text from him saying that he “doesn’t know if I know why he’s annoyed with me or if I even care.” out of the blue. Obviously I care, as it kills me to go into work and have my coworker, who used to be my best friend, then boyfriend, not even LOOK at me. I’ve explained my part of the story, and I am NOT discrediting his feelings at all, as they are completely valid!\n\nI explained to him that I did NOT mean this to come across as me rubbing it in his face that I’ve “moved on”, and I’ve apologized for the way that it’s come off. \n\nBut am I in the wrong for having someone come to an event that myself and my ex are working (on two separate floors) to come and support me?

Said friend has a girlfriend (now fiancé) who I’ve been good acquaintances with over the years, but she herself is not really my actual friend.\n\nMy friend has been officially dating this girl and for most of their relationship, has been cheating on her with various females. I used to bring this up from time to time but other male friends of ours basically tell me to mind my business and call me sensitive for caring about it so I eventually just stopped bringing it up. Now, what he does with these other girls doesn’t affect our friendship in the slightest.\n\nWell, to my knowledge he stopped this behavior about a year ago when they got engaged, and the wedding is being planned for a few months from now. I was invited but declined, when he asked me why I don’t want to come, I told him that even though I’m not particularly religious, I do find marriage to be a pretty serious thing and don’t think its right for him to be marrying this girl when she doesn’t know he’s been cheating on her for years and only relatively recently stopped. I said I’m not going to go up to the wedding and cause a scene or anything but I don’t feel comfortable being apart of that. I told him the only way I’d come is if she knew and left it at that. I still consider him a friend but I literally just feel morally wrong about the shit. Again, I’m not the most morally straight guy so alot of my friends are calling me a hypocrite and its soured a few relationships already, but honestly? This is a hill I’m ready to die on. I personally feel like what he’s doing is tantamount to tricking someone into marriage based on a false image he’s presented (I didn’t say all this to him)\n\nSo am I the Asshole here? ",

      "description": "A couple of months ago I got a job as a bartender abroad in Brisbane. When I first started I was told by the manager that interviewed me that my hourly rate would be $25aud. However when my first paycheck arrived I realized I'd actually gotten around $20aud per hour. Keep in mind that the job I took was cash in hand (not taxed) so there was no contract or anything like that. I realize that working cash in hand makes me somewhat of an asshole in and of itself but since I'm here very short term I'm not in a position to say no to work. I went to the owner (who handles everyone's paychecks) and confronted him about it. He told me that everyone in fact gets $20aud in the beginning but when he sees that they can carry parts of the bar themselves he would raise the salary to $25aud per hour. I wasn't happy being lied to but accepted it and figured I'll just put the hours in until he bumps up the salary.\n\nNow for a while I've been able to work easily on my own, taking care of the bar without help. So I sent a message to my boss a couple of weeks back asking when the rate would go up. It was left ignored so I went to talk to him about it and he scoffs and says he's busy (he is not a very pleasant guy) . I later heard from a workmate that actually everyone gets paid $20 an hour and the owner has no intention of paying anyone $25. \n\nI felt like I had been misled from the beginning and have started to skim some cash from the register, just enough to cover what would have been my promised $25 per hour (literally, I don't take more than that) . The method I take the money is in a way that still makes the numbers add up, it just looks like the restaurant is making slightly less profit. I feel a little bit dirty taking money all the time but at the same time I feel it's fair. I'm only working at the place for another month, before I move back home so I don't exactly have time to find another job. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here? Or am I right to steal? ",

Because of her condition I've been waiting on her hand and foot. A few weeks back she got an insane craving for Asian pears. So what did I do? I went out and got a whole carton of those pears. A couple days later she completely lost her craving for pears so now we have half a carton of Asian pears sitting around. I didn't complain about it of course. But there is one thing that she's been really, really wanting and that one thing is the thing that I can't do. She says that her pregnancy is making her extremely aroused. However, there's literally a baby in her stomach! I can't have sex with her while that baby is literally inches from my face! She says that I'm being unreasonable and I do feel bad about not being able to give her this. AITA? ",

      "description": "TLDR at the end!\n\nTo be clear, my husband takes a shower every day in preparation for work, and he does shower on his days off as well. However, I get UTIs very easily. I had them occasionally before, but not at all with the frequency I have been getting then since we've been together. \n\nI follow the advice of peeing and cleaning myself thoroughly from navel to knees before sex, and then peeing after sex and washing with warm water and mild soap on the outside of the vagina and around my anus to minimize the risk of a UTI. But STILL. Nine times out of ten we have vaginal intercourse I get a UTI.\n\nIt's gotten so frustrating that I often turn him down for vaginal because I know it'll end in twenty four hours of pain and pain-medication-stained pee and underwear (and a lot of potty breaks). It hasn't put a damper on his spirit at all since I am more than happy to please him in other ways. I am very sexually attracted to and aroused by him, and I am glad unplanned pregnancy isn't something in our future if this continues, but it is making me feel a bit guilty.\n\nI haven't made him explicitly aware of the reason we do butt stuff or oral so much besides the fact that it feels good for me. I enjoy myself immensely as well even with our modified sex life. But today, he got a little frisky while we were waking up and started fingering my vagina. It felt nice, and I was happy to oblige his desires, but now I ONCE AGAIN have a UTI to treat. I'm so done with this irritation, and am thinking I want to draw the line. I may tell him my pussy is off limits unless all parts that will be touching me are completely washed. Precaution and preparation on my part simply doesn't seem to be working. If I have this discussion with my husband, will he think I'm an asshole for making him shower before sex which could completely take him out of the mood and ruin any spontaneity we have left?\n\nTLDR: My husband's penis and fingers give me UTIs whenever we fool around, even though he showers every day and is in general very hygenic. WIBTA if I insisted on only boning after he washes himself even if taking a shower will take him out of the mood?",

Helped her assemble furniture only to get yelled at for \"not doing it right\". Was there when her pet got sick. Offered to help her learn for her drivers license. Was there when family issues came up. Was there when she went on a downward spiral. Offered to help her sort out therapy. Was always there, whether we were a thing or not.\n\nIn turn I never asked a thing. Didnt even say a word when I had to move appartments and did it completely without any of her help. Twice.\n\nThen, finally after 4 years of friendship+ came the day when I actually, positively needed something for once. Car broke down in the morning. My place is about 500 meters away. Her home is about 1000 away. Battery was empty, and electric was going haywire. No way to reliably kickstart it unless I get the battery to recover. Texted her if she could help me get the car home at around 7pm. All she’d have to do was hit the clutch and steer. \"Yes\". Phoned her with 5% battery left about 20 minutes before I'd need her to  and help me out. Flat out told me she wouldnt do it because she didnt have a valid drivers license. Sighed and told her to just stay at home and I'd take care of it myself.\n\nWhile I fiddle around with the car, along comes a random girl - about a head smaller than her. Wears nothing but a hoody on a February night in the middle of the alps. Asks me if I need help. I explain the situation, she hops in and helps me out. Street is on a slight incline. Random ass dude suddenly jumps in to help me push. Girl keeps asking us if we are okay, since we struggle with the incline. OFFERS to switch, since she's rested and we've been pushing for a while. HELL NO.\n\nBoth me and the other pusher get exhausted and cannot go any further. I thank both of them for their help and inform em that I'm gonna ask someone to tow me. Walk back to my appartment, plug in my phone and call a friend I havnt seen in 4 months at 10 pm.\n\nI'm still standing there, sweaty and exhausted, shoes, jacket and high vis vest still on - when my doorbell rings. I open the door and she walzes in and scolds ME. Goes all \"Why the fuck are you at home while I stand on the parking lot for 30 minutes waiting for you? - I'm so cold - look at my hands shake!!\". Tell her a friend is gonna tow me. Been pushing the car halfway home up until now. Tell her she can go home and have a rest. She calls me an asshole, flips me off and tells me to go fuck myself.\n\nIt's been 3 weeks and I'm still upset over this. I really, really do not feel like it. She called me once, drunk and depressed. Havnt really initiated contact or made any plans to see her since then. I feel super guilty about distancing myself, since she's having a rough time right now. AITA?",

So there's that\n\nI got a call one day(on my day off) from the hospital asking me if I can fix a drawer. This is not normal considering we have people on call.  I asked them what was the issue and he replied back they couldn't get a patient specific medication out. Now that's a huge deal in the medical world. I asked if he submitted a ticket for it. He told me that they need the medication to be accessed as soon as possible and the tech on call would not be able to get there for 3 hours. \n\nSo I'm actually 20 minutes away from the hospital. I knew that going around like this was problematic but given the circumstances and that we switch shifts all the time I thought it would be acceptable. I drop everything I'm doing and race to the hospital. I fix the issue and the patient did not experience any time where they couldn't get their medicine.\n\nI call everyone and let them know to transfer the ticket to my name so I get paid. Well the on call guy was super upset I took work from him. If he did make the call he would have gotten about 2 hours of overtime for the day. So I thought it was yet another good move to do it because it lessened overtime which the regional manager LOVES so save on overtime. \n\nSo 2 hours after I'm back home I get a call saying I'm done. I was fired, I won't get anymore work or calls. I was confused because I did my job and I got the axe.\n\nThe next day I got another phone call. The ex boss told me I need to drive 4.5 hours to drop off all my gear and tools(tools I paid for) to his brother. I said how much am I going to get paid. He told me I don't work there anymore and it's not paid. So I would have to drive 9 hours, pay for gas and tolls to drop this gear off(I'm not even thinking of giving up the tools) I told him that from what he said that's a job for an employee,  which I'm not. I then hung up.\n\nI blocked all the numbers, I'm not on the work email. Also I recently moved and they have no address for me or any way of contacting me. \n\nSo the question is..Am I the Asshole and just drop the stuff off and move on with my life?\n\n\nTLDR- Got fired, they want me to drive 9 hours to drop off their parts/gear and tools I paid for. I hung up and removed all ways of contacting me.\n\nWrote on mobile. Please don't judge me. I'll fix everything once I'm back home.",

      "description": "Before I begin talking about this, let me at least admit that ocassionally, I do make some random jokes from time to time in class, but in this instance, I was completely honest and serious.\n\nIn my CTE Health class, a class that talks about social and self health, we were doing some activities where we talked about Stereotypes. In one activity, our teacher asked us to provide examples of groups of people, i.e, Jocks, Nerds, Emos,  etc., and the point was to question these labels.\n\nThe class was getting a little noisy and she snapped, yelling to the class to stop talking, which is understandable because it was getting a little out of hand. However, when we continued naming group labels, I said Metalheads, being one myself, and she got frustrated at me because she thought I was trying to be funny because earlier, I already said musicians. But she didn't write down Musicians, she wrote Band/Orchestra/Choir. Now, if you are aware of the Metal subculture, you'd know that they aren't the same thing, and that Metal has a cult following that has been treated horribly for decades, where as the things she listen were just class subjects. She got annoyed and I told her I wasn't joking. She pointed out that she already wrote those three up there, but I told her that it wasn't the same thing. After she heard that, she just made us all do notes instead. \n\nRight there in that moment, I lost all respect for her. It's hard to describe the thick atmosphere of the room at that moment, so it may not sound like a big deal, but if you were there, you'd have felt like the entire day just went to shit.\n\nThis isn't even it. At the end of class, she gave a speech talking about how she would rather have a fun class with activities rather than a boring one with notes. But what pissed me off for good as the fact that she said \"It's not all of you but there are a few classmates that are just being a pain in the neck\", and I know for a fact she looked directly at me or at least in my direction when she said that. I know because I was in the left side of the room and any time she talked about those \"few\", she would slowly walk over to the side I was at, as if she was trying to tell me that I was the problem. And I know for a fact that's what she was thinking, because the entire reason we switched to notes was because I implied that Metalheads aren't the same as Band/Orchestra/Choir kids.\n\nIn my own fault, this was at the beginning of the semester so I may have made a weak impression, but I doubt I am in the wrong here. I provided an example of a group of people, LIKE SHE ASKED, and she thought I was trying to joke around, when I made it clear that I was not joking.",

      "description": "For most of my(19) life I've been really emotionally unavailable to my friends and family. As a child I was pretty normal, but somewhere along the way I kinda just stopped feeling things like happiness, sadness and stuff like that. So I've ended up not really being empathetic towards anyone I know. \n\nOver the years teachers and other adults were talking to me saying how they were concerned that I was being quite antisocial and that wouldn't get me anywhere in the future. After a while I was getting irritated by these constant talks, so I thought I would just pretend to be a normal kid. I would laugh at jokes, talk about stupid things with friends, and generally be a person you wouldn't think twice about. But I wouldn't be the same inside and out. \n\nFast forward to university, I've got friends who think I'm a pretty upbeat person and a family who think I'm normal, at least whenever they see me or text me. I'm not very social and if I ever do go out and/or appear in front of other people, I just switch on the act and get on with it until its over. Despite how annoyed I might sound regarding that I don't dislike it. \n\nLately however, I've been considering dropping the entire act, because I am getting bored of it, but I'm not completely sure if that would have a negative impact on me. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. \n\n",

      "description": "So to preface I need to let you know some background: I had a group of friends where I worked. One of those friends (Let’s call him Jack) was always making really sexual jokes (example: “would you like to start a family? How about 9 months from tonight?”) to me that made me uncomfortable which I told him but I eventually learned to brush them off. It’s just his sense of humor. \n\nJack worked in an area with a cooler and one day back in March I went in the cooler to grab something and he made a joke about bending me over a pallet. I brushed it off but he picked me up and carried me to the pallet despite me repeatedly telling him to put me down. He then put me on the pallet and pushed himself between my legs and leaned in for a kiss before I pushed him away and left. I eventually reported it to management after my boyfriend said I had to. Long story short he got a slap on the wrist and told he couldn’t interact with me anymore. All of our mutual friends told me I overreacted and shouldn’t have reported it. \n\n Fast forward a month later and I quit the job and go somewhere else. I’m out of the loop on Jack seeing as I do not associate with him anymore. Well in September a friend who was part of my former friend group (let’s call her Amy) invited me out to go walking with her because my dad had just passed away and thought I could use the fresh air. I agreed. Well on our walk Amy is catching me up on all of the people I used to work with. Then she gets to Jack. Apparently his life has gone down hill in the last several months and he eventually tried to take his own life. I tried to be nice but flat out told her I didn’t want to listen to this and would preferred if she didn’t talk about him. Well I could tell I upset Amy and she essentially called me an asshole for not caring about him. It’s been a few months and I’m still conflicted. I know what he did was bad but AITA for not caring that he tried to take his own life? ",

      "description": "My partner and I had a disagreement the other day. The root of the fight was that they felt I was not communicating enough with them, and that I was being dismissive. I listened to what they had to say, offered input, and was generally willing to have a conversation about whatever they wanted. Here is where the issue comes in. Sometimes during fights, my partner gets a little hyperbolic. They will say things like, \"god, this is why we are going to break up,\" or \"this is never going to work.\" That or some other general comment about the fact that our relationship is \"doomed.\" Now, the first time this happened, I got very concerned, I thought that we were literally having a conversation about the possible end of our relationship. When confronted, their response was \"I don't actually think that, I am just expressing how I feel in the moment.\" I told them that this isn't how I process a statement like that, and asked that in the future they avoid talking about our relationships end in a conversation unless that was actually part of the conversation. It feels like shouting fire in a theatre to me, it hurts a lot to hear, it is traumatic, and it worries me. I have had to mention this to them several times concerning the language and how I didn't feel it was fair to say things like that in a conversation that wasn't actually about our relationship ending. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCue the fight the other night. During the fight, again they said, \"god, this is going to end so badly, i knew it.\" I asked them if that is genuinely how they felt, and again they said that it was just \"talking about how I feel right now, trying to process my emotions.\" I got mad and told them that I was hurt that they continued to talk this way despite having several conversations about the matter and expressing how hurtful it was when that was said. I was then told I was trying to \"tone police\" when they were just trying to say how they feel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, I see it as being the same as asking \"Hey, I don't appreciate you cursing at me when we have dissagreements\" or \"please don't speak in a condescending tone.\" I find it especially hurtful because I have brought this up before how much this hurts me to hear, and it seems like it just gets blown over, and then it gets turned around on me as if my repeating a previous request was out of line (tone policing). I honestly have no clue on this one and feel like I lack perspective, that combined with how adamant my partner is has me wanting to get a fresh opinion. Am I the asshole for asking them to not talk about breaking up unless that is actually what we are talking about?",

      "description": "My husband got home while I was making dinner.  Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn’t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said “oh do you mind changing her diaper?”.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn’t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn’t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn’t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was “covered in pee” because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?

      "description": "Please read before you rip me apart.\n\nI met this girl who seemed nice enough. I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my bulimic roommate to control herself?",
      "description": "I (F20) have been living with my roommate (F20) for about a year now. We’ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she’s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren’t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn’t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can’t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn’t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it’s been getting much worse and it’s clear she’s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I’ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I’ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she’s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it’s wrong, but she can’t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn’t want to be like this but she’s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I’m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn’t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there’s something wrong with her but it’s not like she can’t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people’s tables. I told her that and I don’t understand why this is any different; it’s not socially acceptable to take other people’s property regardless of what’s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven’t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I’m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don’t think I actually did anything wrong. We’re both 20, IMO it’s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don’t because I know better. I’m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

He asked “there’s nothing else you want on the entire menu?” in a sarcastic tone and I said nicely (although I was so upset at how selfish he was being) “no. I only want that. If you want something else then you can order for me.” He then got annoyed of me and told me to just order something else on the menu and named a few choices that sounded good to him. When the server came I got something else that sounded okay to me but he didn’t name and he was surprised and seemed kind of annoyed. I didn’t care.

I also still help with those when absolutely needed due to being short staffed. \n\nAnyway, I’ve slowly been doing more and more calling of patients lately and it’s always to give them bad news. It sucks and they get mad at me for things I can’t control. The nurses were doing it before and we are down to just one so I get it’s busy but there are others that could potentially help. \n\nAlso because of the nature of our practice we are supposed to be awarded quarterly bonuses to give us incentive to keep coming to work. We’re also all getting raises next week as our reviews were just put in. I got an .11 raise and the bonus is $500.

      "description": "Hi Reddit, I know this seems like a pretty cut-and-dried situation but hear me out.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for almost a decade and married for about half of that. She’s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I’m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She’s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don’t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can’t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I’m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can’t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don’t know what to do or if I’m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my father when I was 17?",
      "description": "TLDR is at the bottom of this post.\n\nWhen I was 15 I had my morals tested like no 15 year old ever should.\n\nAround this time, after my family had come back from a holiday, my mother told my father that she wasn't happy in the relationship, and wanted to leave. He was very sad due to this, and it was odd to see him cry because I had never seen it before. But he was sceptical, so one night he followed her when she went out for a drive. He saw her cheating on him with another guy, please note that my parents had also been married for 30 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sadness turned into anger, and rightfully so, he started destroying all photos in the house that contained her in it. My mother went to live with her parents when she noticed that he knew about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father earned about 4 to 5 times more than my mother, and she would not be able to live on her own if she left the marriage at any point. My dad was an asshole, I don't think he ever hit my mother (although he did hit my brother and I with his hands and sometimes a belt), but his personality was disgusting. He was strict and old-fashioned with his ways of discipline towards my brother and I, and always focused on telling us what we did wrong instead of what we did right, as a child it just brought me down. My father had a horrible personality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chose to live with my mother 5 days a week, and with my father 2 days a week. My reasoning was this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"I will never justify the actions of my mother, although she was in a tough financial situation and couldn't live alone if she left my father. I choose to live with my mother because she was kind-hearted and always there for her kids emotionally. My father was an asshole. I don't justify my mother's actions, I'm in a predicament choosing between two wrongs, but I have to go with my mother.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father disliked the fact that me and my brother hardly visited him, and chose our mother over him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a different dispute 1 year later, my father virtually embarrassed my brother in front of his girlfriend, telling him off for living at his girlfriend's house in their garage. My dad didn't understand why he did this. Why would he choose to live in a garage over my house? My dad was either an oblivious person to the wrong he did, or he was devious, very well knowing what he did wrong but lying about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that dispute, my brother never saw my father again, and has not seen him for years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother year passes and I also hit my limit. Please note it's been 2 years of visiting my father on the weekends. I didn't like him, I didn't want to visit him, I visited out of obligation and the fact that I felt bad for leaving him all alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'd have arguments every single weekend when I'd visit. It was 2 years of this, he'd call my mother a slut in front of me, he'd call her a cow, any word in the book. We'd also have arguments about all sorts of stuff, including one time when I came out and told him I didn't believe in God, he told me he was disappointed in me. Do note I was raised a Catholic and only went to private schools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter those two years, I called him up one day and told him I didn't love him, I was not obligated to love him just because he was my father, he treated my family like shit, and that I never want to see him again. He continued to argue, and after 40 minutes, the call ended. I have not seen or spoken to my father ever since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo note this took place 2 or so months after I turned 17. The experience as a whole really challenged my morals, and I always wondered, was there any right way to go about it? I had to choose between two wrongs, but I sympathise with my mother more than my father because of who she is. I will never justify someone cheating, even in a situation like this, I think it's disgusting regardless of the situation, but the context behind this surely makes it less of a wrong to cheat in this situation (although it's still not justified in my opinion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father lost all 3 of his family members, one at a time, with a year gap in between them all. But never thought he was in the wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think I should have done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for choosing my mother, who was a good person and treated her kids well, although she cheated on my father? Or should I have chosen my father? Even though he was a dick of a person, but got cheated on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR -** My parents were married for 30 years. Mother was a good person, earned 4-5 times less than my father, couldn't live on her own if she got divorced, she cheated on my father. Father was a shitty person with pretty bad old fashioned views, but didn't cheat on anyone. I chose to be with my mother and left my father, although I still to this very day don't justify my mother's actions. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm 47 years old, and my wife is 45. We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My stepsister (I’ll call her B) and I have been super close ever since our parents married. We had a great relationship and friendship, confiding in each other regularly. B has been depressed for a long time, but recently she seems to be getting a lot worse. \nI have told her that she needs to get help time and time again. She’s always refused. She thinks that medication will make her worse and firmly believes that no one can help her. Especially a stranger (a therapist or counselor). Talking with her one night, she admits to me that she made a noose and planned to take her life earlier that day. She added that she decided not to do it and that she was “fine now.” She also added that she was telling me this in confidence and wanted it to stay between us. \nThis seriously freaked me out and I forwarded the message she sent to my mom. One thing to add is that I live 500 miles away from her, so I felt pretty desperate to have someone closer to her know what was going on. \nMy mom and stepdad (her father) went to check on her the following night and forced her to agree to attend counseling or risk being committed for her own safety. \nB was livid and called me telling me that I ruined her life and that she would never trust me again. We haven’t talked since and it hurts because I considered her one of my best friends and my intentions were never to hurt her. ",

He talked me into letting him to try to seal the base of the faucet to the sink in which it turned out extremely ugly. It hasn't dried yet because he keeps turning the faucet on and adding more things that he needs to do to \"fix\" it. He cleaned out what I think he called the \"p\" trap but then removed the sink stopper which left a hole where water comes out the side of the pipe now.\n\nAnd now he wanted to replace the whole faucet with hoses but is saying one of the pipes or hoses he's worried about because it's welded to the wall or some shit. \n\nWe've been fighting about this since Christmas Eve. And every time I tell him no, he gets into a pissy mood because I'm not appreciating his work. Well fuck no I'm not appreciative. He just keeps making things worse after I've been telling him not to fuck with it for days and still insists he knows what's he's doing and that plumbers will charge a huge amount. and then I'm like well no shit! After you turned a minor thing into something major, of course he's going to charge a lot plus, plumbing is a profession that takes skill and experience and not just some random tinkering. Fuck!",

      "description": "For some background, I’m a recovering anorexic. Was 30 lbs underweight for my height and now I’m healthy and not just barely; my weight is nearly back to what it was before anorexia nearly ruined my life. I’m still working on my body image a lot, especially knowing this fact. I’m eating normal portions and even indulging and minus the guilt, I’m on the right path. And I’m trying to stay that way.\n\nMy mother has disordered eating and is in denial about it. It’s not quiet; she boasts that she only ate 300~ calories that day. Right now she’s still overweight but has lost a lot of weight in the last months and tells people how much she lost. She’s been caught binging in the middle of the night and purging under the guise of an upset stomach.\n\nHere’s the predicament. I can safely attribute that her constant urge for weight loss kicked my eating disorder into gear. She picked and picks at my weight. Buys clothes in sizes far too big and is shocked they’re too large. She’s always commenting on how much I eat. When I was very sick and in and out of hospital, she remarked she could “never eat as much as they give you”. Now that I’m recovered she stares at my portion sizes and takes two bites of her meal or just drinks water.\n\nI understand my mother is very likely narcissist. She’s always been obsessed over image and we don’t necessarily get along, especially following my diagnosis. We recently got into a discussion and I told her unless she gets help I can’t be around her because it’s hindering and impacting my recovery. Watching her eat next to nothing is causing a lot of jealousy in me(didnt say this) and it’s putting me on the brink of relapse. This caused a sobbing fit and my stepdad and older brother aren’t talking to me now. Now I feel rotten. She wasnt exactly there for me in my recovery and I was pretty alone in my illness. I’m worried I’m doing the same to her if she’s struggling as much as I’m worried she is, and being just as inactive.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nBack in high school, some friends and I went out to a party and one of my friends got outrageously drunk. Long story short, he ends up sleeping on my bathroom floor after I drive everyone to my place. My step dad, who didn't know the friend was in the bathroom, ends up tripping over my sleeping friend during the night and ends up jamming his thumb. \n\nThe following day, my friend apologizes to my step dad and everything is forgiven but my step dads thumb is still jammed. After a few days, my friend asked how my step dads thumb was doing and I have the realization that the only way my friend could get information about my step dads health was through me, so I kept the story going. In reality, my step dads thumb felt fine a day or two after jamming it but I told my friend something along the lines of \"his thumb is really bothering him, he's planning on going to the doctor tomorrow.\" \n\nFast forward a week, my friend asks about my step dad again and I feed him something along the lines of \"he was doing a little work on his car and fell back on his thumb and it's broken now.\" This trend continues for at least 6 weeks with the final story ending up being that my step dad had broken his hand so he couldn't work (contracting/construction), leading to things getting tight with money, even dipping into my college fund to pay bills and all the random expenses that kept popping up, etc etc. I got some friends and even my mom to contribute to the story in little ways like with an off comment about seeing my step dad in a cast, etc.\n\nWeek 6 of the joke rolls around and my friend is back at my house for the first time since the thumb jamming incident. He then apologizes to my mom and she looks at me and says is \"Oh, you still haven't told him?\" to which I finally reveal it was a joke and that my step dad was fine since day 2.\n\nI recently told this story to a couple of newer friends and they told me they thought that what I did was kind of fucked up which got me wondering, AITA in this story?\n\nTL;DR I fed my friend false information for 6 weeks and basically convinced him he caused my family financial stress as a joke",

      "description": "I own a pretty large home.  A couple years ago I moved my mother into my house after my parents divorce to help her both financially and mentally.  My house has an apartment in the basement, kitchen, bath, bedrooms, living room, private garage entrance and own front door.\n\nAbout 2 months ago my Mom said an ex co-worker of hers was living in a camper (we live in the midwest so its cold now) and was wondering if he could move in with her while he looks for another job.  I wasn't too happy about it, neither was my GF who also lives with me; however I met this guy plenty of times before and even had him over last year for thanksgiving.\n\nAnyways, not long after he moved in my mom didn't want him there anymore.  For no particular reason other then she thought he wasn't looking for a job as hard as he should have been.  He has no license so any job he gets he needs to be able to get to it in a reasonable walking distance.\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago, my Mom and I come up with a plan that we can pawn him off onto someone else.  My girlfriend is happy because she doesn't want him there (not any safety issues).  So a few days before we pawn him off he gets called in for an interview.  We keep the plan going, then he gets called back for a drug test; we keep the plan going and then a few days after we got rid of him (told him it was just temporary although we planned on it being permanent) they left him a message on my moms answering machine saying he got the job and could start right away.\n\nWe dropped him off 10 miles away in another town, our area doesn't have any real public transportation system.  So now my Mom and I were feeling really guilty that this guy would now have to turn down that job and remain homeless and unemployed because we kicked him out.\n\nMy mom and I agreed we would take him back with the condition that he has 30 days to find a place and move out.  When I told my GF she exploded at me.  In fact its going on day 4 and she wont speak to me, sent me a message today saying shes not going on a trip that we had planned for mid February and that shes sleeping in the guest bedroom until he moves out.\n\nShe feels I chose a homeless man over her and that me and my mother lied to her because we said he wouldn't be coming back and then he got the job so we let him back.\n\nI feel guilty that shes mad at me and that plans changed.  I also would have felt extremely guilty for ruining a mans chances of getting back on his feet.  I can accept some responsibility and know I'm skirted the line of \"assholeish\" just don't know if I went full asshole or not. ",

      "description": "So I've been dating a girl for about 4 months. We were randomly talking about our friend groups and how we all met. 8 years ago, when I was in college I had a girlfriend that I dated for about 3 years. I became really good friends with her brother and his friends, and after she and I broke up we group of guys all just stayed friends. \n\nFast forward 5 years and I'm dating a new girl. When I mention that technically I met my friends through my ex and that one is her brother, she basically says, \"I'm having nothing to do with ex's. We might as well just stop seeing each other.\"\n\nI try to explain that it's been more than 5 years since I've spoken to my ex, my friends and I are mainly online gaming buddies, etc., but there's no convincing her that it's no big deal. \n\nAm I the asshole for maintaining a friendship with someone related to an ex?\n\nTL;DR I'm friends with my ex's brother and the girl I'm dating has big problems with that, but I don't want to stop a really old friendship",

S and I would hang out often, and after about 2 weeks we confessed feelings for each other. S and I became very close that week and she asked me if she could kiss me while we were cuddling and watching Netflix. I said no because I was still with M.\n\nThe next day, I broke things off with M over text and explained that when I returned home we could maybe resume things, but the next few months were going to be very busy and life changing.

Recently we came across the topic of moving together, but it was pretty evident that she expected me to move, since I already moved a few times and always said I want to get out of my country one day. The problem is, while that is all true, moving is not the problem, her country is. It's 1st world, but poorer than mine, with bad working conditions, an extremely difficult language and very strict laws. \nI feel like I can do better here while working less with less problems (my country can be racist as well, but it comes more from stupid old fucks, and usually not directed at her race). She then called me an opportunist ass (jokingly, but still, I'm wondering if I'm wrong).",

      "description": "So, kinda a long one.\n\nI am 26. I am the youngest in a big family. One of my oldest sisters is 48.\n\nI have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. \n\nMy older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.\n\nShe maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.\n\nWhen she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay £50 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. \n\nAnyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.\nShe asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.\nIf I say no (except to come move her stuff) AITA?",

Before I arrived, I made it VERY CLEAR to the organization that I would only be staying for one month. I had a room rented for a month, and that was it. The ORG seemed super excited and willing to have me on-board for the month, as I was super excited and willing to participate! \n\nI have been here for 2 weeks, and it has been a great and enjoyable experience. EXCEPT it has been really getting on my nerves how everytime one of my fellow ORG-workers asks me how long I will be staying, they almost always reply with \"OnLy A MoNth?!?!\". And proceed to give me a weird look. I explain to them how yes, while I enjoy volunteering very much, I also cannot do it forever as I need to find a way to make money and provide for myself. (background: while I am from a first world country\", I am poor myself and do what I can to help others, but ultimately need to make sure I have money to eat as well). I have even received the response to \"wait around and volunteer for a few more months and then you might get a paying job). UH SORRY?! I do not have the funds to not work for months on end, and wait to MAYBE get a job with the ORG. \n\n  \nIDK, am I being unreasonable here? AITA for wanting to make money so that I can survive (lol?).  Is this how the non-profit, volunteering world just operates? How do these people have the funds to not work for such long periods of time? I don't know, I have many questions haha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You need your swipe to get in to the building and then into your dorm, the bathroom, etc.. If you lock yourself out and have to call public safety to let you in, you  have to pay a fee $15 fee.  My roommate and I aren'tclose at all but are respectful of each other. To an extent. So last week at about 4 AM my roommate texted me asking if I would let him in because he left his key in the room. I was falling asleep when I got the text and checked my phone but was so annoyed that he would even ask me to get out of bed at that time. I know that it literally would have taken me a minute to go out there and let him in, but this wasn't the first time I had to stop what I was doing to let him in because he locked himself out and I sort of wanted to teach him a lesson. So I pretended I didn't see the text and went back to sleep. About ten minutes later, public safety came and let him in. I should add that he wasn't left out in the cold, there are two doors and an area in between that he was waiting in. The next morning I acted completely oblivious and as if that was the first time I saw the text. AITA for not getting out of bed to let him in?",

When we do that my wife will grab her wallet and military ID and place it in my car for the trip. It just so happens that we just made a trip on Sunday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife also goes to the gym every night, which happens to be located on the actual base. Queue to tonight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife left for the gym and I was in my office \\~\\~procrastinating\\~\\~ doing my homework. About 5 minutes in my wife calls me sounding a little panicked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife: \"I'm pretty sure I left my wallet in your car.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Okay, no big deal - \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife: \"it has my license in there.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Maybe come back and get it?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife: \"I'm not in housing anymore, I'm on base.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I already know what she is implying. She didn't say it, but I know her tone all to well and she totally wants me to get dressed, get in my car and drive over to her to deliver her wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Babe, it's okay. As long as you got your military ID, you should be fine. And you've been driving to the gym every night this week without your wallet and fortunately nothing has happened.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife: \"But I shouldn't be driving without it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point her voice is getting irritated and I can sense the frustration building in her tone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"If you feel uncomfortable, come back over here and grab your wallet out of my car. It honestly should be fine, and Security Forces are generally chill folks who would understand.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife: \"UGH!! OKAY! FINE, Mastu\\_KBM!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUh-oh, there is that famous phrase that means I goofed up. At this point I kept trying to diffuse the situation and reassure her that she would be okay as long as she didn't do anything stupid, but the damage was done. She didn't say anything else to me and hung up on me abruptly. A few minutes later I here the garage door open and her come in the house to grab my keys and get her wallet, then leave without saying a word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad, because honestly, I wasn't in the mood to get dressed and drive over to her. And I wont make any excuses for my lazy behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not stopping my task of finishing my homework to help my wife out?",

      "description": "My bestie swears up and down I’m a petty bitch when I think I haven’t done anything wrong.\nSo, my all time best guy friend, let’s call him Matt, is in love with me. We met in senior year but fell out of contact and reestablish contact around April 2018. And he and I start hanging out all the time. Now I don’t have a car at that point so he comes to pick me up and we do fun things. Now he was a larger guy, not super overweight but big enough he was unhappy and had self confidence issues/body image issues. So I encouraged him to start eating better and invited him to come work out with me and he started dropping pounds like nobody’s business. He was feeling good about himself. I even helped him get a job.  I literally changed his life for the better. He was even friends with my dad. We told each other everything, he was my best friend and I even saw him as an older brother.  So for that reason plus the fact that he just wasn’t the type of guy I’m looking for I wouldn’t date him (despite all of our other friends saying oh you guys would be cute together and all this is the man you married and all this other stuff they gave him false hope), so for those reasons I suppose he held out hope. I figured (hoped)  It would  pass. Nope. Wrong. Now we tell each other everything he brought me all his problems, which is fine I don’t mind listening and I’ve been told I give pretty good advice, but he kept bringing me the same problem, that all he wanted was a girlfriend. He brought this problem to me twice a week if not more. It was beginning to become a strain on our friendship. My best friend and I helped him set up a tinder, he hadn’t matched with very many girls yet, he also kept thinking he could get girls that where on my level of attractiveness, big boobs, with a nice ass. (Y’all will probably crucify me for that but it’s the truth, unless he finds some 10 with daddy issues) But I digress, I finally just couldn’t take it anymore I had told him for months he needed to go to therapy (I did it in subtle ways I brought it up talked about my time in therapy as a child and how it helped me. But he seemed very unreceptive to it so I didn’t push the issue), he’s a messed up dude his family did it to him, and being overweight most of his life definitely didn’t help. And so I was like look you need to go to therapy, I even offered to go with him and help him fill out the forms and take him to a good place. After two long hours of tears and things he finally agreed. So I went with him signed him up and finally things started to get better and go his way. He was getting the help he needed and he got a very promising match on tinder. (As a matter fact he’s with that girl right now) but he was still madly in love with me. So his therapist said “you need to cut her out of your life. So that you can move on.” He was very upset about it. But he did it. And I understood, but now I’m a little resentful of the fact that he kicked me out of his life. ",

That hit me like an emotional truck.\n\nI teared up and cried that night and tried to resume to the previous mood and continued texting.\n\nA few days later Jessica asked if I was going to give up on her.\n\nThen Jessica mentioned that she started to like another boy named Dean, which was kind of strange to me because it was in the middle of summer vacation, and interest to a guy doesn't just get sprouted out of no where.\n\nI thought that after all sustaining a relationship purely from the texting was after all too idealistic.\n\nSo I said I give up trying to get her more interested in me but did not say I will stop liking her.\n\nTo help myself and Jessica to get off the awkward phase, I just said I will focus on school more.\n\nJessica didn't say much.\n\nAbout a week later she called me a fucktard.\n\nFew days after that she called me an asshole.\n\nLater on, I found out that Jessica did go with Dean, and sometime we'd still talk, then I gave my blessing to her with Dean.\n\nThen Dean and Jessica broke up. Turns out Dean was 'sort of' cheating and being a lousy boyfriend and such.\n\nJessica was heartbroken and gotten more and more depressed. She was practically despondent to romantic relationships.\n\nAfter a few months, things die down and I spoke to Jessica again. She said I broke her heart that I let her go. She said it was my fault.\n\nSo the question is: Am I the asshole?  \n\n  \n\n^((Sorry for bad English))",

      "description": "My girlfriend(18F) and I (20m) have been together for a month, but have been close friends for 4 years. In those four years we had the most honest friendship I’ve ever had, never one have either of us lied to each other. As a result, a relationship seemed like a good idea.\n\nWe share locations with each other and we have even prior to our relationship, it just something my family and friends do Incase anything ever happens. Yesterday I was leaving school and checking to see if my grandparents were home, when I did I noticed that my girlfriend was at a old weed dealers house, this guy has hit her up at 2am saying ‘What’s the deal, come over’ and things of that nature more than once. Now, I’ve acknowledged that this bothers me in the past and out of respect of the relationship she said she would stop going through him. \n\nSo immediately I messaged her, I asked her what she was doing over there. She responded with “Picking up ____ from *insert dealers name* house” I was fine with it and relieved, just told her I wish she would of communicated with me. \n\nNow, as I go back to check to see if she had left, she’s still there 20 minutes later. So I got a little suspicious, we grew up in a small town so of course I knew the guy. I decided to message him and ask him what was going on. He proceeded to tell me that he was kicking it with *insert girlfriends name*.  I asked about it and again she covered it up. \n\nI personally don’t think I would of cared if she communicated it or would of cared as much, but now that I’ve caught her lying I feel as if I can’t move forward in the relationship. It has turned me into a dick towards her and I feel like I’m questioning her every move, I ended things. As the day went by I slowly became less mad and agreed to meet with her, she started crying and asking for me back, touching me, and me being a fool I chose her back. But now I’m just right back to being a dick to her and questioning everything.\n\nSo AITA for letting one lie cause so much turmoil?",

      "description": "Obligatory \"disclaimer\": I am on mobile so please excuse any formatting mistakes.\n\nI am 20 years old and preparing to be able to move out next year. My Birthday will be in May.\n\nAnyways, onto the context. I'll start with saying that I absolutely can not stand kids. I don't like being around them, talking about them or interacting with them BUT I always hide it in front of kids because I have these feelings no matter how they behave, so I can't be rude or anything to kids simply because they exist.\nSo, about a little over a year ago one of my aunts had twins. I am happy for her and I do love my cousins and I even play with them sometimes and am always nice to them, because even if I don't like Kids they are still Family and obviously if normal well behaved baby behaviour is annoying me it's not their fault.\n\nOn the other Hand I am quite vocal about my dislike for Kids and I make it very clear that even though I will interact with my cousins when I meet them I do not want to see any baby pictures or talk about baby stuff, and the most I want to hear about them is an occasional reassurance that they are okey since it is enough for me to see them at most family events. \n\nI always liked to go to family events, and I do like doing stuff with my aunts, and my grandparents and my mom (my parents do not live together) but since the children are there this has become a sensitive topic because of my absolute disinterest in anything related to babies. I don't even think my cousins are cute and especially my childless aunt (Sabine) takes offense to that. She has this giant mother complex and even though we get along very well normally there is tension between us whenever this topic comes up since I get annoyed at her for trying to force me into caring more than I can, and she gets annoyed at me for not caring enough.\n\nThe other aunt (Mel), the one who actually has the kids, understands my point of view and is actually the most civil person is this whole thing. She knows how I feel and that I try my best around her kids and I think she appreciates that I try to overcome my uncomfortable-ness around her kids.\n\nSo now that you know the context and the kind of drama this has already caused in my family I can finally explain the real conflict. I apologize for the length of this but I want you to be able to make a fair judgement so you had to know the Situation and the feelings of the persons involved.\n\nI know it will be another 5 months until my birthday comes around but Christmas has got me thinking. Since my aunt Mel had her children EVERY single family get together was centered completely around them. Times where adjusted so just she could bring them (what is fine, since I would not want her to miss out on Christmas and easter and stuff), we took extra long to let the children unpack all christmas presents her family got and no one really cared when anyone else got presents since the children where playibg with theirs and this was 'soooo cute', everyone only talks about the children and to the children etc.\n\nIt's not that I don't want my cousins to be at my birthday party. It's just that I saw today at my brothers birthday party that the twins seem to take absolute priority over the one whos celebrating and since my next 2 birthdays will be very special to me (the last one where I live at home and my last one before I will move very far away to my dream city) I want them to be about me getting together with my family. (I always have separate celebrations for friends and family). \n\nI do not want everyone sitting there gushing over the children and not talking to me, because that is exactly what happened last time and at every other family event over the last 1 and a half years since Mel announced her pregancy.\nBut because of the situation I explained above I am not in a position to just adress this as it will just be met with \"Well you should just try to include yourself into that topic! (Children)\" - I tried that already. \nSo in order to get what I want (a Birthday get together with my family where I am actually really included), I'd have to ask them not to bring the twins.\n (Important note: I do not want to be the total center of attention! In fact I want no total center of attention at all since I just want everyone to be equally included and that can't happen if the kids are there!)\n\nI would also understand if they had to go earlier because of this and offer to help them get a babysitter. \nSo would I be the asshole for asking my aunt not to bring her kids to my next 2 birthday parties?\n\n",

      "description": "**AITA because I don't want to visit my newly born niece?**\n\nSo I left my family home about 10 years ago and moved in with the man that would become my husband. My parents are both fundie Christians, and my dad is a pastor. We now live a state apart and it's been the 10 happiest years of my life.\n\nI have had no contact with my mother other than a cancer scare over 6 years ago where I visited her while she was healing and the last time we talked, she told me I was dead to her. My dad is more of a softie and has been texting me off and on, usually filled with quotes from the Bible, but is overall genial. My sister is less against my being gay but she's just as conservative as my parents or even more so in all other matters.\n\nMy sister just gave birth to my niece, and my dad wants me to visit. He's offered me invitations in the past as well but always with the stipulation that my husband wasn't welcome. He prefers to think that this is a phase in my life and I will \"come back to the Lord\" at some point in time. These invitations are always to things where my mom isn't present because she just outright hates my guts.\n\nI've always turned down offers to visit because 1) it would be very uncomfortable for me, especially after the way they've treated me after coming out and all through growing up (they were physically abusive even before knowing I was gay), and 2) because they obviously don't respect the fact that I'm married and will not welcome my husband in their home. They'd prefer to pretend that I'm not gay. Also 3) every time we're in the same vicinity, we fight and argue, at least when I was younger. Now that I'm older I just swallow their terrible behavior in the name of peace, but it's something I'd rather not even be subjected to. It's stressful and I have a fully welcoming family with my husband's family that I'd much rather be with. So partially, I am being selfish because I simply don't want to be around them anymore.\n\nAnyway, I'm conflicted. I feel like I'm obligated to visit my sister and her new baby. But at the same time, she's never stood up for me to my parents (and has in the past has even made statements like \"at least I'm not as bad as my brother because he's gay\" when being accused by my parents for dropping out of school or having tons of extra-marital sex), and probably deep down agrees she with them because of her other conservative leanings. \n\nI feel that my dad is reaching out when he's inviting me, and he is trying to be kind, but when he found out I got married, first he didn't say anything at all until I brought it up. He didn't congratulate me and instead said \"you know how I feel about your relationship.\" and that he \"hopes I will come back to Jesus\" then proceeded to gush about the fact that my sister got pregnant (out of wedlock) and was going to get (a shotgun) wedding. He's the one pressuring me to visit because I'm the new baby's uncle.\n\nI simply don't want to be around them without my husband because 1) he's essential for emotional support (he'd probably be the only one to back me up), and 2) because I think they're being assholes and don't deserve my presence until they accept my husband as part of their family as well. He is literally the man I married and in our family spouses are typically welcomed and respected as part of the family. I feel like they are totally disrespecting him and me by keeping him disinvited from every event they invite me to. Technically, he is also an uncle to my niece after all. I know partially this is a selfish inclination to stay in my comfort zone and reject their overtures for reconnection because I just don't consider them my family anymore. But I also feel like I might be justified in my reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?",

      "description": " I (28) am going to a concert with my mother, step father, and step sister tonight. It’s something my mother and step father have been planning and talking about for a long time but I didn’t know I was actually involved in going until about a week ago. But nonetheless I was excited to go with them and I expressed my gratitude for including me. \n\nYesterday I was going over the plan for today with my mother (who was driving where and when, where we were meeting, what the weather is going to be like, etc). We agreed that my step father would drive all of us to venue since it would be easier to take only one care, he knew exactly where we are going, and the fact that he just wanted to. She then offered to come pick me up before the concert and they could then drop me off on the way home which I declined. The weather is supposed to be really bad and they (mother and step father) have expressed many many times how much they hate driving at night and even more so when it’s raining. It didn’t makes sense to me for them to have to drive even more in conditions they are uncomfortable with just to get me home. Especially since my house is not on their way home. They would have to add at least 40 extra minutes to their trip to do this. \n\nHowever, once I declined and gave her my reasons for doing so, she became adamant and this once generous offer became a demand. She told me that she was going to pick me up from my house at 12, before the bad weather begins. I again told her I would rather drive myself to their house and then back home after the concert. Having to leave at 12 does not work for me. I work from home and still have work to do before the concert so losing that time between 12 and when we have to leave for the concert really inconveniences me. Her response to this was “No.” \n\nNot wanting to make a big argument about this, I dropped the subject and we said we could talk about it later. I still don’t want to make a huge deal out of this because it seems so silly, but I feel like I should be able to decline an offer of help if it’s not actually helpful. But I mean, I don’t know, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My boyfriend just broke up with me.\n\nWe’ve been together for almost two years (exactly two years on April 8th so real close.), and we’ve had our disagreements and arguments but nothing recently. He sat me down tonight and told me he wanted to break up, that he needed space and time to grow more as a person before being in a relationship. This is all very sudden for me as we’ve talked about marriage, kids and having a life together and he’s acted normal and like nothing was wrong, up until tonight. We live together so we see each other everyday and talk every night before bed. I’ve told him multiple times that if he has a problem with something just to let me know right away (he has an anger issue and blows up if he lets things that bother him stew). I freaked out and asked him why and tried to pry into the deeper reason as to why he wanted to break up. He did give a little saying that he was too comfortable with me/I make him too comfortable, but he wouldn’t say anything more or be more direct. \n\nMy ex (we’ll call him David) has this close friend, a very rich man, that is more than 20 years his senior and is very gay.(we’ll call him Larry).They met for we started dating and the friend has taken my ex on quite a few very expensive trips, bringing him along as his “assistant”. Larry has bought David many expensive things, such as an alligator jacket and a Rolex, he’s even bought him a Mercedes (my ex returned it). They were friends from about two years, two years ago, and just started talking again. David had been receiving lots of little gifts and the older man and my ex been on two of these trips in the past three weeks, so David was only home 4 days. \n\nI feel as though I’m either very stupid and can’t see the obvious or just jumping to conclusions... \nWIBTA if I asked him if the other man was the reason/his sugar daddy and if he was gay?",

      "description": " This happened 3 months ago and I got a court date for the case now. I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So, my friend has gotten a new boyfriend and I see that she's very happy with him and all. I am happy that she is happy, although I do not quite understand how this guy is the source of it anyways.\n\nThe thing is we've known his boyfriend (before they started dating) for quite a long time, almost two years. He lives across the hall from our campus residence and we all share some common spaces with other people in the student housing. I now have come to the point where I just don't care about him - in the past he made some stupid rude mistakes, including lying to my face for a really petty thing. It wouldn't have mattered, but I am quite wary of people lying to me, specially for something so small and most importantly when they are really good at it even though they are completely in the wrong.\n\nThis happened among other things and although I was quite angry at first, I let it slide anyways, because being angry is energy- and time-consuming and I've come to a place of complete peace of mind. I do not care at all about this boy's existence. I just would not want him close to me, because I believe when someone shows you their true colours - you better believe them. Nobody had lied straight to my face in such a way. It hurt at the time, because I felt completely disrespected.\n\nAnyways, it's this guy's birthday in a month and some people have gathered to make him a present. I honestly would have completely dropped out - I do not want to participate and I have no interest whatsoever in going to his party. But he is important to my friend now. \n\nAITA if I drop out of buying this guy a gift and refuse to go to his party? ",

The first couple times go well, she seemed to be getting the material well enough. The problem centers around driving. I drove to her the first time, about 20 miles round trip, and I realized I didn't want to do that anymore.\n\nSo I told her as much, she told me she was short on gas so I gave her five bucks for the trip. Easy peasy.\n\nThis time however, she's insisting that I drive because she finds it demeaning that I'm essentially paying to tutor her. I argued that it's the same difference since I'm still spending money driving and I can't do shit to not make it demeaning. \n\nSo now she's gonna go to the free tutoring center on campus. Probably the best end result but I did enjoy hanging out with her.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "My friend/co-worker always asks me to go out to lunch every week. I have been having very long days at the office and hate getting food by myself so usually I am very happy to accept this invitation. Since visiting Japan and realizing that not every meal needs to be about pleasure and instead can be about nutrition and should feature some type of vegetables or salad I've been eating better. This means my side of french fries or burger is replaced with a craving for side salad or salmon/grilled chicken. For about a year now this same co-worker has complained of health issues and had extensive tests performed and finally her doctor discovered that it was a \"blood sugar issue\" that she could fix with pills and diet. It took her months to actually say the word \"diabetes\" and once she did I was horrified with her explanations for why she justified eating candy during work to keep her blood sugar from crashing (Can someone tell me if this is true??) when she said even rice and bread had too much sugar and she was only allowed one piece of multigrain bread a day.\n\nShe tells me everyday about how she is doing so much to eat healthy and exercise but she never ever eats healthy in front of me. It's always the WORST choice on the menu (burger and fries, grilled cheese, bacon pizza) and she never wants to go to health oriented places. And this is multiple times a week. I finally told her that if she actually wants to make progress she needs to make actual healthy choices and that some lettuce topped with gobs of ranch, bacon, and cheese isn't a real salad. I also told her I won't go out to eat with her anymore unless it's somewhere that has actually nutritious healthy food and that she makes good food choices. I say this because 1.) I care about my friend's health and it makes me sad to see her harm herself this way 2.) Her poor choices affect what I order by making me \"give in\" to indulging in bad food and her justifying \"oh I've had a bad day! I deserve this\" or \"Whatever, fuck it. It's just one meal\" is getting annoying.\n\nTLDR; Friend has diabetes and eats crap. She's indirectly making me eat crap too and I don't want to anymore.",

The whole day i was stressed worrying that everything went as planned and when people started arriving i was kinda distant and anxious.Then my GF came and we went to the restaurant but she could tell i was really panicking about the whole thing. She asked me what was wrong and i told her i was having a panick attack from all her friends being there and worrying if something could go wrong (she really didn’t gave a shit) So i order a couple of beers so that i could calm down. Then the bus came and i was even more stressed and drank a couple more drinks in the bus. Then my GF screamed at me in front of all of their friends that i should stop drinking. I got pretty mad and basically went to the corner because i didnt want to talk to anybody. Then she looked at me while i was mad and pretty much ignored me the whole trip which pissed me off even more. She gave me her phone and i dont know why i looked through her chats and i saw she was texting her ex. I didnt look any further and it got me even more pissed off. I gave her a text unloading me from all the frustration so when she saw her phone she’d know whats up with me. She looked and didnt even care. So when we arrived i was basically devastated. I didnt know what to think or what to do i just wanted to get out of there. So without thinking i called an uber and got out of the house like a ghost so i could go to the nearest park to load off some steam. I ended up crying because i imagened the worst. If she hide that from me what else was she hiding? So she asked where i was and i told her i got out to cry from anger. And she told me to get back in. But i didnt want them to see me fucking crying. So when my uber got there i just bailed. Not because i wanted to go, but i just did it without thinking.\n\nWere still fighting till this day, and shes saying that i should have been there for her, but i was just mentally devastated. I’m not proud of what i did. I didn’t think clearly. But i also felt like she didnt gave a shit for me until i was truly rock bottom. And i also feel like she doesnt trust me for not telling me about her texting her ex, (which she knows i would get mad if it happened) ",

      "description": "I’m 28F. BF1 &amp; BF2 are my boys. \n\nBF1’s boyfriend, I call BF3.\n\nI’m the ‘uncool’ nerd one, and can be a bit embarrassing. Fact. It’s unspoken, but really affects me.\n\nWe went to a pub quiz. The quiz was ridiculous- trick questions, weird answers- Quizgoers were grumbling. BF3 is tipsy, ranting, then goes outside. \n\nWe were confused, but let him cool off. \n\nAs part of the quiz, our phones were ‘forfeited’ to one side (if caught on your phone you buy another table a round). \n\nBF3’s phone had work messages, so I go get him. He ignores it, still ranting. I went inside. He soon comes in to sit down- ranting again...\n\nBF3: Ohhh, guess what the next answer is! The carpet is made out of shark teeth!\n\nMe: This is getting a little embarrassing now...\n\nBF3: You would know ALL about being embarrassing, wouldn’t you?\n\nI froze. BF2 gasped in a ‘Woah, don’t say that shit’ way. BF1 told BF2 to shut up and behave. A while later, I take BF2 home, then drop BF1 and BF3 at their house. As BF3 is climbing out of my car, I get a small wave and a ‘Sorry, Joscelan.’ I kept quiet, and decided to sleep on it and see how I felt the next day. \n\nI still felt like shit, so I text BF3 and tell him I’m hurt, my insecurities about it, how it cut me deeper than he thinks.\nBF3: ‘Like I said, I’m sorry. I’m a drunk idiot. I have a harsh tongue when I’m annoyed. Let’s move on’. \n\nI felt like he wasn’t taking my feelings seriously just brushing me off. \n\nTwo days later, we’re at our monthly PN (poker) with friends. (F4 is the additional character here). \n\nDuring our pizza break, I’d have to climb over the seats in my way, then get the people in those seats to climb out for me to climb back in. I asked if someone could pass me some pizza. BF3 got me some. \n\nI’d had a drink this time, but with my autism I’m louder than I realise. I made a passing comment of something quite passive aggressive like. \n\nF4 asks what’s up, so I tell her the story. I can hear the room get quieter and I lowered my voice as I noticed my volume. I had assumed everyone was distracted, but they were starting to listen. BF1 shouted at me to say that BF3 had apologised already. I said a quick sorry getting out of my car or by text isn’t an apology. \n\nConversation ends quite quickly. \n\nThe next day BF1 is off. I took it that he was hungover, had to go to work, and wanted to sleep. I later receive a text calling me a ‘sly c*nt’ for how I was whispering. \nI didn’t see my behaviour that way, so I texted him back to explain it from my POV. We end up dropping it. \n\nNext PN, I tell BF1 I’m still really hurt, and he snaps that I’m a c*nt and to get over it. Then he told me to speak to BF3 because he doesn’t want to be involved- but the reason I was trying to ask how to broach the subject with BF3. \n\nI sent him a long text about my feelings, my POV, how I should’ve said it differently. Now I feel so uncomfortable. If I text BF1 I get instant attitude, and I haven’t spoken to BF3 as he’ll just tell me to get over it. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend of 8 years has been interested in traveling recently. We went on vacation to Europe for 3 weeks in November and I just found out he booked 2 vacations without me. He has mentioned going back to Europe to visit friend’s of ours but we had not talked about dates or prices. He assumed that I wouldn’t want to go and didn’t have vacation time to allocate towards this, so he decided to buy tickets for himself when he saw a deal. His argument is that he is traveling regardless if I come and wants to do this for himself and suggested that if I want to come, that I can book tickets and join. I would like to go but now I feel that I was an after-thought in this decision and that he’s impartial if I join. Am I the asshole for being upset that he didn’t include me in this decision?",

      "description": "About 5 years ago I was dating, let's call her Cindy, and she broke up with me. 1 year after that I contact her a couple times. You see me and Cindy had an amazing friendship. That's part of the reason we split, there just wasn't more than that. Well I contacted her to try to salvage a friendship out of everything. First time she thought I was trying to get back together with her, so she said some really nasty things. Well the second time she apologized and agreed to meet me after the summer, it was college and she was going home. \n\nWell that summer I met what I thought, still wish it was true, the love of my life. She was everything to me. I fell quick for her, let's call her Lisa. Well the time I agreed to meet Cindy came around and I was in the middle of deep love with Liza. So when we met, I essentially told her that because I was now in a relationship there is no way I could be friends with my ex. I kind of was Stern and a bit of an asshole about it because I was still hurting after the first time she contacted me. \n\nI have a wonderful relationship with Liza for four years. One day, completely out of the blue I mean she was begging me to stay with her forever the week before, she broke up with me. It was very harsh because we were very close until two days before she broke it off. \n\nWell now a week later here I am. So my question is, WIBTA is I contacted Cindy after four years of not talking to say sorry and say if she wants a friendship I would be open to that?",

      "description": "I know the title sounds pretty bad, but you'll have to know the full story. It wasn't my breakup, but his. He was dating a girl who I was really good friends with since middle school, and in the midst of their relationship, we became really good friends with each other. They broke up around a year ago now, but he's still hungover on her while she's moved on and dated a two guys. Over the whole course of this year, the only contact I made with the guy (let's call him Z) is when he would Snapchat me theories on why they broke up or to get extra information on her and her life. I was completely fine with it at the start because I figured it was just a way for him to cope. Until a couple months ago, that is. I was going through a tough time and contemplated my life for a bit (don't worry I'm safe now) and I went to Z to seek help because I thought we were close and he should know about it. Z completely ignored what I was saying only to talk about his ex. Of course I was fed up, so I slowly backed away from this friendship. Then, skip to a couple days ago, he texts me telling me about how much of a hoe she is, that she just sleeps around, and how she never loved him during the course of their 3 year relationship. I told him that he was just upset that she was able to get over him, he then messaged me a string of \"fuck you\"s and told his friend group the situation. The whole friend group started to harass me even though we all used to be close. When I finally got way too shit faced about it, I exploded all my feelings and ranted. I called them \"hopeless sons-of-bitches who can't even see straight if a girl isn't riding them\" and that they \"should get a fucking life other than the life you see with your right hand and lotion\". They went silent on me today and ignored me, until Z came up to me and called me an asshole and that I went too far. I don't know -- AITA?? or is it that I'm biased towards my point of view. ",

A few times when we have gotten into arguments, my BF decides to pack his stuff and leave and of course his parents end up coming to the house to help him get his stuff out without question. \n\nThe last time this happened, things got really heated between my BF and I (no violence or anything but the argument was really bad), then his parents showed up and I was already an emotional mess and I felt cornered in my own home. I don't have any family where I live, my home is my only \"safe\" place to go and I felt like they made me a prisoner on my own property even though I wouldn't let them inside. \n\nWhen they left I sent a text to both his parents saying they are no longer allowed on my property. The only time they come by is to move my BF out anyways. \n\nThis upset them, obviously, and now they want me to apologize to them for it. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to apologize? I literally felt trapped because of them but they don't understand how basically ganging up on me made me panic and feel unsafe in the one place I'm supposed to feel safe. \n\nThanks for any responses.

I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me.

One got\nSuspended for 4 days for talking to someone else about how they want me to just kill myself. Not as a joke. He and the other person made it sound like they genuinely want me dead.\n\nThis all started last night. We were in a ps4 party and the night was farley late. Some of the \"popular\" girls at our school were at a birthday party but its high school so they were high and drunk off their asses.\n\nOne of my friends is very good friends with one of the girls and was put on her private story. I was the only one with a screen recording app at the time and he along with everyone else in the party wanted to have a certain video of that girl and another. Lets\njust say in a certain pose.\n\nSo he gave me his user name and password so i could get on, record the story and send it to hime and the few others who were in the party. And i obliged \n\nCome to findout this morning that one of the girls found out. I don't know how. It wasn't my account so it they couldn't have fournd out that way but all my friends deny it. The girl kept yelling and was furious (understandably) and demanded to have it\ndeleted (i deleted it) and to know who all had it. I told her the people i knew had it because it was more trouble than it was worth at this point. She messaged\nthem all as far as i know.\n\nIm now blocked for the day as a type of punishment by most of my friends. At least the ones who have the video. And are blaming me for the entire thing. They've all decided to keep the video but im still\nthe one that's getting the most shit from everyone including the girl.\n\nAnd i really the worst one in this situation?\n",

The whole pregnancy thing was sort of an unexpected and weird situation, but it's not my life and its not really relevant to this post so I won't go into detail about that.\n\nAnyway, Janet has texted me a few times trying to make plans to go to dinner or hang out or whatever, and I am hesitant to make solid plans because, well, I just don't really like babies that much, especially *fresh* babies. I didn't even hold or interact with babies in my family until they were at least old enough to hold their bodies up on their own, even then, I didn't really know what I was supposed to do with them. \n\nI should point out that although I consider Janet a friend, I haven't known her a really long time and we aren't super close. I attended her baby shower and helped her out with rides to doctors appointments when she was pregnant, and before that she dated a good friend of mine (where the unexpected and weird pregnancy situation comes in) so we would all meet up for drinks sometimes.\n\nThe baseline is however, I don't really like interacting with children. I know that no matter what we choose to do during our hang out, it is going to involve this baby and all the things that come with it (crying, feeding, pooping, barfing), and honestly, I'm just not into any of that (babies crying actually make me pretty anxious). I do feel like a bit of a dick cause she WANTS to hang out with me, and I wouldn't just completely blow her off if we actually made solid plans, and I might even feign interest for a brief time if/when we choose to hang out next, I just don't really want to fake an interest in something as major and life changing as a child.\n\nReddit, help me.

      "description": "I am on mobile so I can’t format this correctly sorry\n\nMy mom always struggles to find birthday presents for me because I have always bought the things I need or want by saving up my own money. I came across a limited edition hoodie (once sold out it’s gone forever) that was $60 dollars. I’m fully capable of ordering the hoodie myself but sent the link to my mom and she agreed to buy it for me saying “I’ll buy it later today”. I replied with “the hoodie is limited edition so please buy it in the next couple of days”. My mother gets very annoyed when I remind her about things as I have a habit of doing it too often so I waited two weeks to ask if she had gotten it. Turns out she forgot and now I’ll never get the hoodie that I really really wanted. \n\nAITA for getting mad at my mom even though I could’ve reminded her to buy the hoodie or is she the A-hole for forgetting the one birthday present I let her buy for me, therefore leading the hoodie to go out of stock?",

      "description": "So I basically live in Melbourne, Florida. Orlando is at least an hour away without traffic. Especially at 5 pm on a weekday. I had to take off of work today to drive my mom around and run errands, since she is unable to drive. Did that since 9 am. At this point I’m tired and just want to go home. Then she demands to head to Orlando, to a thrift store out there so she can find a laundry basket. \n\nI tell her no. My reason: I have lived near Orlando my entire life and know how mentally exhausting it is to be there. I need a heads up before I go to Orlando. More than two seconds. At least a day. It’s a common rule in the family that if one of us want to get out of town, there needs to be some sort of advance warning. Especially since I had to drive around town today, I’m too exhausted to deal with Orlando. “You’re the son, I’m the parent! Take me to Orlando now!” She said. So since I am not taking her to Orlando because “he doesn’t feel like it”, I have to give her 50% of my paycheck for a month. ",

Last year, I volunteered to move into a leadership position within the organization after there was great pleading by leadership at a regional meeting of volunteers. Before the training began, the asked for a commitment of two years in the position. After 6 long months of training for this position, I am now 6 months in. I hate it. And I have lost the love that I had for the “grass roots” end of the organization. I am beginning to have situational anxiety (in addition to clinically diagnosed anxiety) over answering emails/ talking with people on the phone about it. Because of this I am not fulfilling the position as it needs to be done. No one has spoken with my about my poor performance yet.

      "description": "About two weeks ago my grandma on my dad's side of the family passed away. The funeral was held this Saturday and I couldn't make it because of school. Now it goes without saying that I don't have the best relationship with my parents, especially my dad who abused me physically and mentally as a child. I don't like interacting with him at all and he refuses to acknowledge fault for literally anything he put me through - he either makes me feel guilty or pretends it never happened. \n\nAbout two months ago I got in a huge fight with him because my mom wanted me to talk about why I don't want to talk to him and he tried to make me feel responsible for everything again. I yelled at him telling him he abused me, and he disowned me as a son. I disowned him back and told him if he didn't apologize next time we talked I would cut off all contact with him. He then tried to get me kicked out of school by calling my uncle (i have a trust fund through a friend of my uncle, who talks to my parents a lot) but my uncle took my side. \n\nAnyways it's been a few months and he's never tried to contact me (just my mom a few times, usually for the phone bill i owe them each month). When I found out I couldn't go to the funeral, I agreed to do a video chat where I would say a few words. When I called for the chat only a few family was there and they told me they would call me back later but my mom put the phone around the room to talk to a few people including my dad, and we only interacted for a bit but I felt extremely anxious and upset even seeing him. \n\nAfterwards I sent messages to her saying I felt very uncomfortable and that she knows I don't want to talk to him. I told her that maybe I shouldn't be mad at her but he literally disowned me and that I wouldn't forget that. She has done this before, putting him on speaker without telling me on calls that I think i'm just having with her. She hasn't messaged me back since.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry at her about this? I know it's a funeral for my dad's mom but I just hate seeing or hearing from him at all, and i felt forced to do so. \n\nTL;DR: Mom put me in an uncomfortable situation on video chat with relatives where I was forced to talk to my father, who disowned me about two months ago. I got angry at her over this even though it's a funeral for his mom, my grandmother.  ",

Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? ",

      "description": "My mom got herself a dog on my birthday last year. He’s a Weimaraner puppy that my mom bought from a breeder. At first, I was really not looking forward to having a dog in my house even though I live with my mom only half the time. I am allergic to dogs and even though Weimaraners are “hypoallergenic”, I still experience hives from his slobber and when his fur makes contact with my body. \n\nMy mom has had him for a couple months now, and, although promising she wouldn’t become a dog mom, she’s become a dog mom. Everything she does revolves around the damn thing and she can’t leave the house for more than an hour without feeling bad. Last night we went to a concert and she had her ex boyfriend come over and care for the dog while we were gone. What the hell? \n\nI feel like I could understand her love for the dog if he was sweet, but he’s an absolute menace. He ate my glasses, my heart rate monitor for the gym, my project for school... he’s not disciplined at all and every time he destroys something of mine it’s always my fucking “fault” for leaving it in his reach! I have to come home from school and spend my time that I could be working on homework sitting in the backyard with the dog to make sure he doesn’t get into anything. I am not allowed to work on my homework and watch the dog at the same time because that would mean “I’m not giving my undivided attention to the dog”. I have been grounded for this “offense” before. \n\nI understand that the dog is a puppy but he should’ve grown out of this phase already and my mom should discipline him! I had to buy myself a new pair of glasses (~$150), a new monitor (~$250) and I got docked points for turning in my project late because “my dog ate my homework”. He fucking did! \n\nI’m sick and tired of having to care for an animal I want nothing to do with. I don’t like dogs in general and I try my best to avoid them but it’s difficult when one lives in my fucking house!  \n\nMy friends always tell me that he’s so cute and sweet and that I’m wrong for disliking him. They say that I’m just projecting my frustrations with my mom on the dog. Are they right? Am I the asshole for hating the dog?",

I blamed myself for not sexually satisfying her.\n\nBut over time, I just felt more and more unhappy and we were fighting constantly. At one point, a few days after a huge argument, I just texted her that I was done and then immediately blocked her number. We'd been together over a year at that point.\n\nI didn't block her on social media so I figured if she really wanted to she could've reached out to me. But I still feel guilty and like I should've handled things differently because I never had any closure with this woman. I resented her a lot but at the same time I'm not sure if anyone deserves to be broken up with like that.",

My boyfriend and me are both computer science studens and we needed it ASAP, so i took it upon myself to buy it.  \n We agreed to share it, everyone paying me for it. Month in, one of the flatmates moved out and a new guy came in. I asked if he wanted to pay for the internet ( it's only about \\~ 2.90  usd per person per month) and he agreed, i gave him the password that was it.  \nExcept, over 4 months after he moved in, despite me reminding multiple times him to pay me for the internet, he hasn't. Once he told me he did pay, but 2 weeks later i still havent recived payment.   \nOne monday, I reminded him again and told myself that I'm giving him time til sunday. Sunday rolls around, no payment. I changed the password, told him I will not give it to him until he pays me. He sent me the money in 5 mins, cool. (claimed he sent it in the morning and i just haven't recieved it yet, but i did not belive that at all based on how long it took him to send  me a screenshot of the transaction)\n\nToday, about a month later, as i'm ending my classes he asks if I did anything other than the password change because the internet works but he can't torrent, and i tell him  \"No, I did not, only the password change, but you can go into my room and plug out the router and plug it int, it's on the right side of the doors. If that won't help i willl be back home in about 45 mins and I can look at it\".   \nAand he tells me that it works, he reversed it to factory settings. I'm mad. Not only do i have to force him to pay me, he feels that he can reverse it to factory settings without asking for my permission. I get really mad, curse a little and tell him that he technician that installed the internet warned me not to to it if it's not necessary or unless another technician recommends it. (true)\n\nHe starts... threating me? He says things like \"watch your words\", \"calm down or else\" (translated)  \nI know that setting it to factory setting probably won't do any harm, although I do not know which settings have changed.  \nI came home, changed the password again, he asked for it. I told him I'll not give it to him (not sure about that yet, that's why I'm asking)   \nNow, I'm considering giving him the password for a week and telling him to get his own in the mean time. I know the easiest thing would be to just let it go but I am pretty angry... am I overreacting and should I let it go or it it reasonable to give him a week to get his own intenet?",

(I should preface that even though I wasn’t talking to him he knew I was right there. We had a class together and he knew I was autistic). So I said to him “Is being autistic really an Insult? It’s not really that bad” And he goes off he tells me to mind my own f***** business and goes off. His friends agree with him and tell me to my own business and I’m always in others business. My teacher comes over and says to him “I agree with We-are-all-uno,you should use that as an insult” and he curses at the teacher. The teacher and him go outside the class. Later in the day some other people were talking about it and I talked very briefly about it. They said I should mind my own business and it’s not a big deal.

(He's seeing a therapist but it hasn't seemed to be super helpful and he's not interested in trying new ones.) But basically, the question isn't \"Is he the asshole or am I.\" It's more \"am I the asshole for feeling this or is what I'm saying fair.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout once every week and a half to two weeks, boyfriend gets majorly upset because a few minor things happen (burns eggs in the morning, realizes he left his to do list at work, phone freezes and he has to restart it.) Some days these things are no big deal; other days, little things escalate into him being upset and depressed for the whole day (at least). (There's no rhyme or reason or predictor for which.) He lays in bed refusing to do anything. He won't talk to me about why he's upset and won't try to do anything (or let me try to do anything) to make it better. He just gives up. A lot of times he'll sleep off and on for the whole day. Sometimes it's better by the next morning, but sometimes he's still in a mood. I want to be clear that his moods are never violent or abusive. He can occasionally be a little mean, but the extent of that is ignoring me or snapping at me when I try to engage him. That doesn't bother me a ton; none of us are perfect people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm frustrated because I feel kind of held hostage by his moods. I wake up thinking we're going to have a good weekend or a nice day, and SURPRISE, nope, he's going to be miserable all day and not do anything to try to change the situation or take me up on any offers to help. \n\nWhen I've talked to him his take seems to be that he is entitled to his feelings (true) and just because he is moody doesn't mean I have to be upset. I know to some degree that's true and that I need to separate my emotions from his.   \n\n\nPart of the problem is that I know I'm overreacting. I was in an abusive relationship for a long time and have PTSD, so the first place my mind goes is to panic that I've done something wrong and it's my fault and I need to fix it. And even when things are good, I never know when this is coming. I've started to be anxious all the time trying to prevent these things from happening. He gets mad with the dog, so I'll make sure the dog is out before he gets home so he doesn't have to worry with her. There have been a few things I've bought, like he often got angry about one pan we had so I just invested in a new set of non-sticks because the cost to me is worth not having to deal with the mood. Even when he's in a good mood I feel like I can never calm down because I am constantly running interference to keep him that way, and every little minor thing that goes wrong makes me feel panicked that it's going to snowball.  \n\n\nBasically this has all happened again today, and I'm anxious and exhausted and frustrated that I can't enjoy my relationship. I went to the other room and had a panic attack because I was so overwhelmed. But also he's clearly upset and struggling, and I wonder if maybe IATA for being frustrated with how he's handling it and making it about me.    \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Trigger warning: mention of animal abuse\n\nFirst, some backstory. My family was practically forced to take in a kitten who is only a few months old because my aunty couldn't (or wouldn't) look after her. She had her for about maybe a month and a half, but she four very uncontrollable and energic children and they constantly abused and terrified the kitten. The youngest was the worst as he's very violent and she has absolutely no control over him, he has a whole history that I won't get into for family reasons, but he treated the kitten like a stuffed toy. He constantly sat on her, pulled her tail, squished her head, etc. He is young, but by the age of six he should really understand how to treat an animal. \n\nWe took care of the kitten for a weekend in the month they had her, because my aunty came to our house crying that her son was literally going to kill it if he continued. They took her again and we didn't see her for a couple weeks, until we finally 'adopted' her. She's scared of the lot of them when they come to visit and I always have to lock her in a spare room with my other cat so she's not alone. I also have to keep my eye on the kids every where they go, which is so stressful to me because they visit for long periods at a time, I'm talking like 4-5 hours I'm running around after four kids that aren't mine.\n\nThe kitten isn't really scared of strangers, but whenever she smells or hears them she's gone. It goes to ahow how poorly they treated her.\n\nThe kitten is overdue for her annual needles, but they cost over $100 and we now have four cats to look after, and we cant afford the money to pay for all of them and the bills. She's still under my aunt's name and we don't really have any legal control of her, so I don't see why we would have to pay for the bills for her kitten. Especially not so since she passed her to us because she was becoming annoyed of it damaging her Christmas tree at the time.\n\nNot to mention we have THREE other cats to look after. That's a fuck load of food and cat litter. Two of the cats are outdoor cats and aren't that expensive, but they still require vet check ups.\n\nIn reality, we will probably just pay for the bills because we're not very confronting and demanding, but it's worth a shot to see whether we're in the right or wrong?\n\nTldr: My aunty handed us her kitten after her children abused it and she no longer wanted to care for her. We can't afford to pay for her to get hwr needles done, should she give us the money?",

      "description": "For reference we're both juniors at a T20 college.\n\nSo my ex-gf and I met freshman year since we're both econ majors (I'm a double major in econ and poli-sci). One thing I disliked about her is her laziness, since she just spends her free time watching netflix instead of joining any clubs or doing any sports. Whatever though, it is her choice. \n\nAnyway, recently I've noticed she's becoming a bit chubbier. I casually mentioned it to her. She said she was 'too busy' to go to the gym. I asked her what she was busy with? She just shrugged and said that she just is. Also I pointed out that I was far more busy than she is: I'm a double major, I play two sports (D1 track, D3 fencing), active in the Political Union, and run my own shoe reselling business. This dissolved into am argument, and I asked her if she would date me if I started getting a gut, and she said no. I just pointed out the hypocrisy. She got angrier. You get the idea, it just went downhill from there. \n\nI don't like to make decisions when angry, so I waited a while to cool down. When I did I gave her an ultimatum: you choose if you want to work out or not. If you don't, I'm not really that attracted to you, and I have the right to break up with you. She just laughed and said 'sure' sarcastically.  After this, I had really 3 options:\n\n1) Try to force her to go to the gym\n\n2) Just let it be and continue dating her\n\n3) Break up with her\n\nI'm not going to try to force her to do anything, because that's really an exercise in futility. She doesn't want to. But that means I'm not really attracted to her anymore, and I have the right to break up with her if I'm not attracted to her. So that really only leaves me option 3.\n\nSo a couple days ago, I broke up with her. Since then, she seems to think I'm a huge asshole. I don't think so. Am I? ",

I work in IT and my office is right next to the front door which leads to a nice garden area. \n\nI'm working away when I hear a bunch of screaming coming from the admin ladies. This happens quite regularly, sometimes spiders or even lizards make their way inside. As expected,  they tell me there's a MASSIVE spider just outside the front door.\n\nI go outside and sure enough there's a great big bloody Huntsman spider - almost as big as an average persons hand. It's close to the gap in the front door and the next stop will most likely be in our office. \n\nNo worries, I'll kill it with my giant ruler! So I go outside and  proceed to kill it when the coffee shop lady (who came over due to the screaming) starts screaming at me to leave it alone. She is particularly upset, shaking her head, calling me an asshole and almost crying. Saying I should have just left it. Most the admin ladies thanked me (except one, who also said she would've just left it) and the coffee shop lady. Am I an asshole? ",

      "description": "So, I've been friends with someone for a few years now, (Cat). I've wanted to enter a relationship with Cat now for a while, but Cat has an on and off boyfriend (Rock). A few months ago I asked Cat out she was on an off phase. She said she was dealing with her and Rock breaking up, but asked if we could consider still being friends. I agreed and we started having conversations through a social media platform. Suddenly, after about a month of this, Cat starts becoming less responsive (mostly responding with K or cool or yikes and shit). Then I see pictures of her, on said social media platform of her and Rock back together again. I'm a little peeved I wasn't alerted, but I'm happy Cat's happy so I just acknowledge this change in status. I'm still trying to make a friendship out of this, so I ask if she, and some mutual friends want to go out to dinner during the weekend. Cat responds that her boyfriend would be very upset if she went out, and said that we'd have to wait until next weekend. A little strange, but, we're mostly free, so we reschedule. We decide to go to a restaurant that is known for being dark. So we meet up, and right of the bat, we can tell Cat's acting very strange. She's being very quiet and seems kind of disconnected. Also she's wearing sunglasses in the restaurant, which she doesn't take off in the restaurant even though she struggled to read the menu. I suggest taking the glasses off, but she ignores this. My friend (Angel), noticed her strange behavior. She could see a little bit of her eye and noticed she had a black eye. Angel asks me to come outside, and tells me what happens. We're both shocked. Later on during the night, It ends up just being us 3. I decide to confront her and ask her how she got the black eye. She gets defensive and claims she just ran into a poll. We obviously see through the lie, but don't call her out A few weeks pass and I get the idea that I should hang out with her and her boyfriend. We talk out a date, and I agree to come pick them up. The day of the event roll around, and I arrive at Cat's place. I peer through the window as I'm walking in and I see that Rock is yelling at her and Cat's crying. I knock on the door and Rock opens up. I see a Vase has been smashed and Cat's has a small cut. I asked what happened and Rock claims her cat broke the vase. Now I'm starting to pick up what's happening, but don't confront them yet. Cat gets bandaged up, and the rest of the night goes on without incident.  Now a few nights ago, my friend who lives close to them, had to take Cat to urgent care because she broke her nose falling down. The person working their said that the trauma that caused the fracture had to be head-on. I and my friends finally came to the conclusion that she might be in an abusive relationship. But we still don't have any full on proof. Despite this I and my friends are going to try and fabricate a story, to make it look like Rock is cheating on her. Should I go through with this?",

      "description": "My first post!\n\nNo words were exchanged in this incident, so this might be a bit boring. Sorry.\n\nSo this happened last year in 9th grade during art class on the day we were doing abstract art. Info on the class: most of the time we had projects that weren’t due right away, so some students decide to wait until last minute to finish their project. Some took the 64 minutes to do work from other classes. Also a note to add is that I am from a small school meaning that everyone knows something about everyone.\n\nOn that day, I was getting the paint and materials needed for my art work. I put my paint in little plastic cups, got varying sizes of paintbrushes, and a cup of water to clean my brushes. In the end, I had 6 cups of paint, a few paintbrushes, and water in my arms. The incident happened when I was walking back to my desk.\n\nInfo on the ‘victim’: she is the type who talks like she’s the sh*t, but in reality she can’t even have a good stance in confrontation. I think this school year she was in fight with another girl that she started and didn’t fight back, leaving her with all kinds of marks. \n\nSo her part in the story was she was doing science homework during painting day, which would seem that she was begging for something to go wrong. Our high school science teacher is strict and she is the type that wouldn’t take students work if it was dirty or wrinkled.\n\nWalking back to my desk I had to pass by her, but her desk and another desk were a little too close together so I tried to be extra careful. I dropped one of my paint brushes next to her foot. I didn’t want to bother her from working, and I thought if I squat, I wouldn’t spill my paint. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nComing back up, my blue paint dripped from the corner of my elbow and splatted right in the middle of a piece of science work (I don’t know if the work was due or a past assignment)\n\nI instantly said I was sorry, but she gave me a dirty look and was about to say something to me, but caught herself. I don’t know if she kept quiet because of my older brother’s social status(he was also in the same class as me and her) or if my emotionless vibes(I have dark circles and always look tired, what do you expect?) I left her table and got to work on my abstract painting.\n\nWhy would you bring science work on the messiest day of art class without knowing something will go wrong?\n\nI think she forgotten about the incident and this school year she and my brother went to homecoming.\n\nThough I was regretful of my actions, I am no longer sorry.",

      "description": "Background info: I’m in college and my dorm is a suite with a common area, with an attached bathroom, it’s important to add the bathroom has a stall with a toilet and a shower without a stall, 2 rooms with 2 people each in them (So 4 suite mates total, with 2 per room). The person I share a room with will be roommate and the person I share a suite with will be suite mate. This will be important later. \n\nMy roommate told me last year that she was sexually assaulted by her ex boyfriend/fiancé (it got confusing towards the end). I won’t go too much into this, it’s a long very confusing story/ies, but the point is she says they had sex and after, she felt like she had been violated. And I believed her whole heartedly and promised to kick the ass of anyone who tries to hurt her again. This event causes her having a lot of trust issues with men and dating in general. Then she got a boyfriend, and I thought YAY! Because this means she gaining her trust back with men, and he seemed nice. \n\nThen one night, one of my suite mates tried to go the bathroom very late at night, think 2:30am. When she got to the door, it was locked. Something that’s never done unless one of us is getting in the shower, and that’s only for a couple of seconds. She knocked to see who was in there because she couldn’t hear the shower. My roommates boyfriend opened the door and when my suite mate looked inside the bathroom, my roommate was on the floor, half naked, trying to make herself throw up. \n\nWhen my suite mate told me this the next day, I was mad, concerned and so upset I was crying. After this incident we (my suite mates and I) told her, the boyfriend is no longer allowed in the room, at all. He had broken my trust in a way he cannot regain it easily. We explained to her that it looked creepy and like he was trying to hide something from us, or he could’ve been trying to assault her, and if he hadn’t opened the door on his own, it would’ve been physically impossible for us to open the door quickly (important note: the door on the bathroom is a pull door, with something on it so you cannot pick the lock, we don’t have keys and the door is about an inch thick). \n\nNow my roommate seems annoyed that I don’t want him in the room at all. And I want to know, am I the asshole for telling my roommate her boyfriend cannot come into the room? ",

      "description": "   Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n   I dropped out of uni 2 years ago because I was planning on moving to a different country and going to Uni there. However, my parents didn't want to help me in any way and I couldn't afford it myself. They've always supported my younger sister though, bought her an apartment and they're even paying her bills, even though she earns enough money to do that herself. So atm I'm stuck at home with them, which sucks as I am 25 yo and I feel like I'm wasting my life completely.\n\n   Both my parents were extremely abusive, especially my dad. As a result, I have social anxiety, trust issues, panic attacks etc. I can deal with everything as I got used to it anyway, but lately things have gotten worse.\n\n   A few years ago my dad was diagnosed with type II diabetes, and he retired. He's been staying at home ever since and he's slowly but surely becoming a vegetable. He had a stroke which left him unable to speak/walk properly. I'm no doctor, but I found his hospital records and even talked to a nurse, and she said he's a bloody mess and he could die at any time. The worst part is, he doesn't realise what's happening around him anymore. He leaves the apartment door open at night, he forgets stuff on the stove, and he makes a huge mess everywhere. I talked to my mum about this, I don't feel safe with him around. He clearly lost his mind but she refuses to acknowledge it. Throughout the years, I've tried to tell her there's something really wrong with him, but she always just shrugged it off. He was an awful husband, so she doesn't love him, but she says she feels pity for him.\n\n   I suggested we put him in a retirement home, as he clearly cannot take care of himself and he's putting our lives in danger. I sleep with ear plugs because he slams doors/drops things all the time. I'm afraid he might set our apartment on fire or worse. My mum doesn't want to do that because she's afraid of his reaction; she thinks he's going to get a heart attack if she tries to bring it up. He's always hated hospitals and he always refused treatment, even when he got bitten by a stray dog, even after his stroke, so I see where my mum is coming from. However, I've had enough.\n\n   Yesterday I heard him choke, he was struggling to breathe and honestly, it sounded like he was gonna die. And I was relieved. My first instinct wasn't to help him, instead I kept doing my skincare, honestly hoping he'd just die already. He didn't. I told my mum what happened when she got home and she thinks I'm a monster. But am I really? This person has abused me my entire life, has beaten the living shit out of me, hell he has even tried to kill me a few times. I know my life would get better if he died, my mum would sell our apartment and I'd finally have money to go to college and start my own life. So AITA for wanting my abusive father gone?",

I hate this woman as she doesn't keep an eye on her kids, let's them trash our house, and gets upset when anything happens to them such as them even hearing a curse word. News flash, I fucking cuss a lot. \n\nSo I was taking a dump and got a phone call while I was wiping so I quickly finished, got up, washed my hands and picked up the phone. It was my boss asking me to work late tomorrow and I said it was okay and we talked a little bit, and I forgot to flush the toilet and left the bathroom. It just slipped my mind.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later I hear screaming.  \n\"WHO WAS THE LAST ONE IN THE BATHROOM. WHAT THE FUCK. WHAT THE FUCK, OH SHIT!!\"  \nIt's Mom's cousin.\n\nApparently her 5 year old got into the bathroom and decided to start eating a log out of the toilet because she likes corn, and saw corn.\n\nShe got bitchy with me and I told her \"if your kid is dumb enough to eat shit, that's not my problem.\"",

      "description": "Background: I can't give much detail because our unique situation may give me away to friends who are on here. We've been in a relationship for a few years. It progressed very quickly within months of our first meeting.\n\nWe agreed to an open relationship to be sure there was no weird feeling of lost opportunity due to our quick involvement. We do love each other very much and want a future together, but we both felt a certain stagnation and tension early on.\n\nRecently, though our relationship has been going really well, we haven't had sex in a while. I've tried to initiate, but with little to no success. I don't push too hard because I don't want to be that person. I don't resent my SO because they're very available emotionally and physically affectionate in small ways. Just no sex.\n\nI've had sex with others in this time. Including an ex that had been kind of an issue in the past. I did not mention this to my SO...\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. I found out that they started up a tinder profile again without telling me, as well as had sex with someone within the past few weeks. It's been months for us. I knew they had gone out and kind of guessed what happened and thought I was fine with it... and yet having it confirmed hurt a lot considering how I've been trying to be more intimate, only to be shut down. It got me really upset and jealous.\n\nI haven't brought it up or shown signs that I know, yet. I feel like I have no ground to stand on since it's an open relationship, but also because of sleeping with my ex. But I still can't help that it hurts and I'm annoyed at their apparent choice to only seek other sexual partners. I'm 100% willing to get over myself if I have to, but I needed to confirm if I'm the stupid hypocrite I think I am.\n\nTL;DR: in an open relationship with not much sex. Slept with ex. Despite our relationship being very emotionally stable and my trying to initiate intimacy, SO sleeps with others but not me. I'm upset about this.\n\nAITA?",

My girlfriend and I don’t live together but we fully intended for this to be OUR puppy. \n\nA couple days go by and I started noticing that he (our puppy) isn’t acting all that normal. Come to find out that he has a severe neurological disease. Even more surprising is that my girlfriend knew this before I adopted him and she neglected to tell me. \n\nI’ve had him for a few months and he poops and pees all over the house multiple times a day. And it’s not that it’s just in one spot; he literally runs around the house when he does his business and it takes forever to clean up. And whenever I pick him up to go outside he ends up peeing and pooping on me. I have roommates and I don’t think it’s fair to them because the house ends up smelling awful. \n\nMore importantly, he has bitten me three times, two of which required stitches (and one of which happened today). He growls and tries to bite at my roommates and any other person that comes within a few feet from him. \n\nWe’re going to get him professional training, but if that doesn’t work and it doesn’t get any better, I told my girlfriend that I don’t think I can keep him. Of course she is mad at me, and I know I undertook the responsibility of taking care of him, but I don’t think it’s fair to me. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This has been on my mind for a while now and I need some out side opinions. For my 21st birthday, my mom decorated our kitchen with a table cover for the island and little bags that all say happy birthday on them. She also put up a big banner over the window that also says Happy birthday across it and she had written a note about how it was my 21st and all that. A week or so goes by and we've put away all the decorations except the big banner over the window. One night one of my friends comes over and my aunt comes by with my little cousin who is about 7 years old. \n\nI don't like children mostly because things my younger siblings and other cousins have done in the past and I've made this known to this aunt especially when her son breaks things around my house (a story for another time smh). \n\nSo the four of us are in my kitchen hanging out and talking and then my aunt points out the banner. She jokingly asks something along the lines of how long I'll keep it up and I say I'll keep it up for some time because I like the little note my mom left on it. Now that its the center of the conversation my cousin runs over to it and start pulling at it and I tell him to stop. He laughs and keeps pulling. Now I get more serious and I tell him stop before he rips it. \n\nNext thing I know hes ripped it off the wall with the corners still being stuck up and hes laughing like crazy. I turn around and see my aunt laughing too. I tell her that I was serious and very annoyed that he wasn't listening. Then she tells me that she was telling him to pull it behind me as I faced him. This makes me even more mad. And all at once all the moments of children making me mad flash in my head. This cousin corrupting one of my video games, another cousin ripping up a drawing I had spent a long time working on, my younger sister acting out and being the spoiled brat she is and many more. \n\nI start to yell at her and my cousin about how much I hate children and her only making it worse because shes encouraging his shitty behavior. It all ends with a big screaming match and they leave and we didn't talk for weeks after that.",

      "description": "My sister-in-law gave birth to her third child, and my wife was ready to hop a five hour flight with the rest of her family to visit the baby.\n\nShe lives in California, an hour drive from Disney Land. My wife has been visiting her half sister all her life: 4 or 5 trips a year. \n\nAfter 5 years of dating and 2 years of marriage I began to see a pattern where my wife visits the sister while she rarely visits us. My wife occasionally expresses frustrations at this. She'll drop everything to visit her sister: wedding stuff, baby showers, baby sprinkles, first week of school, birthdays, but my sister-in-law rarely reciprocates (when we were getting married and she wouldn't fly up here for wedding related events). My wife has never brought up this to her sister because her family never had a problem with flying to California, and she doesn't want to start shit. \n\nWe've had arguments in the past where she spent $600 on a flight for an unplanned weekend. We're a young couple, trying to save for a house to start a family of our own. When say this, she reminds me that she works too and is allowed to spend money she makes on what she wants. She misses her sister and wants to visit her all she wants. When we have children we won't be able to afford to visit as often as we do now, or participate in the fucking thousands of dollars Disney Land birthday parties.\n\nThe past 6 months have been financially hard. I've been going to the doctors and bills are piling up. They don't know what's wrong. Constant fatigue, back pain, and bathroom trouble. It's stressful. We have a dog, and he is a handful when I'm feeling good, let alone when I'm feeling like crap. I'm still working, but my wife got laid off and had to accept a position that's minimum wage. We're not starving or anything, but I've cut back on my spending. I thought she would do the same with less California trips. \n\nLast night my wife was looking at flight prices, and asked if she considered the strain a trip to California puts on the dogs and I. We can only have a dog because of our work schedules: she works nights; I works days. If she leaves, I'll have to board him (more money) because he's not a dog you can leave alone for more than a few hours without problems, let alone 8+. She said I should take some days off from work to watch him, but that would be even a greater financial burden of having to use unpaid sick days. \n\nThe argument ended not being about this trip, but her lifestyle and how we can't afford these trips for the rest of our lives. I said when we have a kid, if she thinks we're flying down to California a few weeks after she gives birth so her sister can meet the baby then I'm going to verbally start shit with the family because its not fair.\n\nI'm not saying she can't see her sister, only wish she would take fewer trips and think about us.",

      "description": "I've been a long time lurker of reddit and this sub but I finally signed up because I truly need help here.  \n\n\nTo tell this story right we need to rewind nearly 4 years ago. Where I was Tinder-ing it up and having a good time. I met this beautiful Filipino girl and we started hooking up. As far as I knew, we were FWB but exclusive. She said she wasn't with anyone else. Well, 3 weeks in and she shares with me that she has been with this guy, but they aren't sexually active. She wants to remain friends and go exclusive with him. Kinda hurts but I agree.  \n\n\nWe become friends on Facebook and eventually she invites me to parties and what not. I am a bit weary but eventually get over it. Then she shares with everyone that she's pregnant. Doing the math I figured she would either have been lying about not being with anyone else sexually, or it's mine. I consulted online and asked a few local doctors and they all confirm that I'm likely the father (but obviously a paternity test would be required); and to clarify, she's telling everyone that the guy she's with is the father.  \n\n\nWell she has the baby and I decide to not be friends with her because I sensed a lot of dishonesty, and I knew she wouldn't be honest. Still, I check in on Facebook and the baby has a lot of the same features as me. Dark hair (both of them are lighter brunettes), oval face (same as me), and a lighter complexion (she's filipino, he's indian, I'm caucasion).  \n\n\nI just sort of live with these details. I mean it sucks but whatever. Then fast forward to present minus a few weeks I see the dad and baby at a supermarket and we get to talking. I've been going through a lot in my life between being professionally stifled and regrets for not going after personal goals more tirelessly. I just feel like I have nothing to lose, and this whole ordeal is 100% a factor. So he mentions how the baby doesn't look like him at all and yeah definitely doesn't so I say \"Yeah, looks kinda like me actually\" and it's like 1,000 lightbulbs went off in his head. I explained the whole situation to him about what happened and how I suspect the baby may be mine.  \n\n\nWell he's devastated, and leaves. I then get 100+ facebook messages from the girl saying how I'm the asshole and how I'm stirring up shit. I don't think I am, I just proposed that I have some suspicions and pointed them out. What do you think Reddit? AITA?",

      "description": "So this all went down last night, I'll try to include most details.\n\nI've been together with my girlfriend for 3 months right now (We're both 22 btw). I can honestly say I've never met someone who I have so much chemistry with, and we are extremely happy together. She's very intelligent and attractive, and we share a lot of interests. I met her at a bar and she actually came onto me, something that surprised me very positively. \n\nLast night we were talking and the topic of sex came up. We see each other 3 or 4 times a week and when we do we usually sleep with each other. She asked me how many people I slept with before her, and I told her I only hooked up with my previous girlfriend. Now I wasn't really thinking but naturally I asked her the same thing. She was a bit hesitant, so I told her she didn't need to tell me but that I wouldn't really care anyways. Well, this is where it starts to go downhill.\n\nShe told me that when she was 20 she worked as an escort for 2 months before quitting. She was with some high-end agency and slept with 2 or 3 guys a week and made quite some money. She stopped because she didn't like the work and made enough money to pay off some debt she had at the time. I was kind of stunned, I didn't really know how to react. When she was telling all this she seemed pretty cool, but when she saw my reaction she became pretty emotional. I told her I didn't expect it at all, and that I needed some time to think. I did hold her for a few minutes and she cried a little bit, but I left after some time.\n\nApparently I am much less open-minded as I thought I was. I really don't know how to feel about her past and it makes me feel kinda shitty. Later that night I got a long text from her and she told me that she loves me for the first time and that she hopes we can move past this. I replied that I loved her too but that I needed some time. After her message I also received a message from her friend saying she had never seen her as happy as with me and never as devastated as right now. She told me that I'm an asshole for leaving her like this and that I should man up. \n\nI get where she's coming from, but I don't agree with her. This is quite the revelation for me and I feel very conflicted.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "The only way I can think to explain this is chronologically.\n\nSo, C is my best friend of 8 years, and we're pretty close. C has what she calls a \"boy best friend,\" that we'll call K. (For context, any boy she's ever called her \"boy best friend,\" she's probably had sex with. She can do what she wants, but she's known for putting out.) Her and K had been friends for a few years, and were pretty close. But, since we're all hormonal teens, of course they started liking eachother in the other way. They had a fling, kind of a friends-with benefits thing, for a while. Nothing official, really, no claiming eachother, and keeping it on the down low. They seemed pretty happy, to be honest.\n\nThen, enter N, K's new girlfriend, who didn't know that C and K were a thing.\n\nC and K weren't exclusive or in a relationship, so, aside from the hurt feelings on both sides and a few small arguments, nothing really came of K calling it quits. C really seemed to accept that K was really trying to commit to N, and they stayed friends.\n\nThen, I notice C being awfully nice to N. I've known her for a long time, and I can tell when she's being fake. It's so obvious to me, so I immediately get suspicious, but don't say anything about it. Few months later, C pulls me aside and shows me her Snapchat messages with K and, lo and behold, there's incriminating stuff on there. There's messages going all the way back to barely a few weeks after K and N got together. Then she tells me that her and K have had sex multiple times, and they're gonna hook up again soon.\n\nEnter moral dillemma.\n\nN is a nice girl, honestly. I don't think she deserves someone being a fake friend or getting cheated on, let alone both, and I think  someone should tell her ASAP so they can sort things out. On the other hand, it's not my place, is it? Would I be messy and trying to start something? I don't want to ruin a friendship, but I don't want to watch a good person get played like this. I want brutal honesty. I'm stumped.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I exposed it?",

      "description": "So it sounds dumb and corny but hear me out—\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is gonna involve 2 other people, let's call them Chris and Brandon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met this Chris my freshman year of high-school. He already knew Brandon, who was a very close friend of mine, and we hit it off immediately. He was the only person who stuck by me after the shit hit the fan for me that year, and he stayed since. We were basically brothers by the time junior year hits, and I get kicked out of school (apparently it's not okay to bring weed to school but whatever) and we both still stick by each other. We shared everything with each other and did everything together. Hell, we even lost our v's to the same lady (a story for another time).\n\nWhen Chris got his license, we went on trips together all the time even if Brandon wouldn't go. Chris and I could just talk for hours and hours without stopping. We could do virtually anything anywhere and still have a good time.\n\nWe've been arrested together (nothing major, just dumb teen stuff) and have really experienced a lot of life together generally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround his senior year (I got my GED so I was out already) he started getting more into psychedelics. We smoked weed a lot before then, but never wanted to experiment with psychs. He tried acid, and mushrooms fairly frequently but never to an extent that would concern me. Brandon and I did acid with him just once, as well as mushrooms and mushroom tea on multiple occasions. Finally, me and Brandon decided we experienced what we wanted to, so we were good and done with psychs for a long while. Chris didn't feel the same.\n\nHe continued to fry as much as he possibly could. His eyes turned into black holes, and he looked like he had goddamn tuberculosis 24/7. I expressed my worry to him on many occasions, as well as Brandon. We did our best to get him to calm down, but whenever we approached him about it, he'd get extremely defensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, he had enough of us and ghosted us for a year. We were extremely fed up with him, and had no problem with him doing this, but continued to worry about him. We'd see him around sometimes, and be relieved he's at least still alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit later on he contacted us again (I should add the three of us were in a band) to see about jamming. We were all for it, and he seemed like he matured a bit and kinda got his head in the right place. We set a date, and he came on over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe jammed for a couple minutes and he continued asking if we wanted to drop acid with him. We declined over and over again, and he got fed up and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlah blah blah he ghosted us again, then he was back.\n\nAfter he contacted us the last time, he announced he's having a son with someone he had a one-night-stand with. I hoped this would urge him to become more mature and get his shit together, but of course not. He became super into painkillers and pills in general. A couple of weeks ago, he swallowed a handful of Valium and downed an entire bottle of Smirnoff. He was in the hospital for two days and almost died. He claimed he was \"just tryna get fucked up\". **He has a goddamn son.** \n\nA couple days ago Brandon and I were kicking it as we do every Monday to catch the new episode of Arrow. He messaged us, asking what we were up to. I told him, and he got pissed off and ghosted us again. We decided we had enough. No use worrying about him, we already grieved him long ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow.... **Am I The Asshole for deciding to just let him rot, and never contact him again? Am I The Asshole for completely cutting ties with someone who's been such an important part of my life?**",

He said he really couldn’t give me a higher grade but he’d be willing to let me have a bit more time and he could help me with it. I told him I don’t have any time this week and he said he couldn’t really do much about it then. I told him I wonder how the head of year would feel about him always staring at me and then asking me to stay after school with him....\n\nHe said he doesn’t stare at me and he was trying to help. I said yes you do stare at me and it makes me uncomfortable. He said he doesn’t but he’d raise my grade if I didn’t say anything. \n\nWhen I left I actually felt really bad. AITA or does it serve him right because he’s a creep? ",

      "description": "So obviously this was today last year, and obviously we were together at the time but aren't today.\n\nSo about a week or so before Valentine's Day, she and I agree that neither of us will give the other any of the traditional love-day fare, like candy, flowers, etc. Or so she thinks. See, I did this knowing that I was still intent on bringing her flowers by surprise. It'd be like a whole thing where she wouldn't have to get me anything just as some extra proverbial cake icing, but still got flowers. Good boyfriend brownie points, right? \n\nThought wrong.\n\nI see her a couple times that day before it's time to spring the trap, so to speak.we get into some non- argument where she messed up. I understand that may sound like a smear given we're no longer dating, but she actually agreed after I called her out that it was her bad. That made her feel bad, I think, even though I didn't hold on to it. She was my girl, and it was Valentine's Day. Either way, probably all the more reason to cheer her up with some surprise flowers, right?\n\nThought wrong.\n\nI bring her the flowers, orchids. She goes from kinda down to visibly upset. She proceeds to go on a big spiel about how it was wrong of me to not tell her about it. Wish I could give details, but alas, it was a year ago. I have one dumb caveman question to you:\n\nWhy thought wrong?",

      "description": " \n\nEnglish is not my first language, so pls try to ignore the grammer error.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory is that I once had a relationship with a Girl called Terra, although we broke up it wasn´t hard to stay friends.  \nOne year passes and she introduced me to a friend (psycho gf). Me and psycho hit it off and after a while came together.  \nThe first few months were pretty fun, but after 4 months things got a little wierd. She forced me to cut contact with my friends and forced me to be diffrent, what I was wearing and what I was doing in my free time, she even tried to keep me away from my family, cuz she wanted me all for herself.  \nthrough the whole relationship i had to put up with her wierd phases and the whole \"I will break up with you, if you don´t do as I say\" shit.\n\nOne day she acted like she wanted to break up, again, same old story. I told psycho that it´s over for real and that I don´t want to put up with this shit anymore.\n\nTerra was psychos best friend, so psycho went to her that night, but I didn´t know.  \nTerra said that she heard that I broke up with psycho and wanted me to come over, which i did.\n\nOnce I arrived, terra and I hit it of again, what I didn´t know was that psycho wanted to see what I will do, once I´m there, she was hiding in the next room, so I wouldn´t notice her.\n\nAt one point I needed to go to the bathroom and there she was crying. I was fucking confused, why was she watching us?\n\nI just laughed, because I didn´t know what to do.\n\nShe was screaming and was hit me while asking I was thinking doing something like that.\n\nI took my clothing and went outside to smoke a cigarette.\n\nTerra joined me and asked me to leave, I agreed and l left.  \nPsycho was devastated that I sleeped with her best friend at the same day I broke up with her.  \nPsycho would call and text me, about how many guys she was banging and that she didn´t care for me any more...that went on for months.  \nSo I started to go out with terra again, but I didn´t like her more than a friend.  \nPsycho saw us every day, because terra and here went to the same college and I wasn´t working far from them.  \nTerra and psycho were fighting every single because of what was going on.\n\nI told Terra that I wasn´t really interested in her and that we should return to being friends,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth hate gut now.",

My parents are divorced, was a small kid, no FatherFigure for good while, mom remarried to good guy. Father remarried too. Had JointCustody of us\n\nHe’s an asshole; didnt know then, had strong habit of defaming my family. Always about money, activly dismissing moms finances by saying child support reason we were well off. 300$ both of us. Claiming, moms car, house, food, &amp; clothes on my back we only because of him. I know its absurd now. Many, (can’t stress enough)MANY cases of this. Lots manipulation, tactics like,”.so you don’t want me as a dad..i bet youd do it if I was Pedro(stepfather).. cloths on back Etc\n\nConstant, his/her fault 4divorce.As a kid made me developed a sense of mistrust 4 my parents, &amp; a heavy sense of guilt that Ive carried to this day.(I know it’s not my fault, but I’ve felt like it’s my fault for 18 yearsNot gonna change overnight\n\nGrew tired of lies, manipulation, attitude, the lack of a loving parent. when I finally turned18 I was in a position where Icould legally decide for myself if I wanted to see him or not. I avoid him\n\nOneDay he drives down2confront me, begins with“I havent paid your child support because you havent seen me” Coolly,“you haven’t paid because I’m 18, you’re lying to me”Was first time I retaliated, I was okay telling him to fuckoff\n\nHe grabs my shirt, “you don’t talk to me that way when I put this shirt on you”. I slapped his hand and said, “go fuck yourself” Shocked, no one ever stood up to him. Seconds were hours\n\n“So you don’t want me as your dad then\n\n“I never did, I don’t want to see you again, the next time I see your face will be when you’re in a coffin. Now get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you like I should have a long time ago”\n\nHe left\n\nFast forward 2years Ive had a hard time making family understand. I made my mind. But mom and sister insist there is something wrong with me, that the problems that I’m facing now, (depression, anxiety, ADHD), result from my bad relationship with him.\n\nIve always felt this way tho, it was undiagnosed,&amp;untreated for years\n\nToday my sister calls me full of tears, asking why I won’t speak 2 dad. (Obviously he said things to her), No need to justify, Its my decision. Mom calls me and lists people who have had it worse, (physical abuse, abandonment, drugs)and still love their fathers\n\nMy reply“it’s terrible that it happened to them, but they decided to love their dads, I didn’t. Just because someone has it worse, it doesn’t make my problems any less valid; if they wanted their dads in their life, good for them. If I didn’t, good for me. I’ve tried to explain this to you many times, but I will not try again, now I will tell you, if you don’t like it, too fucking bad, I don’t care what you think about my relationship with my dad. Maybe I’ll regret it, maybe I won’t. But as of today, I’m very happy with my decision”\n\nAsshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA for not wanting to forgive my brother &amp; for backing out of a trip that has already been paid for?",
      "description": "I am the only girl among my sibs of 4 and the youngest.\n\nIn the summer, I went travelling with my aunt and her family. When I arrived at our home country, I had my brother pick me up from the airport. On our way home, we were talking about my trip when my brother asked me if my cousins (who i was travelling with) do their obligatory prayers (we’re Muslims). Feeling like it was not my place to answer, I told him I don't want to talk about it. He immediately took it as a no and started talking shit about my cousins how they don’t pray and probably drank alcohol behind their parents' back. I didn’t want to hear his accusations and refused to participate in his conversation so I pretended to sleep (bad move).\n\nThis made him pissed off, so he suddenly sped up the car at an alarming speed and started calling me stupid, that i make a big deal out of everything cuz his qn wasn’t a big deal and that I treat him like shit even though he is my older brother. I didn’t say anything. Moments later, he shouted to get my attention and said “when im really pissed off, i won’t hesitate to raise my hand (ie he would hit me)”\n\nBtw, when arguing in our language, esp the word stupid in his tone, it’s a really really horrible insult and packs a lot of weight.\n\nHe started bringing up all my wrongdoings in the past like the many times i raised my voice at my mom (i also know i was wrong most times and I've apologised number of times &amp; definitely before my parents left for Hajj. ofc he didn't know this) and that one time, I wont let him use my mirror (long story). At this point, I was shocked and I wasn’t able to properly think. So I replied by blurting out his mistakes and he tried to justify them and was being passive aggressive.\n\nThen he stopped by his fiancee’s place to pick up his things and left me in the car with the engine off and took the keys with him. I called my parents who were doing their Hajj in KSA &amp; when my parents wanted to speak to him, he told them i was stupid &amp; had the audacity to shift the focus on me by saying how rude i was to our mom before. Middle of the call, he said how he won’t hesitate to drive the car towards the wall so we would die. I’ve already started crying and was screaming like a crazy person in front of his fiancee, fiancee’s dad and brother. Somehow his fiancee convinced him to stay so I can drive myself home.\n\nWhen I got home, there were these texts he left in our family group chat, calling me a fat cunt, that the next time he sees me, he’ll beat me up, etc. He also said he was happy to see me crying, cuz if he couldn’t hit me physically, at least he had the satisfaction of making me cry. He tried to play hero to my mom that if i ever raise my voice at her, he’ll slap the shit out of me for her.\n\nExcept he isn’t perfect either, he has had anger tantrums that hurt my mom badly, barely around to help my parents whenever we have house events (when he does, he does the minimum) and always takes his time that we are always late for anything. He also spends most of his time at his fiancee’s that my mom is constantly asking when he’ll come home. When our maternal grandmother passed away, he didn’t come home &amp; when my parents came home from Hajj, he wasn't around to welcome them and all the relatives were asking where he was cuz it wasn't proper. Also, he is unemployed for over 4 years since graduating from uni cuz he didn’t want to have a job related to his field, wants easy money, leeches off my parents and brother. All my other brothers talk shit about him all the time cuz of his lazy ass. We are all concerned for him and even before this, I used to cook or buy food just so he could have a hearty meal instead of letting him eat instant noodles. He would sometimes ask me to get him something and promised to pay me back, but he never did. \n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago, my parents were planning to go somewhere this Dec and asked if I would like to come with so I said yeah sure. Afterwards, my mom said dad also wants to bring the brother who hurt me and asked if it was ok. Still feeling hurt, I didn’t say anything and left the room. Later on, I was told that my dad had bought the tickets &amp; that this trip is supposed to be for us to reconcile. Apparently, my mom had been texting him and asked him to apologise to me (he is staying with his fiancee). He said that he wants to and that he’s not like that anymore. So my mom pleaded that we talk and forgive each other and I just agreed to get her off my back.\n\nMy mother is really upset that her children are fighting and I really don’t want to upset her any further. Thing is the wound is still so fresh for me and I am still triggered every time I read something on reddit or books about a similar situation. I can’t imagine going a week-long trip where I have to be close to him so I am now thinking of backing out. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not being an adult and sucking it up, and further upsetting my mom for not wanting to make up and would I be the asshole for backing out of a trip that is already paid for that is meant for us to reconcile? ",

She didn’t respond and I’m worried I upset her. I feel really bad, but I’m really not up to hosting a guest, let alone someone I haven’t talked to in 8 years.

As part of my job I have to work in an office 70% of the time with one other operator a few lab techs for paperwork. I make great money but I feel like the odd man out because I work with two black people and three hispanics. My boss is one of the hispanics and is one of the greatest dudes ive met, really hard worker and a good guy, but everyone else is extremely lazy and imo unprofessional but my boss is too much of a \"nice guy\" to do anything about it.\n\nSo anyway,the two black guys and two other hispanic guys single me out for racial talk. At first it was mild like \"I bet you cant handle spicy foods\" and \"Can you jump?\". Like stereotypical stuff that maybe is just a joke but still makes me feel kinda on the outs since they dont seem to do it to eachother. I play along though.\n\nWell now theyre getting more nasty with stuff like \"You know why X has never been pulled over? Because hes white.\" Even though i have been pulled over. \"X you realize that you dont have work as hard as me to get ahead.\"\n\nThat offends me the most because its like you dont even know me or my life but youre saying I have it easy. I know for a fact that the person saying this was born into a wealthier upper midfle class family on the east coast because he told us, whereas i grew up in a bad area in detroit.\n\nPlus he had a college degree with a college fund and i could never go to college. Hes a lab tech and hes basically saying \"You see where I am? Ya I got here above you through adversity because im brown, and youre below me even though you have privledge.\" It seems like hes saying hes somehow better than me. Like he had obstacles and i didnt.\n\nThen I say that I have no \"privledge\" and that you guys are just singling me out because of my race. I call him a racist and he says that brown people cant be racist.\n\nIf it were up to me we wouldnt even be speaking about this bullshit but for some reason they have to come at me like this all the fucking time. My boss doesnt stop it and i dont want to be a snitch.\n\nNow since the fight another says that I am a racist. I ask him why. He says just from hearing my words. I ask him what words. He says just in general. I tell him to fuck off and storm out. My boss calls me later and i have a bitch fest. He understands my anger but thinks i should just ignore it. I hate going into work now.\n\nSo whose the asshole?",

Full disclosure, I usually **do** make out food at the same time, just because I’m normally the first one up. \n\nAnyway, I went and sat on the couch and started eating, (nothing fancy. I ate broccoli, eggs, and cheese toast), and he literally poured at me, and whined, “*You didn’t make me none?*” I told him I was planning on making his food after he got off the game, or close to it so it wouldn’t be cold. He literally *stuck his bottom lip out*, got all sullen, and was like “no, never mind.” It was so ridiculous to see a grown man pouting over something so small, I laughed. \n\nWhich caused him to get upset saying I was being rude and inconsiderate and making fun of his feelings. Then he announced he was going to go *buy* something to eat and stormed out. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Edit: New post with the correct amount of characters. \n\nI'm an aspiring writer, I've finished several short stories, one of which is being adapted for audio drama, and one novel manuscript which I've been sending to literary agencies for nearly a year now. I've mostly had rejections but I've recently had some luck with manuscript requests. The publishing industry is fucking difficult to break into, I'm under no illusion that I'll be published or even get an agent. It's a game of patience. I wouldn't dream of telling other people to not write because everyone should be allowed to explore and express their creativity, no matter what your language abilities are.\n\nBasically, I have a friend who wants to be a professional writer. We've been friends since we were teenagers (we are in our late 20s) s but she's always been a bit manic. She gets these flights of fancies and grand ideas that she usually doesn't follow through. We're both Swedish, but I've spent most of my life living abroad in English speaking countries, did half my Education and my university degree in English, I've been working and living the UK for eight years. I've spoken English since I was four years old and am a native speaker. She isn't. Her spoken and written English is very basic.\n\nShe's been writing a book in English for a while and every now and again she sends it to me to read which I'm grateful for. The story itself is an okay premise but the plot doesn't always make sense and the quality of the language is really poor. I've been helping her edit, pointing out how to structure it a bit and with some grammar. She's never been good at taking feedback or constructive criticism and at school, she was difficult to work with. She sent the novel to one of her friends who read it and called her \"the next JK Rowling\". After this, she has been convinced that she's going to make it in publishing and has been wanting to send the unfinished manuscript to literary agencies in both Sweden and the UK/US. She had convinced herself that they were going to take the unfinished script and she would have a bestseller on her hand.\n\nI tried telling her patiently that it takes time getting into publishing, that most authors don't get a bestseller with their first debut novel and she wouldn't listen. I then told her it's a bad idea to send out an unfinished novel, that hasn't been edited and that's written in a language that visibly isn't your mother-tongue and that it in all likelihood will not be picked up or even read by agencies. She didn't like this at all, told me I was being unsupportive and basically a bad friend.\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "First post here, on mobile, and English is not my first language. Long post with tl;dr at bottom.\n\nSo to begin, I was in the market for a smartwatch - but I hate paying full price for a new gadget that would get outdated anyways in a year, and so I decided to go and seek a secondhand smartwatch (e.g., from eBay, Craigslist, etc.)  I also decided to ask around in my friends groups, and lo and behold one of my buddies had a smartwatch in the exact make/model/year that I was seeking. \n\nI bought the smartwatch from my friend, who claimed that he hasn’t used it for some time, and that it had been sitting on top of his drawer unused, as he prefers more traditional watches.  We agreed on a price that was good for both of us (and I threw in a couple of dollars as well, as I thought it was a good deal.) \n\nAfter a few days, I decided that although having a smartwatch WAS nice, it was not something I absolutely needed, and decided to re-sell it. (I asked the friend I bought it from if it was okay, and he said, ‘Sure, alright,”) Figuring that it was okay as I paid good money for the watch (I assumed it was mine completely.) \n\nI post it on an mobile online selling application, at around 40$ more than I bought it for, and I sold it within a few hours. Prior to this, I posted the listing on my social media in case my friends were interested. Several hours after I shipped the watch to my buyer, the friend texted me, (most likely seeing that I sold the watch) upset that I sold his watch after giving me a good deal on it. Of course, being the good friend that I am, I offered him the profit from the sale (although I feel as though I shouldn’t have, I’m just a nice guy.) I do feel a little bad, but feel as though I didn’t do anything wrong, so AITA? (He hasn’t responded to my offer about me giving him my profits yet.)\n\ntl;dr - Bought a smartwatch from a friend who didn’t need it, decided I didn’t need it either and flipped it. Friend is upset that I sold it and profited, even though I told him I would. \n\n",

Most of the time he plays a few short scales and brings out his music to practice. Of course, this is for practice, and it isn't going to sound good.\n\nSome people approached my friend and told him to get off. He has no idea if they play piano. They told him to get off the piano because the piano in the metro is for the audience (metro users) and you should be playing nice sounding music, not practicing. They said that it was not pleasant to listen to (he was just playing scales). \n\nHe explained his situation to them and they got into an argument.

      "description": "I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible without leaving out any relevant details and hopefully not in a biased way. Anyway: \n\nLately I've been interacting a lot with a guy who has been making me very uncomfortable, but it's hard to tell if he's malicious or just overly friendly, and if I'm not imagining things. I usually pass by his house on my way to class, and a few weeks ago he was getting his mail when I walked by and said hello. Nothing out of the ordinary; I said hi back and that was it. This happened a couple more times that week, but again I didn't see it as abnormal.\n\nThe next week he showed up during my shift at the coffee shop I work at. Not weird in itself, but conversing with him I was getting kind of an odd vibe from the guy. *Slightly* creepy. Plus the fact that he'd never been in there before weirded me out. He came in again a few more times that week and the week after, sort of developing a routine of coming in on my shift. At that point I was starting to get a bit more concerned, because it seemed like he was actually trying to see me as much as possible, but even then I figured it could be fairly innocuous. Or at worst, he was interested in me, and I could just turn him down. But still, no huge cause for alarm I guess. \n\nI didn't see him at work or on my way to/from class at all the next week, so I kinda thought the whole thing was over. But it wasn't, because three times that week I spotted his car in very weird places; once in the parking lot outside the building I had class in, and outside the school library, and once driving through an intersection that I was walking a block away from. \n\nSo I was feeling somewhat freaked out about this when he eventually did come for coffee at my work again. I initially avoided him, but then I straight up told him (in as discreet a way as possible) that his attention was making me uncomfortable, that I'd seen his car in weird spots, and that I felt like he was stalking me. Yes, I actually used that word. He did not react well to being accused of that, said he was just being friendly, and basically called me crazy and made a huge scene, and stormed out. \n\nDoes it sound like I'm being crazy? AITA for jumping to conclusions, or do I have reason to be concerned?\n\ntl;dr I feel like I'm being stalked. Might be jumping to huge conclusions over nothing.",

      "description": "So I went to a bar close to my house that I occasionally visit to have a few drinks after work. The night was going well. I ended up talking with a cute girl for awhile and she gave me her number. Things were chill and so was I. \n\nWell, girl has to go home cause it’s getting late, but I still have another one in me and stick around. In walks a group of four and they sit at the bar next to me. Nothing out of the ordinary. But then begins the great stink. Dude next to me farts, but doesn’t stop at one. He farts again and again. I could have moved, but I had a seat at the bar that I didn’t want to lose. \n\nThen I get pissed from his stank. I tell him to quit farting that it’s disgusting and fucking rude. That was enough to make he and his friends walk out. \n\nThen the bartender gets super pissed at me. She rants about not shaming people for farting and making her customers leave. She literally sits down right next to me and chews me out about this. I just gave her a stone cold stare. Then I tell her it’s rude for people to be doing that shit. She yells some more then goes back behind the bar. \n\nI wasn’t kicked out, but she was super pissed. Thankfully I had closed out already, so I finished my drink and left.  ",

I just wasn't all that thrilled at how it went down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy (24M) girlfriend (20F) and I have been dating for 2 years. We do everything together, and we both get along perfectly with each-other's families. She and her family have been talking about taking a special vacation within the next couple months to celebrate my girlfriend's sister (17F) going to college next year. They have been throwing around ideas like going to Disney World or Universal Studios and spending a few days in Florida. My girlfriend gave me some dates and asked me which ones worked best for me. The next day we all sat down and actually made some plans. We decided on going to Disney and I even had some input on the planning. The very next day i get a text from my gf telling me i need to ask her sister if i'm allowed to come to Disney with them. It would have been me, my gf, her sister, and their mom all going on this trip. I get along just fine with her sister and her mom, so I had no idea why anyone would have a problem with me going. She then told me that her mom had already booked everything; the flights, the hotels, and she purchased all their tickets. I would have paid for my own stuff obviously, but I would have thought if they wanted me to go, they would have gotten my tickets since it would be easier. I was 100% sure i was going on this trip with them since we ALL were talking about it the night before. I asked my gf why she didn't ask about getting my ticket while they got theirs. She told me her mom said it was a girls trip and if I wanted to go I would have to ask my gf's sister since it was technically her trip. My gf also told me they would be able to add me to their hotel room if I did end up going, but I dont even feel like asking if I im allowed to go since I was clearly left out of the discussion and now it feels like I was never meant to be invited in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling left out of the vacation when it seemed clear i would be going? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Parking is at a premium on the streets immediately around my house because this one guy usually has 8 - 12 barely running cars parked. If not for him, the parking would be plentiful. As it is, it's a struggle if anyone comes to visit us for them to find parking.\n\nThe area is clearly zoned for residential, not business, and I'd bet dollars to donuts that this guy is unlicensed (not sure what the rules are on this though) and probably taking cash under the table. It's occurred to us that there are probably mechanisms by which we could report the business to zoning board, IRS, the City, etc.  \n\n\nBut WIBTA if I did? I'm sure this guy's been doing this for years and suddenly white people are moving in and causing problems.

The court ordered me to pay a set amount of child support a month. I pay it. She carries health insurance and pays for day care. I just pay the court ordered amount that lines up with my income. \n\nAbout a year ago he started having seizures. Some of them lasted a long time which led to some hospitalizations. That led to a host of appts at specialist and she took a leave from work to deal with it all. \n\nI work erratic hours and go to college so although I visited him at the hospital a few times.  I couldn’t make it to the appts. \n\nThe medical bills came rolling in and she asked me to help. I don’t have any more money so I told her no. She asked me to watch him sometimes so she could go back to work and make up some hours so she could pay the bills. I told her to get a babysitter. She said she couldn’t afford one. I can’t see him during the week because of my school schedule and work schedule so I told her no. The court order says nothing about medical bills and me having to pay half. \n\nNow she wants to enroll him in some kind of summer camp for kids with epilepsy because she said sending him to a regular daycare is hard since they often don’t know how to deal with his seizures. She asked if I could at least help pay for some of it. Even a small portion. Again, I’ve no money so I said no. \n\nNow she wants to be in a medical trial for the seizures but the doctor won’t let her in unless he can meet with me but he can only meet with me during the week. They are claiming it is because there are overnights involved. I am busy then. I also think the study isn’t necessary. Medicine is controlling them mostly. \n\nI am poor college student. I just don’t have the money. She says I am an asshole for only paying the bare minimum and never helping out more. My argument is that I pay child support as ordered and I take my every other weekend. I do my part. I do what is required. I am not her partner anymore and I don’t think it is my job to help her out.

So for some back story my girlfriend and i have been dating for 4 years. Her family is meh, but i love them. One of them in particular is her sister who annoys me to no end. She is one of those complainer types, who always talks over you, and is never wrong.\n\nFor example, while driving her to a bowling ally she was telling me how shit of a driver i am b.c i turned left just before a card was coming for a somewhat close call. And stated, \"even im a better driver than that. \" Keep in mind she is 26 and at that point only had her license for 5 months and i had been driving for years. Almost 10.\n\nSo with that out of the way for context my girlfriend planned a trip to Disney world with just her and her sister. Cool... I thought. I take care of my autistic sister who cant go. So i say fine. Enjoy you trip and i offer some money for a good time and some goodies for their way back. Well, just this week i find out, not only does my girlfriend want me to pick her sister up from the airport, thursday, she wants me to drive them around town, sleep on the couch while they sleep on the bed them get up Friday morning at 4am to drive them to the airport. Both girls have cars, can drive and the only way i can take them is to make sure my autistic sister who isnt up until 7am to be up early to drive them. I told gf id pay for uber or lift, and she says \" i dont want hurt. \"\n\nAm i fucking crazy, or am i the asshole here?\n\nOther needed background knowledge. Gf family left her here in Ohio with me and her sister could just drive 3 hours here but is requesting i pick her up b.c she wants to fly instead.\n\nSister never says thank you. And has even complajned about me taking a bottle of water from her 24 pk case one time.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR - girlfriends and her sister expect me to drive them around all day and do multiple pick up and drop off during ungodly hours for their trip im not even going on.

      "description": "Long post, most of it is background information... TL;DR at the end. \n\n I have this coworker/close friend, that I have been helping out for a while. His truck broke down once, and I was his ride to practically everywhere he needed to go, and I only asked for gas once or twice. He fixed his truck, everything goes back to normal.\n\nHis truck breaks down again not a week after and I'm back to taking him everywhere. Now, I actually don't mind any of this. We got really close, and get along very well. Plus I'd drag him along to random things I didn't want to do alone anyways. So I thoroughly enjoy his company.\n\n\nHe's also been having money issues, and I've bought him food and drinks countless times. The days he's had money, he has bought me food and drinks so I don't feel like he's ever really taken advantage of me. \n\n\nOne day, I was trying to get his attention, and threw a metal thing at him, missed, and hit his laptop screen. It scraped the screen the tiniest bit and we got in a big fight over it, I appologized and felt super bad, and I told him i'd never touch his computer again.\n\n\nFast foward to yesterday, and I was getting ready to leave for school and I texted my friend if she rented out a computer for me at my school (I can't rent one out for myself because I turned one in late once and I am no longer allowed to rent out any equipment) She said she didn't and I panicked. I needed to use an app to take an online quiz, and my laptop is apparently not compatible with the schools system, so using mine is out of the picture. I'm telling him all of this and ask to use his. He says no, and I start to beg him for it. Telling him I wouldn't ask if he wasn't my last resort. I told him I needed it for an hour to take a quiz but he wasn't changing his mind.\n\n\nAfter that I got up, and told him that after everything i've done for him, I couldn't believe he wouldn't let me use his laptop for an hour, for a quiz I needed to take. I told him it was *fine* and that I would take a 0, and I left. \n\n\nHe texted me telling me he was going to let me use it but that I left. I responded with \"I shouldn't have to beg you for something like that anyways\" and haven't talked to him since. He's tried talking to me, but I haven't responded.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR : AITA for not talking to someone over them not letting me borrow their laptop I accidently damaged after the constant favors I've been doing for them for months.",

      "description": "This happened a while ago during the Christmas holiday. I came home to my parents' for the first time in 3 months and find the family dog with a HUGE, baseball sized oozing lump on her chest. Bloody and sore. I freak out a little but my parents tell me it's 'fine' and that it doesn't seem to be bothering her. I'm not convinced though and I start asking about emergency vet appointments, but they get annoyed and tell me it's 'taken care of' and she has a biopsy in 3 weeks time. They're visibly annoyed that I won't shut up about it so I stop hassling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 weeks seems like a ridiculously long time away for something so horrific. It was making an odour and I was concerned about infection. I secretly call the vet to try and make an emergency appointment but they say there's nothing they can do before christmas (in 2 days) so I decide to hold out until then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dog is, admittedly, fine. She's acting completely normal, despite this mountain on her chest, aside from licking it and it oozing and bleeding everywhere. Christmas comes and I vent to my grandma that I'm really worried about the dog. She knows the vet personally so manages to get me an appointment for the day after xmas. I take the dog in secret because I don't want to initiate any more arguments with my parents, I just want her seen asap. She gets x-rayed and has the biopsy. He warns me that it's very likely cancerous which upsets me but I understand. Costs me about $800 up front and I pay it. I come home and when my parents realise what I've done, all hell breaks loose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get screamed at for 'going behind their back'. That it's their dog, not mine any more, and it was all under control until I got involved. That I had 'cried' to my grandma and embarrassed the both of them and made out that they were terrible people to the rest of the family. I fought my reasoning but it just fuelled their anger and it turned into a screaming match that I'm sure the neighbours could hear, and then I was blamed for 'ruining christmas'. No matter what I said, I couldn't convince them that I was just concerned about the dog's health, and that i wasn't just trying to publicly shame them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents live in a very small house and there's no real privacy at all so I left before things became aggressive and drove south for 2 hours. Slept that night in my car in -5C (because lord knows i had no money left for a hotel). All the while getting conflicting texts from my parents 'we're sorry this happened, plz come home' to 'youve ruined everything, the dog is warm and happy in our bed despite you not being here'. 9pm the following day I decide to drive back home to try and salvage things, and everyone just acts like it didn't happen, which I'm fine with... The dog has a huge cone of shame on her head which my parents mutter 'unnecessary' every so often. I endure the next 5 days at home for the holidays before finally getting to leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe results have since come back, and we now know she does have cancer, has about 6 months to live, but currently isn't in any severe pain or discomfort, despite this absolutely horrendous lump. My parents haven't tried to pay back the vet expenses, but I'm 80% ok with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know if I messed up. On one hand, I know I don't live there anymore, but that dog is still the family dog that I love very much. I should've told them I was taking her to the vet, but I was worried they would cancel the appointment or something and ruin this chance. I was angry at them for not taking her sooner, but my parents don't have much money at all and I know they wanted to prioritise christmas for me and my brother, seeing as the dog was acting okay at the time, and leave the vet expenses for January. They had been living with the dog looking the way she does for weeks at that point, but I had only just seen it and reacted very hastily because of the shock, I understand. So I really don't know...",

      "description": "So me and my mate are going on a trip to another country as part of the school’s exchange programme. There are quite a few going, and so naturally people must be sorted into groups for different families. A while ago a boy in my class, whom I’m not really friendly with (he’s a bit funny) told us that he’d joined our group to make it a trio. Since we weren’t friends with this boy, we were really annoyed, especially since he didn’t ask us for permission beforehand. So we went to the teacher organising the trip and told her we didn’t want him with us, and how we never gave consent etc. She asked us who he was friends with and we helped her put him in a group with one of his mates. However, my mum found out and now thinks I’m a massive bully and was being unkind to him, is she right or were our actions justified?",

      "description": "I’m (17F) in secondary school and I’ve known this girl who’s in my year for maybe 6 years now. I’m not particularly close to her. We have 3 classes together and we only talk in class about homework and school. Whenever we talk to each other outside of school, it’s just more things about homework and school. What I’m basically saying is that we’re not friends and strictly school mates.\n\nOver the past 2 years, she started asking me for lifts in the morning to school. It can range from asking for lifts for a whole week to just 2-3 lifts every few weeks. I don’t drive, my mom drives me to school because it’s on her way to work and sometimes my dad drives. It’s a 12 minute drive from my house to the school. This girl lives 2-3 minutes away from me and I drive past her housing estate on my way to school. She walks to and from school ever since I’ve known her. It’s a 45 minute walk for me to and from school because I’m slow and don’t walk often but for her it’s takes around 30 minutes because she lives slightly closer to the school and also she walks very fast. \n\nThere are multiple small factors that adds to the reason why I don’t really like giving her lifts in the morning to school. \n\nFirstly the most obvious is that it’s not that I’m driving myself, I have to check with my parents whenever she asks which is a small hassle but it adds to it nonetheless. \n\nSecondly her dad has a car and he is a hundred percent capable of driving her to and from school which he does sometimes so I don’t know why she finds the need to ask me. This is the main reason that annoys me the most.\n\nThirdly, I know this is a petty reason but I don’t really like her? I don’t hate her but she’s not the person I’d like to be around and that’s why despite knowing her for so long, we haven’t become friends. \n\nLastly it adds to my routine in the morning which I don’t need because it’s already a tight fit since my brother also gets dropped off at a different school which starts 30 minutes before mine. \n\nI would definitely give her lifts if the weather is terrible and miserable to walk in because I’m not the devil but when it’s perfectly fine out and she’s in good health, I don’t see why I should have the responsibility of giving her lifts to school? \n\n\n",

      "description": "I (20F) have not lived in my hometown for 4 years now, though I was there for the holidays recently. My brother (22) still lives with our grandparents and is constantly late for his job at a local grocery store; he’ll show up at 4pm if his shift starts at 2pm. He’s been constantly reprimanded for it and he genuinely believed he would never be fired, so he never cared enough to show up on time.\n\nCut to the morning of Christmas Eve. I was baking in my grandma’s kitchen and she asked if my brother had gone to work (it was 10am, he was supposed to be there for 10:30) and I said no, I hadn’t seen him leave. She asked me to wake him up (he constantly has to be woken up because he refuses to buy an alarm clock) and I said no, that wasn’t my responsibility, and he shouldn’t have to be woken up his his sister, or grandmother for that matter, to go to work. She seemed to agree with this, maybe fed up because he’s always late regardless, and left the house to go to her own job. \n\nI did not attempt to wake him up whatsoever, even though I knew he was going to be fired if he was late one more time; I simply carried on with what I was doing because, again, it’s not my responsibility to force my brother to go to his job. I used to have to wake him up all the time in high school just so he could drive me to school, and during my last summer at home, I was guilted into waking him up every morning to go to work just before I went to work. I absolutely hated it, and he’s very rude to the person who wakes him up. \n\nSo, on Christmas Eve, he woke up around 2pm- almost four hours late- and went to work, only to come home a half hour later saying he’d been fired. He was upset and my mother was pissed... at me. She said it was my fault he lost his job because I didn’t wake him up, I should’ve been more sensitive to his needs, etc. \n\nShe texted me again today and asked why I hadn’t apologized to him, and I don’t think I should have to. Am I the asshole here and should I apologize? ",

      "description": "So I am apart of a large discord community and people can right click any profile and personal message like on reddit. One day this guy sees my profile picture and DMs me asking for feet pics. He said it in a memey way so I assumed he was joking. He made it clear later by flirting that he was serious. I immidiately let him know that I was not comfortable sending him pics, that I was not gay, and that I was in a relationship. I thought nothing of it other than he swung and missed. He asked me what games I played and made small talk. Later he kept messaging me wanting to buy me things and the flirting became more overt and kept asking and I kept denying. Finally one night he got drunk and was begging me again so I hatched a plan to have him send me a code for a game then block him. This is exactly what happened. So AITA?",

So X was trying to splash me with pen ink so as a revenge I took his eraser and threw it in the garbage bin. We then tried to make peace so I went and tried to take the eraser out of the garbage. Thing is, it was pretty gross so I needed a napkin. Well guess what, no one had a napkin. So, I went to my other friend's desk, Y, and took a random paper that he had on the desk, I'll admit it, without permission. I take the eraser out of thw garbage and then I see Y coming. He is extremely angry. He first pushes me into the wall. I don't react. Then, I go back to my desk, he comes after me and breaks my pen. I still don't react. Then I figured out we were even so I ask him \"Are we even now? And he screams \"No, you idiot\" and proceeds to punch me in the stomach. Hard. At this point, I couldn't help myself and I slap him back as powerful as I can. And then he just stops.\n\n\nSo... AITA for slapping my friend?",

      "description": " TL;DR My coworker and friend has neglected the disgusting stairwells for 6 months and now I have to clean it because we have an inspection this week!\n\nMy friend and I both work in the same apartment building and are given weekly chores to complete in the building. One of them is sweeping and spot mopping the front and back stairwells. I do it on Tuesday and he does it on Saturday. I figured it would only makes sense if I did the front one and he did the back one. I spent an hour sweeping up hair and dust and then mopping the front stairwell and have been continuously maintaining it for months now. He, however, hasn't even touched the back stairwell in over 6 months. I even had to spot mop it once myself because it was getting so dirty. He simply felt it didn't need done because it didn't look dirty. I also live here and see these stairs every day. They are FILTHY. There's coffee spatters on the landings and leaves, dirt, and wrappers all over the stairs. Not to mention, a buildup of dust and dog hair.\n\nI asked him nicely once if we could please work together in doing the stairs and requested that he do the back stairwell. He said he didn't think they needed done and that I shouldn't be the one telling him to do it since I have no authority over him. I layed off and didn't say anything for weeks. Then he finally acknowledged that they were in fact getting really dirty and they need done. Well, despite that, he STILL hasn't done them and it's been weeks since he said that.\n\nToday, I was informed by my manager that we have a building inspection and asked that the weekday monitors clean around the building including the stairwells. My friend doesn't work until the weekend so he's exempt from having to do any of this. So, now me or the other guy has do to the back stairwell that he's been neglecting for 6+ months. It'll more than likely be me though since the other guy during the week does a lot of work already and I feel bad expecting him to do it. But I am so fucking PISSED that I have do this. It takes me over an hour of sweeping up 7 floors of dust and hair that flies up everywhere and then mopping after all that. This is fucking unfair that I should have to do this when I have been doing the front stairwell regularly. AND now that someone else will end up cleaning it this week, he'll then be exempt from doing it for another 6 months because it will already be clean.\n\nHe's such a lazy fucking worker and this is all so much harder because we're also friends and I don't want to strain our relationship because of work conflict. Am I really being the asshole here? Am I just expecting too much of him as coworkers?",

      "description": "This is a very silly matter, but I started feeling like I was an asshole and I want to be sure whether I was or wasn't.\n\nI work at a civil court, which is basically office-work on a legal environment. As we approach our two week long Christmas Recess, lawyers gift us cheap stuff like pens or calendars as a form of showing goodwill. Every year, a particular firm gifts all female clerks cheap chocolate, and male clerks get cheap wine. Since I don't drink alcohol, I always trade my wine with someone's chocolate.\n\nLast year, I traded mine with someone I don't particularly care about, and one of my coworkers who I mostly get along with was sad that I didn't trade with her. I told her, \"I promise next year I'll trade with you\". So, next year arrived and today we got the same cheap chocolates and wine once again. I went to the coworker I promised last year, and when I said \"so, shall we trade your chocolate for my wine\", she dryly answered \"no\", while looking at me as if it was offensive I even asked.\n\nI thought nothing about it and traded the wine with the same person as last year, who was very happy about it (I think she's kind of a wino). I got my chocolate, she got her wine, everyone is happy, no assholes here, right? But suddenly, the coworker who said \"no\" comes to me and says \"I didn't realize you were talking about *that* wine. I do want to trade my chocolate!\", to which I replied \"I'm sorry, but since you said you didn't want to trade, I already traded with another person\".\n\nShe, a mid-forties woman, started to pout and say this wasn't fair. That I promised her we'd trade this year. That I should have waited to see if she really wanted instead of running off to trade with another person right away. Now I can hear her badmouthing me to other clerks who are her friends, and most seem to think this is incredibly silly. One of them even offered to buy her better wine, but she said it wasn't the same. She then put her chocolates on my desk and very loudly said I can keep them even though I gave her nothing.\n\nI know I probably shouldn't feel guilty, but she made such a scene that I can't help but think it was assholish of me not waiting to see if she would change her mind (from the moment we got our gifts until I traded with the other person, it was about 10 minutes). The wine is worth, converting currency, $5. The chocolates are worth $2.\n\nSo, was I an asshole because I took her \"no\" at face value and didn't wait for a change of heart?",

      "title": "AITA For ignoring my dad and stepmom for Christmas?",
      "description": "Sorry for the long post, but I figure enough people will say \"well he's family\" that I want to be understood clearly.\n\nThere is a lot I can say about my dad, but I'll start out by saying he has never been physically abusive, just neglectful all my life. I literally didn't meet him until I was seven years old.\n\nHe left when I was six months old and stole all my mom's valuables, used that money to go to Oklahoma and lead my mom on for five years claiming he was working a good job and would take care of her and I soon and pay her back (spoiler: he was sleeping on his sister's couch and working at a water park). \n\nOut of his two kids (me and my older sister, different moms), he's abandoned both of us then come back into our lives trying to play the \"Good Christian Father\" routine.\n\nHe met a drug addict woman who lost all but 1 of her kids, married her, and has done the Christian Man act for the past 15 or so years, being a good father to her son while he would drunkenly yell at my older sister to the point she has gone no contact with him several times, until he finds her phone number again to yell at her about how she should try harder to see him (she lives 2 states away and has three kids).\n\nTo keep this short, here's a list of things my dad has done to me/people I love:\n\n- Promised to take me places to get me to visit him, then said they were too expensive (for example, this ranges from a trip to movies to taking me to Broadway show, knowing I'm a Broadway geek)\n\n- Tried to guilt trip for not visiting him enough (even though its as simple as calling to ask if I wanted to come over? As a kid I was so used to him not being around it rarely occurred to me to ask to go over)\n\n- Has spelled my name right exactly ONCE my entire life (on the birth certificate), he has me on Facebook and can see he's misspelling it, but makes no move to even try and spell it right\n\n- This one is petty, but he gives me lotion every Christmas even though I've told him, as politely as I can, that I'm allergic to most lotions (because they use fragrance). He continues to do so because his wife gets them free from her job at a women's shelter\n\n- Wouldn't talk to my older sister when she was dating a woman, but is willing to talk with her now cuz it was clearly a \"phase\" (she's bisexual, it doesn't change if she's in a relationship with a man or not)\n\n- Attends a church that hates gay people to the point of preaching for a half hour about how the gays stole the rainbow, raised my stepbrother to be bigoted against gays (I am gay, and it's a case of I'm not out to him, but my older sister has told me he knows, since I'm not closed about it)\n\n- My Grandpa was paralyzed from the neck down and put in his care, and even after grandpa pleased and cried about nightmares from constantly being nude, dad refused to dress him or even put him in some boxers (just covered him with a blanket), so he'd feel better. \n\n- Dad ruined the last moments I had with my grandpa by screaming at him for saying 1 inappropriate comment \n\n- I work nights and am nocturnal, he knows this but refuses to accept it. Last time I visited he put me in my step brothers room (stepbrother had moved out), and locked the dog in with me at 9 pm, telling me not to let the dog out. I went to sleep at 5 am and woke up at 9 with Dad yelling at me to get ready for church and the dog humping my leg.\n\n- Didn't tell me my grandpa was having a second funeral in Arlington, denying me the chance to attend it\n\n- I take care of my little sister and consider her my daughter, my dad told me that I should leave her with my grandma and focus on myself, because I don't want to end up like my mom. I had to resist the urge to tell him that I have no plans on repeating his \"legacy\".\n\nWhich takes us to recently, when, after not contacting me for the second funeral and pretending I don't exist for six months, he starts calling like crazy and texting that he has Christmas presents for me (aka trash he got from his wife's job).\n\nI tried to ignore him, and that freaked his wife out enough that she went around my apartments knocking on my neighbor's doors trying to find me (luckily my neighbor's don't know me due to the nocturnal thing), and even went to my job asking when I work next, and was refused because obviously an employer won't give out that info (I find it funny too, she literally said \"C'mon, it's my daughter!\" and my manager told her \"If it's your daughter, shouldn't you already know?\")\n\nShe even called my uncles and cousins to the point that I gave in, and told her I broke my phone that's why I missed her calls, and agreed to meet her on Tuesday to receive presents. \n\nI'm just really creeped out by how stalkerish they became when I ignored them, even though their fine ignoring me for the majority of the year. I really don't want anything to do with them, but when I ignored them everyone in my family kept telling me to be the better person and just meet with them once so they'll go back to ignoring me.\n\nSo, tl;dr - AITA if I ignore my dad, after he's spent the majority of my life ignoring me?\n",

      "description": "So to start here is a little backstory, a few years ago my mom met a guy that was really into motorcycles and they started talking and eventually dating, turns out he was apart of a motorcycles gang. She hid this from me until 6 months after them dating. He decided to take us to a baseball game, on the way back he almost passed out driving 3 or 4 times almost running off the road. At that point my mom came clean about how he was in a motorcycle gang and cooks heroin for them. It also turned out he was doing heroin during the baseball game in the bathroom. At this point I wasn't a big fan of him and started seeing more and more red flags such as manipulation and guilt tripping her. This goes on for another few months until he leaves my mom for another girl and gets married to her some time after, my mom was devastated. She then gets over him but, some nights when him and his wife got into fights he would call my Mom and tell her how he fucked up. Flash forward a year later, he has been clean of heroin and relapsed 2 times since then. His wife divorced him and eventually my mom had enough of this being the shoulder to cry on and eventually they stopped talking and that was that for awhile. Months go by with no contact until a few weeks ago, turns out he's been doing the 12 step recovery and is trying to make peace with everyone (Including me). This past week he has been non stop talking to my mom and is even having her come over and visit him. I notice when my Mom is talking about him she's falling in love with him again. I start noticing red flags in her stories about how one day he has nothing to do with her and then the next he's calling her \"My girl\". This all leads to today when I find out that my mom just got approved for a new house and is ready to be moved in at the beginning of April. She wants him to movie in and live on the basement even though she knows how exactly how I feel about him. This isn't set in stone yet and I just want others opinions on him because I don't think he has changed at all. If you have any questions i don't mind answering them.\n\nNote: 1.English is my first language and I am terrible at it\n2. This was typed on a mobile phone so sorry for formatting issues\n3.

      "title": "WIBTA for saying no to helping out a friend/potential bf?",
      "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom. It's a long story.\nI (19F) met this guy (24M) a little over a month ago on Tinder. We started off great, had lots of dates... all in all, everything was going good. On our first date, he told practically told me his life story, ending with him saying he came here on a student visa when he was 20 and overstayed. I assumed this meant that he wasn't legal in the US and pretty much accepted it. Honestly wasn't expecting it to have any bearings on our relationship so soon:\nEither we were going to break up before it made a difference or we would actually work out and get to the end goal for every relationship, in which case, that would make him legal anyway (yes, I understand that immigration laws are way more complicated than this, but I'm dumbing it down for the sake of the post).\n\nFast forward to last week, he cancels a date and reschedules it for a few days after. And then he drops the bomb - \"I think this should be our last date\" and that he would explain everything then. Mind you, I do not love this man (after a month, that would be a bit insane), but I liked how we were together, so I was definitely a bit hurt about things possibly ending so abruptly with little to no reason.\n\nI did speculate that it was because of his immigration issue, but I help off in really trying to ask him about it until we met. When we do, he tells me exactly what I thought: the judge rejected his change of status and his lawyer told him he essentially had to marry someone to stay here. He goes on to say that he wants to end things because he doesn't want to go behind my back and date someone else with the intention of being with them for much longer than a few months. Then he ends with the obligatory, \"let's be friends.\" \n\nI have to say I was pissed off and maybe not for the reason most people would think. I've only known him for a month, but I am the type of person who only date people I can see a future with, so I was hurt that he thought he couldn't see a future for us. He actually ended up denying that eventually, but he was vehement on continuing to being friends. I kept rebutting his point because, imo, I didn't think he thought it through thoroughly (it was just 3 days after he got the news). \n\nSo I give him another option: what if we continue what we have, with the intention of getting married, but with the understanding that if we don't end up actually lasting, I would still help him with his situation. Just to be clear, we would have to be married for a minimum of 3-4 years for him to become legal. All of this also came with the understanding that if we did end up breaking up (but not divorcing) within those 4 years, we could date other people and stay married until we could get divorced and he could stay in the US. \n\nWe ended the date with the us agreeing to take a month off of seeing each other (but still communicating with texts that are very relarionship-y)  to really understand the implications of what we would be doing. I should also add that we ended with a few kisses too, so the relationship was a bit recovered, but with a lot of uncertainty. We both decided that we would make the decision of what to do individually, then meet up again to discuss.\n\nSo here's my dilemma: WIBTA if I decided to essentially take back my suggestion and just ask to be friends? I haven't completely made my decision yet, but if I do make that decision to not go through with it, would I be?\n\nTl;dr - A friend/potential boyfriend of mine is having immigration problems and I offered to be his potential wife for the next 3-4 years so he could become legal. WIBTA if I backtracked on that offer?\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions that would help. I hope I gave enough information though.",

      "description": "Hello guys, new account because I never had a reason to make an account or post anything until now.\n\nSo Kylie is my best friend. She's 24, I'm 23. She's been with Avery for 2 years now. They moved SUPER fast. They met on Tinder, talked for about a month before meeting in person, went on 5 dates over 5 days. By the 6th day, they were a couple. They exchanged \"I love you\" in less than a month. They met each other's families by the 2nd week and their families met each other by their 2nd month. They moved in with each other after only a year.\n\nThey both make decent money, don't get me wrong. She is an interior designer and he is a pharmacy owner. That's not why I'm concerned. I think he has been taking advantage of her. Here is why:\n\n\\- They have been looking at houses together for a while. Kylie is going to design and furnish the house. Avery does not seem to be involved in the design process and it does not seem like he is going to pay Kylie or pay for the furniture.\n\n\\- When they moved in together, Avery started using Kylie's car to get to work a lot. This meant Kylie had to work from home. He has his own car. Kylie's is newer, so I think he just likes using hers because it was newer and fancier than his. \n\n\\-  She bought a new iMac and Macbook to use for work at home and when travelling. He borrows her Macbook when he goes to work and she stays home. But he has the money to buy his own laptop. He just loves to use her stuff and not have to buy his own.\n\n\\- Kylie cleans way more than Avery. He will leave dishes in the sink overnight, she will wash them right away. He is just using her so he does not have to do chores.\n\nAnyway, Kylie and Avery went on a trip recently. They were gone for 10 days. About 4 days in, she sent me a photo of a ring on her finger. I didn't reply because I knew if I did it wouldn't be nice. They got back earlier today. Kylie came into my work waving her hand at me to show me the ring. She asked if I saw her texts and why I didn't reply to her. I said I didn't know what to say. She pestered me until it lead to me saying that I think she moved way too fast with Avery. He is using her and she is blind to it. I told her that I always bit my tongue throughout their relationship because I expected them to break up eventually, but the fact that they're engaged is a huge red flag.\n\nWe got in a huge fight. She said she couldn't believe how unsupportive I was being, but I told her she's the one who asked to know what I thought. As much as I love her I can't go to the eventual wedding because I don't want to support her unhealthy relationship. She texted me saying that if I really believed everything I said, I was \"showing my true colors\" and she didn't want me at the wedding anyway. She thinks I'm in the wrong. I feel bad for fighting with her, but I think it was the right thing to tell her I don't support her relationship. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "A similar post on here about the casual use of the word \"faggot\" made me think about something that's been bothering me for a while.\n\nI'm (female) part of a group of friends (mostly male) who have all known each other since school. We're about 30 now.\n\nThe guys have had this habit ever since we were about 16-17 of \"bumming\" each other, particularly to say goodbye. They will either all pile on top of each other on the floor or form a daisy chain while standing, thrusting their crotches into each other's arses and making orgasmic sounds. They all think it's hysterically funny.\n\nI've always found it a bit embarrassing but as we got older I expected them to grow out of it. They haven't, and now some of them are married with kids, and they still do it. To me it's crossed the line from \"childish and embarrassing\" to something worse. I think it comes off as homophobic. Much like calling each other gay as an insult (which, yes, they also still do). I tried to imagine how it would look if they did it in front of a gay man and it just seems offensive. My husband, who is a bit older and did not go to school with the rest of us, agrees. To be clear I don't think the guys are personally homophobic - well, a couple of them are a little bit, but more in the \"gays are gross\" way than the \"homosexuality is a disease/sin/phase\" way - but I think what they are doing is homophobic.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told them this?",

      "description": "So, I (M19) broke up with my gf (F19) a month ago before dating we were good friends and promised no matter what we will still be friends forever. I was really into her and she was too, it was really fun and everything was fine. But all of a sudden last month she wanted break up, I asked her reasoning behind it and her reply was she doesn't think we have the chemistry, I said fine and it was over. I Told her that being friends again won't be easy for me as i was obviously not over her and neither did i understood what happened as it was very surprising and sudden to me, now as promised we talked as friends for 2 weeks and every time the notification popped it made me sad all the memories came back and it was distracting and saddening, it had been really hard for me just to get over the break up let alone still talk to her. I talked to her about the issue i was facing and her reply was i m dumb and nothing changed between the time we were friends and the time we were in relationship and it's still that way and i m overreacting, But she did stop texting for a week. Now after a week again she starting texting everyday 2-3 msgs i try and ignore but feel guilty as she must feel lonely as well and it's even worse not texting back while she keeps texting. So am i wrong not wanting to talk and reply also any general suggestion regarding the situation will help. ",

      "description": "I apologize in advance for my bad English. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends just love to remind me of this story I'd rather forget and I just can't help wondering if I was in the wrong in all of this. I KNOW I have been stupid though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, In August I moved in a new city for Uni, where I barely knew anybody. I hate going out and am pretty shy, so I got on Tinder to meet new people. I matched with a guy that seemed alright when we chatted on the app. We met irl pretty quick, just to take a walk and talk. During almost all of the walk, he only talked about himself and didn't ask any questions about me. It was during provincial elections, so I brought up the subject (I know, bad decision on my part). Turns out, he was pretty passionate about politics and guilted me about not knowing as much as he does. We ended the meeting with an awkward hug and I went home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, he sent me a long text explaining how he could not keep talking to me and how we are incompatible (I don't like the same kind of music as he does, I'm too much of an introvert, I don't know enough about politics and blahblahblah.) I answered to him telling him that it's alright, that it was nice meeting him, you know, just being polite. He then texted me that he's giving me a chance of explaining myself, to which I answered that I had nothing to explain to him. He then changed the subject and asked me if I wanted to go with him to a show with him at the Uni. I KNOW at this point I should have said no, but I liked the band and didn't know anybody else to go with, so I said yes and we went. It was super awkward and I went home directly after the show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days after he pulled another \"I can't talk to you anymore\" sh\\*t, but this time, because of something I said that he misunderstood, to which I answered something like \"you didn't understand me but whatever, see ya\" because I couldn't care less about the opinion this dude I barely knew had about me. He then changed his mind again and asked me to meet after an appointment he had. Again, I KNOW I should have said no but I'm just stupid like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing was, this appointment was pretty far (15 min car ride) and he didn't have a car or a driver license, so he asked me to come get him after his appointment. I didn't really wanted to, but I took it as an opportunity to get to know the roads of my new town, so I said yes. He told me the appointment would end at 20:45, so I'm there at 20:45. At 21:15, he still was not out so I texted him, telling him I would leave at 21:30, which I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 21:45, I'm home and look at my phone to see texted from him, pissed at me because I left. He said he was in trouble because of me (he had hypoglycemia and did not bring any food with him) and cursed a lot. After getting angry and me not answering, he asked me to come back to get him. Since he was in hypoglycemia, had not much battery left on his phone and that there was not any public transport at that time, I said alright but I'll go home after I get you home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe answered \"don't worry I don't ever want to see you again either\". I got really pissed, but I still went to go get him, and I'll admit, I didn't drive as carefully as I usually do. When he got in the car, I had some Rammstein blasting through the speakers, and didn't say a word. I started to drive, and he said \"You're so agressive\" and started complaining about my driving (I wasn't easy on my car but didn't even exceed the speed limit), so I stopped and told him to get out of my car. He did, and I left. He was in the car for maybe 1 minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe texted me \"crazy bitch\" with the few battery percentage he had left on his phone and I blocked him. AITA? ",

He hands me £15 for the damages but ngl I doubt the screen repair on a S8 is gonna cost £15... We were all talking on gc about it the next day and they said it didnt matter so I thought I'd just let it go because its only a cracked screen. But just yesterday i was talking to  a different friend about it he started laughing and told me he was there and saw what had happened. He told me he dropped my phone then stomped on it? I dont know why tf he would do that but that don't sound like an accident. Should i ask him to pay for the screen repair or would I sound like a dickhead?

I'm perceived as a toxic element and ejected, and I don't fucking get it. I don't understand what's so difficult about coming over once a month, wrapping your arms around someone, and just HOLDING them. No checking phones, no TV or music going in the background, no other people watching and judging, just my SO and I falling asleep in each other's arms... Why is it that when I ask for cuddles/physical affection, people look at me like I just asked them where to find the Nucwear Wessels?

      "description": "So for a bit of background my SIL (20f) has been a very unstable person, she has borderline personality disorder and as such she has trouble  regulating her emotions, holding down employment and housing, and maintaining relationships. Recently she has gone to some therapy  and is doing much better and has been much nicer to be around, but she is still very irresponsible and just lost her  job. Her and her current bf have  been living together since a month after they started dating, and just now have been dating for about five months. She currently lives with her boyfriend and another couple roommates in a shared place.\n\nI am (24f) in a stable relationship with her brother and have been for 8 years, we both have stable but limited employment and have been living in the same rented basement suite for about three years now. I am really starting to feel the baby fever and we have talked about having children and have planned alot of our parenting ideas out, but have agreed that we are not ready yet both financially and emotionally. I am alright with this but I still long for a baby whenever I see them and often fantasize about how being a parent will be, however I recognize that we aren't ready and we want our child to have the best opportunity possible.\n\nrecently SIL came to me and told me she was worried that was pregnant, and that if she was she would be keeping it. I asked her if she had been on birth control and she said no, and that she had kept putting it off so this happened accidentally. I told her I felt that she should think really hard about it all and that I personally felt that things would be really difficult for her if she did choose to keep it, but that I would support her decision either way because it is her life.\n\nSo it turned out that she wasn't pregnant. And I basically said \"oh good. Are you going to get some birth control now?\" She looked kind of embarrassed and said \"I don't know... \" I told her that I didn't think that her actively trying to get pregnant was a good idea in her current situation and basically that I didn't support it.\n\nSo kind if dropped the subject and didn't talk to her for a couple weeks, then bf and I were talking to their other brother and he says \" So (sister) is trying to get pregnant eh? Isn't that messed up?\" So she's hiding it from us now because she knows I don't support it. So I got pretty mad about it to bf and other brother (we are all close) and told them how I felt about it. But neither really wanted to talk about it and bf says he just doesn't wanna get involved.\n\nAm I the asshole? I'll admit I feel bitter about it. She's in a way worse situation than me and I want a kid so bad I just feel like she's being selfish. But I also realize I'm just being jealous? I know it's her life but the idea of her being around me pregnant just makes my skin crawl... I mean I'm sure if it happened I would change my tune but right now I just feel so mad about it...\n",

      "description": "So I'm kinda pissed off at a certain sub. It's for professionals in a certain field. \n\nThis field is very lucrative - starting salaries of around 60-70K out of undergrad and very common career trajectories of around 150K by age 35 (obviously not everyone). \n\nAnyways, so this subreddit does a few really annoying things. \n\n1. Some people think they're better than everyone else, including other people on the sub. Especially people who are still in college for this field. They act as if they understand everything and they are incredibly harsh with their words. \n2. Some people think they're poor as fuck. They would post comments like \"I got a 70K salary and the salary is so laughable and disgraceful.\" But it always has a tone of humblebragging - they know they are successful and capable, but they still act like they're not. \n\n\nObviously #1 is just the regular egotistical asshole. But #2 is what truly pisses me off. They are completely undermining everyone else. I chose this field, I make a lot of money, and I know that. I don't deny it and I'm incredibly grateful for it. I know I live a privileged life and none of my success is possible without the rest of society. I don't look down on anyone making less, and I don't up to anyone making more. \n\nThese people who are humblebragging are literally dragging down other professions such as teachers, environmentalists, nurses, biologists, and more. I mean we are in a field that literally gets money handed to us after undergrad, as long as your GPA is okay. \n\nI see my friends, people smarter than myself, go to nursing school and environmental graduate school and I see them saving lives. While I won't change my own career because frankly I like money and financial stability, I know that they deserve more than me. I wish they earned as much as I did, really. \n\nSo it pisses me off to no end that this subreddit is treating it like shit. \n\nThat being said, I think I might be an asshole if I make the post because I would be telling others how to live their lives and how to think. I am appreciative of other professions that help the world, and I feel that those professions make way too little money. But that's my worldview, and I don't expect other people to have the same worldview. ",

Cool, he gets there that night and he wants to cuddle. My idea of cuddling is PJs and some light kissing. He's was being naked and full on making out with light choking. Halfway into it I try several times to have sex. He says no but still keeps kissing me and touching me, so I try one last time and he's face gets this sad look and his eyes begin to water. I felt like a piece of shit. This guy clearly said no and I kept at it, I apologized and we went to bed holding eachother. He told me the next morning he wanted to come over again but I told him my trip was being cut short. Their are guys out there that wouldn't have stop. Hopefully nothing worse happened to this guy. I made it clear in my profile what I was looking for when he messaged and he didn't say other wise til we started.

      "title": "AITA for lashing out a friend after giving me a place to stay?",
      "description": "*Warning: This is a long story that happened throughout a summer but I'll try and keep it short.*  \nA year ago I had some disagreements with my verbally and emotionally abusive father which led to a heated argument and me getting kicked out of my home. I called up a couple of close friends of mine, one whom was with his girlfriend Ada and told them what happened. Ada offered to let me stay at her parents house which I appreciated but kindly refused after getting an offer from someone else who would let me stay at his place for free and was closer with.  \nAfter about a week of searching, I got a job working minimum wage. Ada calls me and says that she is now living at her grandma's house and needs a roommate to take care of her grandma's cat and help with some chores and that if I moved over and cleaned out the downstairs, I could have it all to myself (rent free). I figured it would be better if I took the offer since I was staying in a small guestroom and this would be an upgrade to my current situation.\n\n  \nAfter several trips of packing and moving my things, I arrive and she tells me that her family have some sort of reverse mortgage but requires her grandma to be living at the house (which she is not) and that we would have to lie and keep quiet about it to not raise any suspicion. I didn't really understand the specifics of it but hey, we get to live in a small house rent free so I agreed. Keep in mind I'm still in school but would not be able to pay for it if I also had rent to worry about, which is why she made the offer in the first place.  \n\n\nI asked where I would be staying and she led me downstairs and to my horror the place was an absolute mess. There were years of piled trash everywhere, dead bugs, and cobwebs in every corner. It looked like a hoarder lived there and just stockpiled every thing they could find. You couldn't see the floor or walk two feet without running into something. I was shocked at how dirty it was but I started cleaning because it was getting late and I needed to clear it up if I wanted to get some sleep. She said she'd helped me but ended up moving a couple of heavy things and then proceeded to play on her phone for the remainder of the time. It took me over 4 hours to get the room to the point where I was comfortable sleeping in it. I had vacuumed floor, the cobwebs from the walls, wiped and sanitized them, cleared bags full of trash. And this was only a third of the downstairs. The room to the left was even worse, but it had an office which I asked her if I could use, she told me sure as long as I cleaned everything up inside of it.  \n\n\nAnyways, not a week after I moved in and started cleaning up the place to make it somewhat habitable, I overhear Ada crying after a fight with her boyfriend. She said \"I vented about how you're being selfish and cleaning things that only pertain to you and he didn't take my side, he never does.\" I apologized to her and stated I was just trying clear up the space where I would be spending most of my time FIRST because it was so messy to begin with. After this, she tells me that I would be needing to pay rent for the house which I feel guilty for being mad about because she told me it would be rent-free and is the reason I moved out of my previous friend's guestroom to begin with. She also told me that I couldn't use the office anymore because they needed it for storage (AFTER i cleaned up everything inside of it). I was furious but kept quiet even though this shattered the chances of me being able to attend college the upcoming quarter.  \n\n\nSoon, I notice that she was being very passive aggressive and distant towards me, I confronted her and told her that if she had a problem with the way I was doing things or living that she should tell me and I'd be happy listen to her and abide by her rules. She told me she was upset because I \"wasn't doing any chores around the house\" and she didn't want to seem like a bitch by constantly nagging me. She has never brought up a single concern to me and instead vented to her parents and our friends about how lazy I was because she had to get up and feed the cat a couple times a week. She even threw a party without giving me a heads up, had strangers come through my room without my knowledge while I was still in it to give them a \"tour\" of the place. I retaliated by listing every single thing I have done over the short amount time I have been there, and she said \"See, this is why I can't bring stuff up to you, you always escalate things\".  \n\n\nHowever despite all of it, this was the last straw for me:  \nI had been seeing this girl I recently met for the last couple of weeks, and asked Ada if it would be cool to bring her home, she agreed and just told me to give her a heads up whenever I brought her over. No problem, I do most of the times, but have forgotten a couple. A few days later the girl I'm seeing and a couple of her friends are hanging out when we get into a little argument. We decided to go back to my place to calm down and talk it out, just me and her. I forget to notify Ada who has guests over without (you guessed it) giving me a heads up. Anyways, it's around midnight and my date's friend is at the door to check up on her, says he's been calling but her phone died so he just drove back to make sure she was okay. Friendly guy, no big deal, better safe than sorry. We tell him everything is okay and thank him for checking up and he drives off.   \nNow, while we are both asleep, Ada yells downstairs that her parents are here and that *everyone* would like to have a little talk. My date and I are super confused because it's 2am and as we head upstairs, Ada's parents start interrogating us about who this dangerous guy was that just showed up to the house. Apparently Ada called up her parents and told them that there was some dangerous people outside and she was scared for her life and that I told them where she lived. She runs back to her room with her boyfriend because I'm guessing she doesn't have the nerves to face me after that blatant lie. By now, I've had enough of this shit when they tell me that I should move out for the best (I was going to anyways after what she just pulled). After a stern talk, they left and I knocked on Ada's door and asked if there was anything she'd like to say to me. \"Nope\" with a smug look on her face. God I was heated. I proceed to go off on her about how she's a huge snake for going behind my back every time she had a problem and always going to her parents or her friends to paint a bad picture of me before even talking to me about it. Before I leave to pack my stuff, I yelled \"See? This is why all your friends left you\". (She has had four different group of friends stop speaking to her for various reasons throughout the years). I think she cried after that but I don't really care.  \n\n\n**TL;DR**  \nFriend offered me a place to stay after I got kicked out, said it was rent free as long as I did what she initially requested and clean her house. I clean the messiest house I've ever seen in and out. and she begins charging me rent and states I don't do anything around the house. After falsely accusing my friend of being a dangerous stranger, she calls her parents screaming for her life and tries to get me kicked out. I go off on her and tell her that all her friends left her because she of the way she acts and she cries.  \nAITA for yelling at her and insulting her after she was kind of enough to offer me a place to stay?",

      "description": "Obligatory on mobile notice. Throwaway account for reasons.\nI had a really close friend (Let's call them Joseph) who really got me. When we met, we clicked instantly. We had been through a lot of similar experiences so whenever we talked about anything, we'd understand straight away. We both kinda liked each other but I was dating someone else at the time so nothing happened. We lost contact for a while when Joseph started dating someone and I broke up with my partner and started dating someone else (Let's call them Toni). This is important: Toni knew Joseph from middle school. \nBut a few months ago, I started talking to Joseph again. We became especially close because he understood some of the hardships in my life that Toni didn't understand. We met up in person a few times again and we talked about past memories. I admitted at that time, I had a bit of a crush on him but didn't want to do anything because I was already dating someone. He admitted he liked me as well and wish he hadn't started dating someone else (at this point, they had already broken up). I felt like I still kind of liked Joseph but I once again didn't want to pursue anything because I love Toni and I was happy. Joseph also still liked me and said he would be happy to be friends but hoped maybe one day we'd get together. I told him that I didn't want him to hold out for me because Toni and I are happy and I don't want to mislead him. We had been messaging a lot and the conversation was a lot of what could've been but since I had already made it clear this wasn't a pursuit, I figured it was okay. \nWe agreed to meet up one day and he wanted to drive. We talked a lot like normal. We were sitting at a reserve later in the day and Joseph was sitting close. He put his arm around me at one point but I've always been physically close with my friends so it wasn't unusual. He started telling me I was beautiful and stared into my eyes a lot. I looked away mostly and said I was tired. He began holding my hand and that should've been my first red flag to leave. We kept talking and he kept moving his face closer to mine. Then he kissed me.\nI was pretty shocked and pulled away. I felt like I just cheated on Toni. I couldn't speak and I was panicking and Joseph was trying to calm me down by holding me. I managed to say that I wanted to go home. \nI walked away pretty quickly. He still tried to calm me down but I had completely shut off. He began apologising but I just kept saying I want to go home. When we got back to his place, I told him I couldn't see him again and left. \nI drove straight to Toni's place and told him everything that happened. Toni's not mad at me since in high school, Joseph had a relationship with a girl and things ended badly. A lot of people heard their sides and Joseph came out as the bad guy. I heard Joseph's side and accepted whathe said. The reason why Toni wasn't mad was because he believed Joseph was a bad guy and that he expected him to try something like that. \n\n",

      "description": "I (27M) met my girlfriend (35F) in an MMO we both play. We live a couple hundred miles apart and started visiting each other every few months. (We would see each other more, but I work for a media company and routinely pull 60+ hour weeks and she has a special-needs son who requires a great deal of attention.)\n\nShe's recently divorced and told me that her net worth is approximately $100K, thanks to divorce settlements as well as a lawsuit from a medical supply company.\n\nA few months later, I made an offhand comment that liars piss me off. I said something to the effect of, \"how can you be friends with somebody who constantly lies to you?\" and she went quiet. I asked her what was wrong and she started crying and admitted that she'd lied about her finances. Her net worth is closer to $20K.\n\nI don't care about her financial situation, as long as she's not in crippling debt. I love her and I've become close to her 12-year-old son, who plays the same MMO we do. The thing is, I don't know if I can be with someone who lied to me about something so major. Also, I'm wondering if she's lying about other things now, even though she swears she isn't.\n\nThe fact that she made money off of her divorce and a lawsuit weren't red flags to me previously, because they seemed justified. But now that I'm seeing this dishonest side of her, I'm left questioning everything.\n\nWIBTA for cutting my losses and walking away now?",

      "description": "At night, sometimes when my boyfriend (26M) goes to bed, that is when my kitty is the most cuddly. (I don’t know why she won’t sleep with me in bed anymore, nothings changed) so if he goes to bed before me (22NB), she will hop up on the couch and lay with me and purr like a motorboat. It’s awesome, I love her.\n\nHowever. A couple nights peppered in the past (and it’s an issue cuz it’s happened twice this week), she’s come to cuddle, and I’ve ended up laying down and falling asleep with her on the couch. He wakes up at 6am for work every morning, and today I woke up right around 4:30-45. I felt it was too late to go sleep in the bed because I didn’t want to interrupt his sleep so close to him waking up on his own, so i just dealt with another hour or so of couch sleep. \n\nI thought I was being courteous but he was very short and blunt with me this morning when he was getting ready and he got really sketched out about “who are you texting?” when he saw me typing (commenting on a facebook post). It’s clear that he thinks I’m up to no good at night when I stay up (especially if I don’t go back to bed at some point), but like, I literally did not send a single message through the night, I can’t even recall being on facebook very much, I was just in and out of consciousness, petting my kitty.\n\nWhere I may BTA here is that I lost my patience a little and snapped that “alright, you’ve decided that I’ve done something wrong, you don’t have any evidence but you do have a feeling so I get to deal with you being pissed off now, awesome” .  He didn’t deny that though so it is how it is I guess.\n\nSo, idk. AITA? For future, should I just go back to bed regardless of how late it is or how close it is to him waking up anyway? Should I just never stay up and have that time with my cat and nip it in the bud? (that would make me sad but I really don’t know what’s best here). \n\ntl;dr- slept on couch with cat on accident instead of bed with boyfriend, woke up way early morning and didn’t go to bed out of respect for his sleep, he suspects me of shady wrongdoing and gets upset, i also get upset at baseless accusations. aita?

      "description": "This is my first time posting in this sub so bear with me here. \nAbout I year ago I moved into an apartment with my friend and his girlfriend. She didn't have a job when we first moved in because she has anxiety and depression and needed to get back on her meds first. It's been over a year now and she hasn't gotten her meds or a job. I'm moving to a different state and they're planning on getting a place on their own. \nI've been worried since about month 4 when she said her anxiety was too bad to even make the call to make an appointment. I even offered to call for her and go with her, but she declined. \nShe hasn't made any steps to get better. She hardly leaves the apartment and relies on him to feed her and get her what she needs. She also smokes weed almost constantly and makes him prepare her food and clean up after her. I've also seen her hit him and kick him in the nuts for saying something she doesn't agree with.\nTrouble really started about a month ago when I told him I was concerned she was using him. He tried to talk to her about it and now she's being extremely hostile toward me and trying to tell my friends that I'm being rude to her. \nI'm scared that I'm being to harsh about her mental illness with telling her she needs to get on her meds and get a job. I've been in a place where my mental illness was really bad (I have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), but instead of relying on my partner I stayed in an inpatient  program for a few weeks until I was stable enough to get a job again.\n\nTL;DR I'm worried my roommates girlfriend is using her anxiety as an excuse for him to take care of literally everything for her and called her out for it.",

      "description": "Earlier today, me and my girlfriend's dad went out to shovel some people's driveways. He had mentioned that it's something he does this time of year to make some extra cash and I volunteered to help him today since he's not really a big fan of mine and I've been looking for a way to prove that I'm a good guy who'll treat his daughter right. We both went out in his truck and we spent a couple of hours going around a nearby neighborhood and shoveling snow off of driveways.\n\nThings went good on the work aspect, but things went bad when we stopped for lunch. He did drive-thru for Chick-Fil-A and he pulled up to the speaker and asked for two meals with two bottles of water. I told him that I wanted a soda, but he starts yelling at me that I'm getting water because he doesn't want to spend the extra money for a fountain drink. I just sat back and shut up so that I couldn't be yelled at again. We got our food and he told me not to eat any in the truck since we'd be home soon. I was starving and I really was resisting the temptation to try and sneak a waffle fry while he wasn't looking. We reached a point where he was looking into his side-view mirror and I quickly snuck a waffle fry, but he saw me. He looked over to me with a pissed off look on his face, but he was also distracted and he had to slam on his brakes to avoid rear-ending the car in front of him. Our food went spilling all over his floor and he yelled \"YOU MOTHERFUCKER!\" He started yelling at me to get out of his truck, but I stayed behind to try and grab my sandwich. He snatches it from me and tosses it out the window and he yells at me to get out again. I get out and he yells at me to walk home and he drives off.\n\nI just called my girlfriend and had her come pick me up and she wasn't happy with her dad. She said that she'll try and talk to him about what happened. I just hope that there's nothing in this story that would make my girlfriend consider breaking up with me. I don't see that I'm at fault by that much.",

My post had a lot of concerned people so I just wanted to update anyone who cares. \n\nMy husband came home on his own accord this morning. He was extremely apologetic and immediately sat me down and told me he wanted to explain everything leading to his outburst. \n\nHe said that at work, him and his friends had been discussing their sex lives, and he had let slip that he was not receiving any blowjobs.\n\nHe claims that his friends started insulting him for being weak willed and not more stern with what he wanted. He says they encouraged him to confront me. \n\nApperently his friends put the idea in his head that without oral sex, his sex life wasn't \"legitimate\". \n\nHe told me that he really felt like he was missing out and that this is what lead to him yelling at me.\n\nHe called in sick from work so he could stay home with me all day, we talked a lot about the future and he agreed to go to marriage counseling or see a sex counselor together if that is what I wanted. \n\nI haven't completely forgiven him yet, but it's just nice to have him back home.

      "description": " So to preface this, by this stage in my life I have no interest in fixing or trying to become friends again with this individual for reasons I'm not getting into for this post. All these happened after this.\n\n I had a good friend a few years back at school. We talked the most with each other out of others from our group. We'd be \"best friends\" I guess back then. However the trouble ultimately began with that outside of school we never ever hung out.\n\n If we were in a group he'd come out into town of course. And with other people as well he'd just hang out with them. But never with me. Ultimately I ended up in a sort of bad state of mind and felt bad, I felt quite lonely as I didn't really hang out with anyone one to one. I confessed this to my friend the bay before a two week break.\n\n In effect I just asked he try and contact me outside school (which he never did. I'd also have to initiate it and even then he'd be blunt) and to try and hang out more. I told him that it upset me and such.\n\n During the two week break he did not contact me once. At all. When we got back at school I asked what he was up to but it should be noted I didn't ask why he didn't message me. I asked what he was up to. He told me he had played Overwatch the whole break, was pretty bored and wished he'd talked more to people and went out more over the break.\n\n From that stage I kinda just stopped talking to him. I still made chit chat but I didn't get to in-depth. I still hung it in the group but otherwise we never really talked. Not once did he ever contact me at all. About anything. \n\n By this stage we aren't friends anymore. And there isn't anything that will change that for other reasons outside of this and happened after this. What I'm wondering though in this instance AITA?",

      "description": "(throwaway account)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a little backstory.\n\nI recently got my 1st job and I was super excited. I've been searching for a few months and I finally got hired by a local store. You know what they say, you should never be late to work, especially if it's your very first day of your very first job. The shop is about a half an hour walk from my house and I had to be there at 7:40 to open and prepare before 8 o'clock.\n\nI left my home around 7:10 to be extra sure I would arrive on time. After about 15 minutes I was on this really long uphill road when at the end of it I see someone on a bike going extremely fast (ON A MONDAY MORNING). As he passed me I looked at him and he couldn't be older than 15-16. I thought why he was going that fast on that time of day and after about 4-5 seconds I heard a loud noise and turned my head around to see that he has crashed after, I imagine, going over a pothole. He must have been about 50 meters away from me by then. I stood there thinking if I should go and help. I ended up not helping because I really didn't want to be late for work. \n\nI feel guilty now but my boss is really strict and upsetting him was the last thing I wanted on my first day.\n\nSo AITA for not helping?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also sorry for bad English) \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She's always been a bully but we've just stayed out of it.  She justifies it by saying she thinks she has borderline personality disorder. The thing is I have been diagnosed with autism and have never bullied anyone. My  friend and sister are soft and so am I but I've become more independent after starting work and a job. 2 weeks ago I told this girl to go fuck herself and I'm sick of her. She flipped out but that's the first time I've ever stood up to her and now I'm proud.\n\n\nThe problem is my best friend and sister say they can stand up to her but I know for a fact that they can't. I tell them don't put up with her shit tell her to fuck off but they say they don't want to cause drama but I know in reality they are terrified of her. I am as well but it's something that has to be done. Like yesterday, my sister was crying because the girl was calling her names and making fun of our grandfather who died recently. Now today she's joking with her on Snapchat as if nothing happened. It's so very very frustrating. Of course I'm most angry at the girl who's the bully but I wish my friend and sister could just tell her where to go. AITA?",

      "description": "My grandma is just not a good person. She is an addict with many vices, alcohol and gambling are the to main ones. When my mom was a kid my grandma would get drunk and be both verbally and physically abusive. Shortly after my mom turned 18 my grandma went to prison. She claimed to clean up her act and my mom forgave her and started sending her money. When I was a teen she spent the night at our place one night because she had no where else to go. While I am at school and my mom is at work she steals my life saving that I earned that summer working and she steals all of my moms jewelry. We later find out that she has stolen from just about everyone in the family as soon as they let her in. And she goes back to jail for theft.\n\nShe claims to have cleaned up her act again and my whole family has seemed to forgiven her. I haven't and I won't. I have zero respect for someone who will lie, steal, and beat their own family (especially their own child).\n\nSo this year since it is the first year that I have my own place I wanted to throw a Christmas party for my family. Someone invited her without my knowledge and when she shows up and flip out and kick her the hell out of my house.\n\nThis pretty much ended the party. It was very awkward and quite after that. And many of my family thinks that I should have put all that aside for family and that I should have been more mature and let things go.\n\nSo am I an asshole for kicking my grandma out and by extent ruining the family Christmas party?",

(My parents are 55 and 64)\n\nMy brothers are both very successful and I have a close relationship with both of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister not so much, she started taking drugs (I don't know what exactly she took, it was some pill but my mom never wanted to tell me) and skipping school when she was just 15.\n\nMy parents still cared for her, because they loved her, but that meant that when my parents weren't working, they were spending time with her. \n\nI was a sickly child and stayed home from school a lot, due to health issues. I really hated school because the kids always bugged me for my weight. That lead to me being depressed for the majority of my life. I wanted to tell my parents about the kids at school bugging me but they were always so exhausted from work and caring for her.\n\nShe then turned up at my holy communion (I am no longer religious btw.) completely high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe finally went to jail when I was 8 years old, but that didn't make my parents look after me more. When we went on a \"holiday\" they visited her in jail (they didn't take me with them obviously) and I was left alone with my distant uncle aunt and cousins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got deep issues from my mother and father not being there (some would say daddy issues). I needed constant approval and when I didn't get that my anxiety started building. (I still have anxiety issues). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy classmates behaviour towards me also made me get bad body issues and a bad depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wanted to change when she realized that she was pregnant. She stopped living in a trailor and started rehab.\n\nShe wanted to be more involved with me when her son was born, but through all the issues I got indirectly from her I started absolutely hating her and being disgusted by her. I also really hate her three year old. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got better when I met my boyfriend of almost three years, he made my anxiety, depression and bulimia dissapear. But I have still felt a gruge against her ever since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: parents were occupied with my sister throughout my childhood and now I dislike her. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am really sorry if there are some mistakes in here, english is not my native language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I felt uncomfortable being in the situation honestly and I feel shitty for not being there because Im the only one she has to talk to so she feels alone. So yeah I just feel like a POS for wanting to study and I cant find a way to tell her that, of course shes my number one priority but I also wanna do well in school.",

      "description": "My sister is a huge help for my family. We've been through some really tough times and the only reason that the family didn't complete fall apart is her. But because of this feeling of responsibility and my family's complete appreciation for her, she's become self righteous. Everything she says is the truth according to her and my family. I feel like allowing her to have this god-complex is really messed up. \n\nCut to 30 minutes ago. We were having a conversation about the past and she was interrupting me every time I tried to speak. This is normal for having a conversation with her (and my entire family), but I always end up getting frustrated and become tired of trying to talk. So I said something that she didn't agree with, and she was telling me how I was wrong. I disagreed and she insisted I explain why I think that way. I said why and she didn't accept it. I said 'okay, cool' because I didn't want to continue an argument but she wouldn't let it go. So, I said that I was done and didn't want to explain the same thing again because she clearly didn't understand the first time. \n\nThis happens all the time (with my whole family) and I usually just leave to not end up arguing. But she's not having this and yells at me because I 'always do this' like it's a bad thing. She left me in tears because I 'dont talk to my family' and that I was rude to her my saying I was done with this conversation. \n\nBut I dont think what I did was bad, and that she should figure out that she's not always right, even if that's what everyone seems to make her believe. But was I actually the asshole in this situation because she was the one that left in tears?",

      "description": "So I'm in highschool and my grades are very very very important to me (I want to study medicine). My best friend is always saying that she's putting sooo much effort into her schoolwork when she knows damn right she isn't. Which is okay. School isn't for everyone and her Nr. 1 goal doesnt have to be that she gets into the best college or any college at all.\n\nBut when she is complaining about that one teacher who gave her a C (she 100% deserved the C) eventhough she believed that she should have gotten a better grade, I always support her and tell her 'yeah, what an asshole teacher' instead of 'come on, you know exactly that you half-assed that assignment and didn't put any effort into it. You deserve the C'.\n\nHOWEVER, everytime I complain about a B, eventhough I had set my goal to be an A, she says 'Ohhhh my God, will you stop? A B is fine! You always complain.' And when I explain to her that I am very aware that a B is fine but I was actually aiming for the A which is why this was a disappointment for me, she always claims that I'm just being picky and perfectionistic.\n\nSo the question is: Am i the asshole for HATING that my best friend doesn't take school seriously, she doesn't think about her future, is lazy (when it comes to school) and I ALWAYS have to walk on eggshells around her because God forbid I make her angry!\n\nI love her so much and she is like a sister to me but everytime school is the topic I just cant help but be annoyed and the worst thing is that I cant even tell her.",

Usually its things like \"@wolf1ez literally shut up\" or \"ur gay u wouldn't understand :)\" all in good joking manner I guess, but it just rubs me the wrong way. Why share something in a gc and send &gt;100 messages instead of privately to each other if you don't want to hear other peoples' input? \n\nOnce I start getting fussy, they'll usually reply with \"dude calm down it was a joke\" as if they didnt tell me to fuck off a second ago which only tilts me more. I always try to just leave the conversation and come back when I've calmed down but as soon as I return they pull that 'gtfo' shit again to piss me off.

I’ve given them ample time to plan, and have gone above and beyond to make sure that the transition is smooth.\n\nI was talking with my coworkers about all of this, and I brought up the fact that, if a company is legally considered a “person”, then I should be considered a “company” with my main goal to be to increase revenue. I know that they would drop me without a second thought, so I should be able to walk away from the company. I don’t owe them anything after I leave.\n\nThey all told me that I have to look at it differently, and that it’s a messed up way of looking at things. Someone told me that I’m going to screw them over if I don’t continue to help after I leave. I’m happy to answer questions, but I’m NOT coming in. I’m moving two hours away.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Ok background story:\n\nI'm going back to my home country after 10 years from Canada. I haven't seen almost all of my relatives for  a long time. My mom and I made plans to visit all the relatives, but I mentioned to her that I don't want to see a specific aunt (let's call her SA).\n\nMom: \"Why not? Family is family.\"\n\nHere's the thing, I haven't talked to SA for a decade because:\n1) When we sent money back to support grandparents, she used MOST of the money to pay off her \"debt\", which she never specified. Now my Dad (SA's brother) sends money to his cousin to take care of grandma in the retirement home.\n\n2) Before grandma was sent to her retirement home, SA lived with her. However, SA left grandma STARVING to the point where grandma wanders the streets. Mind you, we found out grandma has dementia. SA's reason for leaving her alone is because they don't get along. She only left boiled eggs for her to eat!\n\n3) After finding out where our money went, I was livid. My parents could have saved a lot of money for my brothers' and I college. Instead of SA taking care of my grandma (which costs less), we sent grandma to the retirement just so someone can take care of her. I finally felt relief after seeing grandma gaining back weight.\n\nBTW SA is 40 years old, no husband or kids, working in an office job the last time I checked. \n\nI feel disgusted after all she has done. My grandma is so sweet to her grandchildren, including me, and it breaks my heart that SA treat her that way because \"they don't get along\". Grandma had to suffer after her breast cancer surgery and grandpa's death, while I was a country away from her.\n\nMy mom, after all that, still wants me to meet her since I haven't seen her for so long. Because family is family.\n\nAITA for not wanting to meet SA again? Also if my mom forces me to meet her, I will probably not even speak to her. ",

      "description": "I met a girl on Tinder a couples of months ago, and after a while we had a date. We had a lot of fun and we connected instantly, but she wasn't interested in anything romantic. No big deal, we kept it to friendship (with sometimes things getting a little more physical, but rarely). We've gotten really close since, we text everyday, we see eachother as much as possible, we've talked about a lot of really personnal stuff. I tought I did a good job of moving on, that I wasn't interested in her that way anymore. Then, a couple of days ago I spent the night at her place. We drank a lot and it was getting late, so she offered me to stay to sleep, it's closer to my job anyway. We didn't have sex or anything, but we cuddled a lot, even though she's usually not a cuddler. The day after I had a hard time leaving, I've never felt so good in my life. That's when I realised that I was lying to myself, my feelings for her are clearly more than just friendship. I wrote her a message telling her that, not because I was hopping that she would reciprocate, but mostly because I felt she should know. I felt like the cuddling may not have happened if she was aware of how I feel, and that I should be honest with her. Her response to it so far was \"I don't know what to tell you. I don't really want to think about it. At least, not right now\". That was bad timing on my part, she was getting ready to go to work and still tired from the night before. During our first conversation about a potential relationship, I told her that I would be honest if I've ever felt that way, and so I did. However, she also said that she feared to hurt me, she doesn't want me to feel bad because it's not gonna go further than that, so I kinda feel like an asshole for putting her in that situation. On the other hand, I would have felt like an even bigger asshole if I didn't say anything and continued to cuddle and potentially more. At least now if it happens, she'll know that it means more to me, not that I really expect it to happens. It's just that I don't know what she's thinking right now, and I worry it might have been an asshole move on my part that could hurt our friendship, which is the last thing  I want. ",

Stop complaing and start thinking of a solution, if there is none, forget about it, move on, simple right. no she will rant about any particular thing all day sometimes all week and i have to listen to it. its to the point where shes the only person in the room talking, shes not looking for a conversation or my views on the topic. its toxic behaviour. i believe if you got nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all. i just try to avoid her all day now, i just dont want to hear it anymore.",

      "description": "We all had previously used my cousin's HBO Go account but she recently got rid of her cable. My family is eager to watch the upcoming season of Game of Thrones, and they suggested we all pitch in to share an HBO account. The thing is though, I already have one. I got it through Hulu, but I don't want to share my account with them.\n\nMy family is incredibly conservative and judgemental, especially my brother. It's why I love that they love Game of Thrones so much. For once in my life, they're taking an interest in something I love. I've always been the black sheep in my family, and they never cared for and at times downright detested my nerdy interests.\n\nBut the reason I don't want to give them my account info is because I'll get so much ridicule for the things I watch. We have a family Netflix account and I watched the Conjuring. A few days later, I got a passive aggressive text from my brother wondering why I had watched a \"satanic\" movie. Yeah. He monitors what I watch. \n\nOh. I'm 28 and he's 33. \n\nYeah. He's really controlling.\n\nMy parents aren't as bad and won't care what I watch, but if I share my account info with them, they'll eirher make me give it to my brother or they'll give it to him. As much as I would love to share my account with my parents (because I really do love being able to nerd out with them about GoT), I just don't want to feel like I can't watch the things I want on my own account. I just feel like I'm being selfish.\n\nAm I being an asshole? ",

      "description": "TLDR down below!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo me (20 m) and my best friend (19 f) have been friends for about 7 years now. I always noticed that she had some kind of crush on me or was at least very very interested in me and my life, which is nice because she was one of the first people in my life that were really interested in me. I appreciated her, she appreciated me and we helped eachother through various periods of our lives. From bad breakups to divorce or the death of a close family member. \n\nNow to the actual story. It all started like 4 months ago. She asked me if I had a crush on anyone. I didn't and told her so.  She kept digging, asking me again and again. After I told her that she is getting kinda annoying her best girl friend started asking me instead of her. I told her the same, then some of my friends started asking me if I had a crush. I told them all no, until I said \"no and I wouldn't tell you if I had one\".Which is the worst you can say, even if it's the truth.\n\nAnd then things got worse. My best friend started asking me again and again and I got soo annoyed. Everyone pressured me so extremely and they all wanted me to say that I crush her (my best friend). \n\nI thought about the whole situation and after getting asked even more and more and being pressured on parties I started adapting to the idea. I thought that if everyone wants me to say it I should at least think about the possibility. I started to kinda like the idea and maybe felt something close to a crush. \n\nAfter the 4 months of pressure and getting asked about it I finally told my best friend that I was kinda crushing on her in the past 2 weeks. She got excited and told me that she had a crush on me for the last year, maybe even more. We had a fun evening, but I never had the feeling or desire to do anything couple related (hugging, kissing, cuddle, etc.) I didn't spend the night with her but used some random excuse to get away from the situation because with every minute that passed the situation got more and more uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I got home I started thinking about the whole situation and came to the conclusion that I didn't like her in that particular way and after talking to her on the next day I told her that I think it would be best to stay friends. She of course didn't understand why I had change my mind. Tbh I had no clue myself. She left with almost tears in her eyes and I felt soo terrible but I needed some times and thought she would need time for herlself as well. After countless hours of thinking and arguing with myself, I figured that I wanted to satisfy the mass and put their hopes above my actual feelings.\n\nWe texted and I tried explaining her why I had changed my mind. She said that was all made up and that I would be weak for breaking under so little pressure. End of the story: we are still kinda friends, but haven't done anything since. \n\nSo please tell me AITA and if so why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I told my best friend that I had a crush on her because I was pressured for over 4 months into saying it. The day after I told her that I was kinda crushing on her I wasn't really feeling that way anymore then told her that we should stay friends. She called me mentally weak and that it wouldn't work out anyways.",

      "description": "Hello everyone, 20M here who was on a tram today and have been riddled with guilt over what happened in it. There was a man a few steps away from me who had been talking to a woman pretty loudly and rudely. Another woman stepped in and tried to tell him to give some respect to the woman he was yelling at and the douchebag exploded on the new woman. He yelled at her, kept threatening violence for a minute or so and then became physical. He started shoving her and threatening her with more violence. I could have stepped in at any point and at the very least tried to stop that from happening. But I didn't because I froze and I was afraid. Fortunately, the tram was pretty full and some brave soul came from the back to where he was in the tram and kicked the douchebag out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJustice was served to the man in the end but it wasn't by me. I'm very happy both those women came out okay from that ordeal and I hope they continue to be so. After the man was kicked out, I was too ashamed to even look at anyone else. I've always thought of myself as a good person, certainly nowhere near the best but someone who tries to help out wherever he sees something wrong and I've done that out of my way in the past to help others. I don't think I have a right to say that anymore. That situation made me question a lot about myself. What if that situation was to happen again? What if there was proper abuse involved, not just shoving? Would I get involved or would I just look the other way? They say a person who fails to stop an injustice is just as guilty as the person who committed the sin. What kind of person am I if I can't find it in myself to stop the most blatant injustice there is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, for those who listened, I'm very grateful since this is some pretty heavy stuff, at least for me. I'd like to think that if there is a next time, I can recall my guilt and shame there and decide to do something but I really just don't know anymore. Thank you all for letting me get this out.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for the support and suggestions! I'm sorry about the late replies but everything that you've said, I've taken to heart. I'm going to start looking in to conflict resolution so that I'm better equipped to dealing with any such situations in the future. It means a lot that you guys took the time to read and offered some advice. Hopefully, if such a situation should arise again, I can look back, not only at my past experience but think about the advice here and respond better to these situations.",

I recognized it was time to tell her.  \n\n\"Uh, I have something I need to tell you, and you might not like it and I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, but I just didn't know how, but I had a vasectomy xx number of years ago.\"\n\nIt was very upsetting, actually, for both of us.

I didn't think sharing it, or keeping it to myself,  would make a difference.  \n\nWell, soon after that she begins making ultimatums, and mentioning deal breakers, that go against well established personal values.

      "description": "For some context, my ex broke up with me nine months ago, and it emotionally crushed me. Once he found out he would not be going to the college we planned on going to together, he started to become very distant. He would only send a goodmorning text and not speak to me for the rest of the day.\n\nIt started to get worse and worse. I had an unhealthy dependence on his attention due to me being young, naive, and convinced he was the only one who would want to ever be with me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or even think. I felt terrible, emotionally and physically. I eventually called him and asked him if he was doing alright, because I thought maybe he was going through something he wasn't telling me about. He said everything was fine and I asked him if we could improve our communication and he said \"I'll try.\"\n\nNot even a week passes before it gets much worse. I called him again, and left him a message telling him exactly how I've been feeling and how I need communication to improve because I was so anxious and stressed out.\n\nHe called back and left a message saying that the distance was getting to him, that he hadn't loved me for the past month, and that he wanted to end things. I called him back, leaving a message saying that if he wanted to break up I would respect his decision, but I remember just being to torn up about it. We eventually were both able to get on a call and he just gave the sweet nothings of \"you mean the world to me but in a different way\" and \"there are so many better guys out there than me\". I was still devastated. I slowly forced myself to put away all the pictures of him in my closet.\n\nFast forward six months. I've improved myself in so many ways. I branched out and tried new things. I have a much healthier relationship with myself. I'm much happier with my capabilities, and I was accepted to my dream college. Basically, I'm thriving. I get an unexpected message from my ex. We talked for a bit, then he said \"Can I talk to you about something?\"\n\nHe drops a bomb that in the past six months he never stopped thinking about me. Things at his college reminded him of me. He's unsure of himself, but he feels bad about the way things ended and wants me back. I'm taken aback, and I know I don't want to get back together with him. I've finally accepted that part of the unhealthy relationship I had with myself was because he was mentally abusive. He was manipulative and good at telling people what they wanted to hear. I’m also just not attracted to him anymore.\n\nHe says he's going to try to transfer to the college i'm going to next year, and that he can see a future with me. Eventually he says \"I want to be with you.\" And I left him at that. I ghosted him. It's been three months since then, and I still haven't spoken to him. Am I the asshole for not giving him closure?\n",

      "description": "First time posting, so bare with me.\n\nMy relationship with my dad has always been rocky (although has been great the last couple of years). See, he's an alcoholic, and he has depression. My mum and him separated when I was about a year old (She couldn't cope with him walking out all the time and going missing when she was trying to look after me). Despite this, he still tried to be a good dad, until he met HER. \n\nCB (Crazy Bitch) was also an alcoholic, who also suffered with depression. I knew that she had fertility issues, and that was partly why she was so horrid to me (as well as the fact she was genuinely just a horrible person). She tried to convince my dad when they were first together, that I wasn't his child. My dad probably would have believed this, except for the fact it is very clear from looking at me, that there is no doubt i am his daughter. She would do everything in her power to get him to cancel his weekends with me, even so far as threats to her own safety. When I had to stay over at her house, I was in the tiny box room, on a mattress on the floor. Even after years, I was never allowed a bed. She would be cruel to me, and when I would get upset and my dad would ask me what was wrong, she would say that I was a liar and making things up. In the end, I stopped going.\n\nCB was a master manipulator, cheater, compulsive liar, and she would regularly both physically and mentally abuse my dad. My entire childhood I had to learn that when I needed my dad, he wasn't there. He would go months without contact with me even if I tried to get in touch with him (depression, guilt over being with CB and drinking). \n\nCB died about 4 years ago from cancer and alcoholism.\n\nWe are finally in a good place. \n\nDuring a relaxed chat about IVF and general fertility issues people face, Dad casually drops into conversation that he and CB went through IVF just after they got engaged (I would have been 5/6). Now obviously, there was no logical time before now for him to bring it up, and I don't begrudge him that. What hurts is that I thought I knew all of the things he could ever have done to hurt me, and thought I had dealt with it. This was a complete curve ball (almost as if even death can't stop CB from messing with my relationship with him). \n\nA) I am an only child who just found out I could have had a sibling.\nB) She wouldn't even stop drinking long enough for the ivf to be successful anyway, surely that was enough of a red flag that having a baby with her WASNT a good idea?\nC) I can't stop thinking about how much different life would have been if it had worked.\nD) He was ready to have another baby when he couldn't even be there for the one he already had?\n\nMy mum and my partner have both said it's the past and I need to let it go, but I don't think I can. It feels almost as if they're saying I'm overreacting. \n\nAITA for feeling hurt by it and not being able to just forget? ",

      "description": "Hello! I work at a southern style restaurant where Sundays are incredibly busy. We have nonstop tables in and out and usually boast a 45 minute wait. I was to be cut around 2, and at 1:55 my 2 top table and another server's 4 top table got pushed together for a group of 6. At the restaurant we work at it is generally the server with the bigger table who gets first chance to take it. I told her about the party and she immediately told me to take it- she was going to be cut at 3:30, so I asked her if she could take it since I was about to be off the floor. She honestly freaked out at me, telling me it doesn't matter and that I just don't want to work. She also complained that I did not greet them and just went to get her but they hadn't been sat yet when I went to get her. I told her I could if she wanted me to, and she told me to fuck off.\nSo after all is said and done and I am cut, she starts putting the order in and I try to ask her if she wants me to get the drinks for her while she is doing that. She told me she does not need help from me and got increasingly more aggressive and rude. And I told her that she was kind of rude about all of this. I also overheard her telling everyone that I am a lazy bitch and that really bugged me. Like! Come to me and talk about it like I have been trying to do and we can solve this. \nSo I confronted her and I definitely admit I was very frustrated and gave off that tone. She said to leave her the fuck alone. And so, I did.\nI feel very bad about this! I would have definitely taken that table if I had known she was going to be  so upset, and was going to offer but she just kind of did not give me a chance to say nevermind. I also didn't mind working, but I was just wondering if she could help me out since I was so close to done. Please let me know if I am a butthole.\n\n",

      "description": "A friend of mine recently went on a date with one of my girlfriends friend he met on Tinder. After the date, I asked my friend what he thought of her, and his response was that he couldn’t see it going anywhere because he thought she was overweight. Now, my girlfriend knows he was texting me, and was very curious as what he had to say. Obviously I didn’t want to tell her what went wrong on the date, because it would make her feel bad.\n\nAfter nagging me about it for a while, I eventually spilled the beans and said to her that he’s more into petite girls and her body type didn’t match that. This is where the issue starts.\n\nWe got into an argument about how shallow he apparently is for not wanting to go out on another date with this girl because she’s overweight, and he should’ve given her another chance because he might fall for her personality. I disagreed with this, and told her that since he’s a pretty fit person, it’s going to be normal that he wants to be with other people that are also fit. After all attractiveness plays a big part for a lot of people when it comes to the early stages of a relationships. Mind you, this girl is not perceived overweight to everybody since she has a curvier body type, but also works outs.\n\nThe second issue is that she has mentioned this discussion when other friends of hers are around, and they all take her side saying that men should accept women for whatever body type they are, and curvier women can never look as skinny as a more naturally slim person can be. I’ve told them I understand this, and a person even though should maintain a healthy routine when it comes to diet and exercise, should also put emphasis on being comfortable in their own body. I just believe that it doesn’t matter if they don’t think she’s overweight, because he is much more attracted to petite girls, he perceives it like this. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "  \n\nAfter my ex and i parted ways 2 years ago, Someone i had considered to be a friend (we'll call him Mr B) started dating her, at the time it felt like a massive backstab as i had always grown up around people spouting the \"you don't date your friends ex\" (I even had a friend cut ties with one of his lifelong friends for asking if he could talk to his ex). The feeling I got from my friends though was that i should accept it and basically 'get over it'\n\nMr B was someone i had considered a friend, (someone you would invite to the shed for beers on a friday night) but had told everyone we were never really friends. At the time i needed a break from life, so i deleted/blocked them both on social media and moved on with my life by spending 6+ months travelling and living overseas. (best life decision made)\n\nI'm now living back in my home state and working, i still try to catch up with my friends often but i didn't want to be hanging around said couple when i did, so i would catch up with friends before or after an event as i still harboured anger towards said Mr B.\n\nI got to the stage where i went camping with all the guys plus Mr B because i missed doing the 'normal' things we would do before everything happened, and i thought maybe i'm alright, its in the past and i can let it go (as i have a new girlfriend at this stage).\n\nAbout 2 months ago while we were on camping again with most friends (plus girlfriends), one of our mates was dicking around throwing mud when its hits my girlfriend, no problem i got him back. Except a tiny bit of splatter hits Mr B's fishing tinny (that has been getting driven up a tree on the bank of the river all weekend and is currently filled with about 20 mostly empty beer cans contributed by everyone there)\n\nNext minute he absolutely flips his shit at me (apparently while i was underwater he had said something about don't throw mud), i immediately appologise and tell him i'll help clean it (while at the same time asking another mate to stop using my shirt to clean the specs of mud from the side of the boat) He flips out again, shoves me back and storms off. Most people there take a dim view of his attitude and console me saying that he's way out of line. Another friends makes us shake hands once we all returned to camp and the group sat it 2 groups the rest of the night.\n\nI have zero desire to try to make ammends to this absolute grub of a human being, which i feel leaves me in the shit position of checking with my friends when an event is organised who is going. I don't enjoy doing this, but its leaving me questioning if any of these people are good friends to me to begin with, i certainly feel like if any of them were in this situation they would be judging me for being a close mate to a person who made them feel this uncomfortable.\n\nI write this after purposfully not attending a friends house for drinks last saturday after he had his first child on Thursday morning. Am i the asshole here?",

      "description": "Context: most mornings me, my husband, and our two boys (2 and 4) cuddle in our bed and talk the first ten minutes of the morning. \n\nIt’s pretty typical the two boys use the time to horse around on the bed, jumping and wrestling and all the other rough play that comes with boys of that age. \n\nThe 2 year old is a bruiser and the 4 year old more sensitive. \n\nThis morning both boys were rumbling around, the 2 year old on my side, 4 year old with my husband. The two year old accidentally kicked the four year old in the head (not hard to do any real damage but a surprise and the older one of course started crying right away). \n\nMy husband then booms to me: “Move him (the two year old) to the other side of you!”\n\nI had already grabbed him in a bear hug so no more toddler appendages could be flailing by the 4 year old. \n\n“He’s fine I have him” was my response. \n\nHusband goes (in a very loud and stern voice): “I’m not ASKING you, I’m TELLING you” then proceeds to make some other comment about my slow movement/processing of the situation. \n\nNow of course both kids start crying and husband tells the four year old to go down stairs right away and demands I stay in the room with the younger one. \n\nIn isolation this is likely a “meh” whatever, marriage, post. \n\nWe left the morning not talking - him getting ready for work, me downstairs with both kids getting them ready. \n\n",

      "description": "This is really more of a general question than a specific situation since it occurs so often, but I’ll couch it in terms of what happened today. \n\nI like milk in my coffee. A lot of milk. A lot of people find this very strange. A lot of people who serve coffee think I am mistaken in my preferences and do me the generous favor of upgrading me to cream free of charge. But that wasn’t today either. Today was a different free upgrade. \n\nToday I went to Starbucks and ordered a grande americano in a venti cup, which means 16 ounces of beverage in a 20 ounce cup. I started ordering this way just because it’s easier to say than trying to explain what I mean by “room for milk” and leaving it subjective. \n\nToday my kind and generous barista decided to do me a huge favor and comp me the extra water it would take to make my grande a venti, rather than wastefully serving me a cup a fifth empty. I appreciated her generosity but found myself facing a conundrum. Because an americano is a set number of shots of cappuccino diluted by water, dumping some out to make room for milk would’ve meant throwing away espresso that I paid a dollar a shot for (airport prices). So I asked her if she could remake the beverage the way I’d ordered it. \n\nWorse, after that I discovered that there was no milk out, as is often the case - because most people apparently have better taste than I do and Starbucks is generous, they only set out expensive half and half instead of the cheap watery milk a weirdo like me prefers. So after bothering her to prepare my coffee the way I’d ordered it, I needed to bother her again to pour me some milk. \n\nThat’s what happened today. Another variation on how this happens is that I order a coffee with milk and a well-meaning barista upgrades me to cream. I find cream utterly disgusting, outright nauseating, and just can’t stomach it at all, so when this happens I ask them to remake it. \n\nI’ve been trying to figure out if it’s my fault, but it doesn’t make any sense. No matter how bad of a lisp I must have, I can’t figure out how anyone could ever hear “cream” when I try to say “milk”, or “venti with extra water” when I say “grande in a venti cup.”\n\nAm I an asshole for insisting my coffee be made the way I order it? If so, how could I go about my life in a less assholish way without learning to drink scalding hot beverage with oil floating in it?",

      "description": "First Post on Reddit\n\nBackground info: I have been together with my wife now for almost 9 years and married for 1. We have been living together (rent) for close to 6 years I think. My wife is a anaphylactic to all nuts and is also epileptic. None of these have really bothered me in our relationship, it's just who she is. But about 2 years ago she had to start taking new medication because her old ones were not working really well. It made her very dependent physically and emotionally, on me, during this transition of the new drug. She was not able to work and was basically an emotional zombie. This all lasted about a year. \n\nFast forward to today, she is doing a lot better and has started going to work and is more independent. However, there is some issue that we are still dealing with. She is 75% -80% of the time always late for work or for any social outings. She has difficulty respecting when i say \"no\" to anything (ie. sex or personal space). Another issue that we always dealt with through our entire relationship is her weight. I will be the first to admit that i do not find it sexy but that does not stop my love for her. But its not just her \"looks\" that her weight effects but also my ability to take care of her. Post any major seizures that she can have i have to either roll her over into a recovery position or when she needs to, lift her to the bathroom cause she has to pee (you semi-ish loose a bit of bladder control post-seizures). I have hurt my back 3 times already lifting and turning her. Lastly, because of her medication changes there is a lot of emotional instability of which i am on the receiving end. Tho she has gotten a lot more stable as she becomes accustomed to the new medication.\n\nActual issue: We have been talking for the past year (since getting married) at getting a house. But with all the stress i have been facing with her I gave her a sort of proposal that if she were to focus on improving herself and reach a set number of goals, we would then buy a house. Because buying house would just cause a lot more stress that i am not emotionally and mentally ready to face with at this moment. She initially agreed to it. But then 2 months later she found her dream house and is trying to force me into getting into the motions of getting it. It started a very large argument and none of us are budging from our standpoint. She keeps repeating that I am \"killing her dreams and aspiration\" and that i dont want to move cause she has not fixed her \"weight issue\". When in reality i am just afraid of the probable accumulating stress and how its going to affect our relationship and my mental health\n\nI fucking love my wife! But i dont know what to do or respond sometimes.\n\nSorry for the length and most likely grammatical errors                      ",

      "description": "So: I’m a single 23 year old guy. I work in a lab, and we’ve taken volunteers to help with field work before. \n\nA few months back, I’m paired up with Ann (not her actual name) at a mass Audubon station, where we checked over deer registered during the first week of hunting season. Ann is from Vietnam. This is our first time meeting, and there’s a smidge of a language barrier. We’re stuck together for six hours or so, so we chat.\n\nShe mentions her hopes and dreams to go to med school, but that she’s concerned about taking the MCAT because her English isn’t very good. I tell her that I can’t really help with much of the rest of the rest, but if she needs a hand with the English portions, I could try to walk her through a practice exam. Admittedly, never actually thought she would take me up on it.\n\nFlash forward to last week- she found me on Facebook and asked me for help. She was nice enough, and since I had promised, I said yes.  \n\nA few things became pretty clear pretty quickly:\n\n1) It became very clear, very fast that she isn’t going to pass the MCAT- or at least not the sections she was going over with me. She seems to know this\n\n2) She mentioned that she doesn’t want to go back to Vietnam, her visa is expiring soon, and if she can’t pass the test she’ll either need to get married or head home.\n\n3) She was interested in doing /much/ more than studying for the MCAT\n\nNow, this is where friends have called me the asshole: she started calling herself short, fat, and ugly, more or less out of nowhere. I said she “was definitely short, but fat and ugly? Not so much.” Apparently this was leading her on that I was interested, while I thought it was just keeping someone from insulting themselves too harshly. \n\nAgain: I genuinely was only interested in helping her study.  Apparently, it’s pretty unreasonable to help a stranger like this and /not/ assume something sexual or beginnings of relationship-y are involved/will become involved. \n\nSo, when she offered me a tour of her apartment, and showed me to her bedroom: I said “oh, your bed is made differently than mine,” and played full-oblivious with her. Left pretty soon afterwards, with a hug and a “happy to help.”\n\nShe texted me the next day, very politely thanked me, and asked if I could help her again sometime. I said if she needs it, I can help; she thanked me again profusely, and then said she would be making me dinner to thank me.\n\nI said there was no need, I had promised I would help and so I did- she insisted repeatedly. Eventually, I agreed.\n\nAm I the asshole for genuinely only wanting to help this girl pass the MCAT, recognizing she wants something from me that I don’t want to reciprocate, but accepting a meal from her anyways?\n",

      "description": "Hi, all. Have lurked for a few months, but this is my first post.\n\nI'm a musician who works at a well-known and -regarded arts organization. I'm on a multi-year contract, and this is my last year before I, by my own choice, move on to freelance work. The pay is pretty terrible and the hours are even worse (six-day weeks on top of evening performances), but there are definitely some perks, and it's an organization that produces some truly incredible performances.\n\nI'm currently working on a project with a project manager who is new to working with musicians. Our personalities don't mesh at all, and neither do our work styles: for example, she enjoys being social in the work place and using rehearsal time to joke around, and I find this kind of banter really distracting when I'm trying to focus on getting something done. She also does a number of things -- liberally saying words like \"cunt\" and \"fuck\" during rehearsals, calling people for a three-hour rehearsal and then not using him/her, and micromanaging all creative decisions for the performers -- that really, really irk me. With these rehearsal techniques, it takes a really long time to get things done, and I frequently feel that my time is being wasted.\n\nI've piped up a couple of times during rehearsal (three times, max, over the course of five weeks) when things this manager has asked for haven't made sense to me, or if I've disagreed with them, but I pretty much always end up going along with what she wants. That being said, some of my aforementioned \"pipe-ups\" have, admittedly, been snarky, but I feel that my concerns are legitimate.\n\nJust this morning, I received a call from the music director on the project, and he flat-out said that my negativity has been palpable in the past few days, and asked if a few days off from rehearsal would help get me into a more positive frame of mind. This was definitely a wake-up call. \n\nSo, I'm asking: AITA? Is it my job not to say anything, even when I find her behavior unprofessional and unproductive? I plan to apologize to her because -- regardless of the fact that I still disagree with her opinions -- I shouldn't have been snarky. The lines are, I feel, somewhat blurred between employer and employee in the performing arts, and the egos are larger than life -- I'm out of touch with how to deal with a boss whose personality and management style really just doesn't jive with mine.",

      "description": "On mobile, all that good stuff, sorry for errors.\n\n\nIn the last few months, we've been in the process of moving houses because my fiances grandma, whom we were living with, passed away in early November, and she gave the house to my fiances father. And within the last few weeks, his family has waited until last minute to tell us we have to leave, and none of his family will allow us to stay with them since we have no place to go.\n\n\nWe got told last Friday that we have until TOMORROW to pack the entire house and be out because they're doing rennovations and we can't be here while they do it. His mom, who had originally said we can stay with them, waited until yesterday to tell us that we are no longer allowed to stay there. So, this brings me to feeling like an asshole.\n\n\nSince all of this is happening right at christmas time, and none of them have helped us, or even offered a couch to rest our heads on, I told my fiance last night that I would not be attending any of his family's christmas gatherings because I just don't feel welcome. His entire family has turned their backs on us, but hes making me feel like Im an asshole because I don't want to go.\n\n\nSo, am I an asshole? I feel like maybe I am being a little over dramatic, but my feelings are deeply hurt and I don't want to spend my christmas with people who are okay with letting their son and I be homeless right before the holidays.",

      "description": "I know the title sounds horrible, but hear me out. Nearly 6 years ago I met this guy online, started chatting, became pretty good friends. He helped me through some really tough stuff like my grandpa passing away, my mom remarrying and having to deal with my verbally abusive mom. \n\nAnyways, about a year in, I had left my phone on a side table and my sister asked if she could use it to check the weather forecast for the week. I said of course, and while she’s doing that, my mom catches a glimpse of a notification with a name of a person she hasn’t met before. And she flips out, does all the usual things like calling me entitled and telling me I’m stupid and all of that stuff. The typical argument of “what if he’s an axe murderer!”  I’m a minor at this time, so she grounds me and forbids me to ever speak of this person again. \n\nLet’s flash forward to 2017-2018. Me and this guy have been dating for a while now, secretly of course. More shitty things have happened, and my mom and step dad are still the worst. Every time I get close to telling them, maybe as their Christmas or birthday gift to me, a few weeks before I had planned to do it, they do something that makes me change my mind. \n\nFor example, my mom overheard me talking on FaceTime about how I’m bisexual, and rages about “how could I have not told her?”. And telling me that if I want to ‘come out’ it needs to be a big deal and I can’t just say it like it’s a normal, everyday thing. Next week, overheard my step dad telling my mom, “You know I think she just said that to get on your nerves.” And demanded I come out to him separately from everybody else. (This is the type of guy that is convinced every bisexual eventually cheats on their partner.) \n\nOr, another example: I went to 5 different therapists and psychologists over the past years leading up to 2018, all because I needed someone to talk to about how to deal with my mom and all that stuff. The reason I had so many was either A: the third session was typically when the therapist asked my mom to sit in on the session and I would talk about how I felt. She would cry and act sad, then once we got in the car or home she would yell at me for making her look bad and feeling entitled. \nOr B: She told me I didn’t need therapy because all it was was angst and I should stop going, and I couldn’t ignore her because her benefits paid for my sessions. \n\nAnyways, I start planning this month-long backpacking trip across Europe, worked full time every summer, 2 part time jobs during the school year. Originally the plan was for me to go with (a now ex)friend. We planned about half of it together, but working over the summer and living in staff accommodations together made us have a bad fallout, so I decided to go anyways and go with the boyfriend, all while telling my parents I was still going with my friend. \n\nEverything about the lie is going well until I get dropped off at the airport and they realize my friend isn’t there. Eventually I tell them that she bailed on me (which she did) and that I was going alone (which was a lie). I was past security at this point, and my parents are crying and freaking out, mom is offering to leave her job and go with me and I tell her no. I leave on the plane, and since I wasn’t a minor and paid everything out of pocket, all under my name, they couldn’t do anything. \n\nAnyways the month passes, I eventually tell them, they’re pissed, they say I ruined the family and caused them ultimate trauma. They threatened to sue my boyfriend, my step dad told me to skip my flight home and stay in Europe, so I skipped my flight, apparently he never told my mom that he told me that, and then they both got angry at me. Eventually was forced back home. ",

He thinks I should have made the demand instead of making alternative arrangements.\n\n---\n\nWhen I got home from work (about 6ish) tonight, he was busy with his hobby, said he would be another half hour and he'd make dinner tonight. About 40 mins later he told me he'd be busy with his hobby all night but he'd still do dinner.\n\nIt got to 20:40, he was still engrossed in his hobby and when he's like that he tends not to be hungry so I decided just to order food in. I popped into his room to see if he wanted something ordered too. He started berating me for not telling him I was hungry and wanted dinner and we got into an argument (he later told me I had a tone when I asked if he wanted anything, I hadn't intended to and apologised as soon as he told me). He was also surprised that I had an expected time frame for dinner and that 20:40 was past it.\n\nI was raised with the view that it would be incredibly rude to go to someone and demand they complete a favour they had previously offered; I also believe that it's poor form not to ensure you follow through on things you say you'll do. He thinks that the situation represents shitty communication on my part and I should have told him to make me dinner when I got hungry even though he was busy with his hobby and clearly happy doing it (so I didn't want to take him away from it).\n\nWe're each convinced we're in the right and his level of confidence has put some doubt in my mind.

      "description": "I met my friend (let's call him Joe) in college. We Became close when One day when I was having a bad time because I was on a verge of a breakup with my ex, he was there to talk it through with me. I appreciated his help and I felt like I wanted to get close to him.\n\nWe started to hang out a bit more, and although we both were different in personalities, I felt like we understood each other. But at the same time, he wouldn't really tell me much about himself. Or if he did I never really felt like he was being vulnerable around me. Additionally, he didn't talk about who he likes very much most likely due to him being closeted (it's an assumption but I can't picture him being straight).  \n\nI confronted him about this and he would say stuff like \"I think you can be friends without knowing everything about me\" or \"I'm worried you would tell others\". I confronted him multiple times about this but it seems like each time he had a different excuse. \n\nNow to be fair, I wasn't the perfect friend either. There were times where I didn't hit him up because I was hanging out with my gf. But when he called me out on it I tried making an effort hanging out with him. But each time I would hang out it felt more like it was out of obligation rather than the feeling of \"I really wanna hang out with Joe!\" I felt like the friendship turned into \"I owe him for that time where he helped me out so I should hang out\". \n\nOn the 5th anniversary of my dad's passing, my girlfriend wrote a tribute post about my dad on facebook. Joe messaged me a few hours later asking if I was ok with her posting. I said yeah it was very sweet. I asked him why he asked and he said that he felt like it wasn't something that needed to be publicized and that he was surprised that I let her post it considering how I don't really talk about my dad. I kinda felt offended because I recently tagged him in a long post where I talked about my dad (granted it was very long and under the influence of drugs so I get why people won't read it) and also it kinda felt like he was throwing some shade at my gf (also if I really had a issue with my gf posting I would've just told her). Now I know that I probably was overreacting and that he didn't mean malice but it didn't make me feel good because I felt like he was projecting his ways of dealing with personal issues which is to be private about it and not talk about them. \n\nI still hung out with him once or twice after that but it felt like we were just avoiding any deep talk. He invited me to a trip to Puerto Rico and I just said that I probably won't go and that was the last time we talked. Half of the time I feel good that I left the friendship because I felt like we weren't compatible. He wanted me to be more committed, and I wanted him to be more open. But the other half still feels guilty because I felt like he did care for me and I don't like abandoning people who actually do care about me. What do you think, AITA?",

      "description": "About three weeks ago, girlfriend was driving while I was a passenger. We were at a four way stop and if I'm being totally honest, I think she went when it wasn't her turn but it was really close and her car and the other guys hit each other at an angle so it was really hard to tell who was at fault. \n\nMy girlfriend is about 3/4 African American but still somewhat light skinned. When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. \n\nWhen the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like \"this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless (and spineless) and kept telling myself \"say something, just say something\" but never did. \n\n\nThis clearly set the cops in her favor and the guy was ticketed for running the four way stop. The cops actually never even asked me what I saw and of course the other guy denied everything and actually looked like he was about to break out in tears and said that he was a retired school counselor and would never even imagine to say such words. I think there was something about my girlfriend being young and pretty that the cop was far more willing to take her side. \n\n\nThe other guy was ticketed for running a stop sign, was found at fault for the accident and her insurance company is actively seeking his company to pay for the entire accident which I assume will mean his premiums will skyrocket. We also have some sort of laws in our state about elderly people requiring super expensive driving exams if they cause an accident so this guy may even lose his independence over this. I am literally sleepless over this. \n\n\nMy girlfriend truly doesn't care and all she sees is that she got away with it. I am still very much deciding if I can stay in this relationship because she feels zero remorse. But obviously that's not why I'm here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not speaking up?\n",

      "description": "I'll give you some context.\n\n4 years ago I met my best friend, i'll call her Molly. She and I were only two until we met another 4 girls, two of them have another group and they are very nice to me.\n\nLast year Molly met another girl (I'll call her Mimi) and became best friends with her because I started to hate Molly at some point, I was always listening to her talking about new friends she made in social media and that was everything she talked about, and everytime I became more and more tired of her (That's why I can be the asshole here)\n\nMimi and Molly told everyone they were best friends and I thought I was still Molly's best friend but I was okay with Mimi so I didn't care too much because if Molly was happy with that, she couldn't be a bad person or anything. And everything starts to go wrong when ny other 2 friends started to replace me with Mimi, but i thought it was okay too because maybe she was better than me doing everything my friends like (We have nothing in common) and I didn't care too much either.\n\nA few months ago my friends started to play volleyball and personally I don't like sports, but i knew that I can't just say \"Hey, i don't like that Sport so you can't play it\", so I just sat and watched them play Volleyball and I was okay with that, but then, they started to go out together without inviting me and then started to talk about it in front of me like i wasn't even there, they started to ignore me sometimes and we don't talk anymore, they only talk about Volleyball and hanging out together without me. In October I decided to leave the group and I was to tell them in November, but there was my birthday and they remembered it, and then was Molly's birthday and I didn't wanted to ruin it so I decided to tell them in December, but we ended classes and we just talked again to organize the birthday of one of them that is the same day de start classes again and I don't want to ruin it, but i need to tell them the truth and that i don't want to hang out with them anymore. I don't know what to do or if I am wrong or if I'm just overthinking everything. \n\nI am wrong? What should I do?",

      "description": "I run my own company. I belong to a job where looking presentable is fairly important. Formal attire is definitely encouraged.\n\nI myself believe that there should be a sense of discipline and order at the workplace. Dressing well is something which compliments this.\nSo while it's not emphasized too much, every person at my work place does dress up well. I myself always wear a suit to lead by example.\nThey honestly don't have any problem with this. We were a team of 9 men and one woman. (I only had men applying at first, hence the skewed ratio. It's more balanced now.)\n\nWe have a really friendly relationship. They get cakes and heartfelt gifts for me on my birthday and vice-versa. We are planning on watching avengers:endgame together. So it's great.\n\nI did hire a woman about 3 months ago. She is pretty efficient and didn't need any help in particular. \n\nOne thing that stopped me from liking her is what she was wearing, or the lack of it. I explicitly told her I expected professional attire and spoke about it's importance during her interview, and she eagerly agreed back then.\n\nBut during the first week or so, she wore track pants,loose t shirts, sheer clothes that showed her nipples, sleeveless blouses and yoga pants. \nI just politely asked her if she had a formal attire, and she said she would get it soon.\nBut then she came in these booty shorts. I gave her the address for my friend who is a designer and told her it was on me, since she seemed to be having difficulty getting a proper dress.\n\nTurns out she didn't contact him at all. She kept wearing informal stuff for the whole week. When they finally got something remotely professional, it was honestly pretty revealing. Pencil skirt, like 8 inches long, not exaggerating. She wore track pants the next day, tank top.\nI had a few other qualified applicants for her position, and her job required her to be fairly isolated from the group. \nI fired her saying I didn't think she fit in, but I wished her the best and was wrote a letter of recommendation for her.\n\nI thought the whole thing had ended...I had someone else replace her. Had the fortune of getting 6 new ,really promising employees too.\n\n But the secretary showed me a Facebook post by her where she said that Working with me was a horrible experience and that I was a misogynistic asshole.\n\nI honestly acted like I brushed it off, but it did hurt and it sat in my mind for a long time. I asked my other employees if they thought I was misogynistic, they said no. We are always frank with each other. If they think my poem is shitty, they tell me so, so I trust them \n\nBut it's still in my head. I just wanted an unbiased opinion on here, hope you guys could help me out. I want to be the best boss possible.",

      "description": "Hi guys, first of all, please bear with my not so good english.  \n\n\nMy gf and I been dating for 2 years now, she's 24 and i'm 23.  \n\n\nShe's the lead singer at her family folkloric group/band (that's pretty normal in my country). Her brother is keyboardist and his dad is a singer too. Most of this business is managed by her dad. Usually, the group/band has the same musicians apart from the family. Same bass player, same guitar player, etc. Only spot that's always open is the drummer spot, since most of the drummers of the band are always busy.   \n\n\nThat's where her ex comes in. Her ex used to play at the band, that's where they met. They had a 2 year relationship plagued of physical abuse (not really punches, but he used to grab her and pull her, leaving her with marks whenever she wanted to leave him) and toxicity (he used to crush her phones, control her, tell her how to dress, etc). Neither his dad or his brother knew the kind of relationship they had, but most of them were against it since they were work partners.  \n\n\nWhen she finally left him, he made some drama, cryed in front of her house and finally left to another state. She told me the abuse and his attitude where a big part of her overcoming that awful experience, she was able to feel nothing for him very quickly after they broke up.   \n\n\nA year later, he came back from his trip, and started working with them again. My gf told me since she didn't feel anything for him, she didn't feel like telling anyone or feeling bad about the past. So she kinda ignored him for the rest of the time.   \n\n\nTheir relationship happened about 5-6 years ago. Ever since, her ex has never been disrespectful or anything (to my knowledge).   \n\n\nThe thing is, I never knew he physically abused her til a month ago. I never felt jealously or anything before that, but now I feel annoyed and uncomfortable everytime he's coming to perform with them. To be more specific, what I feel is a \"this guy shouldn't be here, he's a bad person\" kind of thing. She knows that I feel like this, we talked about it some weeks ago.  \n\n\nLast week we discovered we were going to another state since her family was going to perform there, thing is... he's coming with us. Her brother (who knows about the past since she explained everything to him two weeks ago) is very supportive now (he's the one that told us her ex was coming with us this time).  \n\n\nI tried to act normal with her, but I can't. She got a little mad at me for getting visibly uncomfortable (actually, we spoke it on chat), and I told her that I needed her to understand me, to which she replied me that her past shouldn't be a problem on our relationship since she doesn't feel hate or anything for him.   \n\n\nSo here I am, I wan't to know If I'm an asshole for hating the idea that he's constantly near her family.  \n\n\nI'm really sorry If my english makes it difficult to understand, I'll answer any question if needed.  \n\n\nThanks in advance.  \n\n\n  \n",

      "description": "I usually dont second guess myself but theres been enough blowblack against me irl that I figured id ask for some outside opinions.\n\nMe and my brother both work for my older cousin. More specifically, i work for my cousin and he works under me. He begged and pleaded for his current position, and now that he has it he acts like an embarrassment. Constantly drinking, starting fights, and now whoring despite having a wife pregnant with their first child at home.\n\nI never say this out loud but I hate my brother. He is loud, arrogant, and stupid. If i could go back in time and drown him in the ocean as a baby I would. I look after him because of my mother, but in reality I feel nothing but contempt for him.\n\nHe knows this to an extent. I wouldnt say that im necessarily harder on him but maybe I am, who knows. Some of his traits make him a good earner, for instance he has no fear and hes not afraid to take risks. But his stupidity causes more problems than its worth.\n\nBack to the whoring though, he has been having an open affair with a known working girl. By open I mean people who arent in our company have approached me, telling me that hes been seen at the fucking mall with her. OUR mall. The local one that his wife attends.\n\nMy sister in law doesnt know anything as far as I know, I cant confirm. But hes making a fool out of himself and me and my cousin by extension. I told him he had to stop seeing her, and that if anyone tells me theyve seen him with her, he would regret it.\n\nHe agreed, but then went over my head to our cousin. I could have strangled him right there. My cousin respects my decision but asks me if im being too harsh on my brother. I tell him hes making my sister in law look like an idiot, and that hes disgracing me.\n\nTwo other men approached me asking about the decision I made, apparently my brother has been whining which is another issue, and they pretty much disagree. I know they disagree because they dont want me \"regulating\" their lives, but my brother is a unique case in my eyes since its my sister in law and my nephew in her belly.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation or is my brother?",

My mom has always been terrible with money and as a teenager I would lend her quite significant sums of money to help her hide it from my dad as I thought he was sort of a terrible dad.

Anyhow my grandma came into quite a bit of money and helped my mom out and I never heard about it again so I figured she was done with that shit. Skip up to this December 7 years later and my sister confides that mom has credit card debt and wants my sister to take out a loan to help her with it. I get pissed and dig around a bit only to find that my mom has borrowed almost 10k$ from my brother who is 17 (he is like insanely talented and manages a bouncy castle type place, he earns way more than I do, honestly I’m so proud of him). So yeah shit sucks, my mom sort of poisoned me against my dad, honestly I only think my dad stays with my mom on account of my younger siblings the youngest are twin boys at 8yo. As I moved out and got into a serious relationship, engaged with a 4 month old (very lovely) baby, I realized my mom is probably a narcissist and manipulative. Aita for not telling my dad yet, wbta for telling my dad? I don’t think the option of confronting my mom would bring any positives. So what do you think?",

      "description": "Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. \n\nShe came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more \"appropriate\" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.\n\nFor her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.\n\nLunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. \n\nSo I explained that she shouldn't share \"spicy\" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send \"age appropriate\" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB &amp; J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.\n\nI called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is \"a little kid\" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating \"adult food\" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said \"No\" and \"This really shouldn't be a big deal.\"\n\nThis might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. \n\nJust to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and \"Are the other kids making fun of you?\" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. \n\nSo AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?",

      "description": "So when I was in 9th grade there was this one kid who bullied me well call him Brian. So I was no small kid. About 200lbs but neither was Brian. So everyday in gym and other classes he would make fun of me for my size. And usually I would just brush it off but eventually it got to me. I couldn’t take it it was over a month of it. And the part that really made me mad was this kid was just as far if not fatter than me. \n\nSo fast forward to about 2 weeks after I was fed up with it. There was no end in sight so I plotted my revenge. I decided that I was going to bring in a digital scale and tell him we will Both get on it. I said “if I weigh more bully me all you want. But if you weigh more this stops.” So I get on the scale but he refuses to. So we got throughout gym class and all his friends keep telling him to get on it. I’m feeling like an absolute legend that finally got this kid to shut up. So at the end of gym he still said no. So we are waiting to be let out to busses and his friends keep telling him to get on it so he finally says yes. I pull the scale out of my bag and set it on the floor. He takes a second looks at it then picks it up and just slammed it to the floor. I was dumb founded. We all just started at him waiting and the bell rang and we all went on our separate ways. \n\nWhen I got home I decided screw this kid so I made a bunch of fake sad stories about the loss of my scale and stuff like “R.I.P scale 2006-2014” stuff like that. He eventually started messaging me saying I was in the wrong. That it was unfair for me to try and make him get on the scale. So Am I the Asshole here?",

      "description": "TLDR: 8 Year relationship. She recently made a new friend on a work trip, gained feelings for him, lied about it, lied a second time when she drove him (and him alone, home after a work trip), now wants me to trust that he is just a friend.\n\nThis turned out longer than expected. Sorry.\n\nBackstory:\n\nWhere do I start? GF (Amber) and I together for about 8 years now. Living together for around 3. In love, normal issues in the relationship, nothing we can't get over. I've never really been the jealous type, don't care if she talks to other guys, has other guy friends (she says she doesn't get along with girls, which is true), and she talks to me about them.\n\nThe Incident:\n\nDecember 2018 she had a work trip to Nashville. Its the second time she went to Nashville for a work trip, once the previous year. She is supposed to be training yada yada...it's more of a party trip. Drinks with Co-Workers every night, live music, dancing. All in all, a good time. This is all fine, it happened the first time in Nashville and it was expected this time. \n\nUsually I sleep like a rock, no issues getting to bed, but for some reason this trip I couldn't get myself to fall asleep. Something had me anxious, and worried. I didn't know how I knew, but I could tell something was off with her. She was more distant that usual. She told me everything that she was up to, who she was hanging out with, all that good stuff...but I could just tell something was off. She normally keeps me totally up to date with her day, especially travel days. If we can't keep up periodically throughout the day she likes to re-cap at the end of the night. None of this behavior was present throughout the trip, but I get it. Busy schedule, balancing partying while still getting up early enough to pretend to pay attention in training, all while in a different timezone. Difficult stuff. Travel home day was really telling. She didn't update me at all. At the airport, then radio silence, layover, radio silence, landed radio silence.\n\nWe have location sharing turned on between the two of us. I was following her drive home from the airport because I was worried about her. Long drive late at night after lots of sleepless nights. She looked like she stopped by her friends place to drop her off, that's normal. Hmmmm, that's a place I haven't seen before...interesting. Turns out she dropped off Hank at his place...interesting. She was there only a minute or so before continuing the journey home, seems normal.\n\nI thought maybe I was just being crazy, but I knew something was up in my gut. Over the next couple of days, Hank's name kept coming up. And she used a lot of \"We\", and I guess that was an attempt at making me thing it was her friend Brittany. I could tell she wasn't lying in the truest definition, but she was definitely hiding something.\n\nI put all this together and wrote it down. I am not great at communicating my thoughts, so I showed her what I wrote. The next paragraphs are what I showed her.\n\n\"\nOk I'm not an idiot and I don't think you are either. I know that you and Hank had a thing in Nashville. I don't know the extent of it, I don't know if anything physical happened but I'm fairly certain there was at least an emotional line crossed by either you or the both of you. I know that you suspect me of knowing. Maybe you are worried about it maybe you aren't.\n\nI get it, drunk dancing every night, hanging out all weekend and on the flights and at the airport. Sharing headphones watching a movie, driving him home, and whatnot. I think it's exactly what happened at Hiedi's wedding with her brother.\n\nWhat really worries me is that you aren't admitting it to me.\n\nYou are hiding something and it scares me. You know that's why I've been up all night, why I can't eat. Maybe you are afraid to tell me now that you have seen how hurt I am. Maybe you just don't want to make it worse. \n\nI've given you the ability to tell me, and I'm sure it's hard to admit to my face. Honestly, I just want to know what you feel. My heart has been literally pounding for days of anxiety, my gut is all inside out, I can't focus at work or on anything. Like I said already, I'm scared and I don't know what to do.\n\"\n\nShe admitted to it. Ouch, that stung.\n\nThe next week she had a work event, he works in the same office. Paranoia all over the place, she is still distant, not telling me things. I know he is going to be there, I know they will see each other, but what can I do? I pretend to be ok with it, I act mature while dying inside. She told me she has to pick up her friend, she did. \n\nAs mentioned before she usually tells me when she is leaving a place, but I haven't heard from her in a while. I am a wreck. I check location, she's on the freeway. Punch to the gut.\n\nShe gets home and she says she drove her friend Brittany home (she drove right past Brittany's place on the freeway, there's no way she dropped her off). She gets home, says she really tired, goes to bed. I lie awake in bed dying inside. I didn't mention anything about it, don't want to bring up anything that would cause additional stress.\n\nAbout a week later I casually bring it up, say its been eating at me. She claims she drove Brittany home. I don't call her a liar. I give her the look, ask if she is sure. She breaks, says she took Hank and Ryan(another friend [really just a friend]) back to the office to go to their cars. Again I don't call her a liar. She takes about 10 minutes to admit she took only him.\n\nOuch. Feels good to be right, but it feels so bad.\n\n\nThe Now:\nShe swears that now they are just friends. They talked it out. She messages him on Skype sometimes (I don't know how much, I just know it is more than none). They don't work in the same department, there is no real need to chat.\n\nEarlier this week, she asks if it is ok to go to lunch with him. I can't really say no, so I let her know my feelings but agree to let her. She thinks that I am just going to have to trust her, and get passed it somehow. \n\nI can't trust her. Maybe eventually I can, but it is too soon to write off the feelings that they had.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year now. My family and friends have all met him and they all at leat dislike him. At first I thought they'll get used to me dating him, but after a year, it doesn't seem so, since they still complain when I say I'm going to go meet him, or outright say they hate me dating him. \n\nNow generaly, I get along great with my family and I love them a lot. It's just this particular thing that's causing a lot of tension and arguments. I love my boyfriend and I don't really think he is to blame for anything here. \n\nOne of the reasons my family has stated for disliking him is that he \"doesn't treat me right\". I rarely drive (can't afford a car, can rarely borrow one), so I sometimes go visit him by bus (he lives about a 15min car drive away, about 30min by 2 buses). This bothers my family a lot, they think he should drive to pick me up, if he wants to see me. \n\nWhen we go out, we'll usually split the bill, or I'll pay, or a friend, or he... We don't really keep track, but it usually does involve me paying at least for myself. I don't have a problem with that, but my family does. They are all pretty oldfashioned when ot comes to these things (although my parents for example are under 50) and believe he should be paying for me while we're dating (and because he has a job while I'm in college and not working). They also claim that this is an indication that he does not value me as much as he should. \n\nI have told them that times have changed and it's perfectly normal to split the bill and for the woman to drive herself to see her boyfriend as well, but they keep going back to how \"if he valued me, he'd make the effort\"\n\nAnd now I'm just getting tired of the constand arguments I suppose... I do love my boyfriend, and I guess I' just wondering whether I'd be the asshole if I broke up with him because I'm tired of other people, or if I should make more of an effort to change their mids or just not care?

      "description": "Yes, I understand how petty the title sounds, but please allow me to explain.\n\nHe has a 2008 and I have a 2013. His car is manual and mine is automatic (surprised?). I can drive his car, but barely. I'm very short, so reaching the clutch is really difficult for me to do. I have to push the seat up as far as it goes and still twist my body slightly in order to fully engage the clutch and change gears. Sitting so close to the steering wheel makes it difficult to turn. It's really uncomfortable. Since it's so awkward to drive his car, I stall out and am definitely a hazard to myself and others. I hate that I can't drive it well.. and feel unsafe driving his car. \n\nThere is also only 1 key to his car cause he somehow lost the other one (that's another story..). Most the time when he leaves, he doesn't leave the key for me anyway.\n\nThere are certain times he wants to take my car somewhere instead of his own. Why? Just because he wants to take my car... no functional reasons or anything like that. If something is wrong with his car, that's a different story. So I'm forced to stay home with no means of escape. This makes me anxious for various reasons:\n\n* We have 2 kids, a 2.5 y.o. and an 8 wk. old. If I have no car, I have no means to escape for an emergency. If there's a fire or other ER at home, I can't get my kids in the car to go someplace warm and safe. I don't want to risk my kids' lives because I can't drive his car.\n\n* If he has an accident and ends up in the hospital, I can't get down there easily. \n\n* If the car breaks down and he needs a ride, I'm no help. Can't go get him. If I take Lyft, I have to get the car seats in their cars (do they even allow that?) and somehow lug them and my 2 kids around after.  That also costs money.\n\n* We're alone out here.. no family nearby and really no friends. We moved here a few years ago and man is it hard to start over and make new friends, and our family is all 2+ hrs away. Limited support to ask for a ride.\n\n* He is fully aware of my inability to drive his car even if he did leave me the key.\n\n* He has horrible cell phone etiquette.. it's not always charged, is prepaid and sometimes out of minutes, it's usually on silent so he doesn't even hear it, and sometimes he loses it and doesn't even have it on him. So if you're thinking I can just call him and he'll come home that's not ways the case!\n\nThere are various other things my paranoid brain thinks of, but I'm not going to list everything. \n\nNow, I've explained my concerns to him several times. Sometimes he obliges, but most times he tells me to stop by \"BS.\" He knows I don't like feeling stuck with no independent way to get around. I understand in a true ER there are ER vehicles and personnel, and if I REALLY need to get somewhere I can find a way, but I shouldn't need to rely on 3rd parties if I have my own reliable transportation. If he's going someplace close, fine, but most the time he's going someplace 20 mins away. Which means he's gone for a few hours at a time.\n\nI'll admit it: at times I do feel like an asshole because it's not the end of the world. I get that. But the fact that he completely dismisses my concerns like they're nothing really hurts. I believe my concerns are valid. Besides, why the hell shouldn't I have access to my own car, especially the only one I can drive? \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So I made a Tinder about 3 months ago, less out of finding a partner and more out of trying to practice my people skills (I'm socially awkward when it comes to the other sex) and I met two nice girls on Tinder (1st is 1G, second is 2G) .\n\nI met both of them IRL, told them the main reason I was on Tinder, which they related to (turns out alot of fellow introverts exist out there), they're very nice ladies, I've met both IRL and I hang out with each one to the point that I'm pretty much solid friends with both. Then 1G (who I knew longer then 2G) told me her feelings 2 DAYS AGO and wanted to take the relationship further, and after some thinking I agreed.\n\nBut idk how to deal with 2G, she hasn't said anything feelings wise to me but I don't want to be a dick and cut her off, I'd love to still be friends with her but I also have NO IDEA what to say to her about 1G (they both knew I was talking to other women, they asked relationship status and I said \"Just a friend I met on Tinder\"), will she be pissed? Am I an player for talking to multiple women? Am I an asshole?!",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years now. We met in high school and currently go to colleges about two hours apart so we see each other about every other weekend. He goes to a big state school and is in a fraternity and I go to a small liberal arts school with no party scene.\n\nAfter joining his fraternity he began smoking a lot of weed. I have smoked with him in the past but I always get paranoid and I don’t enjoy smoking. His frequent use was making me uncomfortable and I was worried about him and his future (he ended up being put on academic probation first term). \n\nOne night that I was already in a super bad place emotionally I realized that he was smoking on a Wednesday after partying all weekend and Monday, with plans to party on Thursday or something like that. I called my mom crying about how I didn’t know what to do. I wrote him a letter because I didn’t want to verbally lash out and say things that I didn’t mean. \n\nI read it to him over FaceTime the next day after I had calmed down and decided that I stood by what I had written. I essentially told him that I was worried about him and that I didn’t know how it would affect our relationship. He started out being defensive and saying that he wasn’t worried because he only smokes after he’s done with homework and that the academic probation was a fluke and now he’s working extra hard. He thought that I should have no right to control what he does when we’re not together. I combatted by saying that even when we’re not together physically we are still in a relationship and I am just worried about it. \n\nAfter a few more discussions we have come to a compromise; he agreed to cut back to smoking 3 times a week and not smoke when we are together, period. It has been working out really well so far imo. I trust him fully and I know that he really cares about me. \n\nI just don’t know where the line is between controllling and concern is. I don’t want to be too controlling so I am glad that our current system works for us, but we both agree that ideally I can eventually get to a point where he can make his own choices about when to smoke or not.

It happens every year and it is not too far from where we live now, so not really \"once in a lifetime\", in my opinion.\n\nWhile I slept he bought bus tickets for me and my parents to go after they arrive (we have to go to that town either way), and a ticket for him, much earlier in the day, so that he can see the city/event. So I'll pick up my parents alone and then go to that town. That is not a huge problem for me to do alone, except that I feel abandoned.\n\nSo. Who is being a dick here?

For a bit of context, I am in Canada but a majority of the company is from the USA. \n\nIn our department we had a chat about it, and some people felt that pepe was offensive as it had been used by the alt-right community and could be seen as a \"hate symbol\". I really didn't think of it that way, although I had known of its uses before in that space. Most of the uses of pepe I see are just on reddit/4chan memes and I never really thought anyone would take offensive to just seeing pepe, but that the context behind it would be important as well. Like an emoji \"feelsbadman\" would obviously be reacted to differently than a pepe with anti-semetic text or images.  \n\nOverall, AITA for posting pepe emojis in a work slack channel? ",

      "description": "So a short backstory on me, I am a model. And with that most of my previous relationships stem from the guys I am dating on really dating me because of my looks and the \"status symbol\" of dating a model not because of me as a person.\n\nThis is something that has caused a lot of anxiety and depression in my life and I have been really trying to find people in my life that care about me not what I look like. Now that is not to say that my looks can't play a role (physical attraction is important to me as well) but I can't be with anyone where that is the only or main reason why they are dating me.\n\nSo that brings me to a guy a started dating fairly recently. I really like him and he seems like a good guy. Takes interest in my hobbies and is supportive of what I do. He enjoys lazy days around the house and cooking for me at home instead of always wanting to go out (which with a lot of guys it just seemed like they wanted to show me off). So I really really like him.\n\nBut his friend DM'd me the other day and told me, \"Hey, just thought you should know. You boyfriend has been telling anyone who will listen about all the dirty shit he gets to do with 'this model chick I have been banging'. I'd want to know. Hope for the best!\"\n\nI have only met this guy once and I don't know how close he is to my boyfriend nor do I know why he told me this. For all I know he is just trying to start drama. The problem is I know how badly I want to believe my boyfriend. And if he were to tell me that it isn't true I would probably believe him. But that thought of \"what if\" would constantly be in my head from now on.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if for the next month or so I stop wearing makeup when we go out and I don't put out at all (just come up with whatever excuse I need to when he starts trying to make a move)? If I test what his motives truly are? \n\nPart of me feels like this is wrong but the other part knows this is the only way I can fully 100% put this behind me. And if his friend is lying I can commit to him 100%",

One girl there is close with Katie and others in the group but I don't know her very well. We'll call her Stuck Up Bitch (SUB). Now SUB is one of those entitled people that pretends to know everything and be better than everyone. \n\nI decided last minute to attend this get together and when I showed up realized the place was a hookah bar. Now I have quite a bit of experience with hookahs. They are part of my culture. I own one. I have been to many hookah bars in my life. However, I don't smoke anymore because ya know it's horrible for you. I ordered a drink and sat down. \n\nNow most of the girls didn't know what they were doing including SUB. I untangled the hose a couple times and tried to explain that you don't want inhale into your lungs but just into your mouth. SUB exclaimed that she she already knew that but she hasn't smoked in a while so one time won't hurt. Fine whatever. I asked when the last time she smoked was. She said high school. I quietly asked Katie how often they smoked in high school and she told me SUB was playing it up. They only did it a handful of times. \n\nThe coal on the hookah started getting low but there was plenty of tobacco left so SUB asked a waiter for a new one. He walked away and a few minutes later the owner came over and said if we want to repack the hookah we'd have to pay for another. SUB said no we just want a new coal. The owner said they don't do that. And that's when SUB WENT OFF on him. She was flipping out about how every other hookah place would give customers as many coals as they needed and she would never come back here and tell all her friends to not come here blah blah blah.\n\nAs we were leaving I went up to the bar to close my tab. I'd developed a rapport with the bar tender and felt bad so i told her SUB was a kind of a bitch and I'm sorry they had to deal with that.  She laughed and said the owner was tough but she'd let him know and thanked me. \n\nAfter I walked back to the group one of the girls asked me what we'd been talking about and I admitted I apologised on behalf of our group and SUB. She gave me a dirty look and told me I should have stuck up for a fellow girl... what?!\n\nHere's the thing SUB wasn't wrong about the coal. Their policy is bullshit and I've never been to a hookah bar that wouldn't give you a new coal. However, the way she flipped out was so rude and embarrassing. The staff had been really nice all night and I didn't want them to associate me with SUB if I go back there. AITA? ",

      "description": "I would like to start with saying that I know ignoring messages may not be the best way to handle this, but I'm really struggling right now. I have depression and a panic disorder, which makes talking to people I don't know when I'm not mentally prepared really difficult. I am currently seeing a therapist for this. \nMy job is in retail. I honestly hate it, but for right now I don't have another option. \nI work with a lot of younger people who don't seem terribly responsible. On one hand, I understand how things can get really crazy. I'm a young adult too, and juggling school, work, and other personal issues can be awful. I get it.\nBut I still have little sympathy for people who flake on responsibility. And that's how I feel a lot of my coworkers are. There are a couple specific people I work with who are *constantly* asking me to come in last minute (if I'm lucky 3 hours ahead of time) and cover for them, or trade shifts. I just went through my phone and I easily get 2 to 3 requests from the same few people **every week**, going all the way back to when I first started. These people frequently ignore my schedule and availability when they ask too, which is extremely annoying. So often I have to say no just because the shift I'm covering overlaps with one I'm already working, or because I'm at school. \nI thought me saying no, politely, a few times, would deter them from asking me. But it hasn't. They ask with the same frequency, for seemingly no reason. Some of them have taken to trying to persuade me even after the no, saying things like \"you'll get more hours!\" My anxiety is bad enough as it is (I'll start shaking and have heart palpitations when I get one of these texts) and not respecting my boundaries makes it worse. I get very irritable. It's to the point where I don't trust myself to respond even because I think I might snap at them. \nI did not give my phone number out to these people. I didn't even consent to have all my coworkers able to contact me on my phone. And I'm not  close to the coworkers who are asking all this of me. Some of them have been pretty rude to me, but most of them barely talk to me at work. Part of that is because I'm very quiet in person (especially in the break room, where I can relax and not have to put on this fake outgoing customer service persona) but still. At least try to be friendly to me, maybe?  \nSo because of those reasons I've just stopped replying all together. Clearly my no means nothing, and my pre existing schedule means nothing. And I don't have the mental stamina to argue, nor do I think I owe anyone a reason for my no (in my experience a \"no\" with an excuse attached is often seen by the other person as a \"convince me!\"). \nI would also like to add that the scheduling manager is super nice and reasonable about availability. I've asked for time off a couple times for fun things and it's *always* been approved. We also get our schedules two weeks in advance. The manager will help you out if the new schedule doesn't work for you too. I see very few reasons that a person would consistently need to find someone to cover super last minute. \nBut I also know that if someone had a legitimate reason to skip work it would be awful (and possibly put you at risk of termination) if no one helped you out. Especially if you're stuck waiting on someone to respond to you. \nSo, all this considered, am I the asshole? ",

This concert is a very important one to me, because the artist's music completely changed my life. I told her that I'm not sure if I wanted to go to the graduation party over the concert, and she flipped. I think it's unfair given that I had to save up a lot of money for me to pay for my ticket, also taking into account that she has known since October. She argues that it's important I'm there since I have a commitment with her family, and she argues that they all like me a lot and says that might change if I'm not there. They paid for my entry to the graduation party, but I'd be more than glad to pay it back. I know this may sound silly, but to me it's not. AITA?",

      "description": "AITA for not telling my step-sister it was ok to ditch me? Recently moved back to home town, into a tiny house that was not at all move in ready so was working like crazy with only having a week to move in with help. Step-sister messages wanting to see me and I say I’m real busy with moving in but I’ll be living here now so no biggie that we could see each other whenever we can because I now obviously live around 10 minutes from her house. She asks about Wednesday before Thanksgiving, I say sure but I still have a lot to do so only have a few hours, she says that’s fine and that if she doesn’t see me Wednesday then she will for sure see me Friday, I agree. Wednesday comes and she asks to hang out, I say sure, she says she has a doctors appointment at 3:30pm, could I go to her house when she’s back from the app? I say sure then ask if she wouldn’t mind to pick me up on her way home and I get a ride home later because I won’t have my car until February, she agrees and so I wait. 6:35pm and still no word from her so I message and ask what’s up, she says she ran into her mom who she hasn’t seen in a long time and that she’s at home now. I say ok... so guess I’ll see you Friday..? Would have been nice to have been told you weren’t coming to pick me up anymore rather than being ditched 🤷‍♀️ she gets snippy and asks me “damn sister you really thought I should tell you my every move?” And I say no.. I really thought you’d have enough decency to tell me you changed your mind and weren’t gonna come pick me up anymore 🤷‍♀️ she got mad and started to say things like “I told you if I didn’t see you Wednesday that I’d see you Friday!” Which I agreed she said but I said “You said AFTER that, today being a totally different day, that you’d pick me up after your doctors app.” And that our plans “weren’t set in stone” which she’s not wrong about per say but she said she was gonna pick me up and then didn’t and didn’t think it would make sense to tell me she wasn’t going to anymore.. 🤔 so I tell her that, and add that “there’s a big difference between ‘if I don’t come by today then I’ll see you Friday’ and ‘I said I’ll come and pick you up today but changed my mind and went home and decided to not tell you any of that’ you know?” She then says her reasons for ditching me are pregnancy brain on top of grief of losing her dad last Thanksgiving.. pregnancy brain and grief brain are real things so I say that to her and agree that things are tough and I apologize she’s going through these stresses but I still didn’t feel it made sense to just not tell me she wasn’t going to come by anymore, so she says I don’t care about her and that I’m probably acting ridiculous because of where I was raised and that I’m being butthurt about being ditched and I say that seems pretty childish to say I don’t care about her just because I’m not agreeing with her decision to ditch me and to say I’m butthurt for it, and I don’t see how I’m being ridiculous and how it would connect with where I was raised anyhow.. but butthurt sure maybe but probably just because I wouldn’t and won’t ever ditch someone so didn’t like it done to myself? And I feel like if I had done it to her she would have been pissed at me.. I just thought we could be adult and tell each other when we changed our minds on things? If I don’t feel well or have something come up I tell the person I made plans with what’s up rather than just going home and never saying anything to them.. but maybe that’s just me..? 🤔\n\nShe now won’t talk to me.. or just doesn’t want to right now idk but I’m like I don’t think I’m wrong to have said it wasn’t cool to ditch me, I didn’t insult her person to my knowledge (other than saying I think it’s pretty childish to have that reaction to me not agreeing with her) nor where she’s from or anything and I just don’t see what the problem is.. I just said ditching me wasn’t cool and that I get she’s had a lot on her mind but I’d appreciate being told things next time and I guess that’s not ok??\n\nI’ve also never posted on Reddit before so if this is a mess and not how it’s done I apologize.",

      "description": "Phone/formatting/first-time-posting etc. \n\nI should clarify although she was an ex we were still pretty close friends and talked about this sort of thing often and openly. \n\nWhen she asked what this meant about our sexual history, I said I didn’t regret anything we’d done and they weren’t bad memories at all; I told her I enjoyed knowing she’d got off and everything but that was about the extent of it. She asked if that meant I’d faked all the times I’d orgasmed and I told her I had. I guess to try and put things in context I said she wasn’t the first or the last person I faked it with; it took me a while to realise and come to terms with my sexuality and for a long time I simply thought I was doing sex wrong. \n\nShe got pretty offended and said she felt like she’d been lied to; which is kind of fair, I had lied about orgasming when we had sex. I didn’t have a problem with her saying that. It kinda hurt but I could see where she was coming from. \n\nI only got annoyed when she said she wished I hadn’t told her and “why couldn’t you just keep this to yourself?” To understand why this upset me I need to give a bit of context; we’re both very queer and have dealt with coming out to friends/family and the fallout from that plenty in the past. So to have her of all people tell me I should’ve stayed in the closet both really hurt and felt incredibly hypocritical. For the longest time I thought there was something broken and wrong about my sexuality and that if I felt romantic attraction to people I should feel sexual attraction and the desire to act on it as well, that if I didn’t then my relationships were somehow incomplete etc. I explained that to her and she handwaived it away by saying asexuality wasn’t a real sexuality therefore couldn’t be called coming out. \n\nShe said I was an asshole for telling her and making her feel insecure and for lying to her back then, that I shouldn’t call it ‘coming out’ because see above. She got really mad and we haven’t spoke since. \n\nAm I the asshole here? My friend is prone to sulking at times but this is the first time I’ve seen her get this steaming mad. Should I have kept it to myself? \n\nTl;dr - I told my friend and ex I’m asexual, she got mad and said I’d lied to her and made her feel insecure and should’ve kept it to myself. AITA?",

      "description": "I had an online class from 6-8pm and asked for space to focus. I kept it polite each time they approached me anyway, \"I'm sorry, I can't focus on two things, I need to hear, etc.\" They decided this would be a good time to ask if I had signed our thank-you cards and I realized I hadn't. Unfortunately, they were sealed and the envelopes would need to be redone.\n\nI said I'd fix it after class and they said they'd rewrite them now, but my mistakes have come up in future arguments (i.e. \"you couldn't even do the envelopes correctly!\"). Given this history, I figured it would be better in the long run to do it myself.\n\nBut they kept saying over and over they'd do it for me and I answered \"I'll do it, please just leave them, please, it was my mistake, I'm still in class, I'll do it later, just get outta here, please leave me the envelopes\" in a more and more snippy tone as my class kept running. We had a mini-snippy-fight and they went to shower. I did as many of the envelopes as I could while my class continued.\n\nAt about 7:30 we both apologized and my SO went to lay down while my class continued. I gave a pretty heartfelt apology and asked if they'd come sit at the table with me instead, that I would love some help with the envelopes, and I was sorry for letting the stress get to me. They said \"nah, I'm really comfortable in bed\" in a way that was clearly \"I don't want to be around you right now\" (something they later confirmed during the ensuing argument). I felt pretty hurt because I was really vulnerable with my SO and that's when they *(finally)* gave me space for class.\n\n***Tl;dr:*** I got snippy when my SO ignored my request for space and kept interrupting my classwork, we had a small fight, both apologized, and they put up a small friendly wall and gave me the cold shoulder (left me hanging, at least) until a fight broke out. Is this final bit of not-reconciling over what was really just a small argument asshole behavior or are they justified in taking space and prolonging a satisfying end to a fight?",

      "description": "So my friend (close friend of 3 years) came to visit me for a long weekend. He’s been talking to this couple on an app, and wanted to meet up with them while he was here. I knew they were talking, he’d mentioned that they wanted to come over for a bonfire and dinner. I thought that sounded like fun. He also mentioned that he made dinner plans at a restaurant with them, which was fine. It was understood that he would be hanging out with them some of the time. \n\nWell, as soon as he got here, he started only coming back to my house to eat and sleep. I took time off work so we could do stuff together, and all he wants to do is hang out with this couple. Saturday night, I confronted him and said I felt like I was being taken advantage of a little bit, and I thought he was being rude. His response was, “I don’t want you to feel that way” and he explained that he’d already planned to go do drugs and party with them that night, then said, “How am I supposed to get there...?” \n\nI didn’t want to go, because it’s not my thing anyway and I’m a year clean from addiction (which he is well aware of). He ended up taking an Uber. Before he left, he said he’d be back around 4am. My bf worked early the next morning so I told him if he was going out to get all high and coming back really late then don’t bother coming back, and since he clearly wanted to come into town just to see them, then he could take his stuff and go stay with them. I don’t feel comfortable hosting someone who brings the whole drug world to my doorstep, but we have been really close in the past. \n\nHe came back today to get his stuff, and I’m still kind of mad, but also feel a little guilty kicking him out to go stay with people he barely knows. To be fair, he did let me stay with him for a couple weeks back when I was homeless and strung out. \n\nDid I react too strongly? AITA? \n\nThanks for reading!",

      "description": "#The scene  \nI'm driving on a 40mph(about 64kmph) road in England.  \nThe road consists of 2 lanes (one for each direction of traffic) and lies on a hill.  \nThe road has a \"snake\" in it i.e It curves a few times, about half way up the hill.  \nI'm in the left hand lane travelling up the hill.  \nThere is a man ($Operator) in a tractor that has some kind of hedge trimmer attachment on it's front \"arm\", travelling in the same direction as me, on my side of the road.  \nThe tractor is at the first bend and is moving forward at around 3-5mph(about 4-8kmph) whilst cutting the hedge/trees on the side of the road.  \nThe tractor has orange flashing lights on the back and a blue, circular sign with a white arrow pointing slightly down and to the right (a standard sign for asking drives to move around an obstacle).  \n\n#The ordeal  \nApproaching the tractor I judge the risk of overtaking it on this corner.  \nMy decision is that, I'm more comfortable waiting for him to get around the first bend and then overtaking as the road straightens out, so I can see clearer.  \nAs I slow and approach I leave a car length between us and prepare myself for probably a little honking from behind me and a slow crawl round this corner.  \n  \n3 things then occur...  \n1. The car behind me ($Car) decides to overtake me, as well as the tractor.  \n2. A small lorry appears from around the corner in the opposite lane.  \n3. The tractor starts to move backwards.  \n  \nI immediately stop and honk my horn so as to warn all 3 vehicles of the impending danger.  \nThe tractor stops.  \n$Car pulls into the gap I've left between me and the tractor.  \nThe lorry appears to slow, but continues on it's way.  \nCrisis averted.\n  \n$Car then waits for traffic in the opposite lane to pass and overtakes without issue.  \nI go back to crawling along the road when I realise that the tractor has continued to move backwards.  \nThe other cars behind me have now followed the example that $Car gave and have started to overtake me and the tractor.  \nI'm now unsure what to do and am starting to panic.  \n  \nIf I thought it was unsafe to overtake before, it's now even more so because of the cars behind me overtaking.  \nThe tractor is still moving back and $Operator is looking back at me, gesturing me to get out of the way.  \nI sit there as my panic rises, and no new ideas immediately come to my mind.  \n  \nEventually, the tractor get's as close as he dares and attempts to converse out of his back window.  \nThe conversation goes as fruitlessly as you'd imagine.  \nI get the impression he's annoyed at me and want's me to overtake despite not being able to hear him.  \nI attempt to explain that I can't see around the corner and he's now too close for me to pull around him through arm gestures and speech that he almost certainly can't hear.  \n$Operator then stops his engine and gets out.  \n  \nHe comes to my now slightly open window and he asks what's wrong.  \nI come to the conclusion that he's not going to see my view on this, but my panic stricken mind attempts to explain my reasoning in jumbled words whilst the primate in me attempts to match his tone and aggressive expression, all whilst afraid he's going to get physical.  \nHe exasperates about how he's \"been there for 8 hours\" and \"everyone else can go round\".  \nAt one point he even stood in the other lane to \"prove\" it was clear - at the same time as a car behind me went to overtake which got him a honk that he ignored.  \nI plead with him to let me follow round the corner and I'll over take on the straight but it falls on deaf ears.  \nHe deems the conversation over on his last word telling me to \"back up and go round\" which I don't challenge.  \nOnce he's back in his vehicle I am now able to back up as there is a lull in the traffic behind me and I overtake, as carefully as I can, and come out unscathed.  \n  \n#AITA?  \nDid I do something wrong here?  \nI'm unsure exactly what road laws apply here so I'll see if I can research anything shortly after I post this.  \nI feel like I could have handled it better.\nIf $Operator is considered the to be wrong, I may look to file a complaint to...I guess the local council. I assume he's employed by them (if not directly). I guess I'll research that too.\n  \n*sigh* This is why I want to buy a dash cam.",

      "description": "I’m in high school and as some of you may know school food is pretty bad. The only thing my friends and I like are the salads but they sometimes sell out pretty quick. Due to this my friends and I usually go out to eat for lunch. My friend always takes us in his car which only seats 5 people. This means we always end up leaving the same kid to eat lunch by himself. We’re not allowed to bring outside food into the school so it’s not like we can go and come back. He’s asked if we can take turns going but my friend says that since it’s his car he picks who’s going. The reason he does this is because this kid didn’t have friends and just inserted himself into our friend group and started sitting with us without being asked. We’re okay with him sitting there it’s just we don’t really share the same interests. We’ve known each other since freshman year and only met this kid 3 month ago. My SUV can seat 6 people but it uses up a lot more gas than my friend’s car which is why we don’t like taking it. My friend never asks us for gas money so I don’t feel it’s right  for me to ask either. Am I the asshole for being able to solve the problem but choosing not to.",

      "description": "The irony here is intense. Five years ago, when I was even more of a fuck-up than I am now, I worked as a freelancer for an internet marketing company. They assigned a large, lucrative project to me - managing the social media engagement and writing promotional for a large for-profit university. The more I wrote, the more I realised that the school's infrastructure, teachers, and school-material were the kind that I wouldn't use if even I'd gotten it for free. It was purely a way to fleece students out of their money in return for worthless certificates. I got so sick of it I didn't even invoice the company for my final payment. I was proud of that last bit.\n\nNext four years, I go through extreme depression, crippling back pain, get diagnosed with severe ADHD, spend a year and a half unemployed. I'm finally getting my life back together... attending counselling, racking up certificates, straightening out my diet and health, quitting smoking etc. Found a breathtaking woman who believes the sun shines out of my ass and wants to marry me.\n\nBut I'm still unemployed. Trying to find a job has been grotesque, humiliating experience.\n\nNow, the same manager who assigned me that previous soul-sucking job has reached out to me again because apparently I did a damn good job. They want to pay me more (a lot more) to write content for a larger, scammier university. I know that these places take the dreams and hopes of everyday people trying to make their lives better through education, and suck those dreams dry for the last penny they can squeeze out.\n\nI'm desperate for a job. I want to make this woman happy. I want to show her family (and mine) that I'm not a fuck-up. I'm quickly running out of financial and personal resources.\n\nWhat's the right thing to do? Would I be the asshole if I took the job? Do I owe it to the woman who believes in me to do something I frankly think is evil? This is literally the first job offer I've had in years. I'm scared of turning it down, I'm scared of accepting it.",

      "description": "Context: I recently started hanging out with a group of guys that were already all friends. They've been friends since they were little kids. When we hang out or talk in group chats all they do is rip on each other constantly. Nothing seems to be off limits. They also pretty much only all hang out when it's one of them that comes up with the plans. Every time I've ever asked them to go to a bar or something, everyone has some kind of excuse. One guy's excuse a lot of the time is about saving money. We'll call him Bob. Bob is also the guy in the group that any time we hang out with other people, he manages to say or do something that offends someone and creates an argument/awkward situation.\n\nSo the other day we're talking in a group chat about trying to plan a mini vacation over the summer and booking a vrbo house. Right away one of them sends a link as a suggestion and I check it out. It's really nice but kind of expensive for me, even when split between all of us. I say something like \"that's nice, but can we try to find something cheaper?\", but everyone else seems fine with it, including Bob. So since no one reacted to my objection, I make a joke like \"the dude who can't even afford to get a drink at a bar on a Friday night is cool with this place, and I'm the one trying to save some money?\" He says \"eat my ass\". I call him a \"poor bitch\". Nothing out of the ordinary, no big deal. But a couple minutes, and comments by other people later, he says \"Sorry guys, I can't afford to go on your fancy rich vacation, guess I'm out.\" So I just say \"hah ok\" because I can't tell how serious he's being at this point. Then he says \"I've literally never said I didn't have the money to do something, and if I did it's because I just didn't want to hang out.\" At that point it's noticeably awkward, and no one is saying anything. The conversation ends there and I'm thinking great, everybody thinks I'm a jerk now.\n\nFirst of all, I was just making a joke, a pretty tame one in my opinion, and this guy is the king of offensive jokes. Second, he pretty much said that when he's been using money as an excuse not to do something, he's just been lying instead of just saying that he doesn't want to hang out. So of course I would make a joke about you not having money because you're always saying it!\n\nI ended up texting him separately because it was driving me crazy, and basically apologizing for making the joke. He said \"money just isn't something we joke about because we all come from different financial situations.\" Which made me think ok maybe money really is tight for him and calling him poor really would be a dick move then. But I was the one not having the money to afford that house and complaining in the first place.\n\nAm I really the asshole here?",

It is about 7-8 months now and not a single time have they bought any of these products. I grew up in a household where you replace what you use I.e. I replaced one of their food products after using it a single time. Now I have mentioned if x or y could replace this product or another. When they do they tend to buy the least amount possible and within a short amount of time I have to buy new products again. Well recently I bought the fancy body wash of my dreams and one of my roommmates liked it so much that they started using it. Well I talked to them about it and we agreed to trade off buying the body wash. When it came time to buy the next one they bought one that is extremely gender specific and unusable by me, we are opposite genders. When I confronted them about it they acted like I was the asshole for “making a big deal” when I said I don’t believe they bought it for both of us to use and got it specifically so only they could use it they said “well thanks for calling me a liar”. Also they said that when they started using it “I didn’t know there was an expectation to replace it with the exact same body wash”. The entire time they acted very defensive and also like I am the asshole for even bringing the subject up. \n\nHow would you approach this? ",

      "description": "I have/had this friend whom I’ve known for little more than a year (I’m a man, she’s a woman, don’t know if that changes anything but I’ll just mention it for clarification). We don’t get to see each other very often so we invite each other to hangout when we can. \n\nOne day, probably in October, I told her if she could hang out, she told me “I can hang out friday two weeks from now”, I told her “okay then”. Asked her 4 days before the date we were supposed to see each other if she can still go, she says “It’s fine don’t worry about it”. Friday morning comes, I text her to ask what time she wants to meet up (we already agreed on the place) and she asks back “what are you talking about?” I get mad, but I tell her that we were supposed to meet that day, without making a fuss. She responds with “oh I forgot about it (us meeting each other), can’t go out today”. Not gonna lie, I was furious because I had to cancel something else so I could meet up with her, stayed at home that day. \n\nI then asked her why didn’t she tell me before that she was busy. Her reply was “I never said I was going out with you, I just told you I was available that day, but you didn’t properly invite me”. At that point I don’t know if I’m angry or confused, what else could it mean if I asked her thrice if she could hang out that friday? She then told me that if I wanted to hang out that badly, why didn’t I invite someone else? (This question is besides the point, but there was another good reason for me to invite her specifically I forgot to mention at the beginning of the post, we were going to draw that day, she knew about this, and she knows how to draw pretty well, I don’t have any other friends that are interested in activities like that) I just tell her to stop making it worse, after not getting a reply, I stop texting her for two months, until yesterday. \n\nI text her as if nothing had happened (hoping time did its work), she’s very mad that I didn’t text her in two months, even though I was the last person to send a text before yesterday. We argued about it, and I told her I was not going to apologize since she didn’t care to apologize then either. We’re still arguing I think, but she hasn’t responded today so maybe that friendship is over. I want to know other people’s opinion so feel free to speak your mind. ",

      "description": "So for some background info, I (17m) have been dating my girlfriend (18f) for a little over 5 months. We both go to the same high school. The boy in question (18m) used to be her boyfriend but they broke up quickly, but on good terms. They always used to talk to each other and hangout often.\n\nSo now onto the story. Over the past months of me dating her, I would always have my suspicions of her going behind my back with him, but she assured me otherwise saying if she liked him she wouldn't have dated me and that she instead likes me. A couple months ago, shes asking if she could be around him more and give him hugs again (she's kinda known for giving out hugs so it's not strange) but i still feel very uncomfortable with her giving it to him. I asked her if she could refrain from hugging him and in general talking to him. She's done that, but sometimes brings up how she misses him\n\nHowever, yesterday she brought it up again and she said how he would always be nice to her, compliment her, and how he wouldn't make her feel insecure about her body. I asked her what she meant by this since i'm always doing the same, and was very confused by how i was making her insecure when i always tell her her body is beautiful and it's perfect (she's 4'9). She goes on to say how she feels like i never mean it even though i genuinely do, and she shrugs it off. She said that she only sees him as an amazing friend but would never be interested in him like that again. \n\nThis is where I asked her if she could show me her phone the texts between her and him, and if there was nothing suspicious then she can have my full trust with him, after making her promise she wouldn't delete any messages. She gives me a better offer of giving me her instagram password that second to look for myself. I agree, then an hour later she says forget it and that i should trust her regardless. I explained to her that i do feel like an asshole for asking her to see her texts but assured her i would stop being paranoid about him if i just saw it. she went back on the offer and instead agreed to show me in school tomorrow \n\nJust a side note: She always says she loves me and that i make her the happiest. She always says that she couldn't imagine living without me. I definitely know i'm paranoid and being an ass for invading her privacy, but i've just got this gut feeling. I guess i'll update this tomorrow. but please let me know, how big of an ass am i?",

      "description": "Hey reddit, this is something that has really made me think a bit and I really just would like to share this with everyone.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, we're a family of 5.  My mom,  my dad, my sister (9F), me (15M), and my brother (17M).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we're in the car, heading to Five Guys yesterday, as we hadn't been out to eat in a while, and we all really like Five Guys.  On the way there, for some reason the topic of children comes up.  Now, if any of you remember, I made a post a while ago regarding how my parents are always pushing kids onto all 3 of us, and that if we don't have kids we'll basically have disappointments.  Now me, for many reasons, have 0 intent of having kids later in life, for good reason.  So we're in the car, and one thing leads to next, and here's the conversation that transpired.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Yeah, but I'd rather not have to deal with 18 years of hell, but thanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: Oh no, you're giving me grand kids.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: I'm not putting up with 18 years just because you want grand kids.  That's having kids for all the wrong reasons.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: Yes you are!  You'd make an excellent father.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Sure, I'll have kids if you're willing to pay the $300,000 that I'll have to dish out to pay for the child, and are willing to babysit them for months at a time, whenever I actually want peace and quiet (I know what I said here was a little cruel, but I didn't know what else to say.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister (REMEMBER SHE'S 9): Oh don't worry mommy!  I'll have kids for you!  (WTF?!?!??!?!?!?!?!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: Gavin (my name), I don't want to have this conversation.    \n\n\nMy mom then proceeds to tear up.  Huh?!?!?!  If anything, shouldn't I be the one crying?  I mean, you've just proved to me that I'm nothing but someone who's going to give you grand kids.  What the hell is up with this mindset that I have to give you kids or else I'm a disappointment?  Why can't I just live my own life?  You brought kids into this world knowing full well that you're going to have to let me use my free will, and if you cannot accept that, they why did you have kids in the first place?  I'd rather live my life.  Honestly, if having a family is hell: [https://i.redd.it/sfon879ab1g21.png](https://i.redd.it/sfon879ab1g21.png), then why should I have kids?  It's not like I need to.  I could honestly go on, but if you're reading this subreddit you probably know all of the reasons why having kids suck.  I'm the kind of guy to want to punch the parents in the face for letting their child cry during something.  It's not cute, bring them outside.  It is literally the worst sound in the world imaginable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that's all /r/AmItheAsshole.  Please let me know if I'm in the wrong in this situation, because I'm pretty sure I'm not.  ",

      "description": "Good friend (Xavier) a couple months ago started talking to this real pretty chick, who happened to be an ex of another friend/associate (Rauol). He unsolicited, sent me pics of her in her lingerie, tells me not to tell mention it to Rauol as he'll be pissed. I oblige. This was about 2 months ago.\n\nI am at the bar with a few of my good buddies, who know both of them. I mention how Xavier is shooting his shot with pretty girl, and he sent me a pic and IMO she's super fine. They ask to see pic of girl in lingerie, I oblige, all of us have been friends 15+ years (Xavier included). I mention how it's still in the very early stages, and to not mention anything to Rauol. This was like a week after the picture was sent to me initially.\n\nI have never brought it up again socially, and have been in contact with him regarding how things are going. He tells me how he's been hanging with her and getting there, and how he actually really likes her. I'm super happy for him, as he hasn't dated in a while. Has plans for an actual date with her in a couple weeks. None of this is repeated. This was like 3 weeks ago.\n\nArbitrarily, he had been kinda smoozing all over this girls facebook, and Rauol definitely can see that.\n\nDay of the date, get a text from Xavier asking if I mentioned anything to Rauol. I say no, and mention how it's pretty obvious that himself and pretty girl are talking by social media. \n\nEnd of the night, get a text basically calling me a piece of shit. Saying that pretty girl knows he sent me pictures of her (says Rauol told her but then later says he doesn't know how), and she wasn't happy. Asking why the fuck I would parade her tits around the bar. That she found out after the date.\n\nI explain all the above, how I mentioned it to our mutual friends but it would surprise me if anyone said anything to Rauol. Told him I wasn't sure how she knew (truth). Apologized for even telling them. Explained how I wasn't making excuses, that I definitely said something and showed them, but that the story he has about me parading it around is just not true and exaggerated, again apologizing.\n\nShe wasn't nothing more to do with him at the moment and he said I made him look like an immature asshole....and I guess I did, but he also kind of was? I don't show pictures of girls to my friends who I'm interested in dating/gf/etc nor did I ask for them. \n\nI take full ownership of saying she sent him a picture which he sent me, and then showing said picture. But it was a maybe 2 min conversation, one time, before he ever hung out with her. I'm getting blasted by him, and feel bad but I feel he's the asshole and everyone I've talked about this with has expressed it's entirely his fault. But he's a close friend and I do feel guilty about it.",

      "description": "This guy has been cyberstalking me for a year now from Reddit, made a post on r/legaladvice and apparently there’s no real legal repercussions for what’s he’s doing. He ended up messaging my ex back in September which led to an argument and ultimately breaking us up. He then messaged her yesterday a screenshot of my post from r/breakups, once again no personal information except ages, no names or anything, looking for advice on a breakup sub. She of course got upset at me because she believes I feed into this stalker by posting personal information about her and allowing her to be contacted(this guy found her Instagram somehow through my YouTube)\n\nI’ve explained to her dozens of times that we are both victims of harassment and cyberstalking and that this guy’s sole purpose in life has been to make our lives miserable, mine through her specifically. She of course was more concerned that she was being contacted by this random guy on a fake Instagram. She blocked that account and then today he messaged her AGAIN with screenshots of a conversation I had on r/breakups with a user. The conversation? This: https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/abow7p/comment/ed229yg?st=JQF5RTDL&amp;sh=df5a0b44\n\nI have no names in it(save a child name we’d talked about) and no identifying information. She blocked me this morning and told me to not talk to her “we’re done” I’m curious to know if others think I’ve done something wrong here or if she’s just reacting out of anger regarding being contacted by a stranger constantly.

      "description": "Little bit of context about me, and my job. I've worked at a movie theater for 4 years, and love it. I always come in, and try to go above, and beyond. My managers have taking notice, and have been giving me a lot more responsibilities. Now it's not a promotion, and it doesn't increase my pay, but I know how this works. You start from the bottom, and you work your way up. I get it plus it doesn't hurt that I know this job like the back of my hand, so it's not really extra work. I also put in a lot of work with a bunch of my coworkers over a month long period to perfect a system that would help everyone out, and would make everything nice and organized. We put it all together in a document, and went to my GM with it. He took it to corporate, and they gave us the all clear. Now my GM had to take an extended period of time off for a family emergency. In comes a manager (John) from out of state to step in as a temp GM. First day literally changes everything back. Takes down everything we put up. All the info sheets for new hires when they get stuck and can't call for help, New usher sheets that make life so much easier, New concession ticket that make it more organized, and so much more all gone. Why? cause that's not how they did it at his theater. Workers are confused, and start to slip up by doing things the new way then having to do it the old much longer way it was a nightmare. I've never been handed so many guest complaints in my life. All about how they liked how things were ran before, and that it was better the other way cause they didn't have to wait nearly as long. Then I find out that a new hire was in tears in the back wanting to quit because of how John was treating her. At that point I was so confused/frustrated by how he could come in, and in a matter of 2.5 months just completely ruin what we had going. The new hire ends up leaving, and John comes to me and says \"You need to get on register now.\" This is what I said word for word. \"Alright John I'm heading there now.\" He tilts his head, and says \"Uh I think you forgot a Yes Sir there buddy.\" I look at the line of people then him, and repeat myself, and walk away to do my job. Now my GM is back in town, so yesterday John calls him to pretty much demand that I be fired for disrespecting him, and refusing to work. What he doesn't know is that me, and the employees from that day including the new hire will be going up there in about 30 mins to discuss in detail (Power Point presentation) everything that's been going on since he's been gone. Before I go AITA? I know I could have just said \"Yes Sir\", but not to someone who works, and treats his employees like that I'm sorry I just can't.        ",

      "description": "So a few days ago I had my 18th birthday, and I was raised between my mother and my grandparents. In the past my grandparents have always gotten me like a gift card or some money or even some socks and underwear. My mother is a bit more on the fortunate side in terms of money and I usually always get something pretty nice from her. Which she did not dissapoint, cologne and some other things. However this year, I visited my grandparents to which they gave me a tin of dominos and the game yahtzee, my aunt didn't give me anything at all. I wasn't upset but I was almost underwhelmed as while I have played them in the past, it was when I was very young. Haven't played any sort of board game since that point. AITA for being upset about it? I mean I'm usually a very easy going person but they gave me dominos and yahtzee and I really can't figure out why I'm so upset about it. I've always been happy with simple things like socks and such from them even when I was as young as 12 but I don't know why this rubs me the wrong way. AITA for not just appreciating the gift?\n\nTL;DR: Grandparents gave me a tin can of dominos and yahtzee for my 18th birthday and it just rubbed me the wrong way. ",

Unfortunately, she happens to have a highly heritable autoimmune disease. I'd rather not get into the details as it's quite a sensitive topic, but the severity divers a lot per person. Some people are severely impaired due to it, and can have near to fatal attacks, while for others it could just be a minor inconvenience. I am extremely uncomfortable with the fact that one of our children might inherit it from her, or carry the genes that could potentially continue the disease.\n\nAm I the asshole for choosing not to have children with her because of this reason?\n\nWhen I made it clear that it'd be better if we wouldn't have children, so there wouldn't be a chance they'd inherit the disease from her, she didn't take it well, and it made her extremely upset. We both still would really want children, but it wouldn't be the right option to possibly make people suffer because of our selfishness. We've briefly discussed adoption, after which I've told her I wouldn't be comfortable with adopting children. If we did have children, I'd still want them to be related.\n\nShe's a wonderful person, and I'd never abandon her because of this, but it does make me have serious doubts about having children with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Recently it came up that my father is facing 20 day or so jail time OR pay 2000 as a bail. He turned to his parents and asked them to give him money so he doesn't have to. He owes them a lot of money already, and they KNOW he never gives any back, yet they still gave him the money. I am upset about this because I'm about to finish school and I want to attend university around three hours away from home, and I really need financial aid, because I am not able to pay for everything from the start alone. On top of that, in my opinion, jail would do him good because I know that my mother is very abusive and constantly on her drunken rage mode. He never paid for anything I needed. School, books, hobbies, pocket money, going out, medications, NOTHING.   \n\n\nI feel like I am right about it but my family is making me feel like an asshole for wanting him to go to jail, but I really think he deserves it.   \n\n\nSo, AITA?

So on our last trip to the cities my boyfriend drove. While driving I noticed that he wasn’t doing some of the basic driving rules like using a blinkers. I was navigating for him so we wouldn’t get lost and brought the wrong way. I became a little concerned for both of our safeties when he started becoming hostile when I didn’t give clear enough instructions. At one point he pretty much stopped listening to me when I told him not to take an exit. After a longer day shopping, I didn’t really want to get scolded for an hour plus so I decided to sleep the whole way home giving him the gps so he could navigate himself. When I finally awoke when we were closer to home he said that I was the asshole for setting him up to fail. Am I the asshole in this situation? \n\nNote we are in a very happy relationship and this is one of our debates that we can’t decide on our own who’s in the wrong. ",

      "description": "So my roommate is about to leave for a flight at 2pm today, and since his sleep schedule is all messed up, he’s basically nocturnal - he sleeps at 8am, and told me yesterday that he was going to pack up and clean everything overnight.\n\nAll of the kitchenware and dishes at our apartment are mine, meaning I paid for them, and I’m allowing him to share them. When I eat food or cook, I generally either 1) wash the dishes right after I use them, or 2) fill them with water so nothing crusts over, and wash them later. For multiple times in the past few months, he has done neither, and I have to keep reminding him to wash them UNDER MY RULES. \n\nWell today, he slept at 8am (it’s 11am right now), and he said he will clean the dishes yesterday night, but he STILL hasn’t cleaned them. He ate curry so there’s still dried, crusted yellow curry on the pan and plates. I woke him up a few minutes ago to tell him to clean the dishes, and he was upset at me for waking him up just for dishes. But I think I’m justified, because it’s my property, and using it should be under my rules. AITA?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 1 year. I have 3 kids from my 6 year marriage with my ex, which ended a little over a year ago. Kids are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nMy ex and I obviously have some bad blood there and disagreements over our kids, stemming from the fact that I don't get to see them nearly as much as I would like and I disagree with my ex's parenting and financial decisions. She also will not let me introduce my gf to my kids which is a point of contention.\n\nI admit I talk about this a fair bit, but it's really par for the course for anyone dating a parent. However, my girlfriend yesterday told me to stop and she doesn't want to hear it anymore. For some context, I was mentioning how I noticed the last time my ex dropped the kids off that her hair and nails were done, she was wearing nice clothes, and she has a new car, but the kids are dressed in ill fitting hand me downs that my ex got from her family. I was wondering aloud that perhaps she is not utilizing my child support and alimony payments in a completely selfless way. My girlfriend actually took my ex's side and told me to stop talking about my ex or we were done.\n\nI don't think what I'm doing is all that weird for a guy with kids. Obviously they're my priority and I want to make sure my ex is acting in their best interest at all times, and I'm going to discuss that with my partner. I am perhaps wondering if my girlfriend is not ready to date someone who is a parent, or if I'm in the wrong. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My sister and I (M) are both working people living out of town, and we came home for Thanksgiving. I was in her room and she was showing me the Instagram page of the guy she liked. I reached over and quickly liked one of the photos as a joke and laughed, but quickly realized that she was definitely not laughing. She started angrily telling me how disrespectful that was and how it was such a stab in the back and \"how could I do such a thing?\". I thought this was a harmless joke because we immediately unliked the photo, making the notification disappear. I told her she was overreacting, which became the second nail in my coffin. Armed with the two injustices I dealt her: liking the Instagram photo and saying it wasn't a big deal, she went off on me saying how I invalidated her feelings and was blatantly disrespectful. I walked off in disbelief, but later apologized. She didn't really respond to that, but was relatively friendly during dinner, so I thought the matter was over. Now, 2 days later, she is going off on me again saying how all her friends agreed that what I did/said after was just unacceptable and a d-bag move.\n\nI'm honestly still confused as to how this escalated like this, and am also really annoyed for getting roasted so hard. Is liking and unliking an Instagram photo as a joke a real dick move that I should never do to anyone? And secondly, if I am the asshole, how could I have handled the situation better (after liking the photo)?\n\nTLDR: I liked an instagram photo of the dude my sister liked on her account. She got mad and I told her that she was overreacting. She's now madder.",

      "description": "Background: Wife and I just had our first kid, so out of state mother in law (MIL) decided to work transfer to help us with out. We all agreed that that she would have the baby the majority of the time for 2 days while I was at work and my wife was at work, any other time my wife would be home to help while I was at work or out to sea (navy). We also agreed that because I go to school full time online that she would watch him while I needed to do a test or study. Shes really been alot of help but sometimes she unintentionally hurts my wifes confidence as a parent by attempting to undermine our authority.\n\nIncident: since Monday my 2 1/2 month old has had a runny nose and his typical fussiness, no other symptoms of illness. So my wife and I both agree that if he were to get even one more symptom we would make an appointment. My MIL on the other hand claims he has a sore throat and has come to this diagnosis because he doesn't finish his bottles when hes with her and assumes it's his throat. This is something me and my wife disagree with because he eats perfectly fine when hes with us and we have him the majority of the time. Even with this information she still insist hes got a sore throat and we should take him in asap. Again, my wife and I have both decided what our the threshold was for a doctors vist which is supported by the information given to us by his pediatrician.Yet she still disagrees.\n\nSo yesterday while out shopping we get a call from her and shes asking for the appointment number so she can make an appointment. This enraged me but not to the point where I was willing to make a big deal, because its coming from a good place. Anyway, my wife and I get home and I make a joke as I walk in. I say as I laugh , \"wheres my baby, do you have him on life support?\" This joke puts her into a rage and turns into her making comments implying we are terrible parents because we dont agree with her assessment of my son and because we've already decided when we would take him in. She also states that she is no longer going to be helping with the baby on days that my wife doesn't work, such as times when I have to study and do homework, and that it wouldn't hurt her if she moved back home and didn't see us again. (You all may take this as talking out of her ass but we've seen it happen.) So after about 20 minutes of me defending our stance she still doesnt see anything wrong with what shes said and walks off as if shes the victim. Anyway this hurts my wifes feelings and has her feeling like shes not a good mother to our boy because of the things her mom implies and says.\n\nAITA if I just straight up tell her to pack her shit and go, also do yall have any advice? We've vocally set boundaries and yet this is happening.What I thought would alleviate stress on us has actually done the complete opposite.\nI broke down a while ago and I guess as a form of therapy I typed all this down.\n\nThank you to who ever reads and responds.",

      "description": "    A couple weeks ago my girlfriend, Amanda, and I broke up. We had been together for about seven months. If it matters, the breakup was her choice, but I understand why she made it. She said we weren't right for each other, and she was right that the two of us had different priorities, so it's not like I harbor any anger towards her for her choice.\n\n    The two of us had different work schedules, which meant we didn't get to see each other as often as we would have liked. We did exchange nude pictures as a way to keep each other \"satisfied\" when we couldn't do it in person.\n\n    The two of us are part of a volunteering group (that's how we met), and we have a meeting next Wednesday. Last night, the following text conversation went down:\n\nAmanda: I trust by now you've deleted any sensitive images you may have had of me\n\nMe: No\n\nAmanda: I will be checking your phone next week to make sure you have done that\n\nMe: No need. I'm not gonna do that\n\n    And then she got upset and started accusing me of using the pictures of blackmail. I told her I'm not gonna share them anywhere or show anybody else. Truly, I would never do that to her or anyone. I will never show the pictures to anybody else, and I will never try to hold them over her head for anything. I'm not keeping them out of spite, they are simply for my own continued enjoyment.\n\n    Am I in the wrong here? She said she deleted the pictures she had of me, but I don't really care about that. That was her choice, and I would've been perfectly fine if she kept them for herself. She'd already seen me naked, so it's not like the pictures would show her anything she hadn't already seen or I hadn't already consented to her seeing. Why should it be any different in reverse?",

He hasn’t had lots of exposure to new people/dogs prior to me adopting him. He also can get aggressive when frustrated.  When people or other dogs are in his face when he doesn’t want to play he doesn’t know how to show disinterest without getting aggressive. I’m very protective of him because he is my little guy and I want him to be happy and healthy and have a good life because he hasn’t had any of that prior to being with me. \n\nI brought him to my boyfriends house and his cousins came as well. His cousin, who has down syndrome, is really nice but is obsessed with my dog. The cousin is constantly trying to force my dog to sit or lay down, they also are really rough when they’re “playing”, they pick my dog up constantly, and when my dog is trying to sleep the cousin is in his face and just all over him. My dog just wants to lay down and the cousin wakes him up to pet him and try to play. The cousin also tries to tell my dog to do stuff and not do stuff and holy shit I can’t take it, it’s pissing me off. I really can’t take the cousin any more. \n\nI am getting so angry because my dog is just trying to relax. He doesn’t know how to interact properly. I’m trying to get him comfortable with people and other animals and I don’t feel like this is helping. \n\nI didn’t say anything to any because I feel like an asshole. In this situation my dog didn’t get aggressive and didn’t try to bite (thank GOD) which makes me feel like I’m overreacting. Am I the asshole here? ",

The night we met him I couldn’t stop talking about how much I liked him/how obsessed I was with him. Nothing happened between us that night but I still talked about him all the time to M, but he lives in a different state than us.

I asked her if she was into him at all, she said she wasn’t into him at all. I told her that I was bummed he added her and not me and that it would hurt my feelings if she added him back, she did anyways and said it’s because she “didn’t want to look like an asshole”. They begin to Snapchat back and forth, I tell M that it hurts my feelings that’s she’s still talking to him. A few months go by and we end up spending the weekend with this guy and some other friends. I again talk to M about how I like him, she insists that she doesn’t like him. A week after that M tells me that she “thinks she likes” the guy. I tell her that if she’s going to pursue things with him I can’t just sit back and watch my best friend do something that she knows is really hurting me. I basically made her choose and she chose the boy. \nAm I the Asshole if I end the friendship? ",

But we made the mistake of moving in together 2+ hours from home the rent is 1300 (650 each ) plus utilities but since we broke up and I have no reason to stay in the town (she does she goes to college) I’m moving back to my parents, where I can live rent free. \n\n     Here’s the tricky part my ex is the only one on the lease I’m not legally obligated to pay for my half (or entitled to the apartment or anything in it). Its too late in the school year for my ex to get a sub leaser till at least next semester (3 months)  I’m willing to pay my half of the rent but my mom is basically saying I owe my ex nothing and that I already paid January’s rent even though I’m not living there and that’s more than I needed to do and she has a good job ($23) an hour a full ride and parents to help her and that I’m nothing more then a “friend” at this point and owe her nothing \n\n\n   So is my mom right ? Or would I be the asshole for leaving my ex to pay for the all of the bills ?  ",

      "description": "Let me do a tldr: because its really a long story. I (M) am against third wave feminism and all of the stuff that comes with it. I believe that women and men are equal in all qualities,but i think that females are much more priviledged in this modern era society because they had been opressed for so long. I was discussing with a friend about my slander on women that go out in inapropriate clothing,my personal opinion is that these days most women are dressing inapropriately. Also i got confronted that i was too obsessed with girls that have sugar daddies(specifically i said that it is sickening and unnatural for a 45year old guy, to have a sexual relationship with an 18year old.),my friend said that that aint my problem, but i think that it is,the girl i talk about posts the old dudes and its just sick. My friend thinks i am sexist and an asshole because i have a set of beliefs that don't correspond to hers,we have been friends for three years now, and every time we have a heated discussion or fight,she is always the one that is mad about something, because it seems that i am an asshole in general. I need your opinion, am i an asshole for stating that most females live on recruit difficulty and that they dress and wear themselves inapropriately. Thanks.",

Both of my peers are very into body image, with one (the lead tech on site) being of smaller stature, but both work out daily, and the lead is pretty ripped.\n\nLast week my 2 co-workers and I were wiring a door where we had to pull 6 wires through a hole that was pre-drilled to fit 4. Rather than re-drill the hole, the lead decided that he was going to make them fit. \n\nThe wires weren't moving, so I said \"C'mon, put all your 95 pounds into it!\"\n\nHis immediate response was \"Yeah, I may only be 95 pounds, but I'm stronger than your fat ass will ever be.\"\n\nNow, I'm a bigger guy, but I feel like his response was WAY out of line. When I questioned the other tech, he said that the lead is uncomfortable with being 'picked' on for being scrawny. Our entire work environment has changed as a result of this exchange, which is compounded by the fact that we all have to sit three across for 2 hours a day commuting to and from the job site.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for gaslighting my dad?",
      "description": "I'm 15, my dad is 43. Idk if that's relevant, but it's there if it is. \n\nMy dad is retired Army, kicked out after being \"blown up a few too many times\".  My twin and I recently joined a pseudomilitaristic group called Civil Air Patrol. Think JROTC.  Ever since we did, my dad's been hounding us about physical fitness. This is fair. I'm not in great shape, and was in even worse when we started. He proposed an arrangement- we could only attend CAP if we ran two miles, three times a week. Since we wanted to attend CAP, we agreed, and have been running for nearly three years now.\n\nEarlier this year, I got sick of the shape I was in, and started really putting some effort into working out. I downloaded an app to help me workout at home, because they don't let me go to the gym, I started really pushing myself on running, and even taking the dog for running in the evenings. Eventually, he put a stop to that last one, telling me it was too dangerous to go out when it's dark.  But still! I was improving, and everything reflected that. \n\nSo now we're up to yesterday. It was cold (36°F), and rainy. Not running weather. Since he excuses us for cold weather or rain separately, I texted him the circumstances, so he would see them when he woke up, and did a workout in my room instead. When he woke up, I told him that I had worked out. He nodded, and seemed content. \n\nYesterday evening though, he asked why we hadn't run. I repeated what I'd said in my text. He said sometimes it was cold and wet, and that we should've run anyway. And that even if we didn't run, we should've worked out. I explained that I had worked out, and told him about it, and he got angry, and explained that he wanted us to do *cardio*, on an exercise bike. I apologize. Ok, that's fair, sorry, should've done cardio. \n\nSo now that we've established my and my sister's fault, he moves towards punishment.  \"What can I do to help you do better?\" That might sound supportive, but his idea of helping is offering \"incentive\" to obey better in the future. When we were younger, these incentives were primarily spanking us with a belt. Now that we're older, he mostly just confiscates \"distractions\". \n\nI suggest that he shouldn't. That getting out of shape is a natural consequence of not working out, and if he wants us to develop self discipline, which he professes to be his motive, he should let us face the natural consequences of our decisions.\n\nHe doesn't like that. He says that he \"Doesn't care about *why* we obey, only *that* we obey.\".\n\nThis is old ground. We've argued before over whether only logic matters in decisions, or whether emotion has some stake. I am firmly on the latter, he won't budge from the former. \n\nWe go back and forth for a while about whether intent and motivation matter. He says a number of things minimizing my progress in running, says that he tried to instill self discipline in us but \"doesn't know where he went wrong with [my twin].\" At one point, I'm frustrated with cutting remarks, and begin crying. Eventually he issues another statement. \"I care that *you* care about the why.\" This seems contradictory to his earlier statement, so I bring it up and compare the two. He says I'm gaslighting him. \n\nThings escalated fiercely after that; I don't say anything in my defense, but my sister tells him the thought of me gaslighting anyone is ridiculous. I attempt to interject, as now the two of them are arguing over what I said,  using a phrase he used earlier - \"I'm here, luckily, so I can clarify my own statements\".  He yells that I'm \"immature, petty, and not worth talking to like an adult\", and sends me to bed. We haven't talked since. \n\nI know I could've conducted myself better, and even this portrayal is probably unfair. I wasn't trying to be manipulative, but crying could've been underhanded.  I don't think I was gaslighting him, but I also don't know enough about gaslighting to say either way. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My mother and my stepfather have a large dog, which my mother treats as her child. He lets him do anything, the dog is not particularly trained, which is why I've always found him annoying and problematic. It is not the dog's fault, of course, but it does not change the fact that I limit staying with him to a minimum. I like to play with him a little, pet him, but then I have enough. Besides, I prefer cats and always annoyed me when my mother referred to the dog as \"my brother\". They also have two cats that get along well with the dog, but they had been growing up together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome time ago my boyfriend (26) and I (25) had decided that we would save a certain amount of money and return to the country, and then we would put the money into a thorough renovation of my boyfriend's family house. We want to live there and start a family.\n\nMy boyfriend has a cat (my soon-to-be-father-in-law takes care of him after we left our homeland). The animal is rather skittish, it is very difficult for him to adapt to new conditions. Renovation of the house will be difficult for him, but he will have to survive somehow. We also plan to have more cats later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told my mother that we had decided to move into that house, after a short development of the topic, she said \"how great it's going to stay in our place over the weekend WITH A DOG, because the house is big, blah blah.\" She didn't even ask for permission.\n\nI have already talked about this before with my partner and we kinda knew it was coming (my boyfriend also doesn't want any dog in our house). I told my mother, quite gently, that it is not a good idea to bring the dog with them, because our cat is afraid of noise, strangers and never in his life saw a dog and we will not give him more stress, as we have no idea how both of them will react to each other. That in our town is a really nice hotel for dogs that we could pay for when they come to see us. And that of course, without a dog they are very welcome to visit us and stay for couple of nights and we'll be delighted.\n\nMy mother went berserk. She started a row in which she told me a lot of unpleasant things such as \"you traded your own mother for a cat\" and that \"some stupid cat is more important to me than my mother\". And that she will not come to our house, because either with a dog or not at all \". Because you know, the poor dog will not stay home alone like he did a thousand times before. I always knew that my mother is very explosive, she says whatever she feels like saying at the moment and she's very controlling, but honestly it still hurt me, as I feel like she's the one that chose the dog over her only daughter.\n\nWe had some issues in the past (both her and my fault) and I would love to try to have a good relationship with her (she admitted to feeling very lonely and missing me, and that she's very afraid I won't have her in my life). She made me feel guilty and really bad about myself, that's why I started to think \"AITA?\" Should I let her bring that damn dog with her, even if it's not what we (my boyfriend and I) want and decided?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone have any ideas how to solve this problem, please - give your opinion.

      "description": "My friend is a wonderful, kind, beautiful single mom. Recently she was minding her own business when a strange man who lives in our city decided to message her on Facebook and try to strike up a conversation. He pretended that they had met before but she had no recollection of that. He tried to turn the conversation in a sexual direction by offering to send her a dick pic. She jokingly said “ok, I’ll send it to my group chat so me and my friends can laugh at it.”\n\nHe didn’t understand the sarcasm and proceeded to send the dick pic. He then started to get hostile when he realized that she wasn’t interested and began spouting disgusting, racist abuse (my friend is Asian). He insulted her looks, called her a whole range of misogynistic insults and even went as far as to say “your daughter looks like she has down’s syndrome.” \n\nThis was the tipping point for my friend. She laughed off the stuff he said about her, but when he insulted her daughter she got really angry. We have a Facebook group for women in the city we live in and she decided to post screenshots of their conversation as a warning to avoid this person. \n\nWhen I saw the screenshots I was extremely angry and decided to forward them to the man’s family as he sounds like a dangerous individual to me and I thought his family deserved to know what he’s really like. Some other women followed suit and sent them to his employer, friends and family members.\n\nNow other women are telling us that what we did was immoral and possibly illegal. I know that his family will probably be upset by this, but in my opinion, that’s the guy’s fault for saying such disgusting things in the first place. Thoughts? ",

And I tell him that I don't want him breaking my concsel (are tv set up is on top his dresser). Apparently he thought I was going to do the puzzle for him. \nAfter this he snaps at me that I need to wear headphones while watching a video when there's nothing else on in the room, except his computer wich is on a chat website with no sound coming out. \nI terned off my video and turned tords the wall since I couldn't find my headphones. He then puts on his jacket and starts to walk out. I asked him where he was going. He snapped out that he's going to his parents. I asked him why (it was late enuf that going to his parents ment staying the night or coming back at an ungodly hour early in the morning) we talk for a bit and he begrudgingly sits down in his computer chair and gose back on his computer and tells me, he's staying up late tonight and he dosent want to cuddle when he dose come to bed. Note that it's near impossible for me to sleep without cuddling someone and before we got together I'd been battling insomnia since I stopped sharing a bed with my brothers dog also noting that he knows that. \n\nTbh I'm not sure how to respond to that and we've been sitting in silence since he sead that.",

      "description": "Hey guys, this is long. Apologies for any formatting issues/mistakes I'm in my phone and it's 2 am almost.\n\nYesterday my 10 week old puppy was attacked by my sister-in-law's 10 month old French bulldog. This resulted in my puppy losing a lot of blood, and being rushed to the vets only to be told they didn't know if he would survive the night (he did!! Yay!!). \nMy boy was attacked when my mother in law was holding him, and then placed him on the ground in front of the French bulldog, when there was food around, and the French bulldog has a history of severe food aggression! My dog did absolutely NOTHING wrong, was just put on the ground in the wrong place. We then rushed him to the vets.\n\nWhile we were at the vets my mother in law said/did a few things which really upset me\n       1) that I would be causing a rift in the family for being angry at my sister in law &amp; her girlfriend\n      2) Made a big show about being sad when staff were there, was fine as soon as they left\n      3) told me that her dog had been attacked by the French bulldog plenty of times and that I don't have the right to be angry (to which I responded how many times has she been covered in her own dogs blood).\n     \nWe went today to pick him up from the vet, and my mother in law came (as she will be paying his vet bills), and she cracked it at me when I referred to the French bulldog as a \"monster\" and said my puppy will never go near him again, and because I refused her offer if babysitting my puppy. She made a few comments about having to pay the vet bill, then walked out and sat in the car without saying anything.\n\nSince yesterday I received one apology from my sister-in-law's girlfriend, but her wording made it sound like I was the one in the wrong for being angry. I  have also not received an apology from my sister in law, or from my mother in law for her actions that lead to this. I haven't even had any messages checking up on me to see if I am okay after what happened.\n\nI am ridiculously angry about all of this. Not only have they put my puppy in danger and his life at risk, they refuse to acknowledge or apologize for anything.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nTL;Dr my 10 week old puppy was attacked and almost killed by my sister in law's dog. My mother in law who put him in the situation and sister in law refuse to apologize ",

      "description": "**If he’s already dealing with a lot?**\nUh, here we go. I try my best to be as supportive to him as I can. I don’t feel equally supported in return, but I used to let it go.\nIt all started with us abruptly not talking as much. He would go hours or days to respond if I texted him, and while this peeved me a bit (sometimes it was important) I let it go. Our relationship isn’t that old (4 months), so I moved on.\nSoon every time we talked in person, he acted pissed off and nasty, snapping at me and walking faster if I was walking with him to try and lose me.\nI assumed I was being too clingy or needy, so I dialled it back. When I didn’t talk to him, we didn’t talk at all. The small moments we had started leaving me feeling drained and upset. I was so obviously the only one who cared other people started noticing.\nI never told him anything was wrong. He’d made fun of me before when I was lonely, and I could tell he was unhappy, so I kept it to myself. His friends also always dump their problems on him even if they don’t mean to, and I didn’t want to be like that. I could deal with it, until I couldn’t,\nWe ended up two weeks without contact at all, even though I tried multiple times to text him (not daily). I cried a lot during this period, and I know it’s immature. I’m not proud.\nThe week leading up to this he told me over and over how much he didn’t care about anything or anyone. He also blew me off after agreeing to hang out with me (and then ignored the text when I told him that it was fine he couldn’t go out, but if next time he could just tell me first?)\nI decided I wanted to break up. We weren’t in an equal relationship anymore, and I need affection in a relationship.\nMaybe I should’ve, I got really close to, but I knew I’d regret it heavily. I get attached easily.\nWe had a very short conversation about it and I said I felt like a pest. He told me I definitely wasn’t, that sometimes he just goes offline like that (without warning I guess), and that he’s been having a lot of issues and didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t push for it.\nIt was a five minute conversation, but it was better than nothing. I want a more in depth one tomorrow.\nSo, strangers, would I be the asshole if I asked for more affection from someone who’s going through a lot?\nTL:DR: My boyfriend and I have horrible communication skills, and I don’t feel supported or loved anymore. My boyfriend is very sad. This is because of (unstated) issues unrelating to me. ",

      "description": "Context (long story, but the details are relevant): \n\nOne of the girls (19F) I (18M) go to college with has a friend from high school (that does not go to the college) that sometimes comes to campus to hang out in the student lounge (college is relaxed about this). Let's call this friend Tina (20F). A few months ago, Tina attended a gaming club meeting to play Mario Kart with us (that I didn't actually attend). She met a guy there, Chris (21M), and they started talking. Chris made it very clear that they could sleep together, but he did not want a relationship with her. So Tina and Chris slept together. The next meeting (I didn't attend again), she shows up again. Tina tries to act like Chris's girlfriend, and he denies her. She bugs out to the highest degree, and tries to kill herself right then and there. Police and ambulance were called. She's sent to a psychiatric hospital and is discharged a month later.\n\nThe next month, I finally meet Tina. She starts off immediately with the whole \"woe is me I'm so depressed I'm miserable 24/7\" thing. We get to talking about things, she makes a mention of the whole Chris situation. Trying to be supportive, I tell her that he was kind of a dick and that she didn't really deserve to be treated that way, but her reaction was probably very far out of line with a realistic way to behave at the age of 20. She agreed. The meeting starts and everything is fine. Chris brought his PS4 and is playing Red Dead, I'm playing Stardew Valley on my laptop, and Tina and a couple other people are playing Mario Kart. Chris has not said a single word to Tina, and everything is fine. Tina and her friend leave to go to the gym for a little bit. Chris says something along the lines of \"what is her problem?\" because Tina was glaring at him the whole time. She catches wind of this, and storms back into the lounge. She \"blacks out\" and starts being really verbally cruel to Chris. Her friend gets her into her car and takes her home (after dropping off a few of the other students at their own houses, because they were on the way and had no rides). This entire sequence was a play-by-play ripoff of the Criminal Minds episode with the guy who has MPD and \"blacks out\" and turns into a female alter ego when he gets angry. I leave with Chris and we talked about the situation on the way home, and we agreed that she needs some sort of serious help because acting like this isn't healthy for anybody involved.\n\nTina and I continue to talk for a bit after this over text. She's constantly acting like she's super depressed, talking about self-harm and music like it's 2008 and we're in middle school. I ask Tina's friend if she has MPD (knowing the answer because of a prior experience), and she says no. After a while (like another month of being supportive and kind), I get tired of Tina blaming everyone else for her problems and saying that nobody will ever treat her right, etc. I tell her that ultimately, she is responsible for her own actions and needs to take some initiative to get herself better (I say that as someone with crippling depression and anxiety that only got better when I decided to push myself).\n\nShe said that she's 100% incapable of getting better, because of everyone else constantly being against her. I told her that if you're claiming to be miserable 24/7/365, either you're faking for attention, or there's another factor at play that needs to change. She bugs out and asks me how I know that she's faking. I told her that her entire \"MPD episode\" was ripped from Criminal Minds, and that I have an ex-girlfriend who did the same exact thing when I was 14. When I asked my therapist about it, he said that it's incredibly unlikely that she (my ex) actually has MPD, and if she did, she'd be highly medicated or in a rehabilitation center. I shared this information, and told her that whatever the actual problem is, I hope she gets the help that she needs, because the way she's acting is not healthy for her or anybody around her. L goes off on me, saying I'm a horrible person, I'm not a doctor and can never know (even if my mother studied psychology and I read the texts on MPD), I don't know what mental illness is (even though I have three diagnosed ones and am going to therapy for them), I don't deserve to ever be happy, etc., and then promptly blocks me.\n\nAITA for calling Tina out?",

      "description": "So, recently my grandmother passed and we were going through her house to figure out what to donate, keep, sell ect. Initially, I was very hesitant to keep anything, but my mother pointed out the kind of (hoarder seems too harsh?) keeper my grandmother was, and that she would have been overjoyed if I kept any of her things. As it stands, I don't have a nice set of dishes in my apartment, and I saw a beautiful green set in her attic. I decided I was going to keep them and take them with me when I moved into my first house. Around the edges, there's a set of characters that I didn't know what they meant, but I loved the dishes, so I packed them and put them away.\n\nRecently, I (a white woman) was telling a friend (another white woman) about these plates and she asked me to show her a photo of them. I asked my mother to send a picture and asked her if she knew what the characters were. She told me that they were letters from the Sequoyah alphabet, and my grandmother had purchased the plates on a trip to New Mexico when she was younger. I showed my friend the pictures and told her this, and she told me that I could not keep the plates. She said owning a set of dishes with Native American writing on them was cultural appropriation and I was disrespecting a culture by owning them. My logic was that my grandmother had bought (not stolen) them from actual Cherokee people, instead of buying them from like IKEA or somewhere else that didn't have cultural ties to the language. So, AITA for wanting to keep them? I genuinely want to know.",

      "description": "Recently I took a flight from Detroit to Houston.  The flight attendant  took my ticket and I boarded the plane with one small carry on bag.  My  seat was near the back in coach so I walked to the back of the plane,  located my seat and then started to put my bag in the overhead.   Suddenly a man behind me said \"C'mon. You're killing me man.\"  I didn't  say anything, just put my bag up and then took my seat.  After everyone  was seated (I was on the aisle seat) I stood up to get my laptop out of  the overhead compartment.  The man, who was seated several rows down  from me then said it again, \"you're killing me man!\"  I didn't say  anything and just ignored him.  Did I violate some kind of rule about  flying?  I don't fly that often.  Was this guy right to harass me?  I  held up the line for about 30 seconds as I put my bag up.  Are you  supposed to wait until everyone is at there seat designation before  stowing your luggage in the overhead?  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey reddit, I'm in a bit of pickle right now. I've been together with with my boyfriend for half a year now. Long story short, long before we were dating, he has this friend I'll call B. Now B and I were friends up until a few months ago due to a problem he had with what I had done to my boyfriend (this was before we started dating). Because of that, B actively despises me, and had spread rumors about me.\n\nMy (now) boyfriend made peace with the issue, and started dating a while after that. However, he still hangs out with B all while knowing that B completely despises me. Whenever I see my boyfriend with B, especially when they're right next to me, I get super uncomfortable and my mood drops noticeably.\n\nI feel like I would feel better if I told my boyfriend this, but I know I have no say in who he can and cannot be friends with, especially since they've known each other for longer. Also I feel like by telling him, it would feel like an ultimatum, which is not my intention at all.\n\nWhat should I do? WBITA if I tell him?",

      "description": "So my mother adopted a 2 year old dog the day before she went into the hospital (unplanned/sudden) and I've been taking care of him for about two weeks now. I feed him, walk him, and play so god damn much with him. He's a great little guy.\n\nHe's taking to the potty training but fuck does he need to learn to come when he's called. \n\nUsually there is always someone around so that he doesn't have to be locked up for very long. We have a corner of the kitchen blocked off with a gate with plenty of room for a pee pad if no on is home, waterbowl, bed, area to walk around and toys. I usually come home from work for lunch so I'll let him out to do his business and play with him while I eat. \n\nWhen I'm home from work, he's on my heel at all times and follows me everywhere. I'm constantly throwing his toys for him to enthusiastically fetch and having my hand eaten when he decides that it's time for his weak little ass to beat the shit out of me (playfully btw, he never bites just roughhouses). \n\nThis goes on for hours and hours regardless of what I'm doing or how long of a walk I've taken him on. His energy never drains and he's always ready to keep playing, even running around your feet when you get up to do anything. \n\nBy the time 10pm hits, I need a break and as much as I try to pawn him off to other people, he always seeks me out. I love him and it's clear that I'm \"his person\" but as he's still relatively new to the home I feel like I need to be vigilant in making sure he's not getting into anything or peeing (despite taking him out regularly).\n\nAfter a few hours of playing, I lock him up in the kitchen after taking him out to pee and retreat to go watch tv/play a game before I had to go to bed to be up early for work in the morning. Every whine and cry I hear from him breaks my heart (he's a floor below and isn't too loud) but I just want to be able to focus on something without having to make sure he isn't eating anything that might hurt him. \n\nAITA for \"putting him to bed\" early just to have some time for myself?",

      "title": "AITA For causing my friend to lose his Moderator rank on a popular Discord server after he posted cropped porn (that I made)?",
      "description": "     Context: Back in early 2017 I joined this Discord server which had around 5,000 members when I first joined. It eventually grew to 10,000, 20,000, all the way up to 70k-80k people. That is, until an admin went rogue and banned half of those members. \n     Anyway, I met this kid around my age who we will call RK (his first profile picture was a roblox character). RK was an extremely active user who would make games, bots, and videos for the owner. He eventually became a trial moderator, however, some of the admins were unsure about this since they thought he just wanted to be a moderator for the clout. \n     RK, after awhile, became a full moderator. After this he started acting more like a dick to others, and became extremely sensitive. He would fall out more easily with others, and he just wasn’t the person who he used to be. When you’re a moderator on this server, there’s a ‘3 strikes, your out’ rule. You either get a strike by breaking the rules or being inactive. It was rumored by a former admin that he had more than 3 strikes and was only moderator due to the fact he sucked up to the owner, but that was proven false by screenshots (he only had one strike). \n     RK slowly became more and more inactive, and after the server was screwed up by an ex admin, he was basically never on. He then went on a ‘break’, where he then became extremely active. However, after his break ended, he became inactive again. People started to get angry, as he wasn’t doing his ‘job’, and started calling for him to be demoted. Not only was he inactive, but he also copy and pasted some long definition about furries and spoke in spanish for a long period of time for some reason, which should all be added up to three strikes. But the admins let it slide. \n     At this point in time, RK had just defended his friend who had told my (depressed) friend to go die, so I was pretty pissed at him. He out of no where posted a cropped photo of porn I drew a long time ago as a ‘meme’ (cropped porn is against the rules, even as a meme). I didn’t want any of my friends to know I drew porn (other than the ones I made the porn for), so I was extremely pissed off at this point. I messaged one of the admins about this, and she said she’d see what she could do. RK got demoted a few days later after he a final argument with me about his inactivity. \n     Honestly, I didn’t expect him to get demoted, I just expected him to get a strike. He said he was happy with this, as he was planning to step down from the moderator rank for quite some time, but it was clear he was sad about this. He turned his profile picture to a sad black and white image, and changed his username to something like ‘RK is sad’ and then ‘What’s even the point?’. \n     He had claimed before that his moderator rank meant everything to him, and that he worked really hard to get it. He claims the reason he was inactive was because he was working on a video. I feel kind of bad for causing him to get demoted. \n     Am I an asshole for reporting him for posting that cropped porn? Was I justified? Is he just overreacting?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend she’s bigger than me when she said I ate too much?",
      "description": "My good friend struggles a bit more than me financially (though I’m by no means rich) and rarely gets to eat out or relax. So when she comes over I try to pamper her a little – I’ll get her favorite snacks &amp; drinks, cook for her, and usually pick up the tab if we go to a restaurant. I’ve always thought I was being quite hospitable, sometimes to the point of me even being a bit resentful of how much I give. Our relationship has become more and more “come to my house when you need a break from your life, and I’ll make sure it’s like a little vacation for you.”\n\nSo earlier this week she came over and stayed for 2 days. The first day I made us omelets &amp; toast for breakfast, and then we had lasagna for lunch and watched a movie. I made popcorn and offered her a cookie, which she declined. For dinner we went out (I paid, just as a note) and had pizza and salad. Next day, neither of us had much for breakfast. She had a cookie and I had a few bites of cold pasta salad. Then we went and played tennis &amp; went to a late lunch at about 3 pm. Keep in mind we had barely eaten and had been active. So I scarfed down my soup and sandwich, while she ate less than half of hers. I made (what I thought was) a light-hearted comment, just saying how she wasn’t eating much and had to be hungry by now. She said she was “stuffed” and “felt sick at how full she was”, which I then laughed at because, again, it was way past lunch time and we had been quite active. I just thought it was a bit funny that a few bites of sandwich and half a bowl of soup had her “so stuffed”.\n\nSo then she starts going on about how I’m always eating, that people need less food than you think, that how much she ate is more than enough for a meal, that she thinks it’s gross when people eat too much, that it’s “way too much” to eat three full meals a day, etc. It basically came across as her calling me a glutton.\n\nFor reference, though I’m not teeny tiny, I’m a normal-sized woman with no weight issues (IMO I guess). I’m tall and about a size 8. She’s probably in the 10-12 range, not “big” by any means, but noticeably bigger than me, particularly around the middle. So I just said as much: “If I overeat then why am I a little smaller than you?” She just stared at me for a second and replied “I just think you have a faster metabolism.” I just said okay and moved on, but the whole exchange continues to bother me. I don’t know which one of us was rude or if we both were or if I \\*am\\* a glutton, if I’ve been wrong to “constantly” offer her food while she’s over… IDK here. I just know that I’ve somehow ended up feeling wrong for cooking so much for her and taking her out to eat. No one likes to be told they eat too much, especially a woman, and no woman wants to hear she’s the bigger one either (which is what I told my friend). And I know I technically \"started it\" by asking her how she could possibly be full.\n\nAITA?",

Sometimes we will be talking and Ill just stop talking to them until the next day, or a few hours later. \n\nEvery time I tell them I either was sleeping or I couldn't be on my phone for some reason. Like today I told my friend I went to another city to visit a family member and left my phone at home on accident. But that's not true, I just sat in bed and did nothing all day. I just didn't want to talk. \n\nI do this because I feel like they would think I dont like them or something if I just say I didnt want to talk or if I ignore them without saying a reason. \n\nSo AITA?

She asks constantly when I’m going to be visiting. I understand a 3 hour drive is not much, but I hate going home to visit because I don’t get along with my dad at all. He’s an alcoholic and emotionally abusive. When I go home he either blatantly ignores me, or is an overall toxic asshole to me. And my mom always forces an interaction with him saying “he’s your dad, that’s just how he is, go say hello/goodbye”. And this stresses me out to no end and honestly makes me depressed. Even when I just talk with my mom through text she can never just talk with me, she constantly asks me details on my life/issues I’m going through that I always tell her I don’t want to talk about. \n\nI love my mom, she’s helped me with a lot and helped me through school, etc. but it seems like every time she does something for me(which I never ask for) she holds it over my head eventually saying “I do so much for you and you can’t even talk to me every night” etc. I want a relationship with her but it seems every time I set boundaries she does not respect them. But she’s also my mom and I feel bad for slowly cutting her off. I feel like she’s lonely because of my dad and not having many friends or things to do outside of her job. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to not talk to her as much? ",

      "description": "btw sorry for the spelling or syntax, english is not my first language.\n\nOk. So my gf [F16] and I [M16] have been together for about 1 month. We've had a great relationship, and we've had a lot of fun, but we've yet to disscuss serious topics like sex, love and exes. As it always took me time to get to these subjects in the past, I wasn't too worried about getting there in the near future. She has a friend (let's call him M), with whom she was flirting around jokingly, but I never gave this real attention, as M is in a relationship, and I also like to flirt casually with some of my female friends.\n\nLast weekend, she went on a school trip with some of our classmates, including M. Before she left, we spent  the day together at my house. We had a lot of fun, and before leaving she said that she was going to miss me, etc. I spent the weekend hanging out with my friends, and as I checked my social media, I found that she posted pictures of her with M and they were flirting, having fun etc. Again, I wouldn't have been worried normally, but this time I was not very comfortable with the fact that they were far away from me.\n\nAll the people from the schooltrip came back today, and as I was with my friends, someone jokingly said that gf kissed M. Immediately, I thought that it was a joke, but later in the day, several of my colleagues said that this was the case. I was very distraught, and tried to figure out what was going on. In the evening, I confronted gf about it, and it went about like this:\n\ngf: \"Are you angry at me\"\nme :\"Do you have anything to say to me\"\ngf: \"...\"\nme: \"What happened during the schooltrip\"\nher: \"What do you mean? I only fell asleep on M's shoulder\" \nme: \"Kids are saying that you kissed him\"\nher: *visibly confused*\nme: \"we need to talk about this\"\nher: *breaks into tears*\n\nShe was basically going on about how I didn't trust her, how she loved me, how it wasn't possible that she could have done it etc. I asked around and it turns out that someone misunderstood something and that's why this rumor arose. \n\nAITA for confronting her even though I wasn't 100% sure that this happened? How will I get out of this mess?\n\nTL;DR: I thought that my gf and some guy she flirts casually with had kissed during a schooltrip. I confronted her about it and she's very offended/sad about it. Turns out that the kiss is totally fake and it never happened. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi, firstly I want to say english is not my first language, so I apologise for any mistakes.\n\nSo for the story, I've been with this girl for about 2 months now. Despite having trust issues my whole life (I've been diagnosed with ACOA and my psychologist says that it may be the reason) I decided to trust her. I mean, we are happy together, at least I think so.  \nI think it is important to add that I'm more of an introverted type (I'm not really fond of parties, clubs etc.) and she is the opposite. So I understand when she wants to party with her friends. I don't have issue with that. But what I have issue with is her not telling me when she goes out. I don't want her to ask for permission, just to inform me when she goes out and maybe text me when she's back. I think that is fair, even her best friend was surprised that my GF could party and I didn't have any objections.   \nAlso, I want to add that sometimes she tells me, but few days ago we were talking about spending next Friday together and she said that she can't stay for the night and will go home earlier. I was fine with that, didn't think much about it and said that I would walk her back to her house in that case. She refused, but I didn't want to dig into that so the topic ended.   \nAnd yesterday she unintentionally, at least I think so, told me that she's going out with her friend, she didn't see for a few months, this Friday. I didn't point it out, but got a bit pissed. I mean she knew she had plans and decided not to tell me why she \"couldn't\" spend the night. \n\nAlso a bit offtopic, she sometimes writes drunk text to me that are not funny and make me anxious. For example, that some girl hit on her and was trying to make out with her. She texted this once, but I fear that it happens more often. We argued about that and she got defensive saying that I'm trying to control her.\n\nI didn't confront her yet about that, but I'm thinking. That's why I want your opinion first, am I the asshole for wanting to know when my GF goes out (mostly with people that I don't know)? And for the offtopic, am I the asshole for not being fine with her not only saying that somebody hit on her, but almost bragging about that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I have been dating my current girlfriend for close to 4 years and things have come to a head recently. When we met for the first time, I was immediately attracted to her since we had a lot in common. I asked her out after a short courtship of 3 months and she was really into me I felt.\n\nThe only problem was that she was not very keen about the physicality of the relationship. When we hit the sack, initially she was into the foreplay but she won't allow me to remove certain articles of clothing (those being her pants and then eventually her undies). The other problem was that whenever I would try kissing her (going french) she would act awkward or start laughing. I took this in my stride since she hadn't been with anyone before and I assumed she would get used to it eventually.\n\nFast forward 4 years and we are still more or less where we started. She still has a problem with kissing, even after infinite number of tries, and recently, she finally agreed to removing her undies after I told her it was getting really frustrating for me (it's really hard to get a girl off over her undies, trust me). I have never forced her to have sex with me and never will, since I respect her boundaries, but even getting her to have a casual make out session is really hard. \n\nI have recently started thinking maybe she just isn't into me physically. I asked her about this and she kept telling me she is but I don't know what to believe anymore. Things have gotten so bad that I feel weird even talking to her about it because I don't want to force her into anything. \n\nI have had a number of relationships before and I have never faced anything like this. I was quite serious about my current GF and the prospects of marriage have come up, however she initially told me she doesn't believe in the \"institution of marriage\" to which I told her to not waste my time then. After a lot of cajoling she eventually decided she will think about it, but nothing is set in stone.\n\nIn the end I don't want to waste my time since I'm not getting any younger. I have stayed true to her these four years but I am not sure if it can work out anymore. I have had a conversation with her about this and she is asking me to believe her that she is attracted to me physically but I am not so sure.\n\nWhat do you think, is physicality that important in a relationship ?",

      "description": "So to begin with, I'm a very tall person (almost 2m). This makes life pretty uncomfortable, but especially on public transport, as I don't fit in most seats. \n\n\nBecause of this I usually sit in the special access seats so I don't have to be crammed into an uncomfortable/painful position. I will give these up if someone with a pram etc. comes on, but when I sit on a regular seat, I have to turn and take up two seats. \n\n\nI'll avoid this if the bus is truly full, but if there are other spare seats and someone sits next to me I'll hold my ground and depending on the person just sit there with my knees in their space (this is if they seem like a prick), but usually I just say \"sorry I physically can't move my legs over\" and that is that.\n\n\nI'm in two minds, because I don't like being one of those jerks that takes up more than their fair share, but I also don't think I should have to be uncomfortable just because someone decided the seat next to mine was better than any other free seat",

      "description": "All names changed, obviously.\n\nBackstory: this friend (Jake) and I knew each other through a local improv group that had some drama go down. To make a very long story short, his wife (Rachel) is the president of the board for the group, and she got an anonymous letter that demanded that the manager (Ursula) step down because she was mismanaging the group and alienating lots of performers by ignoring the advice of everyone but her inner circle. Ursula dealt with this letter by accusing my friend (Audrey) of writing it by \"matching the handwriting\" on the envelope, and kicked Audrey out. The next day I left in protest, along with four other performers. \n\nTwo months pass, and the real letter writer comes forward (it was a Republican regular who found out that Ursula is poly and got her panties in a twist about it, because I live in a red state and everyone is mad about people who are different than them). One night Jake messages me, and the conversation quickly devolves into him calling me a bad friend for not checking in on him or Rachel while all this was happening. I responded by saying that I HAD wanted to check in, but I also wanted to have the conversation in person, and he was the one who kept canceling on me when I tried to set it up. He says that Rachel owes Audrey an apology, but \"that's all that is owed.\"\n\nWe go back and forth for a while, and he says he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, and I tell him that I’ll respect that. (If I don't seem broken up about this, it's because I wasn't. I had been reflecting on our friendship before this happened, and I realized that Jake's materialism and inability to talk about anything serious or painful unless he was drunk was not something I wanted to be around.)\n\nCut to about a month later. Jake messages me out of the blue and invites me over to watch The Disaster Artist. No mention of any of the drama that I explicitly told him I wanted to talk about before we could hang out like normal again. \n\nAfter calling Audrey, getting her advice, and cursing for a few minutes, I decided to respond with, \"The last time we talked, you called me a bad friend, and I'm really not okay with acting like we can pick up where we left off. I'm sorry, but I can't be friends anymore.\" He responded, \"It's cool. I'm sorry for anything I said that hurt you. I was in a bad place.\" I didn't respond.\n\nAll this happened in June. Since then, I've gotten four messages from Jake. Two of them just said, \"Hey,\" one said, \"How was Portland?\" after I got back from performing in Portland. He sent the most recent one a few days ago, and it says \"Has it been long enough we can try to be friends again?\" \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that it hasn't, and never will be?",

The manager lets him in because she says that she trusts him if she doesn't feel safe being the only person at the gym early in the morning. I have been going to the gym for 20 years. When I asked if I would be allowed to start my workout early I was told no. When I voice my displeasure call Mom I felt as if the manager was talking bad about me behind my back. For instance, she was talking to one of the other gym members who I also talked to. When I asked what they were discussing, he said that he did not want to get involved with it. This leads me to believe that she was talking about me because otherwise he would have alleviated my concerns by telling me that the subject did not involve me.

      "description": "Long post. Obligatory warning about being on mobile and formatting and what not.\n\nSo a little background. My husband and I have been married for just shy of 2 years. We recently moved from our overpriced tiny basement suite back to his home town (a much quieter small town about 45 minutes away). We moved because he hates my home town and I wanted to support him, and when he was offered a higher paying possition in his field of work we decided to pack up and move.\n\nNow I haven't been working much over the last few years. I'm in remission for ovarian cancer, have had several surgeries and my immune system is shot. Because of this I end up sick very easily and have had to give up working in childcare. Because of this my husband has been under a lot of financial pressure and I'm so grateful for all he has done for our family.\n\nWe moved in with his dad, who offered us to stay rent free for a few months to help with our debt. Not the most ideal situation but still necessary as we want to buy a house. I agreed to this, but did find it a bit bothersome since it is a bit out of the way from the nearest city and I don't drive. There is a bus but it only comes every 2 hours.\n\nMy husband has really been on me about getting a job despite the scar tissue pain I have from so many surgeries. I agreed but did suggest we wait until we moved into the city so I could be more reliable for work. He insisted I was making excuses not to work and so I begrudgingly agreed to keep trying to find a job (I have been applying for jobs for the past week and have heard nothing).\n\nToday I'm in the living room with him and inform him I am going to apply for some more jobs while he is playing video games. I had also told him I was having some sensory overload issues today but the video game sounds weren't very loud so I didn't mind.\n\nI'm filling out one of those long 'what would you do' questionaires for a job and he decides he really wants to listen to that \"what's going on\" He-Man meme song. So he turns it on his phone and blasts it loudly. \n\nI remain quite and put on my headphones to try to muffle the noise so I can focus. The song ends. Then he starts playing it again and singing loudly. I let out an annoyed \"seriously?\" And proceed to tell him he is being very inconsiderate since he knows I'm applying for jobs and I can't focus. I know my tone was harsh but we have been having a lot of issues with him not being considerate of me lately. I also stated that since he'd been pushing me to find a job that he should be allowing me that time to do so in quiet.\n\nNow he is mad because he said if I didn't like it I should have just left the living room since I am 'not tethered to my seat' because he 'just wanted to have a fun moment'.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset instead of just leaving or am I correct in finding his behavior very inconsiderate of my needs?",

I think we took enough.\" She told me 1 more. I did, then 1 more because her arm looks big, 1 more cuz she wasn't ready. Then I just didn't smile and looked into the distance during the photos because I just had it. I told her we could take some pics, but not a whole photoshoot.

      "description": "I absolutely HATE my birthday. Not the date but just birthday in general. I wish I could hide it on Facebook so no one would know when it is. It’s not that I’m upset the day isn’t all ME, ME, ME!!! That’s not what I want but I make a big deal about my family members birthdays. I send them many birthday memes and other stuff just to let them know that someone is glad they were born today and are a part of my life. If I get to see them, I buy them a cake with a card and try to take them to dinner or make them dinner. I try to make the day special for them. I guess I set myself up. I sound selfish but I would even be happy with just a cake. The last two years my parents and four other siblings (I unfortunately still live with my parents) forgot. My siblings would say happy birthday and that would be it. My parents would forget and then say “Sorry, I forgot to buy a cake” and go back to watching tv. I’ve had cereal as my birthday dinner the last two years. My siblings don’t think anything of it because they thought my mother was the one who bought the cake and card for them, not realizing it has been me for the past several years since I could work and have money. I’ve stopped letting other family members put their names on the cards I buy now. I hate sounding like a brat but even if I just got a cake, I’d be happy. I just want someone else to be glad I was born and am here. My fiancé sleeps in the same bed with me and he forgot(long story why we are living with my parents for two months till we move out to our own place) his sister told me happy b-day before him and he still hasn’t said it. But would I be an asshole for telling everyone about this if they have all forgot again? Am I just being a child? Is it my own fault because I do too much for others even if they won’t return the action? I want to say screw it and not do anything else for others just I don’t want anyone else to feel the way I do on my birthday. Am I just being a asshole?",

Let me explain her for a second, shes got a past so bad, that when she first told me about it I honestly thought she had gotten it from some Law &amp; order special victims unit episode. domestic abuse, sexual assault/rape, dead parents, cutting, suicide attempt, insomnia, abusive roommate that says kys all the time to her.  I dont blame her for any of this and I usually do not get visibly mad or tell her about my annoyance, often times I even comfort her about it.\n\nHonestly im just getting really uncomfortable with every time I mention my mother its \"well be happy cause my moms dead\", if I say something about how good I slept, \"I couldn't sleep at all because of my nightmares and insomnia\", if I mention how hungry I am its \"well I haven't eaten in 3 days.\" I love her to death I do, and most of the time with her are good and fun, and shes actually really funny, but id understand if it was a once or twice thing but constantly im reminded and made uncomfortable by her when she makes these kinds of comments.\n\nReally the reason I even decided to make this post was because today, i made the oh so terrible mistake of mentioning how I was excited for Christmas, and if she was too and I get \"I hate the holidays cause my moms dead and I cant spend it with her.\" thats why I put annoyed in the title, because I this point i think I get it your mom is dead... this was the first time I actually got visibly annoyed, and now she thinks im mad because she dosent like Christmas, thats not it im annoyed that my excitement for something was shot down once again by her. \n\nAITA for thinking this way?",

      "description": "I’m having a small party for my daughter’s 4th birthday. Our funds are limited so I bought only enough food for around 30 people. I then told my sister in laws that due to limited food and funds, only family is invited and to please not let their kids invite friends, boyfriends or girlfriends etc. \n\nMy hubby has 2 brothers and 2 sisters and they have 15 kids between them. So in total the guest list would be 23 people not including me my hubby and 2 kids. Sometimes extra friends show up and usually I don’t mind because there’s enough to go around. But due to an injury, our income has decreased significantly. \n\nOne of my nieces asked if her half sister could come I said sure but only if it’s her and the baby   and not the baby daddy also because of what I told my sister in laws. She got pissy when my niece told her and said she wasn’t going to go if her “husband” is not welcome.  I told my niece that’s fine with me. Her sister can be a bit dramatic at times and this could cause an issue between my niece and her. \n\nSo AITA for saying family only? ",

      "description": "Sorry about format, I’m on mobile.\n\nSo I have a tightly knit friend group on discord. We all (try) to get along, and it’s overall pretty great. \n\nExcept for one thing.\n\nMy friend, who we will call Mike, is extremely fucking judgmental. For example, a 14 year old girl left our server today, and in the mod group (I happen to be a mod on there) all he did was shit talk about what a slut she was and how he thought she was a stripper and her boyfriend was a pimp and all that nonsense because she said that she liked sex. While I feel like 14 is too young to worry about that stuff that’s her business not mine.\n\nI actually got mad at this, and confronted Mike, and he just told me it was different with me and my boyfriend because I don’t go broadcasting it to everyone? I mean, I don’t but to just not shut up about how someone is a whore to your mods is kind of annoying and very rude.\n\nHowever, there is a catch to all this. Mike is autistic, I don’t know how badly, but he’s 34 and lives with his parents. I feel like a jerk for getting angry at him but like, no one wants to hear someone constantly shit talking someone (who might not even be telling the truth. Young teens are prone to doing that) all because of something they say on a discord server. \n\nSo, the big question. AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway for privacy.\n\nI (F, 20s) am a middle/high school English teacher.\n\nIn my middle school English class (13yos) we have a routine where the kids silently read their assigned novels for the first 10 mins. As per school policy, if they forget their novel they receive an infringement (a 'point' on their record for minor offences; they accumulative points means a detention). The class has been clear on this rule from the get-go. If a kid forgets their book, I just hand them the infringement slip, and they either fetch it from their locker, or grab a random book from the class shelf.\n\nA few days ago, class started like normal. When the 10 mins of reading was almost up, I see one girl (P) fiddling in her seat, no book in sight. I ask her where her book is, she says in her locker. I'm thinking, she didn't say anything because she wants to avoid the infringement, and thought she could get away with it.\n\nI address the class/P calmly but sternly: \"P has forgotten her novel, but the main issue is that reading time is nearly over and she hasn't said anything.\" I send her to go and fetch her book, and when she returns, I say: \"Reading time is now over, and sending you to get your book may seem like a waste of time. However by not making an effort to get a book, you've wasted your own reading time. Next time, please remember to be up front right away.\" P apologises and class continues as normal.\n\nThat evening, I get a lengthy email from P's mum accusing me of 'deliberately humiliating' her daughter for an 'honest mistake'. With my mentor's blessing, I call the mum the next day and explain that the main issue was not that P had forgotten her book, but that she tried to hide it, hence why I called her out. I politely tell her that while I acknowledge that P may have taken it personally, my expectations are simple and have been the same from the start of the year. I also said that given that I'm an approachable teacher, and have offered many chances (students had a grace period of about a week or so at the start of the year), there isn't really an excuse for wasting time, especially when there is a bookshelf in the room. Mum seems to accept this, and I finish by saying I'll talk to P the next day.\n\nChat with P goes well, I just talk with her briefly after class about the conversation I had with her mum. I acknowledge that she may have taken it personally, and it was not my intention to humiliate her. I reiterate my expectations about being honest. P is agreeable about this, and we part ways positively. That evening, I receive an angry email from her mother. She is not happy about the fact that I didn't apologise for my 'wrong doing' as she put it, and has requested a meeting this coming week with me and my mentor, as she doesn't feel the issue is resolved.\n\nAITA for calling P out? I genuinely didn't mean to humiliate her, and I saw it as a teaching point for her/the class. Should I have apologised to her/the mum?",

      "description": "For clarification, this happened quite a while ago, but has been on my mind ever since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, a good friend of mine introduced me to this guy, I'll call him \"Dennis\". Pretty much from the start it was clear that he had some romantic interest in me, but I wasn't so sure about how I felt -  at that point, I'd never had a serious romantic relationship and was generally pretty inexperienced. Also, I had a crush on a guy who I thought was not interested in me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause we shared a lot of interests and also because I was eager to gain new experiences, I kept seeing \"Dennis\", even though I had no romantic or sexual interest in him at all. Not much happened (we didn't even kiss), until we went to a Party together - I got very drunk and we made out. The next day, he asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. I honestly don't know why I agreed, I suppose I just felt pressured by the fact that we had kissed and there was no \"objective\" reason not to fall in love with him (this is no excuse though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI regretted my decision instantneously, but I didn't have the Courage to tell him until the other guy \"Leonard\" asked me out, and I broke up - not even a week had passed. ( \"Leonard\" and I are now almost a year in a relationship together, and I am still extremely happy with him.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo: AITA for this?

      "description": "I'm a senior in high school. I've had a best friend since tenth grade. In the middle of our junior year me and my friend got stressed out and afraid because we felt like there was no way for us to beat the pressure. We felt like there was no chance of us getting to a university we wanted. So, we made a pact that either we go to community college or we go to university, but whatever decision we make we make it together.\n\nWell, since then I got better. In fact, a week ago I got into my dream school. He was in the room when I found out, and I was excited. More excited than I've ever been. My friend hadn't gotten himself together, though. He couldn't get his grades back up and in some places they dropped significantly. Later that day as we're walking home my friend tells me he's mad at me. Because not only am I breaking the promise I made, I'm excited to break the promise -- as if it didn't mean anything to me. He felt betrayed. And for the past couple of days I've felt guilty. I made my friend feel like he didn't matter to me and that I was excited to leave him behind. \n\nBut I'm going to this school. There's no way I'm giving up this opportunity I've been working for. But at the same time I want my friend to be there in my life -- and I don't want a promise that was my idea, that I broke -- to ruin it. \n\nAm I an asshole for breaking a promise with my friend?",

I get very upset with this situation and it ends with us both shouting to each other. He says that my order contains at least 50% of what i have ordered and that i should just accept it and i can eat some of what he ordered too. Right now the whole evening has been ruined and we are sitting in different rooms not talking to each other.

He still expects me to pay everything off and then gets upset/confused when I tell him that our water bill is past due, or my account was negative so I couldn't go grocery shopping. \n\n\n\n\nSo, AITA for wanting more money from my husband to get shit done even though it is \"his\" money.

      "description": "Just a little context before proceeding. This happened today, and I was feeling not well mentally ever since I woke up. In fact, I was so not in the mood so I haven't yet until now.\n\nAnyway, here we go:\n\nMy girlfriend went to my apartment to hang out while her parents were doing groceries. We chilled until her parents got back home, and we were planning to have dinner on her way home. She watched funny videos on Facebook while I played a video game. Anyway, I was starving that point and my mood wasn't a hundred a percent. Her parents texted us that they are home already so we decided to get ready and go there too. My apartment is located on the 2nd floor by the way, and when we were at the ground floor and about to leave she told me that she accidentally left her eye glasses in my apartment (she's the clumsy type who often does this, but i wasnt in the mood this time to be patient with it). So i gave her the keys and told her to get it while i prep the motorcycle, which has a process that involves opening a huge gate, taking out the motorcycle, and closing the huge gate. So now im out on the street sitting on my motorcycle, waiting for her to come down. But i saw her struggling to do the trivial task of closing the door and locking it. Nothing was wrong with the door. She just needs to lock the door knob and exert a little bit of force to close it. She was signaling me to come help her and I was pissed of course because i was starving already and it's such a simple task to do. So i went upstairs angrily, grabbed the keys from her hand, and accidentally bumped her with my left shoulder when i faced the door. Now, i was pissed but i didnt mean to hit her with my body. Then i proceeded to slightly angrily close the door in front of her and told her that it was that easy. So i headed down first and she followed, but she didnt ride with me and told me that she'll take the bus instead. I told her that i didnt mean to hurt her and i was pisses because of the delays but along the street she was screaming at me that i have an ugly attitude. Not telling me, screaming at me. So now Im back in my apartment, lying down on my bed and wondering if i didnt have the right to be angry and react like that or not. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Every year, my friends and I schedule a trip to catch up and hang out, seeing as we are in different cities. It was decided this year that I would schedule the Airbnb for our stay, to be later reimbursed by everyone. This isn't typically a problem, but not everyone has Venmo/Zelle, so the organizer has to sometimes wait until the start of the trip in order to be paid back in cash. The trip is typically scheduled half a year out.\n\nThe total for our Airbnb was roughly $800 for our entire stay. Since I had never opened an Airbnb account, I searched for a promotion and found that I could get $40 off my first stay. Later, I also saw a credit card offer in my banking app that would reimburse me 15% in statement credit for any bookings on Airbnb. Finally, when booking the Airbnb, I received 1.5% cash back as part of my credit card's rewards. In total, I am saving roughly $150 by making this purchase on behalf of everyone. I'm a bit conflicted about where the line is between the money that I should keep, and what I am obligated to share.\n\nPart of me feels that I'm justified, in that I volunteered to do something no one was particularly enthusiastic about doing. And though I can certainly expect to be paid back, it is essentially a small short-term loan. AITA if I keep this money?",

He's been really depressed so when I go over there on the weekends I had been trying to cheer him up by letting him come with me on little errands or having lunch with him while my bf worked and stuff.\n\n Sunday night he \"got the wrong idea\"  while we were alone on the couch and whipped his junk out. I went home asap and called my boyfriend to explain what happened when he got out of work. My boyfriend was more \"worried about me being okay\" (which I am, and I also feel the same way) and less offended at his friend. He doesn't want to see him but he justified everything by saying he's depressed. I (who also has MDD) feel like depression shouldn't let you feel comfortable trying anything with a friend's girlfriend... especially if that friend is nice enough to let you sleep under his roof when his girlfriend kicked him out. \n\nAITA for not caring about this guy's depression as a factor as to why he did this?

I kissed him on the lips a few times but he wanted to make out and kept coming back for more. Since we’d both just woken up we both had morning breath which isn’t exactly super enjoyable and it was starting to overwhelm me. He came back in for another one and I sort of pulled away (I feel bad for that) and told him we should brush our teeth first. Now a few hours later he’s still upset about it and says if i “don’t want him at his worst I can’t have him at his best”. I’m trying my best to express to him that it’s not that I don’t love him or think he’s gross, it’s just not enjoyable because we both have morning breath. I’m just thinking if we can both take two minutes to brush our teeth it would be much better. He doesn’t believe me and says me being a germaphobe is hurting him and the relationship. It’s true that I’m kind of a germaphobe, but mostly just with washing my hands before I eat and whatever and I try not to let it get in the way of us too much. But maybe I should’ve just put up with him kissing me and not made a comment? Was I being rude? AITA?",

      "description": "My husband (“H”) and I co-lead a teen youth group with another couple. Our team discussed how a couple of older boys often play on their phones during the program. We’d heard that phones were a big power struggle issue in the past from previous staff, so we agreed that H would pull the boys aside privately this week to encourage them to participate and set a good example.\n\nWell, the boys arrived late, so H wasn't able to check in with them before we started. The wife from the other couple (“S”) sees the boys on their phones, and loudly announces from the front of the room that the boys in the back need to put their phones away. S then stands next to them while I lead our message time, hovering until they reluctantly obey.\n\nAfterwards, I mention that we probably should have stuck to the plan, because if we call the boys out and embarrass them, they may end of resenting us instead of actually being motivated to participate. S is quite taken aback by this, says she doesn't think she called them out or interfered with the plan. I decide this is not a hill I want to die on, and try to just quickly end the conversation (with the \"smile and nod\" technique).\n\nA few days later, S texts and asks to meet with me \"to finish our conversation.\" I reluctantly agree and we meet up. She says she felt personally attacked, and that it was like a “hit and run” since I then tried to drop the conversation. I explain I understood her reasoning of why she did it, it wasn't a big deal, and I didn’t want to start an argument. She asks that we go over the details of our perspectives, walk through what I would have done in her place, etc. So we do.\n\nBut 45 minutes in, and the conversation now seems to be going in circles. I still think it wasn’t the best thing to do. She still thinks she in the right, and is trying to get me to agree I should have done the same thing her position. I finally snap at her and say we’ve already discussed this several times now and this conversation isn’t productive.\n\nShe tells me I’m being very hurtful and asks if I “have a problem with talking things out.” She says the right thing to do is work through the situation, and I’m being immature in not wanting to keep talking about it.

      "description": "A few weeks ago I broke up with my gf on 10 months because she was very emotionally manipulative. I wasn’t able to do anything without her, and she would be very annoyed and angry with me for doing anything outside of her. We’ve shared a lot of memories together, but it was just too much. I really liked being with her, but it got to the point where all I did was either be in class or be with her. There’s a lot of things, like, no one in my family thought we were a good match, we were doing things we weren’t supposed to, i was constantly lying to my family, and more. \nShe’s really upset and trying to get back together and she says she will change, but my family highly advised against it. \nAITA?",

      "description": "I'll just cut to the chase here. So in the apartment I'm renting out, I have 2 roommates. We didn't really do any planning of any sort for how we would lay out our room and who gets what area to themselves so we just winged it upon moving in and as it turns out, I ended up bringing my own bed frame and my mattress and they ended up buying a bunk bed frame together as well as their separate mattresses.\n\nThe topic finally came up one day about whether or not we would switch where we sleep (top bunk, bottom bunk, and solo; we agree that top is the worst, bottom is suboptimal, and solo is king) and I told them I'd hold off on a decision but I'm thinking I shouldn't have to move since I own my bed frame and feel it would be weird if any of them uses it (especially since one has a girlfriend) and vice versa if I slept in theirs.\n\nWe've gotten along well all year and I doubt whatever happens with this situation will harm our relationship, but would I be the asshole if I refused to give up my solo bed frame spot? I won't lie I mostly don't want to move for comfort however I sometimes also toss and turn in my sleep. Thank you in advance!",

My sister says to just let him tell the story but we're all adults here and my dad always tells me I have a pass to mess with him if he gets Alzheimer's and asks me the same question repeatedly, I feel I should let him know if he repeats a story too but I know the common courtesy is to let the elders speak.

      "title": "AITA for not giving up the head seat of the table to my father",
      "description": "A bit of background: I (21M) find myself in a dilemma with this current scenario, not knowing whether I was being unreasonable or not, it has knocking about in my head for the past couple of days with no definitive conclusion. Me and my dad normally have quite a good relationship, but I felt really sourly towards him after this scenario and have a few times in my life, really resented him. In contrast, the relationship I have with my mum is fantastic and we rarely disagree on anything.\n\nSo, to the story: I have just dropped my girlfriend with her parents so that we can both have the day with our respective families. I get back to our holiday home and ask if anyone needs help preparing for our family lunch. Only little help is needed and my two siblings and grandmother are already sitting at the table, and there is still quite a while before lunch is served. I take a seat at the head of the table as to not have my back to the kitchen, where people are cooking, but still able to be involved in conversation. We chat for about an hour before lunch is beginning to be laid out on the table.\n\nMy father was responsible for the barbecue (we live in New Zealand, so it is summer time, and a relatively overcast day). As he puts the barbecued food on the table he asks relatively politely if I can move so that he can sit where I am. I ask politely in return why he wants to sit here. He answers by saying again that is where he would like to sit, so I say no, with my rationale being that his reasoning is simply the same as my reasoning to be sitting in this spot, plus I have the added reasoning being that I am already in said seat.\n\nHe goes to get something from the kitchen for the table and comes back and states that if I do not move he will be very angry with me, to which I reply that if I cannot sit here, then I will simply leave. My dad then goes into the garage to do something which I do not know. In the mean time the rest of my family convinces me to move seats, and we go on with our Day.\n\nFurther backstory and my current thoughts: 1st: at our holiday home there are not the kind of allocated seating plans that we have at home where each person sits at the same place when having a family meal. Plus, there were guests which normally throws all prior seating normalities out the window. 2nd: I don’t like doing things simply because someone says so. 3rd: I don’t like how in the end, the burden had fallen to me to be the one to be the grown up and move when he was the one causing the fuss. 4th: the only seat left was next to my mum (his wife) and if it were me I’d much rather sit next to my SO than at the head of the table\n\nTrying to view from my dads side: I am finding it difficult to view from his side (hence the post). But if I were to speculate the most reasonable cause for him wanting me to move was because it is his house and should be able to sit where he wants. If I go into less reasonable reasons, it could be some weird power move or some bull hierarchical subconscious thing, where he wouldn’t feel like a man if is son were at the head of the table.\n\nSorry for the long post but I am really struggling with this one and kinda need an unbiased third party at this point for my own sanity. Also, I know that I am probably biased towards my own point of view, but am having a hard time getting over that for this specific case.\n\nTL;DR: my dad asked me to move from the head of the table which I had been sitting at for an hour, I said no, he got upset, I moved when my family convinced me, when dad left the room",

All she has to pay for is the electric bill and groceries.  The electric bill jumped quite a bit for December and she freaked out asking me for money to cover it because it would break her budget.  Of course I do because why say no when I have the ability to help.  But when I get home she is excited to show me several things she got from the clothing store.  I asked her how she could afford that if she didnt have money for her one bill.  She just said that it was Christmas money she got from her mom.  While I do think I should help when she needs it.  I think it was really not cool of her to not communicate fully like this.  Am I crazy?",

While also I am all for women empowerment. \n\nSo, the situation is my friend and I are also gym buddies. We work out together everyday. Recently, he started talking to this woman that goes to our gym. I'm all for it! \n\nWe were at the gym earlier and she happened to be there too with a friend. \n\nThey mosey their way over to the squat rack next to ours. No problem, She likes him and they can talk. They need help with the spring clip collars for the end of the barbell. They're kind of acting like the damsel in distress trope.\n\nHere's where I could be the asshole and where I think since they are acting all weak (These women are regulars like us). He walks over to help and I make the joke \"That's why women don't belong in the gym\". \n\nI made sure to say this in the goofiest voice, so it couldn't be construed as me being serious. \n\nThe friend of the woman said something to the affect of \"That's gross\". I say \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that seriously\" \n\nI finish my set because there is no way to salvage that situation. My friend and I go to work in another area for a different leg muscle. He says to me \" Bro, I don't think you know how to talk to people\"\n\nNow, I know after the fact I shouldn't have said it but hindsight is 20/20 because they weren't the crowd for the joke.  I also feel my friend was wrong for how he approached me about it basically implying I'm a child instead of saying hey that isn't cool and say how I should work on it but I digress.\n\n\n\nSo reddit AITA for making that joke? \nWill make sure to apologize if I am in the wrong. \n\n",

I never went there and don't know anyone from my father family except some cousin who went live in France too. \n\nTwo of my 3 sisters went with my father 15 years ago and since this moment he tells me and my other sister he will bring us there to discover where we are coming from. But he never did. Mostly because it's too expensive. \n\nNow I'm 24 and started working in September and since October he asks me to come with him to Madagascar in July since I started to make some money. I said I didn't want because I don't want spending so much money right and I'd rather saving it (the plane ticket is around 700€) but he insists and say it's important for me to connect with my origins. \n\nI never really cared about my origins since all I know is France. I think I'll go at least one time in my life because I think he is right, it's important to connect with my origins but right now, I'd rather not.  \n\nIt was never a big deal for him either that I never went there but now I can pay for it we have to do it this summer. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to go with him ?",

      "description": "Okay so this year my boyfriend bought a house and we moved in together. We worked really hard to renovate and make it our own, but found money to be tight with all the renovations and new bills/expenses. We have an extra room and bathroom, so we decided to rent it out and get a roommate! This has helped tremendously when it comes to finances and we don’t mind sharing our space.\n\nWe posted online and found someone quickly. Now, we are not the most tidy people, and we specified this very clearly in our post. Our house is not a pigsty (The house actually had a really bad roach infestation when we bought it, and we worked really hard and spent a lot of money to fix the issue... so we wouldn’t do anything that might ruin that) but there is some clutter and sometimes we leave dishes in the sink for a day or two before washing them. We don’t use many so they take a while to pile up. Anyway, we find a roommate, and she says she’s fine with us being a little messy. She’s a really nice girl and we welcome her, give her a bed, and help her settle in.\n\nA few weeks go by and I’ll admit, we let the kitchen get messier than usual. Suddenly I get a text from my boyfriend that Roommate had texted him (From in our house, where I also was. Don’t know why she didn’t just talk to me) saying that the dishes are starting to bother her and she would appreciate if we could keep up with them a little better, as she’s been keeping her room and bathroom clean and taking care of all of her dishes. I felt really bad and immediately went to the kitchen and helped her clean up while apologizing. She explained that she didn’t want to come off rude, but it was bothering her because now that she has “her own place” she feels like it’s different because it’s “her space” and wants it to stay clean because what if she has friends over? Fair enough. \n\nWe didn’t let it get to that point again. We would have a couple dishes in the sink at a time, but would always clean up before it became a “mess”. Yet lately we have come home to her cleaning our stuff and while making small talk, she would describe how she’s SO tired from work but the mess is just killing her so she’s cleaning it anyway. And telling us about how she cleaned all the dishes and wiped all the counters and organized the shoes by the front door (she seems to have an obsession with the shoes lol). It comes off pretty passive aggressive, like we’re assholes for making her do it. I mean, she’s welcome to clean if she wants the place clean, but I feel like we made it extremely clear before she moved in that we are not super neat and tidy people. Yet it seems like she expects us to keep the place neat and tidy for her at all times. She “confronted” us about it again the other day and I just apologized and cleaned the place up. But like, am I crazy? She’s still a nice girl, but I’m starting to dread running into her at home because I don’t want to hear it. My boyfriend is equally annoyed. Are we the assholes here?",

      "description": "Now I know that the title is already showing me as an asshole. But hear me out here, I'm starting from the beginning.\n\nI'm really hyped about candy and always get my candy from sorta fancy gourmet shops, and it's pretty expensive to me.\n\nSo one week (this happened just about last week) I bought fancy cotton candy, which costed me about $7.50, and for someone with no real income, this was a real treat.\n\nThere was actually a sale, buy 2 get 1 free, so i spent 15 bucks for 3 tubs of cotton candy. (These tubs weren't huge, they were about the size of soup containers)\n\nI show up to school boasting my pretty cotton candy, and occasionally enjoying some until 3rd period comes along. \n\nIn this class, I sit with 3 of my friends, and another girl who is the girl whose stuff got cut up.\nI share some cotton candy with them, and all is well and I put it away for a moment.\n\nI bring it back because one of my really good friends is pleading for more cotton candy (it was her favorite kind of candy and I owe her one for a favor she did for me), so I roll it across the table for her to just take a handful out of the tub and roll it back.\n\nAnd I audibly say that 'here, FRIEND, just take some.'\n\n Then, while I slowly roll it across the table, the girl snatches it off the table and takes a big handful (about 1/4 of the tub) and eats it in my face. My friend takes some and NOBODY seems to question it. \n\nI ask her why she took my cotton candy, and she just calls it 'taxes', and stares at me with a death glare.\n\nI'm just so spineless, that I don't say anything about it. Who's gonna stand up for me? It was just cotton candy, I could always get more...\n\nBut I was just so appalled at her, it was like when people would take your stuff in a joking way, and you didn't really expect them to actually take it and pass it off as a joke.\n\nSo I got to work and pulled some scissors out of my bag. We were supposed to sketch objects that we could disassemble from home, and she brought a small cheese grater cylinder, which came with a small thing cardboard box. I started cutting it up right in front of her, and I SWEAR I saw here just look at me and say nothing.\n\nEventually, she looks around, and then stares at me cutting up her box with an audible gasp, making all my friends turn and look at me.\n\n\"What the heck, why are you cutting my box?\"\nMe: idk, why did you take my cotton candy?\nGirl: it was just a joke, chill! Fix my box, I really need it!\n\nThen I proceed to tape the box back together and she gives me death glares. \n\nShe gets even hissier when I don't share any other cotton candy that I've brought in this week.\n\nBut was I an asshole for cutting up her stuff? She took my stuff, and I even fixed the box, but my friends call me selfish and stingy :(",

      "description": "I’ll try to make this as clear as possible. My friend, we will call her J, was texting me about birthday plans 4 days ago. I usually do two or three things for my birthday knowing not everyone can make it to one event so it gives anyone who wants to see me a chance to show up whenever they can. I told J a couple of my other friends wanted to go out Saturday night, but also that I made plans for brunch Sunday morning as I have friends who don’t drink or are recovering addicts. She asks me if we can go to a downtown area on Saturday night that is 45-50 minutes away from where we all live because she’s never been there. So I say okay because I know she’s been wanting to go. Tell everyone else let’s go to this bar at said downtown area at 10. Fast forward to 7 PM last night and I haven’t heard from her but know she’s been off work since 5 so I text her, saying we are going to head out after dinner and ask if she’s still coming, she texts back saying she’s staying in because she has to make her rent so I simply said okay and actually went and texted my other friends that I was changing the location closer to us, realizing I didn’t want any of them to have any amount of drinks and then drive 50 minutes home or pay for a really expensive Uber. She texts back and says she’s working today in the afternoon and is on call all morning (bartender) but that she can come to the brunch, I simply said I made plans for this venue (they have a sister restaurant next to her job, I chose the one more convenient to every else that I know is coming) and I’m not changing it because everyone else already RSVP’D and left it at that. She didn’t text back. I don’t plan on texting her before brunch today to see if she’s coming, I’m not saving a seat for her either. \n\nAm I the asshole... ",

The typical cost for a keg is around $100. The deposit for the keg (returned when you bring it back, they’re expensive) is $25. The total cost to walk out with a keg is $125... you get the $25 back when you return your empty keg. \n\nOne time I walk into the wine and spirits section of a grocery store to return my empty keg and purchase a new one. I find a specialty half keg that I like costing $60.   \n\nThe way this transaction should work is that I pay $60 for the keg, $25 for the deposit, and get refunded for the $25 deposit. I end up paying $60 out of pocket. \n\nI’m filling out a form for buying a keg, so I’m not paying much attention. She hits some buttons and hands me $40, smiling.\n\nI said wait what?  This can’t be right. She “confirmed” this was right. I said I gave you an empty keg, you gave me a full keg, shouldn’t I be paying you?  She said no. I shrugged and left.   What she must have done is charge me for the $60 keg, charge me for the $25 deposit, refund me the $25 deposit, and refund me the $100 full cost of the keg I returned... she shouldn’t do the last one - it was empty.  \n\nJust for reference she was ~20 and attractive. I’m around 35, male, and not attractive. I don’t think this was anything intentional on her part. \n\nThe next time I went in I told a manager that checked me out at the resister what happened, leaving out specifics of the employee. \n\nAm I the asshole for being paid to pick up beer?

      "description": "I have been friends with this guy for a long time and we have always \"almost dated\", but always somehow stayed just friends.\n\nLast year, while I was away at college, he finally officially asked me out on a date when I got back home permanently in a few weeks. I was very excited and couldn't wait to get back home to see him and possibly start a romantic relationship. He kept talking about how he couldn't wait for me to get back, how we'd hang out right away, etc etc. I was definitely not picking up signs wrong here, he was very clear.\n\nWhen I actually got back home from college, and messaged him ,he was evasive. I didn't know what I'd done wrong and kept trying to set up a time to meet up, but he kept dodging hangouts and saying he was busy. I was driving myself insane wondering what I'd done wrong between then and now to make him change his mind so drastically.\n\nA few months later, I come to learn through the grapevine that sometime between when he started messaging me last year and when I actually came back, he met another very pretty girl and started pursuing her. They are now officially together and have been for like 6 months.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I felt misled and very hurt and rejected. While he did clearly choose this girl over me, me and him had never officially dated or even kissed so it's not like I had any sort of \"claim\" over him or real justification to be mad. I just felt stupid for being so mad over it and didn't want to interact with him anymore. \n\nI think he knows what he did as he tried to set me up with his friend which didn't work out, but that just insulted me even more that he'd basically shove me over to his friend like that.\n\nNow, about a year after he started messaging me and i left college, he is trying to hang out again, solely as friends. (he is still with the same girl.) I really don't want to, and not only that, I don't want to talk to him at all anymore. He keeps messaging me, not knowing why I don't want to see him or talk to him. It almost feels like nice karma to me because that's how I felt last year, messaging him like a clueless idiot. \n\nI don't feel I owe him an explanation and I don't want to hang out with him anymore. Even though we were never together, and I have no real reason to take offense to it,  I was hurt by what he did.\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for asking after my old car, when my dad gave me a new one?",
      "description": "5 years ago: My grandpa, who is too old to drive, gives me his old car. Two years later, my dad suggests to me that the car can be transferred to his name, so that I would get lower insurance costs. It would still remain as my car, to use and take care of. I, as a poor student, accept. Everything goes fine. \n\nEarlier this year, my dad suggests that we should buy a new, safer car for me and my girlfriend (who is pregnant). He has some extra money after my grandpa died. The idea is that we buy some good used car and pay it 50/50 with my girlfriend, with my dad paying my half. We had not really talked what the plan was with the old car. Just keep it somewhere, for the time being, in case someone needs a second car, or something. Or if my parents talked about it, I never heard of it. \n\nWe go look for some cars, and we find one very good offer. Me and my gf go to check the new car, and while not perfect, it is very good, and the price/quality ratio is excellent. We decide to get it. Also in the local car dealership they are willing to pay a ample minimum for any car given in exchange. The thing is, that the minimum they promise to dish out is much more than my old car is actually worth. Me and my dad talk and agree that we will give my old car to the dealership, and what remains of the price we will pay 50/50 as planned. We wanna buy the car before someone else buys it (which is what happened to us before). I get a written offer from the dealership, which is basically what they asked for, minus what they give for my old car. \n\nHowever, I am working the next day, so we agree that my parents and my gf go to the dealership in my stead, to test the car and buy it if everything is good.\n\nAround noon, I get a text from my girlfriend. The deal is made. But she is confused, and then I get confused. The car is more expensive than in the offer. I text to my parents and later I found out this is what happened. \n\nThe morning of the deal, my mom met an old acquaintance by chance, who earlier expressed interest of buying my old car. Having completely forgotten his offer, she was embarrassed and agreed to sell it to him instead. They got from him a little bit less than what the dealership was willing to pay, so instead my mom haggled the price down quite a bit in the store. The final price was still higher than the earlier offer I got, but as there was now no old car to be traded, in that sense the deal was better. \n\nStill me and my gf were confused. How come we got a better deal, but still we have to pay more? What happened to the money that we got from my old car? \n\nI ask my dad, and he replies to me that the old car was never really mine, as I never paid anything for it. I reply that, yes, because my grandpa *gave* it to me, and actually I have paid for the car: every tax, insurance, repair, gas, etc. for the past five years. My dad tells me to stop complaining and appreciate the new car instead. I tell him that we are grateful, but we have to be careful with our money, since we have a child on the way, so I need to ask what happened since the last time we spoke. He is getting irritated, and he indirectly says to me that I am ungrateful complainer. \n\nThe thing is, I can understand his point of view. He paid a Substantial Amount for the new car, which is a considerable upgrade to our old one. He is not that wealthy either. But instead of focusing on his good deed, he sees me focusing on the old car, which was worth maybe 15% of the price of the new car. Instead of me seeing him as a benefactor, he maybe felt that I saw him as a cheater. \n\nIn reality, it was bit of both. I am grateful for his contribution. Without it we could not have afforded to buy a new used car. But I am still irritated. I feel like he broke my trust on several fronts: \n\n\\- He indirectly claimed the ownership to my old car. It was in his name due to lower insurance costs, so I had no legal way to prove it was mine anymore. I had the legal documents from five years ago, when grandpa gave it to me, but showing them did not help, my dad can be stubborn. I had trusted him when we moved the car to his name, that I would still own it, that was the agreement. I felt he broke that trust. \n\n\\- We already had agreed to the deal already, both with the dealership and with them, but they changed it without asking me, to a new one that was more beneficial to him, but worse for my girlfriend who now had to pay more for her half. \n\nI guess that the last part is the reason why I had hard time to accept this. My situation had not changed, I still did not pay for the new car (except later taxes, insurances and so on). But my girlfriend was confused (she does not speak the local language) on why she suddenly had to pay more, and why there is no money from the old car to reduce the combined price, like I said there would be. Now, basically, the old car price was reduced only from the portion my dad had to pay. \n\nThe thing is, if we had agreed that my dad gets the old car or whatever money he can get from it, and in return I get a new car, I would have been more than happy to comply. It would have been a great deal for me. But now he just laid claim on things, and got irritated when I asked what happened and questioned him. \n\nFor him and mom to sell my car to a third party without my knowledge, keep the money, alter the deals we already made, and then claim that the car was never mine in the first place, made me mad. It was mine in every way but name. It was worth only little, but it was mine (my mom eventually believed me, after I showed the legal papers). \n\nBut on the other hand, I got a nice new car (well, new to me), without paying for it. Did I have the right to complain? Am I the asshole? ",

I say I'm glad I had a daughter because my mother, who is also very involved with my daughter, was a single mom and my daughter's father has chosen to be completely absent.

I don't like that she's a girl because I want to dress her up like a doll or anything like that, there's just something nice and relatable about having a daughter and having my \"core family unit\" of my mom, my daughter, and me being all women.\n\nAITA for feeling this way?",

      "description": "Let me start at the beginning.\nMy parents and I have never had a great relationship, I was adopted by them when I was 5, and honestly a pretty hard headed kid, so was my brother who was adopted with me (blood brother), that being said I always lied to them, did stupid kid stuff, and we fought I am not exaggerating, daily. \n \nOnto the story.\nI turned 18 in January of 2018, \nOn may 18th, 2018 in Santa Fe Texas, dimitrios pagourtzis brought a sawed off shotgun to school, around 7:30 ish I believe it was, a fire alarm went off, I was doing my makeup in first period, as it was the end of the year and we didn’t have much to do in class. \nEveryone thought it was a drill, until we were outside of the school, we heard a shotgun go off in the art wing. \nEveryone ran, everyone was terrified, we now knew this wasn’t a drill, and ran to the nearest safe place. \n8 students and 2 substitute teachers passed away.\n\nNow that you have the gruesome details, here is how I decided to go about it. \nThe Sunday after the shooting, I went to church as well as most of Santa Fe. I shook hands with governor greg Abbott, he asked me a question or two about school security and what we can do to improve it, and I gave him an honest answer, telling him the doors are not secure, And this is coming from someone who would have teachers cover for me to sneak out of class and go home early almost daily. \nMSNBC saw my answer with greg, and asked me to do an interview, I texted my mom after the service and she was very excited...\nThen my dad heard about it \nHe threatened to take my truck if I did the interview, he felt like I would ruin his business by saying something stupid, but I told him I AM doing the interview, because I NEED to inform other schools on how to make things a little safer, as in, locking doors during school hours (dimitrios came in after class had started through an unlocked door) as well as being more strict in certain things \nI did the interview, and immediately got kicked out and went to live with my boyfriend. \nI have tried apologizing but they just don’t want to hear it. My whole life its been “their way or the highway” and this time I actually had something to say that could benefit other schools. \nAITA for going against them or was it my right to decide? It’s been almost a year with very little contact with my parents. ",

Therefore minimum three days off work to attend, sorting out extensive rota swaps, flights, accomodation etc - ok it's cheaper for you, no problem. \n\nNext, who gets invited (wedding of approx 60) on his side.\nSiblings, parent, couple of longstanding plus 1s. Seven, if they all make it which isn't gonna be the case for at least one plus one, so say six. \nOne friend, one best man, couple of relatives of thiers he is closeish to. Five. \nNo other friends, invites sent to five or six distant cousins who are unlikely to make it - say max six, most probably one.  \nApparently all the rest are her family. 45+ to his most likely 12. No other friends. Initially it was supposed to be roughly equal, with strictly careful spending limits. \n\nIt's also he is trying to do this cheaply as they aren't long out of uni and wants to buy a house, fair do, but why then invite 40+ distant family? \nHer immediate/emotionally close family max out at about ten/twelve people. He has had no say in who she invites, or any of the plans, and is just nodding at everything. She insists on every point for her \"perfect day\". \n\nAITA for feeling this is gonna be a miserable experience and wishing he wasn't marrying her? ",

      "description": "This has been bothering me for months, bouncing around inside my head. \n\nLast year, my mother started using one of those singing apps. I think it was called Smule. She tried putting her voice out, and after getting lots of positive attention, ended up getting obsessed with singing. \n\nMy problem is that she spends too much time on it. She'll constantly have her earphones plugged in both ears, either singing or listening to music. She does this while driving, preparing for work, putting herself to sleep, and basically all of her free time.\n\nBeing constantly on that app is a problem for the rest of our family. \n\nMy father gets irritated because she barely hears him speak, and thinks it's dangerous to drive with earphones plugged in. He also complains that she doesn't spend enough time with our family.\n\nMy mother will start recording herself singing randomly, so she'll shout at me and my sister to not make a peep. If we make any kind of noise (coughing or sneezing included) near her, she gets angry, telling us we're spoiled children. Once in a while she'll play a victim card, complaining that her life is boring, singing makes her happy, and bothering her makes her want to kill herself. I don't really care about her complaints, but I'm worried my young, impressionable sister might start copying her behavior.\n\nI try to talk to my mother, but most of the times she has her air pods in, so she'll either rip them out, with an annoyed look on her face, or just not hear me at all. \n\nI feel like this is my fault somehow.  It just pushes my insecurities, making me wonder what is happening to our relationship. I've broken down to my father about it, but my mother got defensive when he tried to talk to her about it.\n\nI've tried to confront her on these problems, but every time I tell her about how uncomfortable I feel about her hobby, she *snaps.* She'll tell me that she hates her life, and using her app is the only thing that makes her happy. She'll sarcastically call me a princess, and says that she isn't just my servant. I just want to have a conversation with her. \n\nI barely get to see my parents because of our busy schedules. Talking to my mother in a car ride for more than two minutes is a damn privilege. I have so many mixed feelings, it's hard to put into words everything about this. AITA?",

      "description": "My gf bought me 3 tickets to see one of my favorite bands in concert for about 100 dollars so her, my best friend, and I could go see them. It was a birthday gift to me, and she talked it over with my friend that he would pay for his own ticket. My best friend pulled out about 3 months before the concert because of school. So I asked my other friends if anyone would like to go, because we had an extra ticket and we’d sell it to them for about 80 rather than 100. One of them well call J said sure and agreed to pay when the concert came around. Awesome. Flash forward to 2 hours before the concert. He said he didn’t want to pay because he “didn’t know the ticket was 80$” even though I showed him our text conversation where I clearly stated he would have to pay. Whatever, my gf and I went had a great time. However she was out 100$.\n\nA few weeks later J buys a UFC pay per view fight for 100$ and tells about 10 people to come over to his place and watch it. We get to last prelim fight and he says “oh yeah since you guys are watching it you all owe me a share of it” everyone else coughs up 10$ but I’m broke, I can barely afford food, so I tell him no. No big deal because he understands my situation. Next week he says he has an extra ticket to a party and invites me to take it. I go, have a good time, and then he wants me to pay for the ticket, only telling me after I already went to the party. \n\nNow he’s demanding that I pay him 20$ that he scammed me out of, so I told him if he’s gonna be a dick about money then since he screwed my gf out of 80$ then he can take the 20 I “owe” him out of the 80$ he “owes” to my gf. AITA for this? \n\n",

      "description": "My brother and his wife are both carriers for the recessive allele for Tay Sach’s Disease. If you didn’t know, Tay Sach’s Disease restricts the production of a protein vital for the development of muscle and tissue, which leads to complications during the development process. Often times this genetic disorder leads to decreased motor control, enlarged internal organs, and the loss of functioning sensory organs with time (primarily vision). \n\nMy brother and his wife are both practicing Catholics and recently announced that they are having another child. This disease renders the child with both recessive alleles, for lack of a better term, a vegetable by the time they hit five years old. Their first daughter has Tay Sach’s disease. They are now expecting another child with the 50% chance of inheriting the terminal illness. WIBTA to suggest to my brother to get an abortion, or at least a vasectomy when he has the chance? I’m afraid I’m going to get extreme backlash from my family but I feel like it’ll be worse on everyone, his family, our parents, his wife’s parents, to have another child brought into the world with such an agonizing future ahead of them. I’ll be honest, it destroys me that they are going to potentially have two children with this terrible condition and I can’t help but be angry at the both of them for letting their religious beliefs get in the way (I believe they’re against contraception and abortion). Financially, this scenario will ruin them as well. I do want to respect their choice to keep the child but I feel like they knew the risk of having unprotected sex when clearly they are carriers.

      "description": "Earlier today, I was out in public and had to take a shit. The bathroom in question had one regular stall and one handicapped stall. I went to the regular stall first, but there was piss all over the seat so I used the handicapped stall instead. Almost immediately after I began my shit, an old man in a wheelchair missing a leg showed up outside my stall and told me to hurry up. I finished my shit, and he angrily asked me \"why didn't you use the other one?\". I infrormed him that there was piss on the seat, to which he said \"you should've just wiped it off, asshole\".\n\nI, for one, feel that he was the asshole. He didn't even have to wait 5 minutes, and it's unreasonable to expect someone to do something gross (like wipe a stranger's piss off a toilet seat with cheap, thin TP) if there's a way for them not to. Even if he was inconvenienced, he could've just let it go and moved on like some kind of adult or something. Handicapped stalls also don't follow the same rules as parking spaces; there's no signage saying they're *exclusively* for handicapped people.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I had been working for this woman on a sub-contract basis for a few months (mostly social media content writing).\n\nI decided to step away from the social media work because her rate of pay was embarrassingly low ($250/month shares between me and one other person). Prior to this I felt she expected a lot (free sample work, in-person meetings, too much back and forth distracting communication).\n\nI decided to finish the one project i was on with her - $500 to write text content for her clients website.\n\nClients wanted to add more work to this job so I contacted her about increasing the rate. She asked me what I thought it would be and I said “about $120-$150” or something (I gave her a range”). She said she was good to increase it, would “contact the client for the amount”, and to carry on.\n\nI carried on with the work but followed up with her 2-3 times about what the exact increased rate would be. She kept saying “I already told you”, didn’t give me an exact number. Then she seemed to get frustrated and told me she needed a “detailed report on my hours” and implied she didn’t think the $500 we had already agreed on as a “flat rate” was warranted. Her reasoning was because the client had provided me with draft text for some of the website content. \n\nMy reply was that I absolutely would not be adjusting the rate for work I had already completed. She sent me a very long, confusing reply and repeated the request for “report on hours”. I started to panic that she wasn’t going to pay me, so I sent her a detailed invoice for the $500 but told her I would have to pull out of all future work.\n\nA few days later she sent me the $500 but told me never to contact her again and that I “lacked professionalism and work ethic”.\n\nI found the whole thing very upsetting and it was hard not to second guess myself. Am I the asshole for being so shocked? We agreed on the $500 as a flate rate and no one said any bring about it changing when the clients provided me the draft copy to work from ",

      "description": "I’ve been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her’s.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  \n\nPretty much since my son was born I’ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I’ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I’m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I’ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  \n\nMy girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we’ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn’t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. \n\nWe are a great team usually.  It’s almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She’s fighting dirty too, she’s been making it out as if I don’t really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That’s not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn’t even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she’d never admit it. \n\nI honestly don’t even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there’s just a big “NO” feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. \n\nI also feel like it’s really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don’t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. \n\nNeither of us have been backing down and it won’t be too much longer until it’s time to give him the money.

      "description": "The story is that my wife's childhood friend (acquaintance now) is breaking up with her boyfriend and father of her 9 month old daughter.\n\nHe is not a good guy and is constantly having problems with the law. He has been verbally and somewhat physically abusive towards her. There is also a pretty good chance that he will be going to jail in the next few months for his 2nd DUI, a hit and run, and drug possession.\n\nHe also found a new GF and is moving out of their apt. She can't afford the rent because he was very controlling of her and wouldn't let her work and wouldn't pay to get her car fixed so she could go and get a job. Like I said, I am not downplaying that he is a major shit bag.\n\nMy wife helped her pack up his items last night and then came home and unloaded the story on me.\n\nIt turns out that she has been in a lot of trouble herself. She lost her job with the Department of Child Services for performance issues that were caused by her starting to use Meth. The meth use stemmed from the guy she was dating prior to this boyfriend. He was a drug dealer and eventually OD'd. She claimed that the stress from him dying is what lead her to try Meth as a way to cope.\n\nThere is a bigger story at play. The old boyfriend was being investigated for his role in selling bad drugs to two other people who ended up OD'ing. She was also involved in it - and from my knowledge had either withheld evidence or destroyed evidence. So there is still an active investigation going on. There is a possibility that she could be wrapped up in this.\n\nMy wife and I are pretty charitable people. We try to help people when we can. That is not the issue for me. My issue is that my wife wants to let her and the child move in here for 2 months until she can get back on her feet.\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for me is that I don't want that drama in my home. I don't want to be involved in any issues between the father of her daughter. He seems like the type of person to retaliate, and I don't want to risk something happening at my home with my family here. I especially don't want to be involved in any situations with the law. We both have very good jobs and I don't want to risk anything with being associated with some sort of criminal investigation.\n\nWhen I rose these concerns (especially our children) she said that she thinks it would show them a real life lesson. That not everyone is a good person, but it's always good to help when people need help - regardless of their situation.\n\nMy compromise was that I would pay the first month's rent (two if really needed) for her to get an apartment somewhere. That would give her time to get her self situated and for her to get a job so that she can then support herself until she works out some sort of child support from the father.\n\nMy wife stormed away and told me that I was being selfish.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So, throwaway account because my friends follow my real one, and...I'm not out to everyone.\n\n***Tldr at the bottom***\n\nI'm pan (or bi, whatever you want to call it. point is, couldn't care less) and a 17yo female. I have tried coming out to my mom for several years, before I started dating my girlfriend. I tried, and she shut me down telling me that I couldn't know, and that she couldn't handle having another gay kid (my brother who is much older than me came out gay about 5 years ago, but since then, he has married a woman and had kids...which...is confusing...I know...). She goes off about wanting grandkids, which is hilarious since...now that she thinks I'm straight and talking about never having kids she's suddenly okay with it!\n\nSince the past 3 times I've tried coming out (once when I was 14, another time when I was 15 dating a guy, and when I was 16 and dating this girl), whenever I bring up LGBTQ issues she \"accuses me\" of being gay. I have to shut her down, because she gets livid every time, and I just can't deal with it.\n\nHowever, I love my mom. I love my mom so much. She's such a good mom, and this is the only thing in the world I wish she could be better about. She has done so much for me, and it's clear she cares about me so much. She only wants the best for me, and I know that. It's not even really like she's homophobic. She's not against gay marriage or gay people, or anything. She doesn't care when it comes to anyone else, just her kids...but not even really my brother. It's just me. She just can't handle *me* not being straight...\n\nAnd then it happened. 6 years ago, I met this girl. And like, I knew she was pretty. But when we got older, and both realized yknow...we were super gay...and at that gay for EACH OTHER (crazy right?),we started dating. We've been dating since 2 years ago, probably closer to 2 and a half now. And we have been through so much together. I know I'm young and its probably crazy to say, but I love this girl more than most things in life. She reminds me of sunflowers and roses and pretty sounds and pretty smells and she's just so wonderful. I want my driver's license so bad just so I can see her more often, and I want to move into my own apartment so she can live with me. I can't wait to see where our relationship goes so that one day, I can settle down with her.\n\nObviously though...I haven't told my mom.\n\nAnd she knows this girl. She knows this girl and her family very well since we were friends for so long before this happened. But she has no idea that I'm madly in love with her. And I feel so terrible about it everyday. I text this girl that she's one of the best things to ever happen to me while sitting across from my mom as we go eat lunch and she asks me about why I'm not looking to date any boys right now. It's terrible and I feel so bad. \n\nI can't see myself ever telling my mom either, because I'm so afraid of losing her, and losing her love and support. I also feel like she would be so hurt that I hid it from her for so long, but its not like I haven't tried telling her either. It scares me so much that now when my mom asks if I'm gay I just straight up say no, because if I say yes she'll probably get upset. \n\nIt depresses me so much, because I love my mom, but I'm not about to give up on someone so special to me either. So...I need to know if it's warranted guilt. If I'm the one who sucks here, or if its my mom, even though it would hurt to know.\n\n***tldr; my mom, who is a very good mom, just doesn't want me to be gay. despite attempts at coming out, she doesn't think I'm gay. I've been dating a girl she knows very well for 2 years now. AITA for not telling her?***",

We were arguing a bit, and I told them that I wasn' t gonna get rid of it, as I just don' t wanna get rid of animals I own and that I wasn' t gonna betray my principles just for another person.

      "description": "I should preface this by saying that this is a long-distance friendship/relationship.\n\nI have this close friend, we'll call him Terry, that I've known for 2 years. We've gone through a lot of difficult situations together and we've supported each other, primarily with relationships. We would hang out almost everyday, play video games together, watch anime, and just act like nerds around each other. Around December of 2018, he became a bit lovey-dovey, by doing things like kiss the camera and even be a little teasing towards me and my feelings a bit. I started to feel like love was beginning to take flight due to those actions and how he would act in a very flirtatious manner towards me for a while.\n\nOne day (December 28th, 2018), he decided to make a group for me, him, and two friends of his on Discord, which is a site that allows gamers to chat, have calls, and hang out with each other mostly. As we were playing a game together with said two friends of his, one of them, we'll call him Kenny, made a comment about sucking his dick after biting a jalapeno pepper. Immediately, after hearing that my mind started to jump to the idea that those two were dating, and as the group call went on, the remarks become much more obvious. Then I asked Kenny a question, \"Are you and Terry dating?\", and responded with \"Yes, and have been for a few months.\" Immediately my anxiety hit me and I started to feel like I was played with, Terry then told me that he wanted me to 'feel accepted,' which I still don't understand what he means by that. I soon learn that there is a closed polyamorous relationship between them and someone else, one that I don't know of. Ever since then, Terry has been very distant from me, almost never responding to my messages except for me texting him a 'Welcome home,' where he responds with 'Thank you,\" every time, and it's starting to get tiring when I try to message him about the stuff we would talk about, only to never have him respond.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling upset that he stopped responding ever since I found out about the relationship in the way that I did?\n\nTL;DR: A close friend of 2 years (who I have feelings for) acted all lovingly towards me, only to suddenly reveal that he's been in a closed poly relationship for a few months. Ever since I found out, he's been quiet/distant ever since then, only barely responding to me.",

Me being the excited 15-year-old that likes to learn about electronics and how things work, I was looking at them. My father was at the flea market. I was asking him how much one of his VHS camcorders was, he said $100 and $300 for a digital one. I looked up the model for the $100 camera and you could buy it on eBay for like $20-40. Ok, I didn't ask him about that. I was looking at the CD players. A Sony CD player from 1985, a vinyl-cassette combo, and tons of stuff. He asks me if I had any money and I said no (My Dad did if I really wanted something, and I was looking for something). Then he gets mad at me and says that you can't \"touch\" the items (I was checking if the buttons on a CD player were working). Then he says how I'm wasting him time because I have no money because I'm just a \"white kid\" and screams at me to leave him alone. ",

If you get within 10 feet it is like having your face in a hockey skate, so bad that I genuinely cannot focus if I'm in that area. \n\nThe issue is there is no where to hide, the entire gym smells way worse within 10 mins of him entering the room.

Before we got together, we were friends, and we had this mutual friend (24 M) whom we’d both known since childhood. The thing is, this friend was in love with me for a very long time, like 6 years or something. \nWhen me and my BF got together, this friend lost his shit. He said a lot of horrible things to the both of us, spread lies about me (that I had cheated on my previous boyfriend with my new boyfriend), that our relationship would never last, and that he’s happy to never hear from us again - among other things. He even took some things from my apartment - my roommate let him in, unaware of our fight. We cut off contact with him. \nWell, recently, my BF has reconnected with this friend. He said that it’s been two years, that everyone deserves a second chance, that he doesn’t want such a long friendship to go to waste. By the way, my boyfriend reached out first. I am VERY uncomfortable with this. We fight about this all the time, but we can’t reach a resolution because I’m aware that I don’t have the right to tell him who he can hang out with, but I can’t help feeling hurt that he’s okay with a person who’s said such awful things about me and our relationship being in his life. Am I the asshole for freaking out whenever they hang out? I would even try to forgive this friend, but he has never apologized to me or tried to contact me. \n",

My gf misjudged how many cars there were in the intersection as the light was turning yellow. She ended up in the middle of the intersection blocking some cars. She goes to check her phone, but then the car in front of her starts to move.

I had about a week to prepare a group project for my English class, and all four of us got the same grade so I was eager to help with anything any of the group members were struggling with. I had an hour and a half of study hall before the presentation, so we all sat together to finalize everything. It turned out one of the group members hadn’t even started his notes, so I offered to help him, as it was in my best interest. I ended up writing him a full on script, word for word. \n\nDuring the presentation, he somehow got confused and completely screwed up. He then proceeded to blame me for this, and spent the whole five minute walk to our next class yelling in my face. During this time, another student stepped in to defend me. The second kid wasn’t particularly polite, he pretty much just said “we all got the same assignment so maybe you’re the stupid one here,” but he wasn’t overly rude. \n\nAbout ten minutes later, the first kid (who screwed up our presentation) started going on a  rant in our project group chat that was just way over the top. He said stuff like “i feel bad for his parents that they didn’t abort him and now they have to deal with his fat ass” and the like, and it was ongoing for at least 10 minutes. He also said he was going to beat him up after school Friday (today) and went into detail about giving him a concussion “so he won’t remember.”\n\nThis morning I asked him if he was serious about assaulting this kid, and if he meant everything he said in the group chat. He was kind of noncommittal, but he said again how much he hated the second kid. Because of this, I went to talk to the head of school about it. I hadn’t initially planned to show him the screenshots, but he asked so I emailed them to him. Part of what makes this a little sticky is that another kid is worried he might get in trouble, because even though he was trying to convince the first kid not to do anything stupid, he also agreed that the second kid was annoying and had no boundaries.\n\nMy school is really small, with about 30 kids in my grade, and it’s a pretty relaxed environment. I know he’s not going to get in trouble beyond a stern talking to and maybe a call to his parents, but I still feel a little bad about reporting him. I wasn’t planning on it because I thought he was just angry and embarrassed, but when he stuck to his word over 24 hours later, I decided I should say something. Did I do the right thing, or did I overreact?",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my suicidal ex-boyfriend?",
      "description": "TL;DR I had a boyfriend that was suicidal, he had an abusive father and I tried to contact the police, his mother and siblings to get them to help him. He told me that he would expose me to my mother if I contacted his siblings and mother so I didn't. I decided to not make the decision to end our friendship because I disliked the emotional hardship I was going through because of this situation.\n\nA few months ago around June, I(16F at the time) met my former best-friend(17M). We'll call him R. It's important to note that we were both depressed and had suicidal thoughts at the time.\n\nAfter about two months of friendship, he messaged me saying that he was done with life and really just wanted to end it. I was obviously worried and spent several hours trying to talk him out of it. It's important to note that he has attempted suicide before so this wasn't just edgy teen behavior. In this time where I was trying to talk him down he said that he's been lying to me this whole time, that he just fakes the emotions he should feel including any love he claimed to have had for me. That he's lied about several things in our relationship.\n\nHe admitted that he was stringing me in a web of lies to get me to love him for these few weeks. I didn't care at the moment I just didn't want him to hurt himself. I told him to sleep on it and to not make any rash decisions until the morning. I hoped that it was all going to blow over and he'd come to his senses by morning, but he didn't.\n\nIn the morning he was still suicidal. I knew this wasn't just going to blow over so I had tried to text the Netherlands PD to try to get them to stop him. It didn't go through so I messaged his mom on Facebook and tried connecting to his siblings on Steam. I just wanted them to stop him and get him the help he needs or at least catch him soon enough to save his life. The Netherlands has universal healthcare so if he was admitted at any point I knew there wouldn't be a financial burden to his family. He has an abusive father so I tried to keep him as far out of the picture as possible and hoped that any bruises he had on his body would be noted by authorities and investigated. I would have warned the police about this if I was able to get through.\n\nI told him what I did and he said that if I didn't delete the friend requests I had sent to them and delete the message I had sent to his mom he would tell my mom everything I had told him. Which would include me being bisexual (my mom is homophobic and has stated before that I better not become a lesbian), my suicidal tendencies (not as bad as his but would likely ruin our relationship) and all of the things I had said about her. So I complied, he gave me the option to remain his friend though he wouldn't guarantee that he would be around for much longer and if he had stopped messaging to assume the worst. I had said yes then put some more thought into it and decided against it.\n\nSo Reddit AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with my friend about her understanding of sexuality while she was questioning her own?",
      "description": "Maybe I was being a dick, but I'm still angry:\n\nMy friend knows I am gay. We have talked about sexuality before, but she has always said she's straight. Recently though, she has begun saying that women are pretty and that she would like to have sex with a women one day. She often asks me for guy advice, so it wasn't unusual for her to complain to me about how her boyfriends are usually assholes and misogynists. This time she said that men in general were so misogynistic that she felt she needed to try dating a woman so that she could experience \"at least one healthy relationship\" before dating shitty men again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then says that she hates how society cares about labels so much. She says that society should abolish the labels of gay,straight, bisexual etc. entirely and just let everyone be sexually fluid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm gay, and I use that label. I like there's a label for how I am exclusively attracted to men and never attracted to women. So, I respond that I agree society should allow more general sexual experimentation, but that we don't have to get rid of labels. Someone can start questioning and take their time and just gradually figure out sexuality on their own. They don't have to label themselves right away. IMO, society's usage of labels doesn't inhibit sexual exploration because we acknowledge that people can question sexuality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn response, my friend says \"that's so upsetting\". She says that she doesn't see why someone has to call themselves only straight or only gay. She says that it is restrictive to say that someone is only attracted to one gender, and that while they might have a previous history of mono-sexuality, they should be allowed to acknowledge the possibility of one day being attracted to someone outside their usual preferred gender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was annoyed at the idea that I should \"be open\" to the idea of one day being attracted to a woman, since I have never found women attractive at all (despite hoping I would find some woman I was attracted to). I told her this and she replied \"But I don't understand how that's possible. I don't get how that works.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe justified herself with \"I'm not saying that you have to be attracted to women. It's just that one day you could be and society should be able to acknowledge that. I just don't see why society says people have to label themselves as straight or gay.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; AITA here? It feels like my friend was disregarding my experience in her crusade against \"society\". I wish she'd get that not everyone is capable of being sexually fluid. *I am a gay man, ffs*. But she says I'm not being supportive of her struggle to understand her own sexuality and get away from society's heterosexual expectations. Reddit, AITA??",

      "description": "So I look back on it now, and yeah, it was kind of an asshole thing for me to do. I kinda acted like a little kid. I did apologize afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me and my sister's 20th birthday back in July, we were gonna go out to a sunday buffet at a favorite restaurant; this buffet is something I hadn't been to in a long time. \n\nTo preface, I have a pair of Mary Jane shoes that I'm very used to wearing (I'm autistic and have some sensory issues). My mom has said they're pretty much broken, but I know they're not. Pretty much all of the parts of the shoes are still intact. They just look worn down from the 3 or so years I've had them. So it's pretty clear she doesn't like me in them, even though I'm comfortable wearing them.\n\nSo before we go to the buffet, we stop at my grandparents' house because of presents. My twin sister gets a ukulele. I open mine, and I get a new pair of Mary Jane shoes. \n\nAt this point, I'm crestfallen. I don't break out into tears yet. I kind of just sit there silently. I run to the bathroom and start crying because it felt more like a gift for my parents so that I wouldn't embarrass them in public. I have low self-esteem as it is, so that thought didn't exactly help. \n\nI'm relatively fine with them now, but I'm wondering; AITA for crying over them?",

      "description": "English is not my first language so, also phone so formating may be an issue.\n\nIt's more complicated that the title, so, for context, both of us (me (M) and her) had known each other since we were like 7, after some years I lost contact with her.\n\nSome years ago I got to high school and realized she was there too. At the beginning I didn't care much but then I started to like her, so I tried to get close to her by being friendly.\n\nAfter a month or so we were best friends, yeah that didn't go well for me but whatever she was nice. We had been doing really good, but somewhere between 2018 I realized she didn't quite care about me, just cared about me being there for her. I didn't feel so good about it, so I ran a \"test\" to see what she would do, it was to stop messaging her (because I used to start every conversation) to see if she would notice or message me. After some days I realized it was going nowhere since she didn't seem to care.\n\nFrom the beginning of our friendship I used to depend on her assistance for my days not to boring, and of course I used to be with her every break time and be with her the entire time, so my next move was not to, just not to and see if she would do something.\n\nThis is when it goes to hell, at that time I had good relations with a guy (let's say Kevin) and he happened to be my friend's ex boyfriend, the one she hated the most. From literally a day to another, Kevin was my good friend with who I could spend the break time without thinking about her.\n\nYou can now imagine which reaction it caused, she thought I had changed her for him, and she couldn't be further from what it had really happened. I never really told her why I stopped talking to her because I obviously couldn't tell her it was all an \"experiment\" (something she had some with me multiple times) so I just told her the truth, that I hadn't changed her for him, that I was just spending time with him.\n\nKevin had also warned me numerous times that she was using me for emotional support, now I choose to believe that.\n\nThen, I don't remember when exactly, we both stopped talking to each other.\n\nSo, Was ITA for doing that?",

      "description": "Hopefully I worded that title correctly.\n\nMy family is not really close and we have a lot of issues. My siblings and I kind of developed a very passive-aggresive behavior towards my parents because whenever we tried to talk back and try to explain (respectfully) they scolded us and told us we were being disrespectful.\n\nThere was a really deep misunderstanding and divide between my parents and us siblings and being wrongly accused of something happens fairly common. It got worse to the point where it was actually the cause of my clinical depression. Long story short, I never felt safe opening up to my parents so it kinda built up inside and they kept pressuring me to do better at school, which didn't help at all. There's more to it than that but that's all I'm sharing but now after attending some form of family counseling they promised that they would change but I fear that they are doing the same things to my sister. And she's been very closed off and quite lately so I'm really concerned. \n\nThe problem is I have a hard time telling my parents about this out of fear, that they'll get angry at me, or misunderstand the whole situation.

      "description": "Let me start by saying I am not a meninist, someone who subs to MTGOW or incel-like ideologies. In the least virtue-signaling way possible, I am a self described feminist and a liberal. \n\nThat being said, I hate it when my friend(s) say that they hate men, as I am a man myself. Something about it rubs me the wrong way. I know deep down they are not talking about me, but whether I like it or not being a man is part of my identity. And when they say that, even if in their mind they aren't calling me a bad person, they are attacking part of my identity. \n\nThis is something common in my friend group; a lot of the women will use phrases like \"men are the worst, men are ____, I hate men\". It's taken as a joke, and I didn't let them know it bothered me until recently. One of the worst offenders sent a message to our group chat about a guy she had a gripe with, and in her text, she explained something she did by saying \"or maybe it's just because I hate men\".\n\nThis was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I messaged her privately telling her how I felt: that while I realized she wasn't talking about me it made me feel uncomfortable having group conversations with her, especially because she knew I was present. \nShe responded by saying that if I wasn't a bad man, than she wasn't talking about me. She also said that because I find it offensive I'm probably doing something bad she doesn't know about. (Not entirely sure what the implication is there, but I didn't like it regardless). \n\nI responded by asking if she wouldnt mind it if I said \"I hate mexicans\" or \"I hate women\" (of which she is both).  She said that it's different, because there aren't a majority group of mexicans or women who deserve that hate, unlike men apparently.\n\nSide note: as I am writing this I know it sounds like rage bait, but I really just want to know if I am being too sensitive. She is a good person overall, but I feel like this is something she got wrong and I need some outside parties to set the record straight.\n\nSo, AITA? She seems to think so, as she told some of our mutual friends and they are telling me I'm taking it too seriously, and that what I said about women and mexicans would be completely unwarranted.\n\n",

My dad lives with us and this morning shouted at me from across the house to \"come get my kid\". He says nevermind and we all go about our morning routine until we get in the car (I give him a ride to and from work daily) and he goes off on my daughter about being respectful and how \"she may talk to us like that but she's not going to speak to him like that\". So I asked what was going on and he says that's when he needed the bathroom this morning but she was in there and he told her to vacate. She says she asked him \"if he could wait a couple more minutes please?\" because she was almost done doing her morning thing, and he got angry right away. Saying she had an attitude. Also because he says \"she's a child and if I tell her to do something she should do it!\" To which I responded \"Just because she's a child doesn't mean she deserves ZERO respect for herself\". So he says with a nasty attitude, \"You're not going to do anything at all about this are you?\" and I shook my head no. She says she did not have an attitude and was just requesting a couple extra minutes because she was almost done, she only had to brush her teeth. Now my dad has this shitty attitude with me because he says she was snippy with him but he walked in and literally demanded she vacate the bathroom for him. AITA reddit?

      "description": " \n\nI'll preface this with some background. Surrogacy is legal where I live, and has been since 2012. My wife and I will be married for 5 years as of this November, and have been together for 8 years. We have 2 boys, a 5 and a 6 year old. She stays at home whilst I go out and work a 9 to 5 to support the family, and for the most part we're content, with the genral challenges which come with a relationship.\n\nNow we were talking about having another child. She had her implanon (contraceptive implant) removed so we can start trying. I'm pretty excited, I'm in a really stable job with good career prospects, and I'm in love with my wife. We have a family which comes with it's own challenges of course.  \nThis morning, she comes in to the kitchen all nervous; I ask what's up? She takes a deep breath and says she wants to be a surrogate for someone she met 2 weeks ago. This wasn't exactly the statement I was expecting on a Sunday morning in the kitchen. Initially, I'm not feeling any negativity, and my wife rattles off a list of requirements which includes me needing to be on board with it. This is about when I became triggered as the concept settles in, and I started shutting off in a confused state of anxiety. The issues are as follows;\n\n* She's known this woman (a fellow home school mother in our community) for about 2 weeks.\n* This would put having our own child on hold.\n* I'm worried there will be attachment issues after the pregnancy.\n* If I'm not on board, I'll likely push my wife away.\n* There may be financial implications; we aren't in a position to support someone elses pregnancy.\n\nI understand; this is her body, and ultimately I cannot stop her from doing what she wants to do. If she really wants to do this, she will take our children away and do it on her own.\n\nI'm currently trying to go through scenarios where I would feel comfortable with the idea, and I think this ultimately comes down to the fact that it feels like she's prioritizing someone elses child over ours (This makes me feel a bit rejected) for someone she's known for a very short time. I've worked so hard to support her in what she wants to do in every way (Stay at home, home school the kids), however I don't think this is something I can get behind, at least not until we've had our 3rd child which we literally just started planning for.\n\nTLDR; wife wants to have someone elses baby, instead of our own, for someone she's known for 2 weeks. I'm not comfortable with the idea, and have the power to stop it as my agreement is required by law.",

Before the affair even happened they got a matching tattoo of some inside joke.  It is not very big, six or seven characters and only about two inches long.  However it is on a very visible part of his bicep and it is visible almost constantly. \n\nI hate that fucking tattoo.   Seeing it makes me want to throw up.  If I decide to try and make this relationship work, I want him to get rid of it.  He can laser it off or get it covered up, I don't care, but I never want to have to look st it ever again. \n\nI can't help but feel like I'm crazy for asking this of him.  \n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "(Apologies if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile.) *Not sure if this needs a trigger warning but it involves mentions of alcohol and non-physical abuse.\n\nI'd like to start by saying my father (age 60?) is a high-functioning alcoholic, and emotionally/verbally abusive. He wasn't always like that but he has been for roughly 6-8 years now.  My mother is fully aware of his condition and does not purchase alcohol for him. So he finds other ways, either by asking my older sister or brother to bring him some when they come visit, or paying friends to get alcohol for him. My older siblings (mid-30's) live away from home. I know my siblings are enablers in this but they don't seem to realize he has a problem; though they themselves have alcoholic tendencies, they're not as bad as my father. My mother doesn't drink much and I do very rarely but only when I'm with people I trust.\n\nI'm a college student (25F) also living away from home but I do visit on the weekends or during breaks, so currently I'm home for the remainder of spring break. As my siblings are not here and his friends are busy, my father asked me to go to the liquor store and buy him wine. This is strange as he's never asked me to do this, but he won't go himself because he \"doesn't want to be seen there.\"\n\nI was working on an assignment in my bedroom when he came to ask me. I tell him I won't do it, even though saying \"no\" to him still makes me very nervous because I never know how he'll react. He got very quiet and just said \"okay\" and left me alone. I think the worst is over until I hear him talking on the phone with my older sister about it, and I can clearly hear how angry she is that I'm so \"selfish and disrespectful\" but dad responds like \"yeah well whatever she hates us I knew she probably wouldn't do it.\"\n\nThough I've been going to therapy for a few years and I'm getting treatment for my depression and anxiety, my father can still make me feel like shit, either while talking to me or telling other family members how I \"hate\" him and how I don't care about anyone. Stuff like that.\n\nI feel like the asshole. But did I do the right thing, even though he's my father? Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "So my wife has worked at as a childcare worker for about 10 years. She currently works about 30 hours a week for a company that offers her no benefits and low compensation. She unfortunately has fibromyalgia, which makes many things, including working, more difficult for her. She has struggled in the past to find jobs due to anxiety, including seeing a counselor about it.\n\nI work for a medical laboratory that offers good benefits and above average pay. It’s a good job for a good company and I bring home more than my wife even after paying for all our insurance. This job also gives me decent raises each year and I stand to make about 25-30% more within the next 7-8 years. \n\nDespite all this, while we are not poor, we do struggle a bit financially. My wife and I had discussed in the past me going back to school, however through much consideration I decided it makes much more financial sense for me to stay in my current position, given I will not accrue any student loan debts and I also stand to make nearly as much as I would with a degree in my current position as I would with a degree. \n\nSo today, she brought up me going to school again. I told her that it didn’t make sense and she should consider looking for a new job. She was immediately defensive saying she has too much anxiety to work any other job and her fibromyalgia prevents her from doing anything else. I told her that she could find a job that is less stressful and less physically demanding than childcare that would also pay her more and give her benefits. She refused to listen insisting she’s incapable of doing anything else because her body is used to childcare so it’s easy, but even a job with desk work would be harder for her. She maintains I should be the one to make changes because she is incapable and I don’t understand her condition. She has not worked in any other job beyond her current and some food worker jobs in her teenage years.\n\nSo am I the asshole for asking her to consider looking for a new job?",

      "description": "I was at a bar with my girlfriend (8 years), college friend (4 years), and a group of GF’s work friends (~2 years) tonight. One of the work friends was on a date with someone who was using a walker. The person using the walker was in their mid to late 20’s. One of the other work friends warned us that the guy was disabled by physically emulating what walking with a walker would look like, and saying “one of our friends was set up on a blind date with a disabled guy.” This rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI ended up talking to the guy with a walker for a while. He was very polite and fun to talk to.\n\nLater that night, he left. The same friend that described him earlier said something along the lines of “Finally, he (*making walker motion*) is leaving.”\n\nThis really upset me. I said something like “oh yeah, fuck him, the disabled guy is finally leaving (/s).” Everyone looked kind of shocked, and asked what I had said. I repeated myself. I probably said it pretty aggressively, as I was angry. Everyone fell silent, and I excused myself to go to the bar. I offered to buy everyone in the circle a drink individually. I went to the bar and took my time to cool off.\n\nThe night was a bit awkward afterwards, but I made a point to include everyone in the conversation, including the person that I likely upset by calling her out.\n\nMy girlfriend and I left the bar with a close college friend in an Uber, on our way to another bar. I explained that I was sorry about the way I handled the situation (after GF brought it to my attention), but I’m not sorry for the position that I held. She agreed with my position for the most part, but was upset about possibly embarrassing her work friend, which she will have to see after the weekend is over. She was also upset with the way that I handled the situation.\n\nWe continued to argue for the rest of the 10-15 minute ride. GF was upset because it may make an awkward time for her at work. I argued that it was fine with me if he work friend felt awkward, because I think it’s wrong to make fun of people who are disabled. Our college friend ended up getting annoyed with the bickering and left to go home once we got to the next bar. I texted an apology to college friend. She is very close and dear to GF and I, and I acknowledge that I’m already an asshole for the position that I put her in.\n\nI firmly stand by my initial position. Although I may make work a bit awkward for my girlfriend, I fundamentally would feel wrong to stand by silently. My girlfriend firmly stands by her belief that I was an asshole, not because of the position that I held, but because of the way that I handled the situation. She thinks that it may have been a better idea to bite my tongue and stay silent, or have collected my thoughts and stated them in a more appropriate manner.\n\nI acknowledge that I should’ve handled the situation with more grace.\n\nAITA?",

We immediately hit it off. we were both into the same movies, and music. We both had a guilty pleasure of watching japanese anime(Cartoons from Japan) and Korean Dramas. We both even likes the same type of video games. Ashley was pretty much perfect, and I started to like her alot, really fast.\n\nWe went on a few dates(3) and other than that just chilled at her place, or mine. We made out a few times, but Ashley didnt want to take it any further than that. She wanted to take it slow, which I was cool with. One night while watching the Castlevania show on Netflix, things got a.bit more heated than usual. Before anything happens though, Ashley stopped it. She said there was something important she wanted to tell me before we continued. \n\nI said, what were you born a man? Jokingly. Except all of a sudden she got deadly serious. She said when she was born, they assigned her the male gender, but since age 11 she had taken (hormones?) And had surgeries, and now she is the correct gender. \n\nI didnt really know what all of that meant, so I just said, you were born a boy? You had a dick? I could tell that made her uncomfortable,  but I was uncomfortable too. She said let me explain, but at that point I didnt really want an explanation,  just a yes or a no. Ashley said yes. \n\nI flipped, I said that she tricked me, and she was a lie and a lier, and to get out before I do or say something that I cant take back. She said that she thought that I liked her, I said that I liked Ashley, not whatever you are. She started to cry, then I told her that she had 5 seconds to be gone. She left.\n\nWe havent talked since then, but honestly I feel like an asshole. Even if I didn't flip out, I couldn't date Ashley after finding that out.",

      "description": "I have pretty bad insomnia and I can't sleep for more and a couple hours at a time. I'm up most nights and need a nap during the day so i can function. While i nap, my husband is in charge of our 2yo. \nI woke up after about an hour of sleep to a bark and then crying. My husband then calls for my help. Our newish husky was eating my 2yo's snack and when he tried to stop her, she nipped him. Nothing was broken and he didn't need stitches, but now he has 3 punctures and can't use his hand until it heals up. \nWhere was my husband when this happened? \nIn the other room, on his computer. \nI'm really trying not to be angry but I have told him so many times that he can't leave our baby alone to just watch TV while he's on his computer. He does have school work he needs to do, but he is most often on video games. He was working on school work at that exact moment but when I asked him why he couldn't have waited to do that until our baby went to nap soon, or even later that night, he didn't have a good reason. Then He got pissed off at me that I was asleep during it so I have no say on his actions. I asked that he stays off his computer while the baby is awake. It's in another room and he just can't be present enough. I'd even be fine if he was on a laptop, as long as he can be in the room. He was extra pissed off and felt like I was banning him from his computer like a Mom would to their kid.\nAITA here? I didn't just piss off to go sleep and leave my child in front of the tv with the dog. I asked my husband and he agreed to take responsibility for watching so I could get some sleep. I know he was doing school work, but i really don't think it was appropriate to try and do school work at that moment. Mostly, he is constantly on his computer, playing games or watching videos, ignoring our children when I'm there and when I'm not there. He could have just as easily have been playing video games when our kid got bit, but he is pissed that I'm mad at him and insists he's not at fault and no behavior needs to be changed. Any advice would be awesome.",

      "description": "My friend an I are old slot machines enthusiasts. He is the one who originally introduced me to the hobby, and I have loved it ever since. We talk about different machines, which ones are the best, which ones are overrated, etc. You can say we are both obsessed. \n\nWe both have a couple that we have purchased over the years in our basements, that we have both moved together (I have paid fair market value while he has found incredible deals). He scours Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, etc. for deals. There have been many a day where there is a great deal that needs to be hopped on immediately. They are heavy, so we tag team it - he finds the deals and I'm the muscle. \n\nAfter helping out with a half dozen or so of these \"drop everything\" deals, without ever expecting compensation, I finally mention that one of these times, I would just like to be able to get one of these deals. Though I do check Craigslist, I'm not on Facebook, so the marketplace is out of my reach. On a recent venture when we were going to pick up a GREAT deal (at a moment's notice, as is often the case - which hey, I'm always willing to drop everything for the greater good), after we make the pickup for 1/10th of the value of this particular item, he says \"next one is yours\". I am excited about the prospect of getting such a deal so have a brief conversation about it, sounds fair to me.\n\nFlash forward about three months later, he finds another incredible deal - another \"drop everything\" moment. This is it - my incredible deal. On the way there, I mention how excited I am and he is like \"uhhh, about that... this is TOO good of a deal\". We go back and forth a bit, and I concede that this particular game was not on my \"short list\", but it is a fun game that I would have kept and played and given the situation, either one of us could easily parlay the game into one that we really wanted. He insists that it is one that he really wants and would keep himself. I concede and tell him that he can have it as long as he keeps it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward about six months later, he is now sending me texts about how he wants to trade it for a machine that we both have talked about wanting before. If it's not obvious, I'm not much of a businessman, and I generally try to take an attitude of \"freely give and freely receive\", but I feel a bit taken advantage of here and I'm having a hard time getting over it. AITA?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He's already picked some random number, and wants anyone who's interested to reply directly to him with their number guess. Whoever guesses closest, gets the tickets. Well, a bunch of folks starts replying-all with random numbers. My inbox is blowing up. So I reply-all with a highlighted copy/paste of the line in his email that read \"reply to me directly\". Within a minute I get some direct responses of people LOL'ing, I get a few Slack chats from people thanking me for calling those goobers out, etc. It's all in good fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, one of the girls who mistakenly replied-all, sends me a direct email. All her message contains is a big image of someone riding a JumpBike(electric bikes you can rent locally). Why? Because a couple months ago I was in a bike accident on one, and literally almost died. I got *lucky* and *only* broke my jaw in 3 places and ruined my teeth and had to drain my PTO on medical leave for almost 2 months. She apparently thought it was a funny comeback to remind me of that, in response to me reminding her to read instructions better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI almost did nothing, but a bunch of fellow employees encouraged me to FWD her message to HR. I did, and they are pissed and going to be handling this... somehow. I dunno yet. But I feel like a \"rat\" for not just shrugging it off. \n\nAm I the asshole for calling her out on that shit?",

It’s a woman who I’ve never met before and she tells me got my number  from another woman I’ve babysat for before.

Friday night arrives and I pull up to her house. I go in to talk to her and her son before she leaves when I see her son. Her son is no younger than 16 and is obviously retarded. My guess would be severe Down’s syndrome. Whatever his affliction was, I was very obviously outclassed. I was used to looking after grade school kids and not 180-pound guys that don’t know their own strength and have problems feeding themselves. \n\n\nI didn’t even wait around to talk to the mom, I just bailed.

      "description": "So about a year ago I popped the big question. I was deeply in love with my girlfriend and everything felt amazing. That is until she transformed into a bridezilla in front of my eyes. \n\nEver since we got engaged all she can do is talk about the wedding, which was fine at first but it started to consume her. I thought that I would get some say in how the day was going to go but everything I suggest is immediately shot down. The only choice I got to make was my tux and even that had to fit her God damn color scheme. \n\nWell things really started ramping up when her mother came down for the weekend. She's your typical trailer trash woman who married into a successful family. All her ideas are awful and tacky yet my fiancee laps it up like a dehydrated person in a desert. When I try to bring it up with her she tells me that this is \"her\" big day and I should just be supportive. I told her it was my money and that I should have more say in how it's spent. Her mom picked out maroon table clothes with flowers and suns on them, I feel like it's a funeral for a carnival worker. She even suggested we have beer kegs on tap.\n\nSo the last straw was that her and her mother, without my consent, used my credit card as a payment on a venue down by a river instead of the church we discussed where my family has attended for generations and made many contributions, the pricing was even a little cheaper minus the price of the hall afterwards. Who wants to get married next to a stinking river full of flies and whatever other insects will float around, on top of all the people who will just waltz up to the river to enjoy the day while were trying to get married. \n\nI finally had enough so after she told me what she did I cancelled the payment on my credit card (after spending hours dealing with my credit card company) and told her she could either set up a date at the church or find someone else to marry because I've had enough of this. She's spent the last couple hours bawling her eyes out to her mom and making me seem like the monster after she went behind my back. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? \n\nTL;DR:  my fiancee became a bridezilla and won't let me make any decisions and her and her mother have teamed up against me. She chose a venue without my consent so I cancelled the payment and told her that she either goes with my choice of where we get married or we aren't getting married at all.\n",

      "description": "So me and my ex dated for almost 2 years and recently we have had some discussions, more regularly that before, and we would break up but come back. During our relationship when we got mad at each other she would breakup with me and start dating another guy, and then that would make me jealous and when we got back she would say it was just to make me jealous. Now at the end of our relationship, when we were still dating, she would take longer to answer my messages than usual, wouldn't want to be with me that much and would always be with my friends (who I introduced to her as she was too shy to introduce herself). About a week and a half ago, last last Friday (before the last one) she broke up with me saying that she didn't love me anymore. I was sad but still hoped we could get back together for the first days, until I decided I was always the one trying to get things to work while she didn't care, so I didn't talk to her for 2 days and on each day she sent me a message, the first one saying \"wow, you survived a whole day without me, congrats\" and the next one was a middle finger emoji. One week after our breakup she started dating a friend of mine, one of the two I introduced her, and he was telling me how sorry he was and that he was sad for me. That just made me become even more sad than I already was and told the both of them I wouldn't talk to either for some time until I was feeling better, with my friend answering with a \"I respect and understand your choice\" and a \"cool\" from my ex. Sometime later my other friend who I introduced to her (actually reintroduced as I met her when I was with him, they also had dated for a day but that was pretty meaningless) told me she had called him two days after my breakup with her and said she had to do a truth or dare and stripped naked with her cam on covering only her private parts, and asked him to tell her what to do, what poses and other stuff. He was pretty confused but went on with it and eventually told her to show her ass and she asked \"with or without the panties\" which my friend answered with \"with\" because he said that would be too much (don't forget that 5 days later she started to date my other friend). During our relationship we had sent nudes to one another and our relationship was already a very long one, so I was weirded out about how easily she forgot me and started dating my friend, with whom she already probably already sent nudes too, I say probably because she sent a message to my friend that she and my other friend did some naughty stuff in a call.\n\nSo, am I wrong for thinking that this is too much? I mean, we dated for 2 YEARS and she just forgot me in a week and is already sending nudes to another guy, who is my own friend! And she even called my other friend and did what I just mentioned before. Also, some guy (one of the guys who she dated to make me jealous) came to me and told me she was asking for him to take photos of him with just his shorts, which I didnt believe because I didn't thought she would do such thing (now I do), and he also told me to be careful about her. Am I an asshole for thinking that this was too much? Or do I have nothing to do with what she does when she isn't dating me, even if then we got back to dating? Am I an asshole for thinking she is a slut?",

Most of my money goes to everything food, rent, bills, my own bills. It’s a stressful day everyday due to it. I have to work 40hrs a week and I don’t ever get time to myself to just sit down and relax and play a game or watch  a movie or a tv show. If she doesn’t like it she complains and I turn it off to avoid the fight.\n\nI don’t have friends out here due to the fact I can’t ever go anywhere because she won’t fend for herself and refuses to do anything without me.\n\nShe won’t follow up on job applications she applies and just leaves it at that she doesn’t want to call them or go into the location to mention she applied. Even something as part time as she’s in school and I’m okay with that I just want some help. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting her to do things to make our live better?

      "description": "I work as a cashier at a grocery store, and I'm one of very few guys in the store. Literally my only job is supposed to be ringing up peoples groceries, bagging them and placing them back in their cart. However, myself along with whatever other guy happens to be on get stuck with additional responsibilities, basically anything that requires physical labor. Putting the large water jugs into their shelves, bringing the carts into the store, lugging shit from the back of the store out to an aisle, taking customers carts out to their car if they're heavy even if a female employee is supposed to be the one doing it, getting asked to go down to the bakery department and lift shit, etc.\n\nI'm sick of it, I complained before but nothing changed. Myself and the other guys don't get paid additionally for this. The other day I overheard some coworkers talking about the wage gap and I blew up a bit and basically said it was bullshit that they can sit there talking about not being paid equally when they still make as much as we do in this store despite objectively doing less work. I said it's hypocritical to complain about inequality when they put some of their responsibilities onto us just because we're the guys. They said it's \"different\" because they physically can't handle some of those tasks and we can, to which I replied that's fine, but if they physically can't handle tasks that are a part of their job they either shouldn't have the job or we should be paid more because we're doing that work for them. My manager took me aside and apologized if I felt \"taken advantage of\" and things have improved a bit but some of the younger women feel offended.\n\nThis isn't some anti-woman, boys rule girls drool thing either. I'm specifically talking about my store. In my opinion, it's not right to expect us to go above and beyond to pick up the slack for employees who cannot perform without giving us compensation for that. It feels sexist to me to expect me to do additional work for no additional reward simply because I'm a guy. AITA for complaining about this?",

I have an eighty pound golden retriever mutt so it would be impossible to get him on a train.\n\nSo the thought occurred to pretend that my dog is a service dog by just purchasing one of the vests for it.

      "description": "This post is the result of me trying to be as open-minded as humanly possible (and thus far failing). So I'm really just hoping the judgements here will either help me along on that path, or confirm that my initial feelings are correct. \n\nAnyway: I (f/20) have been dating this guy (m/24) for a little under a month. Obviously I find him very appealing on a lot of levels. One thing to note is that he really enjoys dirty talk during sex (which I don't really mind provided it's not too degrading). Recently, though, he crossed what is to me a major line - he used a racial slur in a very derogatory way. \n\nI was naturally quite upset, and asked him to explain himself. He said that he'd been in the habit of engaging in race-play with past partners, and so he slipped into it here in the heat of the moment (a defense I've never found compelling, for starters). Now, I'm familiar with race-play as a concept and I'm not eager to shame people who like it. But IMO slipping into it because he's done it with other partners is sort of like calling me some other girl's name during sex... only this time, he's grouping me and said girl together in his mind because we're the same race. That to me is entering fetish territory, which I consider to be semi-racist at best (entirely apart from the fact that he has that slur on speed-dial). \n\nWe've talked this over extensively. He's repeatedly apologized for calling me that without asking first, but he's very offended by the notion that said slip-up might be evidence of some underlying issues that need sorting out. In essence: both of us think the other is an asshole at the moment. If we can't resolve things I honestly can't see the relationship going much further. Measured judgement would be pretty useful here.",

I won't go down into details, that's stuff for another post and another subreddit.\n\nI have by know totally recognized how bad of a person my father is, he is the lowest reputable individual amongst everyone I know, and I cannot think any worse of him, and my mothers knows it but she still calls me almost everyday detailing something bad he does, and I'm tired of hearing it.\n\nI now live abroad in a beautiful country, studying what I love and I'm slowly getting better, having been severely depressed in the past (and you can't imagine how worse when things with my father started happening this year). I can finally feel changing and becoming the person I want to be, sometimes even happy, which is something I didn't even reckon as achievable until not long ago.\n\nMy point is that I'm not my mother's friend, I am extremely saddened by the situation and I still kind of depend on them economically for staying here, even if I have a job to try and be the most independent possible (this having been discouraged by both of them), but I don't need to know these things, they are useful to nothing for me. I recognize that they are important for my mother but I suffer as well by knowing them and I don't think I deserve to be ruined every single day - even today that I'm spending the new year's eve with a friend - by rants and sad things that she can tell to a friend or an external person that won't suffer as much as me by hearing them.\n\n",

      "description": "My mother is convinced that a shot she got years ago made her gluten and dairy intolerant. She is also a vegetarian. She used to eat totally normally, but now we can barely go out to eat anywhere and she would be afraid to eat something that even came in contact with one of those items. \n\nI will add that she had a test done and no, she does not have an actual allergy.\n\nWell we were in the car together after we went out to dinner and she didn’t look too happy, I asked her what was wrong and she said “my stomach hurts, I think my salad dressing had gluten in it” (She barely uses any salad dressing btw, very light, and it was an oil dressing off the gluten free menu). I replied that no it likely did not and besides that little shouldn’t hurt her as she doesn’t have celiac disease or anything. She got mad and said “well, you don’t live in my body.” \n\nThis is when I think I got a bit assholeish, because I made a snide dumb joke about try telling that to a doctor. I shouldn’t make her feel bad about the way she eats and I usually support her, but it’s made family dinners hard for a while and I’m sad to see her limit herself for no reason. She acts like she’ll go into shock if she eats a breadcrumb or gets a drop of milk on her tongue.\n\nI’m sure it’s worse for her, but I’m tired of trying to accommodate something that’s been proven to not actually be a concern.

      "description": "Alright I know everyone is going to be like “you can’t do that! Blah blah blah it’s illegal to ask if it’s a real service dog or not and blah blah blah you don’t know if they have a disability or not how awful of you blah blah blah”  I know the rules but I also know real service dogs when I see them and I strongly believe this one isn’t. \n\n   A short back story, I live in an apartment complex on a military base. I recently got a puppy and since I don’t have a yard I take him out of the building to do his business. There’s other dogs in the building and most of them do the same thing so all the pet owners talk to each other while our dogs go potty. \n One lady I talked to was new and had a large dog she would take outside and I would talk to her to make her feel welcome. Our apartment complex only allows pets on the first or second floor. She asked which floor I lived on and I said the second and she said she lived on the fourth.   \n\n\n I told her dogs weren’t allowed on the fourth floor   (I have no idea why she wouldn’t know this since you have to sign a contract about it and know all the rules since the base is really strict about stuff like this. She also got him after they moved in to the building) She said she didn’t know that and thanked me. I didn’t think too much about it,I could care less honestly so I let it be. A few weeks later the same lady and her dog are walking around and I noticed he has a vest on. A service dog vest. I was like “maybe she got him trained because he was a handful before” I walked by her to get into the building with my puppy and the dog lunged, growled, and  barked at me and my puppy. It scared me because service dogs aren’t supposed to be like that. The same incident happened on the stair way when I was trying to go down and she was trying to go up. Her dog went bonkers and dragged her to my dog and tried to jump on me when I picked up my puppy. \n\n\n\n  Idk if he’s aggressive or just really playful but he’s a little concerning to the other dog owners or people with kids because he’s so unpredictable. I don’t want to be “that guy” or anything but that’s not cool that she’s most likely lying about it being a service dog and putting everyone else at risk. My puppy is now scared of other dogs because of these incidents. I’m fine with just minding my own business about it but at the same time she’s making other real service dogs look bad as well. I understand she probably did it to keep her dog but there’s other ways, the base is understanding and would most likely move her to a house or she could live off base if she wanted to. \n  \n    WIBTA if I told someone about this? \n  ",

      "description": "My partner is from Brazil and speaks completely fluent English. We’ve been together for over 2 years now and are planning to get married next year.\n\nBefore I met my partner I had completely zero knowledge of Portuguese. While we’ve been together, we’ve already visited Brazil a couple of times to meet her family and friends.\n\nGiven my very limited Portuguese, I basically spend a large portion of the trip in silence - which is clearly not ideal!  My partner is very keen for me to learn the language and I have already been putting in the hours in classes, using Duolingo and reading text books.\n\nI’m finding it really difficult improving my language skills - I’m usually pretty brain dead after work and find it hard to focus on anything. It also doesn’t help that private lessons cost a bomb and place a strain on finances.\n\nThe path to fluency seems so far away, that I’m not sure it is feasible or justifiable grafting away and continuing to spend money on these classes.\n\nI love my partner and want her to be happy, but taking these classes is easily the worse thing about my week. I’ve always hated learning languages and the cost doesn’t help motivation either.\n\nI’m wondering whether or not to continue and can’t really decide on what is the best thing to do...",

I'm also very sensitive to touch, which they know, and I'm in the closet (as bi and transgender) at school, which they know. However, for the period of time we were dating, they ignored ALL of this, pushing my boundaries as much as they could, coming very close to outing me to a ton of people, and just generally never letting me have time to myself— if I wanted to be left alone, suddenly it was all \"do you hate me? I'm so worried about you :( are you mad at me?\" and all this guilt-trippy stuff. I told them I needed space (before the breakup) &amp; they disregarded that. When I broke up with them, I, again, told them I needed space. But whenever I see them, they run over to me, beg for hugs, kiss my forehead, and hold my hand as if we're still dating. This makes me extremely uncomfortable, so I'm avoiding them. I feel bad for not telling them why, but I'm too scared to do so. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "My husband is sweet, but clueless when it comes to gifts so he often defaults to flowers or jewelry. I don't wear much jewelry in general, but he usually give me reasonably priced gifts and I make the effort to wear them.\n\nToday is a significant wedding anniversary for us and he gave me an expensive sapphire necklace. In addition to it costing way too much, I am sorry to say I really don't like it. It has a chain I cannot manage and the style is very young. Plus I already have one (given to me by a family member) that is similar. \n\nI don't even know if it can be returned or exchanged. Should I tell him? He's very pleased with himself and I dread hurting his feelings. I just keep thinking though that the money could be better used. ",

      "description": "I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for almost six months.  He's really caring and sweet and prior to tonight I envisioned us getting married in the near future.  I really love dogs, I've had dogs my whole life and have a corgi and she is my favorite thing in the world.  Bf doesn't really like animals but he's always been good with her whenever he's at my apartment and I was never uncomfortable.  \n\nThis is relevant because of a conversation we had tonight that will probably end with me breaking up with him.  We had dinner at a Chinese restaurant tonight.  Bf ordered duck, and enjoyed it a lot.  He commented on how it's cool that in other countries like China, they eat certain meat such as duck that isn't very common in the US.  I mentioned how they still eat dogs, and I told him about how horrific events such as the yulin dog festival are, since I remember reading about this recently on reddit.  I almost cried when I first read details about this, and still almost choked up thinking about it.  I asked him \"you would never eat dog, right?\"\n\nI expected him to say no, but he admitted that he had tried dog meat before.  He went on a study abroad to China when he was in college, and tried dog when he was there.  I was shocked and appalled.  I tried being understanding, I assumed that he had eaten some mystery meat dish of some sort and not found out what he had eaten until after.  I was horrified by what he said after.  He went to a restaurant with several Chinese students and tried an assortment of different foods.  One of the dishes was dog, and he knowingly tried it since he was \"curious\", and he said it tasted good.  He even said that he was the only American at the table who tried it, and that the rest of his friends were disgusted while the Chinese students laughed.  After he told me this, there was an awkward silence for a while after.  He could tell I was uncomfortable, and said that he probably wouldn't eat it again and that the yulin dog festival is cruel, but that it's not that big of a deal and it's a cultural difference.  At that point I was still in shock and barely responded.  We were both done with our food, or at least he was: I had no appetite left.  We went up to the front of the restaurant and paid the check.  We were going to see a movie but I asked him to just take me home.  I told him that I'd see him later but got out of the car before he could kiss me.  I've spent the last few hours sitting on my couch clinging onto my dog and crying.  I couldn't believe that I had let someone who had eaten dog near my dog, and I was repulsed at the idea of seeing him anymore.  I haven't said anything to my bf ever since I got out of the car but I really want to break up with him.  I'm really sad because I thought he was the best guy I've ever dated and I really felt a strong connection to him before tonight, but I can't look at him the same.  I also would never feel comfortable letting him anywhere near my sweet little girl.\n\nAITA for planning on breaking up with my boyfriend over him knowingly eating dog meat?",

      "description": " So last year My Brother invited himself to live at my place for the summer. (Admittedly the place used to belong to him but he left it a semester ago and now I own the lease.) and when I said Invited himself I mean I at first told him No because I'm a broke college student and can't afford to have him live there the entire summer. Plus Our parents offer to give him a place to stay free of charge for as long as he needs. Not to mention having a guest stay longer than 2 days technically goes against the lease agreement and could cost me my lease. but He refuses our parents offer and demanded on staying the entire summer. During that time he didn't work at all and he didn't help pay rent either and by the end of the summer, I was so broke I had to sell plasma just to put food on the table. When fall came around my Brother took a semester at the nearby university. he said that He'll use his financial aid money to help pay rent.  So he got his aid money around August about 5k or so. so when rent was due I ask for about 2k for the semester (which should help cover things from August until December).he said he couldn't right now but he'll get me next time. October rolls around the same story.  then November comes then after much nagging he gave me about $400 and said he would pay the full amount when he is good and ready. I told him no and to just pay the amount in full now. then he said that he didn't want to live with me anymore because of the way I treated him. Which is amazing since I've literally been cooking for him for weeks as well as giving full access to my room when he brought his girlfriend over, plus paid $500 to help put her in a hotel while she visits. but I digress. A huge fight ensues and threats were made and longs story short I kick him out and threatened to call the police. And for those who think he refused to pay anything because he was broke or something, I must inform you he later when on a 1-week vacation to Chicago to see his girlfriend after the fight. Anyway, my brother told everyone including my roommates about the fight we had and how I threaten to call the cops on him. now everyone thinks I should apologize to him and let him live with me free of charge. Am I the asshole here? is there something I'm overlooking?",

I was mad at my ex because he didn't ask me how I was after that day but instead he was planning to have sex with me again.

      "description": "At my husbands grandmothers wake, my SIL and her boyfriend brought 6 children age 8 to 3 (4 hers, 2 his).  I ignored the children’s terrible behavior as long as they were contained to a corner and not terribly loud.  One child did try to climb in the casket, but my SIL did intervene on that occasion.  But, they generally were wild, climbing on and around chairs, knocking picture frames over, etc.  Towards the end of the wake, the children started to as a pack run in circles in the middle of the parlor while being very loud.  I snapped my fingers to get their attention, as they were very loud, then firmly and directly told them no running.  This prompted my SIL to somewhat restrain their behaviour, but also inform me that the children were told they were allowed to run in circles.  When a few minutes later the children returned to running in circles, I again firmly got their attention and told them no running.  After this my SIL and her boyfriend collected up the children and left.  Later she texted me angry and said that under no circumstances am I to speak to her children, and I should know better than to treat a child like that, and she would not stand by while I “snapped and yelled” at her children.  And that at the funeral the next day if her children were causing me distress, that I should remove myself from them.  Now keep in mind that my husbands grandmother was 91 when she passed, so many of the attendees at the viewing were quite old and frail and could easily be injured by a running child, not to mention the disrespect of allowing a child to cause a disruption at a viewing.

      "description": "So I am normally not annoyed by anyone and am typically very accepting of new friends and new people. But at the beginning of this school year this girl just showed up and asked to sit at the table am sitting at. I said sure, as I really didn’t mind at the time. Now I sincerely regret it.  She immediately started treating me as if we were best friends and she was over sharing her entire life story with me. It made me uncomfortable. She touches me a lot when I’m obviously uncomfortable, and I’ve even directly told her to stop touching me but she just won’t. I’ve tried to just tune her out and tolerate her- but if she thinks I’m paying to much attention to my phone she literally steals it from me and won’t give it back till I pay sufficient attention to her. She will also shove me randomly as a “joke”. I’ve told her so many times to stop stealing my stuff and shoving me. I’ve even gotten so mad I’ve yelled at her but nothing gets through her head. Anytime I tell her to stop she just goes “okay, you don’t have to act like my mom you idiot” and laughs. It’s not funny. Everyone in my friend group does not like her and we are all uncomfortable. \n\nSo I really just want to be direct and tell her to honestly just fuck off. Like I want to explain that we are not friends, and she needs to stop talking and sitting with me. Would that be to harsh? I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I’m so uncomfortable and irritated around her. \n\nTL:DR: I let a girl sit with me at lunch, now she thinks we are best friends and she oversteps her boundaries and steals my phone. I want to tell her to leave me alone and stop sitting with me but I don’t want to be an asshole.",

      "description": "So I’m gonna do a background, before , what happened, and an after.\n\nBackground:  I work in a retirement home and I serve food and bus tables mostly. \n\nBefore: I overhear a conversation in the area where I drop off dishes between another dishwasher and my coworker.  \nDW: “That new dishwasher is so lazy. I hate that guy, he doesn’t want to work.” \nCW: “I know...” he continues to agree and add more examples, but this happened as I was leaving the room.\nSo I think to myself, “wow that sucks, but I guess I have to see anything first before I believe them.” That happened at noon. \n\nFast forward for dinner time. We get another dishwasher, who is also the father of a women coworker. During the end of the shift my coworkers dad gets his head injured. And I noticed my coworker was now doing the dishes for her father. While one manager helped her father. I process this and decide to help her. \n\nWhat happened: As soon as I reach for what was coming out of the machine, I hear the door open and a deep sigh. It’s the new dishwasher. I turn around around and say, “Oh! Thanks for comi-“ I get cut off by him. “What’s wrong? Afraid of a little hard work?” And he’s leaning back on fridge behind. I stare at him cause I thought he was joking. I say, “No. isn’t this your job?”  As I stare at my coworker who is doing the dishes really fast.  He then asks, “could you at least help me bring some dishes to the other dishwashing room?”(why didn’t he just work here? Plus it seemed like he was ordered to come work here)  I responded with, “but isn’t this your job??” And then he brought up something about managers. And I said, “okay let’s go ask her she’s right outside.” (Cause she was caring for my coworkers dad)  I end up leaving the room. \n\nAfter: I leave the room and another manager is just sitting around with other coworkers cause we just finished a busy night. In my mind I argue with myself, “do I tell her what just happened or not. Would she believe me? I have no evidence..” I just walk over and wait for their convo to end. It ends and I’m about to tell her what happened when the new dishwasher comes in fast and says, “hey I am here, but could I grab this guy (points to me) to help me with the dishes real quick?” She just agrees and he runs back into the dishwashing room. I then just tell my manager if I could not help him and just prepare right now for tomorrow morning. I didn’t mention anything that happened and she understood. So I did that and I went home. I don’t even know what happened after I left. \n I should’ve just mentioned to the new guy that my coworkers father got hurt and that’s why she was doing them. Maybe he would have understood so she could be with her father. ",

      "description": "I’m doing this on my iPad, so in the case that the formatting is shit, I’m sorry.\n\nOkay so I’m a 16 year old Chinese kid living in Thailand. But since I’m 4th generation Thai, I don’t speak a lick of my ancient roots. Even then, I can’t really speak Thai because I also grew up in the US, so it’s a bit hard for me to communicate to anyone who doesn’t speak English in this country.\n\nSo I’m at my grandma’s house because my mom decided to drop me off there. We talk about the random things and I get something to eat. \nFast forward an hour or two, my grandma starts asking about me going to university. I tell her I want to study overseas (primarily in Canada). She seems to disagree with what I said but she continues listening to me. I tell her that I also want to gain Canadian citizenship and settle there.\nNow I’m not sure why, but grandma here got pissed. She went to the point where she called me a traitor to Thailand (I really can’t give less of a damn) and tells me the following:\n\n\t1) I’m a Thai person, and a Thai should live and die on Thai soil (wtf no)\n\t2) They won’t accept you there (ummm Canada is made of immigrants but okay)\n\nEven when I talk about the benefits of studying abroad and living there, she seems reluctant. She tells me that she wants me to take it easy and maybe study a year or two in Thailand for uni first, but I had to put my foot down. If I can’t speak Thai for shit and I act more westernized than Thai, then I can’t function in society here. She doesn’t seem to understand, but she’s disappointed and upset.\n\nSo am I the asshole for telling her I don’t wanna stay in Thailand because I want something better for my life?\n\nTLDR: grandma gets mad because I told her I want to emigrate",

      "title": "AITA for being miserable due to the state of my sex life?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been going out for nearly 3 years now. Our sex life is horrendous. I have an extremely high libido (up for it every day pretty much), and hers is extremely low. We probably average sex once a month at best, and when it happens, it's rarely fun and easy. She gets scared about people walking in, she asks how close I am constantly, she mostly is a dead-fish, and sometimes she begins to hurt which means of course I am not going to continue. This is compounded by the fact she is not super adventurous in bed or open with sex-related stuff in general; for example, she thinks porn is disgusting and does not like the idea of me watching it, so I don't because that's a boundary for her.\n\nNow after reading that you may think it's obvious that we are not compatible and we should break up. However it is a lot more intricate than that. For starters, this is no secret; we have talked about this a tremendous amount of times, and she is always very apologetic and remorseful during such conversations. She makes a lot of effort to try and improve this situation too, especially in the last 5-6 weeks. She has tried going off the pill, tried scheduling sex, and a few times (fully consensual) she has asked me to keep going when she hurts a bit to see if it wears off. Nothing seems to work. The issue is exacerbated by my SSRI medication, which makes it much harder for me to achieve orgasm, but unfortunately my libido has not been lowered at all, so I end up sexually frustrated a lot of the time.\n\nI'm young and naive, I won't hide that, but she really is perfect in every single other way. She is my best friend and despite this huge issue I still don't enjoy anything as much as I enjoy being by her side. From the opening paragraph she might have sounded cold and impassionate but I assure you this is not the case. She is the best person I have met in my life thus far. Whenever we discuss how much this issue hurts me emotionally and makes me feel unwanted, she really shows she cares and she is honestly desperate to fix this situation.\n\nHowever, this issue really depresses me a lot of the time and I'm unfortunately not very good at hiding my emotions, so a couple times a week I am miserable for 15-30 mins and this makes my girlfriend miserable as a result because she feels terrible for doing this to me. It's not her fault, there's nothing wrong with a low libido. \n\nI feel like an asshole who only cares about sex. So tell me honestly; am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm 17M dating 16F that goes to another school and lives about 15 minutes away. Relationship is going great, especially considering we can only see each other on weekends. Kind of important note about her: she's fairly shy around new people and tends to be quiet when she feels she has nothing good to add.\nI'm in a groupchat with 4 close friends (was 5 at the time, 1 has cut us off, but that's unimportant). We've all known each other and have been close friends since middle school. We all have very similar senses of humor and converse very well. This groupchat (while on different platforms) has existed for around 4-5 years.\nAbout 4 months ago, we were talking about music in the groupchat. We were talking about some artists that I know my gf likes (we were technically only \"talking\" at this point but we were basically dating). I made a comment about how *gf name* would enjoy this conversation, but I didn't think it would be a good idea to add her to the chat. My friends said it would be fine, so I did. We talked about music and such for a bit that night and all seemed fine. After that night she rarely says anything at all in the chat, and if she does it's almost always a single response that doesn't add anything to the conversation. It's been this way the entire time she's been in the chat, but she reads everything that's said in the chat. About a month or two ago, I made an offhand comment to her that if she doesn't want to be in the groupchat then she doesn't have to. She told me that she's fine with being in it and likes to read the messages. We haven't spoken about it since. It kind of makes me uncomfortable having her in the chat. I feel like I have to watch what I say at times (not too often) and the jokes I make (we tend to have an edgy sort of humor). We also talk about some pretty sensitive things at times, things that aren't the end of the world if she knows about but aren't her business whatsoever either. I've briefly talked to the people in the groupchat privately about it and they're indifferent on her being in the chat. I don't know how I'd go about asking her to leave.\n\nTLDR: GF is in a groupchat with some of my closest friends, doesn't ever say anything, but likes to read the messages. Makes the chat uncomfortable for me.",

I used to hurt myself every night various ways. Basically depression, anxiety and insomnia damn near killed me.\n\nThis weekend a bunch of friends and I were gonna go camping in the middle of nowhere. However on Tuesday a friend was feeling very low and I was very worried and because I don't have my license yet I called the police and asked them to do a check on her then asked my housemate to speed to her house. \n\nMajor TW here. \n\nWe found her on the ground covered in blood, cuts on her wrists, neck and thighs. She had overdosed, unconscious, not breathing, shoelace around her neck. Called ambo and started cpr. Once they took her to hospital I went into her room and found alcohol, pills and razors. I threw them all in the bin and cleaned the blood and vomit as best I could.\n\nWe visited the next day, in her room I couldn't say anything. It was too much, she was saying all the things I used to say. No one cares, you'd be better off without me, why are you even here why do you care. \nI had planned on saying all the things I wished someone had said to me, I'd planned on being there for her and staying as long as it took. Instead, I had to dig my nails into my thumb just to stop myself from losing my shit. \n\nWhen we got home I spent hours screaming and crying, all the shit memories I'd blocked came flooding back and my urges to hurt myself came back. \n\nI can't do this, I can't go back and visit and I can't be there for her. I feel like I need to get away. I'm scared that if I keep trying to support my friend, it'll end badly for me.\n\nWould I be an asshole for leaving and having fun for the weekend?

I also was blessed enough to inherit a large sum of money from my grandmother. I contribute around 70% to the account as I make more and also have the inheritance to help us out in that regard. \n\nMy boyfriend works at a restaurant and makes a little above minimum wage there. He contributes whenever he’s able, sometimes he’ll miss a month or two at the most but it’s not a big deal overall.\n\nNow we’ve been kind of having a lot of arguments about our joint account recently, specifically the “work” department. We’re having a fancy dinner at my job in a week to celebrate the good year we had, the boss is requiring us to actually look fancy as we usually wear very casual outfits to work.\n\nThe only pair of heels I had were old and basically broken because the glue wouldn’t stick anymore. So I decided to buy a new pair for work, I went to Nordstrom, it’s a more upscale store but has some affordable options as well. \n\nI ended up purchasing heels that costed around $130. I was thrilled, upon returning home I excitedly showed my boyfriend. \n\nThe conversation below isn’t word for word but it’s to the best of my knowledge:\n\nMe: Look at these heels I got, they were really cheap too. I was stuck between this one and this other pair but I just went with this because it’s all black.\n\nBf: How much were they?\n\nMe: Originally they were $250 but it was on sale for $130.\n\nBf: That’s not much of a deal, it’s probably like $20 tops and they just overprice it because people like the brand so much.\n\nMe: I don’t even know brands, I just chose it because it looks nice and feels comfy.\n\nBf: Well I’m sure there were other alternatives too.\n\nMe: I charged it to the joint account card by the way, just wanted to let you know before you get the notification on your phone.\n\nBf: Wait what? Why would you charge it to that?\n\nMe: It’s for work, I’m planning on using them for other events in the future too.\n\nBf: Thats obviously not for work, I’m not buying Jordan’s and saying it’s for work.\n\nMe: I don’t ever wear heels, they are for work. I wouldn’t buy them otherwise.\n\nBf: If you don’t even wear any then why would you go all out like that? I hope you plan on repaying the account later on.\n\nMe: You can’t be serious, it’s $130, that’s so much hassle to transfer.\n\nBoyfriend storms out at this point, he usually needs to smoke a joint after arguments so he doesn’t get too upset. \n\nI didn’t make my case yet but I plan on bringing it up again soon. My point is the heels are a work expense, and they weren’t that expensive.\n\nHe spends over $300 a week on weed for work, which I understand it’s a part of the restaurant culture and it’s a stressful job. But that being a work expense qualifies my shoes to be as well. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I bring up my points or apologize for my mistakes? I do feel bad for starting an argument over this but it feels kind of weird how we manage our money. I understand it’s for security reasons but I think I should be able to spend some money on heels.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So my friend (26F) and her boyfriend(26M) are very close to adopting a young husky (roughly 3yrs of age, male) and I’m trying to decide how honest I should be when talking to her about this because I think it’s a bad idea. \n\nFor one, they have a small dog (15-20lbs) who is 13 now and has always been their only dog. She has had him since he was a pup and treats this dog like her child, wraps him in blankets, lets him sit at the table etc. I personally dislike this dog because he is not well behaved and constantly jumps on me and scratches up my legs. But I know that’s not his fault, it’s the owners fault for allowing it and at this point he’s too old to change.  I don’t think this older dog will take well to a younger dog coming in and stealing attention away. This older dog is also on meds for anxiety. \n\nSecondly, my friend has weird work hours as does her boyfriend which are not able to be adjusted (from what she tells me her boss is a dick). It’s not abnormal for them to leave the house at 6am and not be home until 6:30pm or later. This is okay for the older dog because they leave food and water out for him and he can eat when he pleases. However, for a 3 year old husky it seems unfair to either cage the dog for several hours or restrain him to a certain room without food or water. \n\nSo it just seems like while they have good intentions it wouldn’t be fair to either dog if they were to adopt this husky. It’s likely to put a lot of undue stress on her older dog, why not let him live out his last years in peace? It also doesn’t seem fair to the husky coming into a home where he will always be #2 and likely won’t get the exercise his breed typically requires. Should I tell her all of this? I’ve tested the waters and said something like “just make sure you’ve thought it through” and she kinda snapped at me saying “if we hadn’t thought it through do you think we’d even be discussing this?” So, what do you guys think? Should I try again or let it go?",

Since then everyone has unliked the gif and is acting like I'm an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like this is a pretty typical way nicknames have been discovered, and it definitely wasn't an attack on that individuals character, just a funny thing they did that we could all have a giggle at after they are inducted.

      "description": "Okay so I met this girl through the Facebook group for new students in the winter of senior year. She seemed nice enough and I drove to her city (about 5 hours away) to meet her. We decided to be roommates after meeting in person. We didn't talk much about our cleanliness habits (HUGE mistake). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after getting to school, I realize this girl is the DIRTIEST girl I have possibly ever met. She never does laundry, and keeps her laundry bag (of dirty clothes!) right next to my desk. It is so overfilled that sometimes dirty underwear will fall on the floor. Granted, the room is small and she is an out of state student so she brings more clothes than me. But, I keep my dirty clothes in a bag in my closet. NOT right next to her desk. It is embarrassing to have friends in the room because some of them have pointed this out. To make matters worse, she used to keep them right next to the futon where friends sit. So the other spot she picked was right next to my desk. I didn't fight it at the time, as I would rather it be here than next to the futon, but it is disgusting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second thing she does to annoy me is sleep on the futon. I'm not talking about sleeping on the futon once a week when she gets home plastered at 3 am. It is every single night. It is bothersome because she often does not wake up until noon or 1pm, therefore, me or any friends I have over cannot sit on the futon. I feel like I have to tiptoe around my own room when I get ready for class, as she is usually sleeping on the futon right there. Often times when she leaves for class she will leave her stuff strewn all over the futon, as she uses it like her bed! I have mentioned to her that I would prefer she would sleep in her bed, so she stopped sleeping on the futon for a few weeks. This was about 3 months ago. However, after her friends came to visit (week after winter break) and THEY slept on the futon, she started doing it again! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe does other things to bother me, but those are the main two that really drive me crazy. I provide most of the cleaning supplies for the room and do ALL of the cleaning. Her idea of cleaning is to throw clothes in her closet, whereas I actually wipe stuff down, vacuum, take out the trash etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA for asking my roommate to start sleeping in her bed again and do her laundry so that the bag is not overflowing next to my desk?

      "description": "Throwaway because of the personal details. Me[22f] and my ex boyfriend[22m] were in a relationship all through high school and had a daughter when were in 10th grade and 16 at the time. We did not have a great relationship because he wanted me to move away from my family with him while he attended the college he got accepted to which was about an 8 hour drive away. We tried long distance for a few months but we broke up as I fell in love with someone else at home and began cheating and got caught.\n\nAfter a pretty shakey few months we worked out that we would try our best to stay on good terms and we decided a child support payment between ourselves based on what I knew he'd be able to support due to his only working part time while at school. Over the past 3 years I've had 2 more children with the new guy and am a stay at home mom full time while living with my father to take care of all the kids. My father recently had to quit his job due to medical issues and my boyfriend struggles to hold a job and has spent some time in and out of jail recently.\n\nSo I have three kids and am really struggling to make ends meet right now. My first daughter's father has made it known to my father in the past that he disapproves of the way I've gone about life, thinking that me having more kids has lessened the opportunities his kid will have. I've also asked him for extra money about 4 times in the past 3 years and each time he gives it, but makes sure to lecture me on getting a job and being more responsible while he's off at college not seeing his kid very often.\n\nHe is graduating this spring and will be moving onto a full time engineering job and I am wondering WIBTA for asking him to pay more money in child support each month so that I will have more money to support my whole family.",

      "description": "My friend and DM of 10ish years is demanding I apologize for inviting a mutual friend to hang out after our D&amp;D game got cancelled. One of the other players was sick and wouldn't be joining us. I myself had a bit of a sore throat and hadn't really been relishing the idea of braving rush hour traffic for 40 minutes, especially if we were just going to end up playing Mario Kart and arguing about the same 3 movies as always happens whenever one of the players doesn't show. I replied to the group text asking if the game was cancelled expressing that I was fine if it was as I was not at 100% either and that 'cancelled plans feel akin to found money' to me. Aparently that feeling is not universal and I was told it was a 'dickish way of expressing myself' and some vague swipe at my 'life style'... if I had been on the fence about it before, I sure wasn't stoked to come out now.\n\nA fellow player and mutual friend stepped in to smooth things out a bit in the chat and the issue seemed resolved. Game cancelled, feel better everyone, heart emojis. I am left thinking what a good dude he is and feeling kinda bad now because this mutual friend gets zero free time away from his wife and kid. I shoot him a thank you for smoothing things out I tell him if he wants to brave the germs, he's welcome to pop by on his way home. He declines. No biggie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple weeks go by and no talk of the game. I don't think much of it until the DM calls on Saturday morning.\n\n \n\nDM: \"Well I was talking to Mutual Friend and he said you invited him out after cancelling my game...\"\n\nMe: \"I told him to pop by if he needed time away from his fam was all. He didn't want to get sick.\"\n\nDM: \"Uh huh... well it felt like you just want to do things without me. I don't know what to do with you.\"\n\nMe: \"Have you been stewing about this for 2 weeks?\"\n\nDM: \"Whatever, I'll talk to you later.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20 minutes before texts about how I cancelled the game, he 'looked up the transcripts' and 'do his feelings even matter to me in the slightest'... Fuck this. I spent my day eating and relaxing rather than kissing my DM's ass about imagined slights. We're almost 40 for fuck sake!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's been a few more days. I'm left thinking about how, I'm probably DM's oldest friend as he regularly pushes people out of his life. I have seen him do this to a dozen or so other players/friends over the years, and am not really surprised that my number seems to be up. Despite weird loyalty tests, jokes about my appearance, constantly being told I have shit taste, I still think he's a good dude deep down and I can see all these actions for what they are; defense mechanisms. Feel bad for not responding as I know that he's been ghosted before by a lot of people and doesn't understand why. It's not my intention but every time I pick up the phone I see his last text \"Utter unapologetic.\" and I just feel so drained and like if I engage with this nonsense I'm validating it on some level.

She says they're just friends, but knowing her they'll be sleeping together by the first night. My niece insists every new guy she sees around the house is her \"new dad\". Anyway, I'm upset because I think she is being selfish. She lives a few towns over and I only get to see her + her kids about once a month. I don't know when I'll get to see them again after the move. That, and I think that her completely uprooting her kids' lives to go live with someone who is a total stranger to them is damaging to them. Am I an asshole? I haven't told my sister how I feel. She is nearly 30 and will not grow up, I feel I'd be wasting my breath.",

      "description": "For the past ten years I feel like I’ve been excusing his behavior because in our vows we said “in sickness and health”, but I’m afraid he is having a negative influence over our three kids.\n\nToday we were planning to go to the zoo, which is two hours away. We get there and will have to park in overflow and shuttle in. He has a panic attack and basically wants to go home. Our kids, ages 5,8,9 don’t understand why we drove all this way there just to turn around, so I end up going to a park instead, hoping he will calm down. He tries blaming everything on the kids since they were “too loud” in the car. Then after we get home, he says he just can’t do stuff like that. Like at all.\n\nI love him but I basically am saying I will conduct every event solo because he just can’t handle big stressful situations, which happen all the time since we have three kids. \n\nHis episodes have also kept him from keeping steady work, which makes me the only income for a family of five. I know I said I would be there always, but I just don’t know if I have the strength to run a whole family without the support of another functioning adult. I feel selfish, so AITA?\n",

He recently turned 16, and up until the incident, seemed fairly mature. He is the youngest person in the server. For clarification, I am 25.\n  \n Right after his birthday, I had made a joke that he was legal in certain countries, and made a bdsm joke (nothing super graphic or extreme) and he said no. I switched topics to joking about anime's and human experimentation. Kinda dark humor but it's normal for the server. He kept saying he wasn't into that and that he wouldn't allow that to happen to him. He never asked me to stop and I thought I had made it clear that I was no longer joking around with him.\n  \nHe, and a few other people he roped into the situation, messaged my fiance to wake my SO up and didn't explain anything. This caused me and my fiance to have a fight, and I had a breakdown because of stress with this incident being my breaking point.\n \n I messaged the 16 year old telling him to next time, please message me first if he has a problem with me.  He taunted me for it,and I overheard him talking about me. I snapped and told him he was basically an insect to me at this point, and if he continues to act this way/ doesn't learn how to talk to people in these situations, he won't amount to anything in life.\nHe called me an A-hole and is trying to get everyone else to agree with him. I don't think I am one and he's been trying to throw himself a pity party since.\n\nTL:DR I made a joke, kid thought I was joking about him. Caused a fight with my so and taunted me for it.

He drove across Texas to pick me up, coed back to central Texas for our event, drove eat again to get me home and headed back to his home in west tx. Yeah, I got the feels for him and made the mistake of telling him. He said “I love you, but not like that. “ ok, so his intentions are pure. But I’m hurt and confused. WHO DOES THIS? why would a grown man give me everything and even drop hints that he has deeper feelings for me only to turn away when I finally accept his advances? He was flirtatious, he has been there through thick and thin. And he got angry with me when I told him how I felt. \n\nAm I the jerk for being selfish and expressing my desire to be more deeply involved? Further more, am I in the wrong to feel hurt over his rejection? He expressed he’d be very sting if I start something with someone else. Why? He doesn’t want me. I do not want to lose my best friend.

We did long distance/only seeing each other a couple of weekends a month until a year ago, when we moved in together.\n\nOur relationship is pretty much perfect in every aspect apart from one - our sex life. Before we moved in together our sex drives were about equal, but over the past few months my boyfriend’s drive has dropped completely. He rarely initiates sex any more, and rejects me 9 times out of 10 when I try to initiate, usually saying that he’s too tired.\n\nI’ve brought it up as an issue at least 3 times now cause I was getting worried something was seriously wrong. Every time we talk about it he says all the right things, reassures me that nothing is wrong, and promises to have sex more regularly, but still nothing has significantly changed.\n\nI’m starting to feel unloved and unattractive. Despite the fact that the rest of our relationship is amazing I don’t know if I can stay with him when I’m feeling like this. I don’t want to throw everything away without trying to work on it one more time, so I was thinking of having another serious talk and explaining that if our sex life doesn’t improve, I’m going  to have to consider the future of the relationship as a whole. But I’m worried that that will come across as a threat. I don’t want to seem like I’m manipulating him into sleeping with me, I just want to get across the severity of the situation and how shitty it’s making me feel.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I told him I was considering breaking up with him if our sex life doesn’t improve?",

      "description": "Hi!  \nSo this is actually two years old and I still think about it quite often.  \nMy best friend and I are born in September, 10days apart, her birthday been before mine.  \nFor her 18th birthday, some friends of hers and I decided to offer her two tickets to go to London with another of her friends (her other best friend) in November or December.  \nIt wasn't a great trip planned, because we didn't have a lot of money for it, but since she wanted to travel, we thought it was a good idea, especially since she was supposed to go with her best friend.  \nShe was happy and there's that.  \nWhen my birthday arrived, she didn't have a gift for me and told me she really wanted to give me a good gift and she would rather wait than rush it, and I was okay with that especially since it was my 18th birthday and I really wanted it to be a bit special. She said she wanted to wait for her trip to London to get me something good, and even if it was months after my birthday, I was okay with it too.  \nWeeks go by and her weekend to London gets closer and closer and nothing is going as planned. Her mother wouldn't let her go by herself with her best friend and decided that she would go with her instead, making it a mother/daughter trip.  \nShe went and came back and told me that it was probably the worst trip she had ever gone on, that the location of the hotel was terrible (I admit that it was quite far), etc.  \nIt wasn't really cool to hear, because we were trying to make her happy and she sounded like a whiny bitch when she wasn't usually.  \nAnyway, still a few weeks later, she tells me that she has a gift for my birthday!  \nSo we agreed to see each other the next morning before classes so she could give it to me.  \nWhen I meet her, she gives me my gift and it is a mug that has a phosphorescent tree drawn on it.  \nAnd I have to admit that I was super disappointed. While I do love hot chocolates and teas, and mugs are a great gift for me in general, I was expecting much more from her, for my 18th birthday. Especially since I had seen that exact same mug a few weeks before (and admittedly found the idea really cool even though I didn't like the drawing) in a shop I went. And the bag in which the mug was in was from a shop that was 10min away from her home. I sometimes think it was some kind of petty revenge for the worst trip of her life...  \nWe are still friends and all but birthday gifts is a subject I hate talking about with her because she considers herself a great gift-giver.  \nAm I the asshole?  \n\n\nSorry if this isn't very clear, I'm French",

      "description": "When I was a baby my grandmother set aside savings bonds for my siblings and I for when we went to college. Now that I am in college I remembered my mom telling me that they had been set aside for me. My mother is no longer around much, my parents divorced when I was 9 and she had to move away to live with family after her boyfriend kicked her out suddenly in 2017. So I'm living with my father for now (keep in mind I dont live in his house, my father, his girlfriend, my brother and I all live with my grandmother, none of us pay rent to live here, i just wanted to clarify because a lot of people i tell about his online make the argument that since I'm living in his house I can't complain), and he has all my documents (insurance card, birth certificate etc) so I sat him down and asked him where my savings bonds were, as I figured they would be mature by now. He immediately got defensive and started yelling at me, saying \"what do you think I did with them? I cashed them in to pay bills!!\". Apparently he did this when I was only 5, now this was before my dad lost his job in the recession, so we weren't the most well off, but at this point both my parents held jobs that payed relatively well. I asked him if he had any intent of paying it back and he started calling me ungrateful and saying my head wasnt screwed on straight. He then brought up times where he occasionally gave me a few dollars here or there to buy candy or a lip gloss or something. I said \"Jeeze dad, if I knew you were handing me my college savings to buy candy when I was 12 I may have thought twice about spending it on something so temporary.\" He then said \"I only got maybe $900 from all of them and some of them  were your brothers! I maybe got $300 from yours.\" And I said \"well first of all, if you let them sit until now they would have been worth a lot more than $300, especially considering you cashed them in only 5 years after they were purchased. Second of all, I understand if you really needed the money, but it still wasn't yours to take, and I know if I had kids and I absolutely had to borrow from them in order to pay bills then I would at the very least set up a plan to repay it by the time they were old enough to cash them in.\" He then threw a glass and it shattered on the floor and startled me. He started screaming how I'm ungrateful and undeserving, how I've changed and how I used to be his favorite but now I'm not. He then stormed out of the house and drove away and didnt come back home for 2 hours. I called my mom while crying and she told me (I'm not sure if its true) that he had a gambling problem and would clock out of work on payday to gamble away his paycheck. I was heartbroken, and he hasnt treated me the same since, always favoring my brother and letting his girlfriend make digs at me. Was I wrong for wanting the money back? Its just that I'm at a point in my life where I could really use the money and he knows that, yet I still havent recieved a cent for them, as a matter of fact, he actually owes me money for other things, I havent asked for it back though because whenever I do he gets defensive and his girlfriend (who is always around) will get mad at me for asking for money, even if it was money he borrowed from me and told me he would pay back. I just want to leave at this point, I'm not sure I can handle living with them anymore, they make me feel so bad about myself.",

      "title": "AITA for having a dildo twice the length and girth of my boyfriend's penis?",
      "description": "So this is probably NSFW and TMI, but I need to know if I AITA. \n\nSo a little backstory. When my boyfriend and I got together sex was normal, but when I got pregnant my sex drive took a massive dive into I don't want to, but not because I had low libido, but more it's not worth the effort since I never get off, and I'm exhausted from pregnancy. My boyfriend gets off within like 10 minutes, and he doesn't care about foreplay or after play or my orgasm at all. Anyways I brought up the fact that I got a vibrator to him, and that I would like to use it in bed. He asked why I would need that if we never have sex. I said because it will make sex more enjoyable for me, and thus increase the likelihood of sex happening. I also asked if he would care if I bought a dildo, and he said I shouldn't have one because I have him. Basically implying that if his dick is available then I shouldn't be ignoring sex to fuck a dildo. \n\nNow I kind of respect his opinion because I do believe sex is an important part of a relationship, and I also wouldn't want him masturbating constantly and ignoring me. \n\nNow fast forward a year and a bit, and now our son is born and he won't have sex with me. He hasn't initiated, and when I initiate he pushes me away. We have had sex twice in about 8 months. I have talked to him and he says its him, and that he doesn't feel well EVER, and he is stressed, but I'm literally sexually frustrated. \n\nSo I bought a dildo. The dildo is about twice the length and girth of my boyfriend's penis. Now let me say I have ZERO issues with my boyfriend's size, it just so happened that these dildos were on sale, and they were what I was looking for, style wise. I have the dildo hidden, and my boyfriend has no idea about it, but I am worried that if he finds it he will be angry, and probably feel a little offended? \n\nSo AITA for having a dildo that is double the size of my boyfriend? \n\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I go to the gym six days a week to lift weights. It's been my hobby for 8 years and I'm just getting her into it. She has really, really bad social anxiety and, as you can imagine, is extremely self conscious about being seen working out. Her self esteem is so low that she tends to assume that whatever she does in or out of the gym is \"stupid\" and that others are judging her. I always do my best to be her #1 cheerleader but this brings me to an incident I couldn't have anticipated. She was doing squats at the gym and I was about 20 feet away at the bench when she suddenly runs to the bathroom crying. I ask her what happened and she said a man approached her, motioned for her to take her headphones off, and started criticizing her squat form totally unsolicited. She wasn't in danger of hurting herself or others, he just said she wasn't going low enough and that she has bad form. In retrospect, this was probably an attempt to hit on her, at best, but even so, I don't see why this gentleman wanted to do so by insulting her. She was seriously distraught, humiliated, and ashamed, and I was pissed. \n\nI saw him over at the bench, and though it seems petty, started harassing him about his bench form, asking why he was going so light, etc, asking why he felt the need to put people who were smaller than him down. Now the tables are turned...this guy is 5'5\", 135 at best (he told me he does CrossFit, lol), and I'm 205lbs on my third cycle of tren. Needless to say, he was scared shitless. He ran over and told the front desk I was harassing him. After hearing the full story, they sided with me.\n\nThis brings me to tonight. Literally the same thing happens, but with a different guy. I responded the same way, except even more pissed because I had assured my girlfriend (who is very attractive and prone to being talked to by creepy men) that this wouldn't happen again. She went and told management this time and they apologized profusely. I told them that I would respond the same way each and every time. However, I can't help but feel like an asshole if this is going to happen on a biweekly basis. Furthermore, I think uninvolved gym regulars will think I'm some roided out freak who confronts people when I'm really the calmest guy in the world...I say hi and am super friendly to everyone and have never, before this, been in a confrontation like this in my life. Am I an asshole for defending my girlfriend who doesn't have the skills/confidence to defend herself?",

Plus the age gap really squicks me out. \n\nThey've been seeing each other for a month now, and she's totally obsessed with him. From the get-go I've been telling her that I'd like to meet him before they take things further, and have been repeatedly denied, along with my probing questions about him (seriously, I still know next to nothing about this dude). So yesterday I told her - for her own safety - that I wouldn't allow her to keep seeing him unless I was allowed to meet him in person. So yeah. Line in the sand. \n\nI'm sensitive to the idea that IATA in this situation. She is, after all, legally an adult. Also it's not like I can realistically do much to actually end the relationship, short of telling our parents.

      "description": "This happened this morning. I (22F) live in the suburbs with my parents and work at a very prestigious fine dining restaurant downtown in the city. Timeliness is extremely important here and we are encouraged to be 5-10 minutes early. It takes me anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour to get to work, depending entirely on traffic. Oftentimes I take uber because I don’t want to pay for parking downtown.\nMy mom (58F) doesn’t have a drivers license because she’s legally blind. My dad travels for work. I help my mom out a lot but I can’t do  everything for her because I work 50-60 hours a week in the fall and winter, and 70+ in the summer.\nThis morning I woke up at 7:30 to get to work by 9. At 8:15 I had called my uber and was putting my coat on to wait when my mom asks: “are you going down {name of street}.” \nMe: “no im not I take {other street} to {other street}. Thats completely out of the way. Also Im taking uber.”\nMom: “well can you just drop me off at my hairdresser on the way?”\nMe: “again im taking an uber.”\nMom: “I can join you in the uber and the driver can drip me off”\nMe: “no, it will make me late and I’ll get fired for being late. If you had told me earlier I would have done it.”\nThen my mom storms off and says “I can’t believe you. Every day you continue to shock me.”\nHer comments really hurt. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong in that scenario, but I have a pretty bad past. I’m trying to be a better person, I just really needed to get to work on time. There was a chance I could have dropped her off and still made it, but like I said, being even 5 minutes late is fireable and I really didn’t want to risk it. Maybe I should also mention that my mom is sick with cancer and sometimes uses that to guilt me into doing things for her (which I usually do). But it doesn’t seem relevant to the scenario. Anyways AITA?\n\nTLDR: Im headed out the door to work and my mom asks to hop in my uber to get dropped off somewhere else. I tell her no, it will make me late. She says my behavior shocks her everyday.",

      "title": "AITA for keeping my young kids on a fairly regular schedule?",
      "description": "I always thought it was recommended that kids stay on a somewhat regular schedule. We've always kept them on a similar schedule to daycare in regards to meals/naps, and we keep a pretty routine bedtime. My oldest is in kindergarten now, so we don't have to worry about naps, but she still eats lunch around the same time she did in daycare.\n\nWith my oldest, we learned pretty early on that if we messed with her routine too much, especially with regards to sleeping, bedtime could be a big hassle, and she'd be more prone to waking up at least once during the night (which could extend to subsequent nights from overtiredness). So if we are invited someplace and it interferes, we politely decline the invitation (or mention a better alternative if asked).\n\nMy brother and his family live nearby off and on, and he has kids of similar age to mine. Whenever we try to make plans together, I always take into account nap/bed times and normal meal times. I could always tell this annoyed him, though he never said anything, but lately, he's started making passive-aggressive remarks (i.e., when asking about making plans for the weekend, I'll mention that we have no plans, so we're fairly flexible outside of the afternoon nap time, and he'll say, \"Are you?!\" in a sarcastic tone). When they were visiting various friends/family stateside while living in Europe last year, he was annoyed that I wouldn't meet up with them after the kids' bedtime for dinner on a weeknight (we had plans to visit with them on a weekend, so this wasn't our only chance). There have been times I've just taken my oldest, since she doesn't nap, but I get passive-aggressive remarks about the younger ones not being there.\n\nI'm not sure if it's relevant, but he and his wife have a very different parenting style to mine and my husband's --- they take their kids everywhere (restaurants, traveling, wineries, movies) no matter the time or occasion, they only eat organic food, they live a minimalist lifestyle, where they barely have any toys (maybe 2-3 toys each and books), which is necessary since they move every year (sometimes out of the country). We are very opposite --- we don't plan to take our kids traveling until they're old enough to appreciate it (our first big vacation is an upcoming Disney cruise), we only go to kid-friendly restaurants, we only go to more formal venues if we have a baby-sitter, we didn't take my oldest to a movie until she was 3 1/2, and it was at a cheap movie theater, we don't shop organic, and our kids have a normal amount of toys. We also own our house and plan to live here until we're too old to do so. They complain about money issues, but go to expensive dinners, travel a lot, and throw expensive wine and cheese parties, while we aren't cheap, but we are money conscious, so have a decent savings. These are just some of the differences.\n\nEven though I don't always agree with his choices, I'm very supportive when he asks for advice and never criticize, since I think it's not my place to do so unless there's abuse involved\n\nI've asked some (childless) friends if we're too rigid with our kids' schedules, and they said that maybe we should compromise to meet up with my brother, as he's obviously feeling hurt.\n\nSo sorry for the long-winded post, but AITA for having my kids on fairly consistent schedules?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Apologies in advance, but this is going to take some background information. TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo when I was probably about 12 or 13, my grandparents got involved with a local community of refugees that immigrated to the United States. At this point they were both retired and they really threw all of their energy into it.\n\nThey became particularly attached a family of four. My grandparents basically adopted them into our family, and since then they come to all of our family functions. I was never really close with any of them due to age differences. Now, at the time I had a lot of mixed emotions about this. At the age of 12 I was essentially told that these random strangers were now my family, deal with it.\n\nThe family function I'm referring to is a summer picnic. I haven't attended since I was around 15 (I'm currently 21). Every year my family would go to the lake and have a picnic together, go swimming, play in the sand, etc. Once my grandparents adopted this other family they began attending as well.\n\nHere's the issue: One year my grandparents decided that it would be a fantastic idea to invite the *entire* extended family of their adopted family. I'm not talking a few people either. It was at least 20.\n\nI showed up to discover that my family had been made a minority at our own event. And it was very awkward. Many of these people were refugees keep in mind, so understandably many of them did not speak much English. They all pretty much pretended like we weren't there.\n\nI was really upset because it felt more like we had been invited to their family picnic instead of the other way around. When I was younger I had a *lot* of unresolved social anxiety, so situations like this one were torture for me. Aside from my brother there wasn't anyone I could hang out with, and he was kind of a dick.\n\nSo, when it became obvious that next year was going to be more of the same I flat out refused to go, and I've always been a pretty stubborn person so eventually I got my way.\n\nMy mother still gives me shit about not going anymore. She'll guilt trip me with all kinds of stuff, even though they have since cancelled the entire thing for (IMO) a stupid reason.\n\nNow that I'm older the entire thing seems very childish and selfish on my part, but I also feel like I was at least partially justified due to the weirdness of the family situation. I don't know, was I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: When I was a young teenager my grandparents adopted a refugee family of four and started inviting them to all of our family functions. I had a lot of negative emotions about this, but was essentially told to grow up because \"they're family now\". Finally got fed up when my grandparents invited the family of four's entire extended family to one of our family functions and it triggered my social anxiety. Haven't been to said event in \\~7 years. Mother still thinks I'm being a stubborn ass about it, even though the event no longer happens. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not sharing my Pro Controller with my little brother?",
      "description": "Bit of backstory: we got the Switch as a shared New Year's present. Since then we have had two sets of Joy-Cons, and the left joysticks of both of them have started drifting (meaning they input things when you don't touch them etc.), which makes it pretty difficult to play certain games I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (16M) have decided to use some of my birthday money to buy myself a Pro Controller. When I shared this idea with my dad to order it online, my younger brother (11M) came up to me and asked if he would be allowed to use it as well. I said no because I bought it with my own money and he could get one himself with his money, or get a HORIPAD if he didn't want to spend €68. He complained and said: \"I do with my money what I want!\" which I have learned to mean \"I'm gonna use your stuff instead so I can spend mine on Fortnite.\" I know this because he has done it in the past, such as when he lost his phone charger and kept on using mine, while our parents got him VBucks and a Battle Pass that same week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also pretty paranoid on letting him use it since I kinda feel he might break it. He's dropped the switch multiple times and has been known to rage pretty often when losing, even having thrown the joycons once (granted, they fell on the carpet). He claims the first joycon started drifting after our cat pushed the Switch down our table, which sounds believable, but the second one started drifting after he took the Switch to a sleepover with one of his friends. I know correlation =/= causation but I really don't want to take too many risks with something I paid almost €70 for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of his arguments is that I sometimes use his headphones, but I asked him whether I could use those and he said yes. If he were to say I'm no longer allowed to use it then I won't, simple as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly want the Pro Controller to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I also bought a Switch Online subscription to play the game online, but with a drifting joy-con that's pretty much impossible (my GSP with Lucina dropped from over 4,000,000 to 1,700,000 before I quit). It's also the main reason I wanted a Pro Controller, else the subscription would be wasted money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother has since been annoying me because he'll only be able to play with the drifting joy-cons and thus basically cannot use the system. A little nuance I'm adding here is that he literally only used it to play Fortnite anymore, which he can also play on our laptop, and watch YouTube videos, which he can also do with drifting joy-cons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's already told our mom about it and she brought it up at the dinner table, insisting I let my brother use it from time to time as well. I explained why I'd rather not but she casually responded something in the line of \"No, he won't break it...\" Since my parents usually side with my brother and my sister literally does not care at all, I've come here to get some unbiased opinions. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She yells at me all the time, finds reasons to be angry at me when it's basically nothing, and it escalated to the point where she's thrown a can of beans at my head and left a very large lump, or tried throttling my neck, and I pushed her off of me, and because I pushed her, my dad and her both said I'm the one in the wrong for it. And it's like that constantly. She'll argue with me, and I'll respond with, \"ok\" trying to defuse it, and she'll keep screaming at me like she's mad she's not getting a reaction, and my dad still only tells me, \"You need to stop being passive aggressive\" or \"You need to just leave when she gets angry, and stop antagonizing her\" but it feels like she's angry everytime she sees me, and the only way to avoid it is to come downstairs when my dad is home (he usually works long hours and my stepmom is home hours before him) or to just not live in my own house. But they consistently always call me an asshole and tell me I'm the one that's wrong, am I delusional? Is there something else I can do to stop her getting mad at me?

      "description": "I have been best friends with this guy for 12-13 years, since we were in grade school. Fast forward we are in our mid 20's. I consider this guy my brother. Always been there for each other.. He shows up whenever he gets into town. (he works in a different city from me) Every once in a while he gets 2 weeks off and he comes to my house and sleeps here. My parents see him as their adopted son. He's basically family to us.\n\nHe's been on and off with this one girl since 8th grade. I used to like her as well back then, but decided to back off for our friendship sake. Rather keep him as my friend than have a girl break us apart. Fast forward to Sr year in high school. She's going off to University, he doesn't go that route and they have a long distance relationship. Everything was good these 4 years into their relationship.\n\nFreshman year. He'd go and visit her randomly. He would do anything for her. They split for a while, she doesn't want to be with him anymore. Obvious college girl wanting to have fun and explore. Whatever not my problem, but he gets sad over it, i tell him just chill and wait and see what happens. They get back together, all is good again.\n\nSophomore year. If i remember correctly, she cheats on him with someone over there and he is distraught. He gets heartbroken because its over someone she constantly kept telling him to not worry about. She cheats on him and leaves him. I'm there again to help him though it because its obvious this dude is in love with her. I as a best friend have to always be there for him. Around this time, i get my own girlfriend. My best friend and her get close and talk about his problems and what he feels. He's not one to really open up much to ANYONE. So for him to slightly open up to her caught me by surprise. She comforts him and tells him to look elsewhere, she's not worth the hassle. He says shes right and \"moves on\"\n\nJr year. She comes back, and he says its for good. Their rough patch has ended and its all going good. Im skeptical at the time, but whatever. Im his best friend i gotta be there and support him. My girlfriend with all the knowledge she has of this girl, does not like her whatsoever. I explain to her that you're my girlfriend, we're obviously going to have to deal with her so to at least TRY to be social. We go out to eat one day and they both meet. Its decent, they talk about school and whatnot and what their plans are. After we go our separate ways, my girl says that she will give her once chance. Clean Slate, she better not fuck this up. Obviously she does. Splits again after like 2-3 months around summertime.\n\n\n\nSenior year. . We told him, block her everywhere, FB, phone number, Email, everything. He said he did. We're proud of him, like finally you're moving on from this succubus. One day he tells me he's been talking to her. Im not one to hide emotions well, i give him the dumbest look like, are you fucking serious? He says, yea i just wanted to check up on how shes doing in school blah blah blah. I guess man, we told you to forget about her and move on. \"i know but its hard man\" No the fuck its not. But whatever. Turns out she invited him to her graduation, and he didn't want to go alone. I go also, cause he doesn't want to be alone. Graduation is fine, we take pics, me and him go back to our hotel and get ready to go barhopping with her and her friends/family. We get drunk and i tell her, yo i never liked you, this is your last chance. Dont fuck it up. She says she wont. Cool.\n\n1 year later. He's in my room and were chilling, and he tells me that shes pregnant. I turn around like dude wtf did you do? He chokes up and says its not his. First time i hear him like that. Fast foward a month or 2 later. He says she has a appointment to abort it. She doesn't go. He gets heart broken again. Im beyond pissed at this point, at both him and her. My girlfriend and me have kept telling him, shes not worth it.\n\nIm hoping her having the kid makes him realize she aint worth it. She did this to him, he's done. Nope. There he goes, back chasing her. Now this time they go everywhere together. Shes all in love with him. Im just annoyed and sickend how he can be okay with all this. He tries to tell me its foreal this time, it going to stay this way. I just blow it off. I try to change the subject everytime shes involved.\n\nI just want to know if im a ass hole for not wanting to even accept her after all this? Like, i consider this guy my brother, id do anything for him. But when it comes to her... idk. This is on a throwaway account, and i changed some stuff up in case she or a friend stumble across this. Im sorry if its long.",

      "description": "So this happened a couple of days ago as I was getting on a train. \n\nI had just stepped on to the train and pretty much that moment, the doors had begun to beep as they were about to close. As you would expect, I didn't pay much attention to this. \n\nJust then, I  realised that a lady, who I presume was at least partially blind due to a white cane, had gotten out of her seat and was heading towards the exit with the assistance of a member of staff, who had gotten on the train when I did. \n\nWithout really thinking, I placed my foot in the way of the doors. They opened and closed on my foot a few times before remaining open, allowing the lady and her helper to leave. All I can presume is that the sensors in the door tripped a switch the same way the emergency door release handle was. \n\nThis resulted in a 10-15 minute delay for the guard to work out how to reset the door, I'm guessing pissing off 100 or so commuters.\n\nI don't know if I'm an asshole or not, because I was meaning to do the right thing, but then the lady could have just gotten off at the next stop and gotten the train back, meaning that I delayed everyone for no reason. Who knows? \n\nWell hopefully you do, so AITA?\n\nTldr: Caused a train to be delayed because I stuck my foot out for a blind person. ",

      "description": "The office where I work is about 1 mile from Jimmy Johns and it's one of the only places that delivers small orders. I order from them for lunch at least once a week and place the order online. My order usually comes to about $6 - $7. During the checkout process there is a prompt to add a tip and it automatically calculates 15%, 20%, or 25%. I always select 20% then checkout. The tip is about $1.70 - $1.95. There's also a $2 delivery fee but I know that at most places this doesn't go to the driver. I thought it was fine since the company doesn't have a delivery order minimum and it's 20% but a coworker lectured me today when I placed my order saying the percentage doesn't matter and I should tip a minimum $4 for a delivery. \n\nAre they right? Even though my order is at most $7 and they are delivering less than 1 mile should I be tipping a minimum $4 or is 20% enough even if it's $2 or less? I'm open to responses and opinions here. I always tip at least 20 - 25% when I go out but if I'm in the wrong here I want to know. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "Some backstory:\n\nAbout 3 and a half years one of my closest friends came forward and says that she was repeatedly sexually abused by another one of my friends. When this came out I of course believed her and tried to help her through it. Of course I don’t mean to make excuses for her abuser and it was abhorrent what she did, but it should be noted that she was severely mentally ill, suffering from disassociation, mania and depression among other things. My friend to this day still claims to suffer from the trauma of the events. As a result it was argued by some at the time that she was not as culpable for her actions. At the time I disagreed with this and besides she denied what she had done and didn’t seem to hold much remorse.\n\nFast forward to now, this girl has become seemingly quite a lot more mentally healthy and has been with a therapist since that time. She has changed, at least from what I can see, into a different, far better person. I truly believe she has changed.\n\nI have started talking to this girl and believe there may be some romantic possibilities for us, however I am aware that this would be detrimental for my friend who was abused who I still care about a lot and who has a great deal of trust in me. As a result I’m trying to make sure she would never find out and so my relationship would never affect her. However, her boyfriend who is also my friend knows and this has created a situation of having to keep this from her because he knows the revelation would cause a lot of emotion damage.\n\nSo AITA for trying to date my friends past abuser if I truly believe she has changed. And if I will do everything it takes to prevent it from hurting my friend who was abused.",

      "description": "I am the head of a university club. I'm going to be very vague to remain anonymous, but this club's single purpose is to attend a very specific type of conference, wherein you dress in fancy attire and debate certain topics in a certain way. It's nerdy, but I enjoy it.\n\nIn pursuit of this, the club ends up staying in fancy hotels. We get funding from the university for these trips, and club members were very explicit in wanting to sleep in the same building as the conference (its a conference center and hotel).\n\nThis is my first time heading this type of operation, but I've attended many of these conferences as a club member, so I am at least somewhat experienced with how they should run.\n\nTo begin this story, the situation developed with a very specific group of 4 girls. They are all in similar programs, and get along with each other very well. I've known them for years through the club. Not really as friends, but as acquaintances. They are all very intelligent, and very good at this conference type of thing. Some won awards in previous years.\n\nThe conference starts on Friday morning, and runs through till Sunday afternoon. We all have to make a ferry trip to get to the conference.\n\nDue to my own budgetary fudge-up about a week ago, I had to re-book the rooms to a two night stay, where initially I had promised a three night one.\n\nThis group of 4 decided to travel over on Thursday, and find their own accommodations. No problems there, but it was a clue of what their intentions were for the weekend.\n\nWhen Friday morning rolled around, only one of the four showed up for the opening ceremony. The ceremony that is supposed to set the scene of the conference.\n\nThe others promised they were on their way, and would only be a couple minutes.\n\nThey instead went shopping and only arrived after the lunch break. They had missed the opening.\n\nThey attended the first part of the conference just fine. But trouble happened that night. University club policy is to reimburse club heads for any relevant purchases after the fact. So turn in receipts and get the money back a week later.\n\nI had a payment plan for the hotel. People pay $90 to me (the head honcho), and get $60 back from the university later (that's just how the university decided to fund us).\n\nAt this point, only 2 of 10 attendees had payed me.  I was furious. They had weeks to get me the money, and now they hadn't even bothered to bring it!\n\nIf I didn't collect the money, I wouldn't get reimbursed later by the university.  \nThis is a fancy hotel, with a fancy price tag that I have to pay come Sunday.\n\nThey wanted to e-transfer me the money. I said no and they of course ask why. I said there is an ATM downstairs, it's the same thing for them to pay in cash as it is to e-transfer me; but for me I get physical cash. I don't have to verify if they paid me or not, or wait 24 hours to see if the money goes through, or deal with bullshit \"I sent the e-transfer yesterday, didn't you get it?\".\n\nThey hated that I wanted cash. I think they were concerned I would do something fishy with the money, like claim they never paid and scrap their $60 refund.\n\nThey dragged their feet in paying me. But by the end of the conference I got everyone to pay up. I had to remind and bother them all weekend to do so though.\n\nThus ends Friday.\n\nMorning of Saturday: things went smooth. It was the best day of the conference. And also the cause of the problems for day 3.\n\nThe conference has a social event at a club on Saturday. I've no problem if people want to have fun after a long day of debate, but as my father has said \"if you want to fly with the owls at night, be ready to soar with the Eagles in the morning\". In my mind, you are at the conference to attend the conference. And I think these girls were here for the party.\n\nThey didn't even attend the conference on Sunday.\n\nI went to see them in the morning after the conference started.\n\nThey didn't answer the door. I left and came back some time later. This time they opened up.  \nThe room was a mess, checkout was soon, some still hadn't payed me.  \nI stormed into the room, some of them were still in bed.  \nI said I didn't care if they felt sick, that they were just hung over from their night out, and told them to get downstairs to the damn conference. Also to give me the money they owed.  \nI turned and left without really hearing what they had to say in return.\n\nI decided to just pay the hotel and told the girls they would eventually get kicked out. I wasn't going to wait around for them.\n\nAt this point I should mention that one of the girls is also a head for the club. And that she had agreed to pay part of the hotel to split costs and avoid stressing over a big ticket item like a multi-day hotel stay. She bailed out of that plan unexpectedly, claiming her card was locked by the bank, and she couldn't pay for anything. She somehow got the $90 to me later. Don't know how if her card was locked.\n\nThey stayed in bed late, one went to the pool and I happened to see her on the way out of the pool, she said she didn't feel well and the swim was to help her out.\n\nI went with her back to their room. One of them payed up the $90. But also claimed they were sick and weren't going to get out of bed, and that I was being very rude to them given how unwell they felt. I said I didn't care what they thought of me, we are here for the conference, so attend the conference.\n\nI left. They stayed.\n\nThis was the last I saw of them as a group. I haven't heard much from them since; they just wanted me to send them confirmation that I got their payments in writing. Which I did.\n\nThey didn't attend closing ceremonies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe club normally sends about 12 to 15 students to these conferences, and every year we get a group photo. This year, just me and my friend got in the photo, out of ten people that attended this year it was only us two that stuck around till the end.\n\nI know I could have handled things differently.  \nI could have gotten them to pay weeks ago rather than at the conference.  \nI could have done a better budget and not have screwed up the three night stay.  \nI could have explained to them my expectations for their behaviour rather than confronting them after the fact.\n\nAm I the asshole for being so harsh and rude to them under these circumstances?",

Today we were talking normally over text and she had this idea to class out friends in order of who we prefer most. I didn't want to do it at first cuz it felt childish to me, and might come back and bite me in the ass in the future, but I did it anyways and put her first (as she's my girlfriend and bestfriend). When her turn came she put a friend (also female) in front of me. I didn't know what to say, the only person i thought i'd be there first choice prefers someone else.\nWe had this long ass argument about it telling me that they had more fights than we did (we rarely have fights, and we get over most), and because they fought more she prefers her more (I found this argument really stupid).\n\nSo reddit, AITA being overdramatic over something normal, or do I have the right to be mad?",

      "description": "Sorry for the wall of text, tldr below.\n\n  \n\n\nI started a new job at a consultancy in spring last year, a month later coworker joined.\n\n  \n\n\nWe were put on the same project and we did have problems getting comfortable working with each other. I would call myself driven, trying to get the most out of everything I do, whereas he is more of a easy going dude, which led to some friction. Example: he would always come in late, always after 10am. One time our clients came to our office and we were supposed to demo something at 9am. The evening before we all went out for drinks and I reminded him multiple times that we had to be in the office \"early\". He showed up at 10:30am, no apologies, not even a message that he was gonna come in later. I took him aside and told him that I didn't appreciate this and that I felt let down as a team mate.\n\n  \n\n\nAbout a month before the project ended, the project lead moved away and even though the coworker has more work experience in general, I was made the new manager, since I was senior on the project and (in my opinion at least) have better communication skills. To clarify: I would only communicate with the clients and relay messages to the original lead, unless it was really urgent because of time difference.\n\n  \n\n\nThe last month was super stressful, the third guy on the project and me worked 10-12h a day for 3 weeks. Coworker did his usual hours as far as I could see.\n\n  \n\n\nOne time, I said to the third guy, I was gonna go home and continue working from home, since we had been in the office for 10h now. Coworker just got up and packed his stuff. I asked him, whether he would continue working from home too, he said no. I told him, that we weren't done yet, and needed to finish things and he just walked away while I was still talking to him. Okay, I thought, we're all a bit on edge for working so hard. He'll cool down.\n\n  \n\n\nThe next day, he sent an email to everyone on the team including the clients stating that he wasn't on the project anymore (he officially wasn't, but he was supposed to finish a couple of things) and that he doesn't want people to ask him about doing things anymore. I thought, alright we can probably manage the rest without him, so I sent him a message, thanking him for his continued work even though he wasn't officially on the project anymore and he answered me with something along the lines of \"I have asked our COO to never put me on a project with you again. You're a bully and I don't like you\" I asked him whether he wanted to talk about it and he never answered. For days I was wrecking my brain, trying to understand what happened, when it hit me, that he probably felt, I took his efforts for granted, even though he wasn't on the project and was doing us a favour. I sent him a really long email, apologising, that I didn't ask him about his feelings and his willingness and extent of his involvement sooner, but also reminded him that it wasn't me who made the decision he had to finish that thing and that I wished that he'd said something sooner, so we could've tried to find a solution that worked for everyone.\n\n  \n\n\nHe never answered.\n\n  \n\n\nSo I thought he probably needed some space, maybe he had personal issues he had to deal with etc.\n\n  \n\n\nIn the following months I tried to be polite and friendly without being too overbearing, asking him about his weekends and such, but he would always try to avoid conversation or flat out ignore me.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are about 50 people in our company, and we are encouraged to give feedback and deal with conflict immediately, without letting it fester. And management is really involved in the employees wellbeing. So I talked to our CEO about this situation (without naming names) and he suggested I try once more at the Christmas party to resolve the issue.\n\n  \n\n\nSo, the day before I told coworker I would like to have a chat about what had happened (this is about 3-4 months after the end of the project) and he answered \"not interested\" I asked if he is still adament of not working with me, he took a really long time and answered \"yes, for the same reason I don't like you. You are bullying me. You are always projecting your big fragile ego on other people. I have worked with people like you and I don't want to anymore. My advice to you is to stop projecting and build something for yourself for once.\"\n\n  \n\n\nI apologised that I have hurt him and asked him if he could tell me what I did to bully him, because I honestly didn't know and never intended to. No answer.\n\n  \n\n\nI have tried everything, reaching out, being nice, giving space, letting him vent, taking his abuse. But I am done. Our COO has already said, that this his behavior is not okay and him and our psychologist are going to talk to him, that he was jealous all those months ago because I got the project management gig and he didn't. That he says I bullied him and he's the victim here.\n\n  \n\n\nI said, if he came around I would still be willing to work with him, but I don't know if that's true anymore. I feel he crossed a line when refused to address this issue in person, but has no problems, dumping shit over me on slack dms.\n\n  \n\n\nI don't think he deserves more chances and he should be let go. Am I the asshole in this now? Should I be able to forgive and forget?\n\n  \n\n\nTldr: jealous coworker says I bully him and refuses to talk to me in person about issues, but insults me in private messages over slack. I want him gone, AITA?",

      "description": "Context: It was lunchtime at my HS when my friend, we'll call her Ant, tried to introduce me to the new kid. He had recently arrived here from the Philippines and didn't know english that well. We were sitting together, in an awkward silence when he said something in Tagalog that I didn't quite understand. I asked Ant to translate it, and his first words to me were \"Is he gay?\" At first I shook it off, and asked him (with the help of my translator) why he would think that, he didn't respond, just gave me a look as if to say, \"Isn't it obvious?\" Then, in an attempt to make sense of it, Ant began to explain EVERY reason why he might think that. The way i sat, the way I looked, my personality, and more. Admittedly, I was insecure about being considered masculine at the time, and each comment made me feel more and more effeminate. It didn't help that I liked Ant at the time. After our lunch period was over, while Ant wasn't paying attention, I told him how I felt in a way he could understand, I flipped him off, and never spoke to him again. It's been a year since then, and I still avoid the new kid like the plague, am I the asshole?",

      "description": " \n\nSo about 9 months ago I met this girl on Tinder. We chatted a while, then agreed to go out for a coffee, the date went quite well.\n\nAfter our 2nd date she told me that she does not think that she can get home anymore as we stayed quite late and her home was quite far, i did offer to call her a cab and pay for it, however she suggested she spend the night at my place. of course i jumped on the opportunity and she was also quite aware of my intentions. Needless to say we get back to my place, do the deed etc.\n\nNow the following morning as I am taking her to her place i realize that we should probably have a talk to see where we stand (mind you at this time i was fairly convinced i did not want a relationship and was mostly looking for a fwb), after talking on this matter for a bit she told me that she has a huge crush on a friend of hers and is not considering dating anyone except him, at this point she is the one that suggest the fwb arrangement. Perfect right?\n\nAnd about 6 months pass with her crashing at my place every Friday night, all the while i got that feeling that she was getting more and more attached to me, but almost every time she kept talking about this other guy he liked and she also had an ex of hers over at her place for a week (she admitted sleeping with him a few times during this period). But still one night when she seemed way happier that usual i decided to ask her if she is starting to have feeling for me, she said \"No\".\n\nThe reason I wanted to know if she started to have feeling for me was that i was getting very tired due to having more and more responsibilities at work and even having to do overtime, as such spending every Friday with her, while enjoyable , was starting to wear me down.\n\nThe next 3 Fridays i had to call off our \"date\" night as I was swamped with work and i genuinely felt bad for constantly bailing on her and so i decided that it's better to just end our fwb arrangement, worth noting is that this hectic period would last for at least a few more months.\n\nNow this part I will admit i was a dumb shit, I call her and tell her that I met a new girl at work that I am attracted to and in order to pursue her i believe we should stop seeing each other (the reason I did this is that i had a strong hunch that if i did not say something around this line she would've said something around the lines of \"we'll make it work\").\n\nAt first she seemed to be ok.\n\nNow a few days pass since I 'broke' up with her and she messages me \"that was a really shitty way to break up with your girlfriend and that I am a jerk for toying with her feelings\" , apparently she somehow thought we were in a relationship not a fwb type deal, note that in the past she referred to us as fwb, she constantly reminded me of the guy she likes so i never tried to think of her as my girlfriend due to this.\n\nPS: English is not my native language so there might some some mistakes here and there.",

      "description": "To start off, it is finals season and I had two major exams yesterday. I haven’t had any time of relax lately because of final projects, papers and presentations all adding up for the last couple of weeks. \n\nThis morning I woke up feeling run down and mentally exhausted. I let my mom know how I’m feeling. Some guy comes to fix something in the house and my dogs go nuts every time someone comes over, so I had to try and keep them quiet so my mom could talk to him. This wastes my entire morning because I couldn’t leave the room to go shower or eat without my dogs destroying the door. \n\nFinally, when the guy leaves I’m able to go to the kitchen to make food. I’m on a diet so I weigh out all my stuff and get it cooking. Then my mom asks me to triple it and make it for dinner. I tell her that everything is already half way cooked and I don’t have the energy to make it again for everyone plus a separate dinner for myself because I don’t want to eat the same thing, so I offered to make something simpler for dinner.\n\nShe said it’s not fair I get a nice lunch and they don’t get to eat that too. I said they have the option to, I just don’t wanna make it for them. This blows up and I get frustrated and start crying. \n\nLater on my mom keeps talking to my dogs telling them not to be scared of me and I ask why they would be scared and she says because  I’m being an incredibly negative person. This was hours after the incident and I was minding my own business in my room the rest of the day. \n\nThen when my family guys home, I heard her talking to them saying just because I feel bad doesn’t mean I can be cruel and abusive. \n\nSo was that cruel, AITA? I feel like I didn’t even really do anything. \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA For Not Letting My Girlfriend Pop Pimples",
      "description": "Some background - my GF (23F) and I (26M) have been together for almost five years, had our ups and downs but have been really happy lately and marriage is becoming a thing that we both know we want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's always been one to want to pop any pimples or zits (as well as pull any stray \"thick\" hairs I might have) I had on my face, chest, back, etc. I have always disliked it and never liked when she did it because A) it usually makes it looks worse, B) takes longer to go away, and C) its painful and irritates me and makes me angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this time I have dealt with it because I love her and she enjoys it and finds it \"satisfying\", despite how much I really don't like it and wish she wouldn't pop them. It is even sometimes to where after we have sex, she'll come back and say stuff like \"I felt a ripe one on your back let me get it!\"  So even though I dislike it and she knows I don't like it, I have let her do it all this time because it was just one pimple or zit here and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow over the past few weeks things have changed. I've started taking a new medication that is causing pretty bad breakouts on my back and shoulders. At first I was letting her pop some of the pimples but the breakouts got to a point where they are getting to where I am bothered by how bad they are and am trying different things to lessen the severity of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I am trying to get these breakouts under control I've decided that I don't want her to pop them any longer. Not to punish her, (which she says it feels like I am doing) but because I really don't think her popping them all is doing me any good. It's my body I should get to decide whether or not she can pop them and if I want to deal with the pain and discomfort that comes with the popping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe acts as if I am taking something away from her. It is a compulsive, almost OCD type thing with her where she REALLY wants to pop all of the pimples on my back and when I tell her no, for the aforementioned reasons, she gets offended and angry and pissed off at me. We ended up getting in a huge fight over this all because I told her I didn't want her to pop my pimples anymore. She claims that all relationships have sacrifices and this is something I should sacrifice for her because she enjoys it. She says it isn't her fault that I am breaking out, but it is because of my medicine, which is true. But I still don't think popping them and leaving red scabs on the top of every pimple/zit/blackhead that appears is making it any better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand it is a compulsion for her and I used to let her do it, but I am at the point where I really don't want to put up with it anymore and am putting my foot down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA for telling my GF that I don't want her to pop my pimples anymore, even though it was something I used to let her do?",

      "description": "A little bit on context for this. My ex and I had dated for 2 and a half years, and for the half we were engaged. \n\nAround the beginning of August we discussed have an open (polyamorous) relationship, which I agreed to a certain extent. I only wanted us to go on dates with other people and nothing outside of that (sexual) for the time being. We both ended up going on a couple dates with friends we had and she asked if she could use tinder for it. I reiterated that it be purely for just dates and nothing sexual. \n\nA few days after she made her profile, she had set up a date with this guy and he came over to our apartment to watch some t.v. while I went out and did our laundry. Usually doing all of our laundry takes about 4~ hours to complete, but we had a super light load and it ended up only taking a little under 2.\n\nI headed back and somewhat to my surprise I walk into our place and she had her shirt was off and it was obvious they were making out and possibly doing something more sexual (not full on but leading up to it). I stormed out in a huge fit of rage, and took a drive to calm down. \n\nWhen I returned, I talked with my fiancé and said that it was excepted something like this would happen with an open relationship and that I wasn’t mad at her. \n\nThen a couple weeks after that she broke up with me for “somewhat unrelated” reasons. After a solid month of thinking I promised her that I would still talk to her regularly and not ghost her. \n\nShe ended up moving back in with her parents (who live around 1000 miles away in a completely different state) and we talked a few times every week just to keep up with each other’s lives. \n\nBut a couple days ago I decided it was exhausting to keep in contact with her and completely blocked her number, and have avoided any contact whatsoever. Does this make me an asshole even though I promised to stay best friends with her?\n\nTL;DR I forgave my Fiancé for somewhat cheating on me. She broke up with me. I promised to stay good friends with her. I blocked her number and won’t accept any contact with her now",

      "description": "I have a coworker who has very poor social awareness. He's 23, but it seems like he's mentally much younger than that. Any time he gets involved in a conversation, he brings up details that are completely unrelated to what the conversation is about and also way too personal. Some examples; his sexual fetishes, his ex-wife's poor hygiene/grooming habits, abusive things his ex has said to him/his daughter, details about the custody battle he is currently going through, vaguely racist comments, racist/perverted/inappropriate things his ex has said, how he thinks he should \"try being gay\", how his daughter is the only thing keeping him from giving up, etc. The custody battle is pretty sad and it sounds like him and his wife are both being extremely petty, but it also seems like he really cares about his daughter. I end up working with him in a 1 on 1 setting pretty often and I've gotten to a point where I don't even respond to what he says and I just let him talk.  I don't know how to respond to most of the things he says. A few of us have talked to him about how he gets too personal and that he should go to a counselor if he needs to talk about what's going on, but I don't think he understood that we were being serious. \n\nSomeone told me that he probably just needs to vent and I shouldn't ignore him when I was talking about how I've been responding lately. I think that I have listened to him/tried to communicate, it's not appropriate for him to act how he does, and if I respond positively I will be enabling him. Am I an asshole for ignoring what he says?",

      "title": "AITA Hitting a man back when I thought he hit me",
      "description": "A few years ago I was drunkenly walking through a busy, affluent town with a friend. We both had an excessive amount of liquor to drink. We drank a lot at his place, and around 1-1:30am, walked the 10minute walk to town to see the scene at the local bars and check em out and drink a lil bit more. It was a fun night overall up til this point. We were shooting the shit and enjoying each other's company, enjoying intellectual conversation as well as pretty silly dumb conversation. The drunken walk there was front-loaded with lots of walking, then we entered the busier, partier, college-partier side of town...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically all I remember was as we approached one of the livelier bars, there was a group of three guys exiting. So here's what I remember happening: one of the guys closest to me punches me in the face... it wasn't hard, but enough for me to be shook up and react. So, he keeps walking on with his buds. I basically look back and decide: should I retaliate or should I ignore? I retaliate. I go up to him, throw him to the ground (he was bigger than me for sure) and I basically stomp on his face with my foot three times and there's blood. His friend comes up and says \"why are you hitting my friend?!\" I reply \"he hit me first!!\" and then I realize that I'm in the middle of the street and I'm pretty much bloodying this guy up and he is unable to defend himself and was probably just a drunk dumbass and I feel vulnerable so I leave immediately. I notice cops rolled up and there's a commotion, but I'm out of there pretty soon after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back, I can't tell if the guy actually meant to smack me in the face with a closed fist, or whether he inadvertently smacked me. I felt my reaction was definitely strong compared to what I was dealt, however I did feel the desire to \"not let him get away with it\" so that's why I reacted. The guy was bigger than me and I felt like he could pick on others if he got away with it. Looking back, reflecting more... it could have all been a misunderstanding...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I tell this story to friends the reaction is usually hugely negative against me. Mind you, most of my friends are hippie dippy types who believe in all sorts of moral superiority and I don't know if they represent the population accurately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I come to you, AITA... obviously this wasn't a good situation, and I'm perplexed, why do many people think IATA in this situation when I tell the story... Based on my post, do you think IATA? I've been called a psychopath for this story... is this justified? Thanks.",

One time she threw out a bag of six wireless surveillance cameras and accessories. Another time she through out a rare book of mine that was on a bookshelf and that I had saved for over 35 years because \"it was old.\" \n\nLast week I came home and she surprised me by \"cleaning\" my office. She took out my bookcases, laser printer, mailing scale, and other stuff that I had set up. She put everything in my daughter's room (she's at college) and in the hallway. It's all in boxes, bags, bins, or just on the floor. \n\nI thanked her for the thought, but asked her again not to do this. Last night it came up again, because she expects me to thank her for doing it, and because she \"cleaned\" the kitchen by spreading everything all over the dining room. I got angry and told her not to touch my stuff. \n\nSo today, she \"fixed it\" and piled everything back into my office, leaving a huge mess.\n\nAITA?\n\ntldr; My wife won't leave my stuff alone, and wants me to be happy when she makes a mess.

      "description": "\nI realize that the title of this seems pretty straightforward that I would be the asshole and maybe I am but I am hoping to see what some of you think given the situation below. \n\nI have 3 boys ages 4,4, and 1 and they are central in my life along with my wife. For example in the last year I went golfing 4 times with friends of mine and I went to a couple bon fires for drinks on two occasions and that is the extent of leisure time away from my wife and kids. I'm not that guy that is more concerned with my social life outside of my family. I do everything I can to worry about them first and I just try to be as selfless as possible. With that said, I feel myself failing in other ways which ultimately makes me nervous that I will fail in the examples that I want my kids to see. I am generally lazy for the most part. I mean, I keep my lawn cut and tidy but I don’t have a lot of ambition to do much else. Like putting up Christmas lights is a big ask for me for example or finishing a room in our basement you can just forget about that. I am out of shape and gaining weight as the stress of parenting picks up. \n\nAnyway, I want to be a better person and I want to change my life so that I am a better husband and father. That is where this Peru trip comes in. My cousin asked me if I would be interested in traveling to Peru and seeing Machu Picchu. That place is in the top 10 places I would like to see before I die but my wife simply has no interest in going there. So, I asked her and she laughed at me at first until she realized I was serious and then she got mad. She views it as a vacation and I view it more like a starting point on my journey to be a better person. After all, I would have to get into better shape in order to climb up the mountain to see it so it would take months of exercise for me to get to that point. Not to mention, I don’t really have any friends that I do anything with and I see a trip like that as a healthy thing. Money really isn’t much of an issue. \n\nOn top of that all, I think I am depressed which doesn’t really make sense because I have 3 amazing kids and an amazing wife but It just feels like I am in a rut. I know it sounds crazy that the way I am wanting to fix that is flying off to Peru to climb in the mountains but the chance presented itself and generally speaking the mantra I live by is that things happen for a reason. The more I think about a trip like this the more I think it could be a really good thing for not just me but my kids and wife as well. Almost like a therapeutic journey. I want to be an example for my kids to look up to and revere and I want my wife to be proud that she is married to me. Currently, I am not so sure I am totally succeeding in that goal.  \n\nSo WIBTA if I took a trip like this in an attempt to change my life for the betterment of my family? Would it change if the trip was to somewhere much closer by? Or Is just taking a trip like that period too selfish of a thing to do and I should look for other ways to better myself instead of leaving my poor wife for a week with three kids to take care of?\n\nThanks everyone!\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my parents to leave my aunt (40s) and her 3 kids (5, 8, and 17) behind?",
      "description": "My aunt and her kids moved in with my family 5 years ago because my aunt dug herself into a hole for the entirety of her adult life. She had 3 kids from 3 different men, but she has never had the financial means to support them.  \n  \nAunt has been in college since she moved in and now has a STEM degree. She was offered a full-time job exiting college. She makes average money, but there is a lot of upward mobility in her job (think: reaching a salary of $100k+ by her retirement). It’s enough to live on, but it’s not a comfortable income like my parents have supported her with.  \n  \nI’m also in college, graduating in 4 months, and entering a grad program in August. Parents told me 7 months ago that they can’t support my expenses anymore. I picked up a job on top of my schooling and started paying my own rent and daily expenses (so about 70% independent). They covered family plans that aren’t easily divvied up per person (think: family insurance plan).  \n  \nAunt, her 3 kids, parents, and my brother live in the same rented house. Parents prepaid their rent up until this August. I live in my college town. Dad mentioned plans to move (just parents and brother) closer to me so I could move in and consolidate expenses. He was hoping to give aunt time to live in their current house for a few months rent-free to give her time to figure out how to support herself independently.  \n  \nParents and brother are being driven crazy by aunt and her kids, as they have no consideration for others and the kids have not been taught the word “no”. Dad was diagnosed with depression, brother is showing serious signs of it. I was very happy to hear that they were moving out, especially because I’m entering grad school and I won’t have any time to work. This means I need a place to stay rent-free, otherwise my parents will have to foot the bill for my rent, which they said they can’t do.  \n  \nNow, parents are saying that aunt can’t live on her own with her salary. They’re saying if they left, they would have to keep supporting her anyway. I did some crude calculations, wildly overestimating expenses (think: spending $500 a *month* on car insurance, spending $1000 a month on food groceries, etc.) and underestimating her paychecks. With this, her income is almost enough to cover everything, but she obviously wouldn’t be able to save money. I told parents that if she spent money like a normal person (aka, with a budget) she would totally be able to afford it while also putting money in savings.  \n  \nParents won’t listen to me, saying that she doesn’t earn a livable wage. I firmly disagree, I just think they’ve been accustomed to an easy lifestyle where they can afford what they want. I overestimated expenses in my calculations because they resemble my family’s current level of expenses now. They spend hundreds of dollars a week on groceries, they eat fast food/delivery multiple times a week, etc.  \n  \nI’m pissed because my family is suffering both mentally and financially, and parents care more about fixing my aunt’s mistakes than helping me get my education. I want them to just let my aunt figure it out on her own now. They helped her for over 5 years, she has her degree, and she has a place to live for free for another 6 months.  \n  \n*TLDR: My aunt has messed up her life and my parents have been supporting her and her kids for 5 years while she fixes it. My immediate family’s wellbeing is now being left on the back burner while we support her indefinitely on an “unlivable” (re: totally livable) wage.*  \n  \n**AITA for wanting them to move up with me and let aunt stay there with her “unlivable” wage?**",

      "description": "Recently in a local women's Facebook group I'm in some screenshots of a conversation between a girl in the group and my boyfriend's best friend where posted. The screenshots showed they were having a casual conversation and then he came of really strong and started to insult her when she said he was making her uncomfortable. In the comments multiple other women said they'd had the same experience with him. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating a little over two years, we hang out with his best friend regularly, and I have never seen him act in any way disrespectful towards a woman. I was shocked and disgusted by the screenshots and showed them to my boyfriend asking if he knew his best friend was acting this way. He said he had no idea and became very upset reading over the screenshots. \n\nOver the last few days he has been very cold towards me. When I asked him what was up he said that he resented me for ruining his friendship with his best friend by showing him the screenshots. He says that he doesn't want to know how his friends are being shitty and wished that I had never shown him the screenshots. He's asked for me to give him a week to \"think about our relationship\".\n\nI am so confused, am I the asshole for tainting the idea he had of his best friend by showing him those screenshots? ",

      "description": "This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I’m honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I’m scared shitless. \n\nBasically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. \n\nWe were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it’s about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I’m so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn’t long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. \n\nParents are furious with me and obviously it’s gone up the chain. I’m hoping to god I can chalk this up to my inexperience and I’m not fired buf when I had a 6’4” dad screaming in my face that he’s going to get my fired...I’m scared. \n\nAm I the asshole for allowing this?",

      "description": "This one's kinda hard to write about, but after writing literal walls of text, I'm gonna go with the KISS approach. \n\n\nMy father is a functioning alcoholic, he has abused both my brother and I emotionally on many occasions, and on a few has gotten physical. All of this started after his brother (my uncle) had been murdered, and my mother divorced him. \n\n\nWe had visitation on weekends, ect ect, which is when this abuse took place. Years later, I'm in college, paying my own car insurance, working a part time job, and... Paying for his phone bill, on my credit card. This is what prompted me to cut contact with him. \nHe had promised to give me money to cover the phone bill, but was late on several occasions, and even missed payment on two months. I had been patient, asking relatively infrequently because I was concerned about being annoying about it. Naturally, nothing came of it, and I eventually became late on my credit card payments. I simply couldn't pay that much while working a part time job. \n\n\n\nEventually, I came to a point in the semester where I had to buy materials to complete a lab. While I was given several week's notice about the date, I will admit that I waited too long. I put in an order for my lab supplies on Amazon less than a week in advance, only for a day later to learn that my card had bounced because I'd hit $400 of my $500 limit thanks to the phone bill not having been paid to me for the second month in a row. I was unable to order what I needed, which meant my marks would suffer. I spent the rest of the week worried about it, and when my professor wouldn't give me an extension, I snapped. \n\n\n\nYears of pent up aggression and anger somehow surfaced, and the first thing I did was call him on the phone, yelling. I don't recall exactly what I said, but it wasn't pleasant. It ended in being told that he didn't want to speak to me for a month, and that I should \"just cancel the fucking phone then\". \n\n\nSo I did. This happened in September, and I'm still not talking to him. However this evening he left a voice mail inviting me to go to the Bike Show near where we live. I know it's an attempt to reconcile, but I'm unsure of how to proceed. It's extremely nerve racking for me, and it's left me doubting myself if I've even done the right thing at all. I've cut off contact over more than just the phone bill, but I'm worried that's all he sees.\n\n\n\nI'm willing to explain more about my history with him if it'll help explain things, if my quick explanation isn't enough",

      "description": "(First time reddit poster here so I apologize in advance for potential awkwardness lol)\n\nNgl, validation would be nice, but I need an honest answer to clear up some confusion and hopefully fix some of my issues.  Basically, I got into a huge argument on discord with a few friends about respecting the server owner’s (SO) authority.  I admitted what I did wrong and cleared the original issue up with SO.  There were a lot of other people involved who, in my opinion, really didn’t need to be involved—they’re the ones I’ve got an issue with.\n\nOne of them (M) kept calling me “disrespectful” and “condescending”.  (To be fair, I am those things.)  I asked if I could just talk to SO privately because me and M have a history of getting into arguments.  SO didn’t want to.  M and I proceeded to fight.  She accused me of being a disrespectful asshole, which I admitted I was and apologized for.  M kept butting into my and SO’s conversation to remind me of what an awful person I am.  I told her that she should admit that she’s also an asshole.\n\nLater, after the issue had been cleared, I DMed SO and told him that M being there really didn’t help the situation, and we could’ve cleared it up easier by ourselves.  SO must’ve told M about that, and M told her girlfriend (GF) everything, who proceeded to DM me and ask wtf was wrong with me.  By that point I was sick of fighting and told her to leave me alone.  She kept messaging me about how entitled, disrespectful, and condescending I was, how everyone agrees with her, and generally being a dick.  I responded in kind and told GF that M was biased, she was biased, and none of them will ever listen to my opinion because they’ve already decided that I’M the only asshole here.\n\nThis wasn’t a great summary but from what I’ve written, how much of an asshole am I and how much of an asshole are they?\n\nTL;DR I admit I’m kind of a terrible person and ask my friends to admit to their flaws, which they don’t.  Issue is that I don’t know how many flaws are really there and how many are my imagination.",

      "description": "I had been in a mostly happy relationship with my bf for over a year, however in the past few weeks I began to get feelings of resentment and felt overall dissatisfied with how our relationship was. He still lives at home, but the problem is more that he relies on his mum to take care of his every need. He is incredibly messy and will leave his room to get horrible until his mum inevitably cleans it for him. I need to move to a new city next year for university and recently it truly hit me that I did not want to live with him if he could not look after himself. Not only that, but I want to move earlier than planned (something he cannot do) as I am missing my friends who have already moved. The last thing is our different values in life, I value my education and will be working crazy hard for the next 7 years to get my medical degree. He is also working towards a trade certificate but values pretty much anything else above it. He always expects me to have a tonne of free time to spend with him, but that just won’t be the reality for the next part of my life.  Realising all this made me so angry at him for weeks, I would snap at every little thing he did, it was horrible and I hated myself for doing it. I knew I was being unfair acting like this towards him. And when he would ask me what’s wrong I would say nothing was. Then on Monday I broke up with him, he was extremely upset and said that this had all come out the blue and I should have talked to him about these issues earlier so we could work towards fixing them. I didn’t want to fix the relationship, I feel like I had already checked out and was ready to end things. Was I wrong to not give him warning that I was unhappy? In my mind it was pointless to tell him any earlier and upset him when I didn’t believe the relationship could be fixed. \n\nTl;dr I broke up with my boyfriend after realising our personalities and life goals were incompatible long term. I gave him no warning that there was something wrong before the moment I broke up with him. ",

I'm moving into a new apartment in Feb and I'm unsure if I can do that now. \n\nIf I quit, she will not have someone to take over my position while she is traveling.

      "description": "So before we start sorry for any formatting since I’m on mobile. \n\nMe and my girlfriend have been dating for nearly 6 months and today we got into a big argument because I haven’t posted a photo of us together on my main account. I haven’t done so deliberately as I rarely ever post on there in general (only posted twice in the last year one was of my high school graduation almost a year ago and then a picture of me and my little brother next to a Christmas tree a few months ago). She had made a post about me on my birthday and while I thought it was sweet I didn’t think it was necessary. When her birthday came around I posted on my Instagram story a birthday message for her for the world to see saying that I love her, so it’s not like I’ve been trying to hide the fact we’re in a relationship. \n\nShe confronted me today asking why it is that I haven’t posted a picture with us and I told her that I hadn’t really gotten around to it since it doesn’t seem like a big deal to me. I also told her that I’ve never really been the type to post about my relationships all that much because I feel like my feed is about my life and any big events that occur, plus I have always believed that posting pictures dedicated to your SO come off as ingenious and in the event you break up they would have to be deleted anyways.\n\nShe then got upset and said that I’m very inconsiderate and that she doesn’t even want to take pictures with me anymore because “what’s the point.“ she also took down the post of me and her since she said “it doesn’t matter anyways right?” I personally think she is being really childish about the whole situation and I don’t get why it’s such a big deal. Can someone please tell me AITA. \n\nP.S please no r/niceguys in the comments",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriends brother generally get along very well. Ive been dating his sister for 7 months so we've seen eachother enough that i would call us friends.\n\nA little background, I am a money lender. I work with several other men who in addition to money lending with me are also involved in sports betting.\n\nOne of these men, we'll call him B, exclusively runs a sports book. Hes also not someone you want to stiff on a debt. \n\nWell my gfs brother comes to me one day and asks if I can take his football bets. I dont know anything about sports betting, I dont want to even try to learn as I dont want to step on B's toes, and I know money lending much better. I also dont want to be involved with my gfs brother financially.\n\nSo I direct him to B. I also tell him B is not someone who you should play around with. He thanks me, and thats the end of it.\n\nWelp, fast forward two months, and he is now indebted 15,000 dollars to B. 15 thousand fucking dollars. He apparently struggles with gambling which i was not aware of.\n\nFirst I am asked by my girlfriend if I could help pay the debt since I directed him to B. I refuse as im not about to pay for his mistakes. \n\nB, being B, is starting to pressure her brother to pay up. I know how B can be. I am asked by her brother to get B to lay off a bit. I really dont want to do this but I do so anyway. B is respectful to me but also says that he cant just forgive the debt. Plus he asks me why im interfering with his business when he leaves me be.\n\nThese are all valid points. Basically i made the decision to back off and let my gfs brother handle his own business. Both my gf and her brother are now upset with me, and the brother is even accussing me of conspiring to set him up by sending him to B when I knew his nature.\n\nI do offer to buy his car to give him some cash and he takes this as proof that im setting him up.

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nFor the last month, I have been training a new employee, who on her resume listed extensive work in the legal field and a stint in law school. \n\nWhen she got here, basically I had to teach her how to organize her notes and use a computer (I can’t count how many times she’s been locked out of her account...). Not only this, but she’ll ask a question that I KNOW we’ve covered and is in her notes, but when I’ll tell her to check her notes, she’ll just get stuck on one part of the page and it takes me having to point it out for her to get it. \n\nIt came to a head this last Friday. Our office closed early and I erroneously said on Thursday that we would leave at that time. Friday comes, I say, no, we need our boss’s approval to leave. She leaves at that time anyway, which I didn’t know until I looked for her and called her cell phone. She said I told her I could leave. I am positive I didn’t. This is too much trouble for a new temp, so I want to let her loose. \n\nThing is, it’s a week before Christmas. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so Im not 100% sure if this is the right place to do this but Ive seen some similar kind of stuff here so I decided to ask away, I mean who better to rant to than to people on the internet. Ill have a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nMy friend, who I’ll call Steve, set me up with a girl from one of his classes, I’ll call her Sam, in January. Well Sam and I hit it off and we started dating two weeks after he hooked us up together. Later on I learned that he set us up because she had a bad breakup with a cheating ex, but I didn’t mind. Steve was a good friend and I trusted him.\n\nNow going on an important little side note, at work some family friends that own some small businesses around the area asked if I had any friends that might want part time jobs, in which enters my friend “Alex”. He almost instantly agrees that Saturday morning (3/16) Well later on that night he texted me saying that “I screwed up. Im in too deep.” Thinking this was about the job interview I rushed asking “did you make me look bad” (as I didn’t want my reputation ruined with the family friends). A whole bunch of talking later I figure out it isn’t about the job, but he still wouldn’t tell me what it is. I laughed about it with Sam because she had joined the discord server I had with my friends and we all had conspiracies as to what he was “in too deep” for. \n\nNow here’s where the story all ties together. This morning (3/18) at 12:19 a.m he said he has something to confess. My girlfriend had apparently gone off with Alex into his private messaged and started texting him, both discord and normal phone messages. He said he felt super bad about it and that he thought it was a joke at first, but as he sent me the messages Sam sent him, such as “We can just fuck without it”, he said he knew it had gone too far. I assured him that I didn’t blame him, but that he was right to come to me. She had even mentioned breaking up with me to be with Alex.\n\nWell this afternoon, still 3/18, I called Steve and said I had a story that would piss him off. Ensue this whole long story again, and man I was right, he was pissed. During that time we planned that I would act all cool as if I knew nothing and we would have Alex take her out, and Steve and I would be there and act all surprised and I would dump her there. To be honest its pretty hard to deal with her right now knowing what I know. She always complained about her cheating ex and thats what she’s doing right now.\n\nTL;DR: After my girlfriend complained about her cheating ex shes started to become extremely flirty with a friend and talks about breaking up with me for him, and I planned a surprise breakup with my friend who set us up. \n\nAMIT for planning such an elaborate and rude break up that not only takes me and Alex away or should I just come clean, say I know, and break up with her?",

There's a girl (26F) who is generally an asshole, but was very close with this person.  Someone mentioned not going to work this afternoon to take time to rest, and she very nonchalantly said \"Yeah, just pull the dead friend card, lol\".  I said, \"Wow, kind of harsh, but okay.\"  She made a shocked face, since no one really calls her out on anything here, but no one said anything.  I guess I don't want to police this girl's grieving, but I think she's just being an edge-lord, and I know some people cope through humor, but I felt this comment was inappropriate and flippant.  The other students in the circle seemed uncomfortable at her words, as they were very close with this person as well and treated them with a TON of respect.  This is not the first \"off\" thing I've heard her say about this person since we got the news.

I ended up telling her that if she pursues a relationship with him then I am not comfortable leaving my daughter (3) with her. She argued back that she could arrange with him that he's not allowed to come around when he is babysitting, but given his past behavior I told her that I can't trust that. She basically made me feel like I'm taking her granddaughter away from her because I don't like her boyfriend.

      "description": "Bit of some background: future MIL was, and is, a stage 4 alcoholic. She goes through bouts of getting help and when she feels better, decides to stop treatment. Inevitably, she falls back into drinking. While sober, though I've never seen it, I'm told she's a wondeful person. Fun loving, responsible, cheerful, etc. When drinking... not so much.\n\nMy fiance has had to live with this his whole life and I feel for him. She truly is a manipulative cunt and I don't like seeing this woman use and abuse him. \n\nShe has insulted me to the point I will not have anything to do with her. Calling him on my birthday, during which I was hosting a party for myself with my aunt and uncle, and making snide remarks about my family being dead when he said he had no time to talk. My parents are gone, grandparents too, and the aunt who took me in after they all died had just passed the month prior.\n\nHe has distanced himself. We mutually agreed to disinvite her to Christmas. She has done nothing but be nasty to everyone, and throwing a tantrum. He proposed right before New Year's and she never even congratulated him.\n\nLast night, she texted him at 4 in the morning saying that since he was able to afford a $10,000 wedding(we have to take out a loan), she wants him to pay her back the $3,000 she put down for his college education. From over ten years ago. She had to sell her 'diamonds' for that. Mind you, he's paid for her treatment facility, housed her when the family dropped her on him in his 20s, sent her money for bills even when he knew it was for fucking booze. \n\nI don't want this woman in my life, in my future children's lives, at my wedding, or anything. I cannot imagine the burden she has been not only to my fiance, but his entire family. \n\nI don't like ultimatums, but I will refuse a traditional wedding and reception if she's to be there. I would gladly give up wearing my mother's dress and get hitched at the courthouse over having this toxic human being included in her son's big day. \n\nI don't think he will necessarily have a problem with it, as he has stated he's completely done with her at this point. But his family might. They've not given her a 'tough love' dose, rather they've essentially enabled her past the point of return and I fear his family may take it the wrong way if we do decide not to include her.\n\nSo, WIBTA?\n\nTldr: fiance's drunkard mother has ordered him to pay her back for his college tuition from over a decade ago because we're paying for our wedding. Never mind all the money he's sent her over the years or housing her for free in his 20s. She's already burnt any bridge she could have with me and I want to disinvite her from the wedding but his entire family may take offense to it. I will push for signing papers at the courthouse and have no ceremony if it is not possible.\n",

      "description": "Last night, my best friend (who is also my roommate, and we also work together) had her son visiting from literally the other side of the country. She told me that she was going out for dinner with him. I was happy for her (even though to be honest I kind of wanted to go out for dinner too) and said I would watch the dogs while they were gone.\n\nHer son came over to pick her up for dinner and greeted me and we chatted. After a while he then said \"Where would you guys like to go for dinner?\"\n\n I kind of hesitated because even though I wanted to go, I got the feeling that my best friend had been looking forward to having dinner with just her son as she hadn't seen him in 6 months. Also, she lives with me and now she works with me too, so I'm around like ALL the time.\n\n So I said, \"Oh, you guys should go out just you guys, and I'll look after the dogs, because you haven't seen each other in forever.\"\n\nMy best friend didn't jump in or anything, but her son said \"Oh, I've had 35 years to get to know her, you're welcome for dinner.\"\n\nI said \"Oh, that's nice, thank you!\" kind of reflexively. But then I noticed my friend was really quiet and not saying anything. So then after a bit, I said \"Actually, someone should stay and look after the dogs.\"\n\nThe son kind of got awkward and said \"Up to you.\"\n\nI said, also awkwardly, \"I think you should go out just the two of you, so then you can chat and catch up!\"\n\nThen the son said \"Okay, I'm sure we'll go out all together again and you can join us next time!\"\n\nI said \"Yeah that would be great!\"\n\nSo they went out for dinner and I looked after the dogs. But then they came back and were really quiet... Not really talking much. And the son was in the guest room and didn't talk to me at all.\n\nSo I'm wondering... Did I handle this wrong? I just wanted my friend to have a bit of a break from me and to enjoy some time with her son without me. But I think I may have insulted both of them and made them think I didn't want to go out with them. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, so earlier this week a guy I had been talking to on Tinder suggested we should meet up for a date. We had a good rapport going so I thought, \"Great!\" and we decided to meet up yesterday for brunch at a restaurant he suggested.\n\nNow, we live about an hour from each other. This may seem like a long distance to some, but we live in a rural state and it's really not that unusal for people to drive that far to hangout. Growing up all my friends that lived \"close\" to me were about a fifteen minute drive. It's just the way it is here.\n\nI bring this up because the restaurant we decided to meet up at was 45 minutes from the city he lived in and about 20 from the city I lived in. I offered to find somewhere that was a little closer to him, so the drive was more even, but again, living in a rural state means there aren't a lot options between cities to meet up. He confirmed he was cool with the drive and I thought since he suggested the restaurant all was okay.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. The plan was to meet for brunch at 11. Since it was my day off and I wanted to sleep in as much as possible (especially with the clocks going back an hour) I set my alarm for 9. I figured that was more then enough time to shower, get ready, etc. However, when I woke up I saw that we had gotten a snowstorm in the middle of the night. I took a quick look out my window and saw the roads hadn't been plowed yet.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not very diligent about looking at the weather. I know I should be better, especially since I live in a part of the country that can have pretty extreme weather, but for some reason I can never get into the habit of doing it. What can I say? I'm flawed.\n\nAnyways, I do a quick pro and con about whether I want to go out on the unplowed roads for a first date. And while I was excited to meet him, I decided it wasn't worth the extra hassle that driving in the snow would cause.\n\nI made this decision pretty quickly and as soon as I made it I sent him a text saying, \"Hey! So, the weather where I am isn't great. The roads haven't been plowed yet and I don't know when they will be, so can I take a raincheck on brunch? Maybe we can do itnext weekend instead?\" I sent this at 9:07am.\n\nAn hour goes by and I haven't heard from him. I'm debating texting him again because I don't want him to drive all the way to the restaurant (especially in the weather) just to think I stood him up. But i also don't want to seem obnoxious by double texting.\n\nHalf an hour later I get a text from him saying: \"Wow I don't know how your mother raised you but mine always taught me to stick to commitments. Flaking out last minute is incredibly rude. We live in [state name] and you aren't used to driving in the snow? Thats bullshit. Next time don't waste my time with fake excuses. You're not cute enough to string people along like this\"\n\nI was shocked. Now- I know what he said about me being \"not cute enough\" is overkill on his part. But AITA here for cancelling in the first place?",

      "description": "#IF YOU ARE EASILY TRIGGERED PLEASE READ THIS FULLY. I AM NOT ATTACK ANYONE AND I FULLY SUPPORT THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY!!!\n\n\nBackground: I grew up in a family where homosexuality was never discussed. I legitimately never had an idea that people thought saying “being gay is a choice” was a insult, nor have I ever said it. I never even really thought about it.\n\n\nNow I was on a thread on sub shitting on mom groups (I’m sure you can guess it). There was a post about Chuck Norris. Someone said that Chuck had thought being gay was a choice. I honestly had no idea what he was saying. I genuinely thought it was (WHICH I NO LONGER BELIEVE), so I responded: “It is a choice?? Right? I don’t mean to be rude” and a minute later it was downvoted to -3 so I added “Edit: 1 minute and it’s already downvoted I knew this would happen but I’m really just wondering”\n\nAgain I’m starting to think I said something wrong. Some people explain that I was wrong and I understand (special shout out to Flyingbangtan he was very sensible and explained it well). \n\nNow I’m at -40 or something so I post to r/explainmydownvotes because I mentioned multiple times that it was just a question and I didn’t want to offend or attack anyone and someone there said: “yeah, i'm reporting you for this. borderline homophobia. ignorant asshole”\n\nI responded with “I was asking a question I literally had no idea how am I the ignorant asshole when I can’t ask a question???”\n\nThey responded with “because your not using logic. being homosexual isn't a choice. you are BORN being homosexual”\n\nThat led me to post here, AITA?\n\n\n\n\n&gt;!Sort of relates: I’m still sort of new to reddit (1 year but I don’t have much experience) so I didn’t know edits about reacting to downvotes were bad (I’ve never been downvoted this hard before)!&lt;\n\n",

The next day on Monday I’ve been mourning since and stayed in bed all day. \n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been planning on going to a rave for New Years. We were both really looking forward to it for a long time because the lineup is really good, we wanted to dance our stress away, and of course to have another New Years kiss. We live about 30 minutes away from each other so I haven’t seen him for a few days. \n\nI decided the next day after her death on Monday, a few hours before the rave started that I was going to stay home. So he helped sell my ticket. But he still went to the rave. 30 minutes before he was about to leave, he messaged me and offered to stay the night with me. I didn’t respond because I didn’t believe the offer was genuine, especially offering last minute. \n\nIt’s Tuesday, New Years, and he messaged me this morning offering to come over. A part of me wants to see him, but I’m a bit upset about what he did. \n\nI admit on my part that I should have asked him to come over. But isn’t common courtesy to be there for someone when their loved one just died?\n\nIs my anger towards him justifiable, or should I be more forgiving? ",

I say that's not true, I just wanted to know my son's whereabouts. She just dismisses me. I tell her I have responsibilities. She repeats that I shouldn't have called her. That's when I walked away.

      "description": "Back when I started university in 2016, my mum brought up the topic on what I want to do for my birthday and graduation. Initially, I wanted to go to the USA for Vidcon but my folks said no cuz they want all of us to go to the USA together. So I had to find other options.\n\nHere’s the thing, whenever stuff like this happens, it's just a dumb excuse for us to travel and most of the time, my folks call the shots. Like they will approve on the trip and go head-on in booking if its a country **THEY WANT TO GO** and we just label it as “*my graduation/birthday trip*” (I swear, if I said Japan or Korea, we would have our tickets by this point).\n\nIn 2017, I had my eyes set on Iceland because of the landscape and LazyTown (thanks WANO memes). A solo/2 person trip with all expenses paid would total up to $6000 AUD (Cheap right?).\n\nAt first, they said no because they have no idea what Iceland is and think it's a waste of a travel ticket but said yes when their Facebook friends shared photos of their trip there and finally saw the appeal.\n\nWe then come to an agreement:\n\n* Have the money saved to pay for everything by the end of 2018\n* Graduate in 2019\n\nI hit both requirements and the trip soon evolved to \"Let's **ALL GO TO UK AND ICELAND**\".\n\nA lot of my plans for this trip has changed but for legit reasons. Initially, I wanted to go in February so it aligns with my birthday and I can go to an event called \"*Reykjavík Winter Lights Festival*\" which is similar to ‘*Vivid Sydney*’ + see the northern lights but my folks said \"NO\" because it needs to be in a school holiday and during the summer season because '*I will just complain about the cold*'\". I then said “*let's go during April so we can still see the lights and it's their Spring season + its school holidays*” and they also said \"NO\" because it may clash with my graduation ceremony (it didn't).\n\nIt HAD to be in July.\n\nI did everything I can to research for this trip and sent my findings to my folks but they're not doing anything about it. It came to the point where all the cheap accommodation is slowly being sold out and I'm just so stressed out that I lost motivation to look for tours because we have no place to stay.\n\nI addressed this to my folks and asked to reconsider just me travelling along and they were like “that's pretty selfish considering this trip is to celebrate your graduation”. Then they argued “but don't you have friends you want to meet in UK?”, “if you ditch the UK leg of the trip, you will regret it”, and “But if we came with you, we will give you more spending money” (which I question considering we’re currently renovating the house).\n\nI have back up money saved but that's for a rainy day and I fear that I will have to use all of my savings just for this one trip which could have been cheaper if I went on my own (plus it's still not enough to cover the expenses).\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

Was all the trouble I caused justified?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, for my APUSH class, my class made a group chat that had most everyone in it. Earlier today, someone asked if someone could send a picture of their completed assignment. Yknow. In normal group chat fashion. And a few popular guys in the chat were like \"no that's cheating\", \"do your own work that's not allowed\", \"this chat is for discussion\" and so on. \nSo a few people, myself included, were like \"??? It's a group chat for class everyone uses these to cheat\". I asked if they were serious and one guy said they were, so I sent \"Cheating &gt; \"Discussion\" all the way\" in a joking manner and one of the guys saved it. Now this guy, we'll call him Ryan, saves my chat and screenshots it and says that he's going to show it to our teacher so that she knows I'm a \"cheater\" and won't grade me easily because of my \"good student\" reputation. \nI got a little annoyed but didn't take it seriously. Until people started telling me that he was actually going to do it because he's done it before with others. Then I got really annoyed. I'll admit, I'm a nerd. I take being a teacher's pet a little too seriously. So I clearly didn't want my reputation put into question with teachers. \nNow, Ryan had recently been in a relationship with a friend of mine and had ended up cheating on her which made her end the relationship. Ironic, right? I sure thought so. So I said so- in the group chat. I said something along the lines of \"Funny that you think you've got any right to be mad about cheating, Ryan. You didn't seem to think it was so bad a few weeks ago.\" And I expected everyone to be on my side... except most people are saying that i was unnecessarily rude... I thought I was being funny and he was taking the cheating shit too seriously as a whole. Guess I was wrong.\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "description": "Obligatory wasn't recent but a year(ish) ago. There was this one kid at my high school who had a reputation of being a full ass canoe of douche. He had formerly been a friend of mine till I realized that he was just kind of an asshole. He had spread rumors about others, made jokes about one sophomore's dad being in the hospital and his mom not being around (we were seniors; class '18), tried to get the cops to crash small kickbacks we threw with other friends after we didn't invite him *because* of all the shit he did. He would use personal things people told him in confidence to fuck with them. That specifically is what sparked my fuckup. I was falsely accused of rape over the summer of my freshman year (the case was closed after she admitted that we had never even had sex - I was still a virgin but I'm not even going to get into that clusterfuck). Now, being the naive dumbfuck I used to be, I had told him at the time because I still trusted him. Big mistake. So, we're about halfway through our senior year and there is this girl who I was *really, really* into. You know those high school crushes where you don't even totally understand it and your brain is just like \"Holy fuck this person is amazing\"? That's the level it was at. What was insane about it is that I'm fairly certain she was into me as well. I used to have a lot of abandonment issues because one of my parents hasn't ever been in my life so I constantly second guess myself when it comes to that. But it was at a point where literally, multiple friends, my mom, and even hear dad pointed out that I was being a dumbass by not saying anything. I finally, after like 6 months of telling myself that everyone but me is wrong (like I said, am dumbfuck) I was just like fuckit, I'm doing it. I had a conversation with said brimming canoe of douche and he told me I should do it. What I **didn't** know was that immediately after, he went and told her and some of her friends about the rape accusation, but from what I was told, he left out the part about her admitting to the lie and the whole section concerning the police. Obviously the truth eventually came out eventually by my other, close friends who had supported me throughout the clusterfuck that was 2015 and early 2016. But the damage had already been done. She and I are still friends today, but the whole what could have been is gone. Back to the story though, when I found out about this - at school nonetheless - I took a nice little walk to my car grabbed a pocket knife I kept in the glovebox (I live adjacent to a big city and walking around at night gets to be dangerous occasionally) and long story short he had 2 flat tires and I just went home. AITA? \nOh and for reference, I was caught because campus security manage to remember my plates, but I did get off with like 25 hrs of community service and a misdemeanor and didn't have to pay anything because the dumbass and his family where super rude to both the DA and the detectives handling the case.",

      "description": "When I was in my first year of university, I was dating a 25 year old. I was very in love with him even though he was the textbook definition of a loser and treated me poorly. He was a pathological liar, a college drop out and lived at home with his parents. He actually told me he dropped out of the same university I was attending years earlier because of a heart condition, but eventually I found out in reality he attended a community college nearby, failed out, and continued to pretend to attend the university for 2 years after. He would \"study\" at the university library and go to fake classes. I would pay for everything. He lived in the city where I spent my summers, but during the school year I was 2 hours away in my university town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClues that he was cheating were everywhere. He asked me not to post any photos of him, even on Valentine's Day he was irate when he thought I took a snap of him claiming he was \"too insecure\" about the weight he had recently gained and did not want to be posted. My sister's boyfriend even saw him out on a date once and he sent me photos for proof, but my ex managed to convince me the girl was just some random friend from work and it's completely fine to go to lunch with coworkers during breaks and I was such a fucking psycho for accusing him of cheating. Lo and behold, I soon found out he had been DATING the girl in the pictures and he had been telling her I was his crazy ex that he still sometimes chilled with because he felt bad. I messaged her and warned her politely, then dumped him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a month: I'm in the city to visit my sister and party for a weekend. I convince my friends to go to a nightclub I know my ex frequents. Just as I expected, he's there along with his two hockey douchebag best friends that are closer to my age and quite good looking. My ex begins freaking out that I'm there, yelling petty nonsense at my girlfriends who I was with, who happened to be (or were) our mutual friends screeching they should have chosen his side etc. The drama eventually subsides, and an hour later I run into one of his best friends (HF) getting drinks and I ask him if he wants to go for a smoke. I'll spare you of all the details, but it was surprisingly easy to make him want to go home with me and that's exactly what we did. At about 3am, HF starts getting a ton of texts from my ex: \"someone said they saw you get into a cab with OP. HF I know you would never, I but know I would KILL you if you did.\" HF and my ex even had a phone call while I was lying next to HF basically naked, trying not to laugh. To this day, I still can't believe what a talented, heartless liar HF was. After the phone call, it was time to put the final nail into the coffin. I got my stuff, called a cab and texted my ex \";)\". He instantly knew. I'll leave what happened to HF to your imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid I overdo it? Am I the ultimate asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Bit of context, I've (M, 30) been with my girlfriend (F, 29) for three years now, great relationship, we've travelled the world and lived abroad for a year etc.  We don't live together for now, since moving back from the country we lived in she's gone to her grandparents and I've gone to my parents while we save money and look for a place of our own, so now she comes over on the weekends after she finishes work.  \n\nWe were going out to do something, and she put on her jumper which stunk.  Now, this isn't the first time she has smelled tbh.  I've told her before and she gets really upset, so I go through this ridiculous performance, where I first smell myself, then ask her \"do I smell?\" which prompts her to say no, and then ask if she smells, to which I nodded.  I thought she would get changed and we would move on and the problem would be over.  Unfortunately, she didn't get changed, we went out to the town and did some shopping.  On the bus home, she raises her arm, and releases the smell, so I say \"we can wash that jumper when we get in\".  So far so good (?).  We get home and get ready to go out to the pub to watch the rugby and she's still in this jumper.  She's sitting down reading a book and is giving me one word answers to questions so I ask her if I upset her by telling her that her jumper smelled and she's giving me one word replies and then she tells me to leave it.  So I did, and went for a shower.  When I got out of the shower, there's still this atmosphere between us, so I say to her \"tell me what's upset you\" to which once again she tells me to leave it.  So I said \"no, I'm not going to go to the pub with you while there is this atmosphere, we need to clear the air\".  So she starts saying how it was embarrassing etc. and that I kept \"banging on about it\".  I said the whole situation was ridiculous, which she then decided meant I said *she* was being ridiculous, which escalated the problem further.  Earlier on, she said that she didn't have any other clothes to wear, so I said \"well we don't have to go to the pub\" to try and solve the situation, which she then took to mean that I thought she was \"too smelly to go out with\".\n\nThe thing is, I'm always telling her to have a shower, or brush her teeth, and she's 29 years old.  It's not the first time I've had to tell her to change because her clothes smell.  I don't feel like I should have to constantly tell her to shower etc.  I also feel like if I smelled, and she didn't tell me I would be pissed off at her.\n\nI probably shouldn't have said the situation was ridiculous at a time of heightened emotion, but still...I feel like it was such a ridiculous thing to argue over.\n\nAm I the Asshole??",

      "title": "AITA if I insist on living in the two bedroom my parents' have bought alone?",
      "description": "I'm a student currently rounding down my first year of professional school. At the beginning of the year, I started to rent a studio. It's a bit pricy at $1100 a month (990 rent and utilities + 110 parking) and the building is older causing some issues, but it's big for a studio and best of all I have it all to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents have never been happy with how old it is, though I'm content. They also would rather my rent money be going to the family rather than a landlord and were looking to have property in the city where I go to school. The idea came up that for next year, they would purchase a condo or apartment and have me rent from them instead. We ended up finding a two bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some background. For the two years prior to this one, I had very negative roommate experiences. My roommates were incredibly selfish and hostile, to make a very long story short. Both of these situations had a profound effect on my wellbeing mental and physical even resulting in recurring nightmares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginally, I had a friend who was interested in rooming with me, and I know her well enough to be certain we wouldn't have issues. Unfortunately she's since backed out and opted to live alone. Despite this, my parents are insisting I find another roommate. I feel extremely uncomfortable looking for an alternative roommate amongst my classmates or strangers because I can definitely not afford to have a bad living situation right now. As a professional student, my workload is about ten-times what it used to be. I've already been struggling a great deal so anything that can potentially add additional stress and anxiety could really send me into a real tail spin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have explained this to my parents multiple times. My dad thinks I'm being dramatic and my mom doesn't even want to hear it. Neither of them have ever had bad roommate situations and they also come from a culture where mental health issues are hardly understood to the point of being mocked. I still haven't revealed to them I had to start seeing a therapist earlier this year for fear of how they'll react. Anyhow, they counter by saying since they're the landlords if the person does anything I can just have them evicted immediately. Personally I dread having to deal with that kind of situation, as I know it'll stress me out beyond measure. They also say I should've ensured they bought a one-bedroom or studio instead if I was so against this. However, at that time my friend was still saying she'd most likely move in with me (she never confirmed, though). They also said themselves that they didn't feel a one bedroom or under would be worth it investment wise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said earlier, I have told them I will pay the price for two in spite of the extra load it'll put on me loan-wise. I just feel like my peace of mind and wellbeing are worth it even if they don't..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo.. what's the verdict? Am I being selfish? An asshole?",

      "description": "I had a bit of a rough time during childhood.  My dad was sick a lot and my mom suffered from untreated mental health issues that I felt responsibility for ameliorating.  Basically I've ended up with a lot of anxiety about my mom being upset, especially at me.  I think that's a bit of necessary context.  \n\n\nMy dad passed away when I was a teenager and my only sister died young a few years ago.  After I graduated college I lived with my mom for a bit, until I got married to my wife.  My mom is a bit of a recluse and doesn't seem to make friends that easily, and most of the friends she has have moved away from the area over the last few years.  Basically at this point the only people she has in the area are me, my wife, and my in-laws.  \n\n\nPretty soon I will be starting a temporary job in a new city that is about 3-4 hours away.  My wife and I have always talked about how we want family around, and that we want to be near our parents wherever we end up settling.  This job will last only a couple years, and my wife and I both feel like we would like to just move there ourselves and have some time for just us for a while.  We've both almost always lived near our parents, and the idea of going to a new city just ourselves sounds kind of exciting.  \n\n\nMy mom obviously really wants to follow us to this new city because she feels like she will be alone.  I feel really bad because, really she is all alone there, on top of me having this guilt complex about my mom because of my childhood.  I am planning to talk to her before we go to say that we want some space just for this time (she can still visit).  I feel a bit like I am abandoning her though...  so am I the asshole?  \n\n\nThanks",

      "description": "My parents did not help me pay for my schooling. I am not writing this because I think it is anyones parents’ responsibility to pay for their son or daughter’s education. At 18, you are an adult. If you want something that benefits yourself (which a degree is) it’s your responsibility to pay for that. I believe in that. \n\nUnfortunately, that is not the way financial aid is calculated. My financial aid was calculated based on a salary I did not make (my father’s). Despite my family’s income of roughly $500,000/yr it was made clear to me before going to college by my parents that I would receive nothing from them. \n\nAt the same time, as a 17 year old kid, I was being very strongly pushed to attend a good college. B grades were not acceptable in my family. Receiving one on a report card resulted in punishments. In meetings with my parents and counselors I was purposefully steered away from local schools and told my aim was to attend an Ivy or a state University. Upon being accepted to several tier 1 schools, I at least had the brains to insist I attended the cheapest one that offered in-state tuition. \n\nI feel like I worked my ass off. Not only did I use all of the money I saved from my high school jobs, I worked 20-30 hours a week during school and purposefully finished my degree in 3 years by taking 2 more classes per semester than what was recommended by the school. I’m now out of school making a $45,000 salary. My debt is $30,000, which to my understanding is a lot better than most. \n\nI think this is fine and fair and I’ve made the bed I sleep in. I have food to eat and a roof over my head. But I pay $400/month towards my loans. Admittedly, sometimes I now find myself annoyed to be around my parents. My parents are by definition multi-millionaires. It makes me feel bad when I visit and my dad touts his money and the things he has used it for. He shows off additions to his car collection, the new cabin they’ve bought, and really expensive renovations to a mansion she shares only with my mother. It makes me ask in my head, why of all the things you could choose to do with the wealth you have, you didn’t help me? It made me especially annoyed when I drove home this christmas and my father made fun of the car I recently bought because it was not new and has some rust. \n\nAt the end of the day, I tell myself I am happy with what I have accomplished, I am way better off than most people around the world and ignore stuff like that. But I feel a bigger and bigger emotional gap forming between myself and them because it simply makes me feel gross being around the things they use their money for. Am I the asshole for feeling this way?",

I live in Vietnam so sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy are banned here, that being said, there is no way to change my gender on the passport. I came out to my family about 6 months ago, it was tough but they had to accept it anyway.\n\nLiving and raised in an asian country, was rather strict. When I was younger my mom would force me to swim twice a week, 2 hours per session. I hated it, and it hit me hard in school as we have obligatory PE as well. When I found out I was trans, I became depressed and dysphoric because of the harassment at school, my grades would drop and I would get yelled at constantly and physically abused for not doing chores because I was extremely tired every day after class so all I did was video games and listening to music.\n\nTime skip to, about a few hours ago. My dad and my siblings went to the public pool. They called to our home telephone to ask me to swim with them. I was anxious when my mom picked it up. She told me to go with them, I replied that I didn't really want to. I hesitated telling the reason but I did anyway. I was embarrassed in a swimsuit and I didn't want to go outside on Sunday. She snapped and threatened from the kitchen; \"Do as I say or I will stab this knife in your fucking face\" in a very scary voice. I started sobbing because I was extremely scared; I continued convincing her why I didn't want to go, she told me to \"shut my mouth and listen to the adult\". After a while I just had to accept it and go to the swimming pool unwillingly because I couldn't do anything against it.\n\nI know she want the best for me, to stay healthy. But, at times, it feels like my mental health was just, ignored and unconsidered... I still feel guilty because I felt like I was hurting her feelings in the role of a parent. \n\nAITA for refusing to follow my mom's request?",

      "title": "AITA for making a meme page about my teacher who’s husband died a few years back?",
      "description": "Last semester I started my first year of high school. I was nervous but excited, on the first day I was meeting all my teachers, they were all very nice and tried to make me feel less scared about the first day. Then 7th period rolls around, my last class of the day, and I meet my math teacher. A 70 year old, shriveled up, prune eating jerk. She started off class by talking about how she’s experienced and “we shouldn’t mess with her”, whatever that means. She was extremely boring and I was dying to get out of class. This was every other day for weeks, fast forward a couple months, I’m bored as frick sitting in her class and I start to zone out, I’m staring out the floor thinking of how I’m gonna play Mario odyssey when I get home, then she yells “OP, bring it here!” “What?” “Bring it here” “What are you talking about?” “Don’t act like I don’t know you’re on your phone!” “I’m not on my phone...” She’s still resisting, I lift my backpack up off the ground, onto the table, and I unzip the pocket on the left side, reach in and pull my phone out. She still looks at me with her stupid, condescending face and waits for me to walk over to her desk. I set it on the table and reluctantly say “sorry, it won’t happen again...” Then you know what I hear? “No it won’t. Cause I’m sending you to the office” EXCUSE ME??? I made it very clear that I wasn’t on my phone and she still sends me to the office??? I rip the note out of her hand and march down to the office. When I walk in the counselor is standing there. “Phone referral?” “Yup” I then explained to him everything that went down. He then says “*teachers last name*? Yeah that makes sense” Then I didn’t get in trouble. I was absolutely shocked that he believed me, but it was welcome. After that I started making memes about her to make me and my friends laugh, it made her class more bearable. Then my friend gets the idea to make a meme page. I was reluctant cause I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I went through with it because it sounded like fun. The page started to gain some traction from kids that went to the school. I was making memes every week or two. Then one day I found out her husband passed away a few years back, I felt guilty obviously because that’s most likely why she acted the way she did, so I decided I should probably take the page down. No joke, the next day, the exact same thing happens but this time I fought against her and this time she wasn’t too stubborn to admit she was wrong, there have been other instances of her doing stupid things, like accusing me and my friend of using hand signals to communicate in class, and saying I was a bad student because I asked a question for something that no one knew the answer to. I understand her husband passed away pretty recently, but I don’t think I should take the page down, because I’m doing it as a joke and she has been pretty rude to me, and there’s always a sense that she thinks she’s better than me, but I don’t know. Is this morally wrong?",

      "description": "TL:DR at bottom  \nThrowaway, because my friends check my reddit some times\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo me an my friends in college play a lot of Super Smash Brothers ultimate in school, and by walking from classes to classes i hear a lot of people in my college does as well, so we decided to throw a tournament for as many people who wanted to attend. So my school said it was not a problem, but they would not fund anything and we had to take care of it. So i did not set any entrance fee nor did i get any reward since, well i am a broke college student. So the only reward was  a paper that said congratulation on winning the tournament. So up comes the day and many people attended, a few more that i had expected but it was fine. So i told them the rules(3 stocks, no items, 6 minutes and stage hazards off) and then told them about the reward. I explained to them why this was all, and i got some nods and okays so people were getting why it was the only thing and accepted it. Apart for that guy who said:\"Really, that's it?\". I said yes i could not afford anything else, i am sorry. Then i see him ramble something but i chose to ignore him. So the competition starts and this guy goes to a complete back seat driving, if you get me. Shouting, NO, don't jump there or you should've attack there and i could see it was getting on the nerves of some players. So then comes his turn to play, and he lost. Now i had the double eliminations, which is if you lose your first match you go there and have a second chance at the tournament. And as i said, he lost his match and i said, like i sad to all that lost, unlucky but don't worry since you will be going to the losers bracket and have a second chance at the tournament. At that moment he lost it and said\" But the guy who fought me used a cheap tactic and should be sent there instead of me, because i played fairly.\" Which i said \" We did not ban any moves or character and since it is in the game its allowed(he did not do anything game breaking).\" He continues with \" But it is such a cheap tactic, i don't want to be in the losers bracket cause i did not lose \"fairly\".\" I said, the Rules are the rules if you don't like them, just go. Then he started to complain more and i said, \"That's it you are out of the tournament, leave now\". Then he left super pissed and i got some mean eyes looking at me, but some were relieved. So was i the asshole by kicking him out?  \n\n\nTL:DR a guy lost his temper for losing in a smash tourney i was throwing and i kicked him out.     ",

      "description": "   So, it is Thanksgiving and I am high off some dabs and a wax blunt. I decide I am going to visit my local waffle house about .75 miles away. I wanted to go, because my dude Norman who also happens to be black works there, and I wanted to dab some wax with him. I frequent this waffle house regularly so the staff knows who I am.\n   To my despair, my homie norman wasn't there. I was sad about this, but I had the munchies, and decided to order a hashbrown that went \"all the way.\" It was indeed some sex in my mouth let me tell you that. I decided in my elevated mind state that I would commiserate with my waitress. I for whatever reason decided to comment on an eddie griffin comedic bit in which Mr. Griffin explains why he hated the whole \"sag your pants phase\" in hip hop.\n   For those of you who dont know sagging your pants in jail meant you were a homosexual. Im not homophobic i am literally pointing out facts. I feel in this political climate I have to clarify everything for both liberal morons and conservative morons.\n   Anywho, conversation also turns to \"black face.\" I want to preface this next paragraph with the fact that I am a korean american who has had the \"chinky eyes\" done to him by numerous african americans. When i got angry about it i was told to chill. I want to also say that i dont condone black face, but was merely pointing out a blatant hypocrisy in the thought processes of SOME African Americans in regard to race. \n   The reason I am asking if AITA is because unbeknownst to me there were a table of four african americans whom happened to leave the restaurant. I left shortly after, because Helga honestly was trying to call me out when i wasnt even aware those african americans were even there. I was having a conversation with a very open minded black waitress and feel I am not the asshole. \n\nAs an asian american this whole race thing offends me, because i feel like the media only focuses on black and white issues. I feel that SOME African americans dont have a sense of humor, but when they make fun of other races they expect you to just be chill. Thats why im mad, and thats why i went on that rant. So reddit Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So basically, I go out late at night for a smoke break. I know, I know, bad habit. It's kinda meditation for me enjoying the nighttime sounds. I walk up our street and down the one it connects with and back. I typically do this at hours past midnight. I'm used to living in the city where this isn't exactly an issue. I dress kinda down for reference, I think that's important. It hasn't been a problem for months.\n\nAnyways, tonight I turn down the connected street that's a bit of a main vein. There's two parked cars with groups of people which is strange. Suddenly I hear what sounds like gun shots several blocks away so I fuck off back to the street that my parents live on. There's a street light out so I just chill there watching up the street while I finish my smoke. Suddenly a car pulls up. Like, right in front of where I'm standing on the sidewalk. I'm nervous, so I walk a couple feet over cause I figure either he's going to kill me, or I'm going to walk away quickly and look sketchy. Needless to say I'm spooked. He gets out, clearly dressed in high vis gear so he's just getting off work, he starts walking into his house and stops.\n\n\nHe says with a loud voice \"Are you alright buddy?\" I'm nervous after the last four minutes. I just tell him that I'm hunkered down here cause there's shit going down on X street. I awkwardly and nervously say I just moved back in with my parents and I go out for a smoke after they go to bed. He says that it's just weird to see a dude out past midnight, we wish each other a good night, and he goes in and I head down the street where my parents live. I feel bad, because I know in a suburban setting its weird to see a dude in shabby clothing just standing there smoking. I typically have a spot that's out of the way, but given the circumstances I just moved back towards the sidewalk on that street. I feel bad making people uncomfortable, but the sidewalk is a public space so I don't know. \n\nFor reference, I carry out my butts. Always. I know they're not biodegradable so I make sure I dispose of them responsibly. \n\nAm I an ass hole for taking a walk past midnight for my smoke break?",

      "description": "This is such a bizarre and stupid situation but here goes.\n\nLast weekend we were both at a friend's party and my girlfriend \"Jess\" got really drunk and I ended up having to take her home. She was falling over drunk so I put her in bed and I stepped out to go to the bathroom. When I was in the bathroom, I hear this giant thump. Lo and behold she has fallen from the bed onto her face (our bed is quite high up so it was a little bit of a drop). \n\nI helped her back into bed and checked her face, which honestly seemed fine at the time and we both fell asleep. When we woke up, she had a very prominent bruise and redness on the side of her face and it really did look like someone had punched her. Unfortunately she did have to go to work the next day so she put some makeup on it the best she could and went to work.\n\nWhen she got home, she told me that her coworker, who is also one of her good friends, noticed the bruise on her face and asked her if she was \"okay.\" Jess told her straight up what had happened with falling over drunk but her friend just said, \"Well in case that isn't what happened and something happened with u/stfisme, just let me know.\" \n\nWe really didn't think much of that conversation at first because it just seemed like her friends were looking out for her, and yeah I can see how the whole situation looks fishy from the outside. But it turns out that this friend has been talking to all of Jess's other friends about it and now they are all convinced I'm abusing her and that Jess is somehow covering for me and lying for me, no matter how much she tells them what happened and that they all saw how drunk she was at the party. \n\nThe other day I even had one of her guy friends approach me and say that they are all \"watching me and her\" and are all \"looking out for her\". What the actual fuck. Now none of her friends want anything to do with me and it is causing us both a lot of anxiety. \n\nJess and I have no idea what else we can do to convince people I don't abuse her.\n\nDoes anybody have any ideas at how we could be approaching this differently? I want to just tell her to fuck off and mind her own business regardless of the consequences because to be frank I think she deserves it. \n\nWIBTA if I told her to just go find another hobby to preoccupy her time rather than making shit up about our relationship?

      "title": "AITA for wanting another chance after I (21M) ended a relationship with someone (21F) twice?",
      "description": "Long post, here goes\n\nI became friends with this girl in middle school. I was sorta interested in her and she was into me too but nothing happened. I moved away and we kept in touch on and off over social media. We ended up reconnecting my second year of college. She had a boyfriend at the time, but we started talking more often and were good friends. I eventually asked her out, but she said she would only hang out with me as a friend, not on a date. I was bummed, but took the chance to see her. It was fun, nothing happened though.\n\nShe started catching feelings for me later on and ended her relationship because she said she didn’t want to cheat. We started talking more seriously, but after a month I realized I wasn’t ready for something serious. She also lived a bit away and didn’t have a car, so it was a 30 to 40 minute drive for me and a hassle to see her. I told her I didn’t want us to talk anymore and didn’t really feel like explaining why, so I stopped replying to her messages asking to talk about it. When she started getting more upset, I ghosted her and we didn’t talk for six months. I realized I messed up though and asked her for another chance and to show her I was serious, that she’d be my girlfriend officially this time. She was reluctant but said yes.\n\nOne thing that she had said before we started dating was that she didn’t want to have sex before marriage and then after we got together, that she didn’t want to unless I loved her (she was a virgin at the time). I felt like that wasn’t fair because 1. she knew I wasn’t a virgin and 2. I had a high libido. I also didn’t think it was reasonable that I had to love her or that I wouldn’t be able to sleep with my girlfriend.\n\nWe dated for about a month and during this time, I actually cheated on her with another friend of mine. I eventually started feeling the same as before about the relationship, and ended up telling her it wasn’t working for me a week or two later. I didn’t ghost her this time and we talked for an hour. After a serious but calm discussion, we broke up. I told her about the cheating and we talked about our issues some more. After thinking later that day about our talk, I realized I didn’t want us to break up, and we got back together that same day. She then told me that she felt she wasn’t being fair to me before and that if I wanted to, we could have sex since she was my girlfriend after all. I was stoked and we hooked up that night. We stayed together for another month, but I started feeling like I wasn’t ready for something so serious again and just wasn’t as into the relationship anymore in general. I ended up breaking up with her. She was upset and said that she felt really used, but told me she understood. After we talked about how things were, what went wrong, and the relationship in general, we stopped talking.\n\nIt’s been a few months since then and I’ve grown a lot as a person. I’ve been doing my own thing and investing in myself, but lately I’ve started thinking about her. She was really good to me and I miss our conversations. She always let me do what I want or hang out with my friends. She never asked me to come see her, but said she really appreciated when she did get to. Overall, she was really sweet and a good girlfriend. I kind of want to ask her for another chance, but I’m afraid she might not be as open to a relationship.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for wanting to try again (again)?",

      "description": "My husband and I have been together 13 years. When we met I was mentally unhealthy due to some childhood stuff from being raised with two parents with personality disorders. I had terrible anxiety and bent over backwards to people please.\nIn the last few years I went and finally got effective help and was released from care. I'm not cured but I'm 1000% better.\nMy husband and I were in a spot where we were coexisting and we went to marriage counseling at my request. He refused to participate, even telling me you have to \"lie to those people\" to get out of it. After several sessions my husband refused to return because the therapist was pressing on him some about his view that he's had no choices in life, everything has been done to him.\nThe therapist told me in a private session after that he's concerned my husband has a personality disorder, possibly BPD, or bipolar.\nI had a talk with my husband and by the end of the conversation he was accusing me of having BPD. (I asked both my therapist and the marriage therapist and both say I do not)\nAt this point, it's like buying a blue car and then all you see is blue cars. I see all the symptoms and it's becoming difficult to tolerate, and like I said we were already in a rough patch, but now that I know he has mental illness I feel like if I say enough and leave, I'm an asshole.\nI know it takes so much time to accept and get treatment but he's suffered from depression off and on our entire relationship and he says he can self treat via talking to himself and that I've just become a Bible thumper but for therapy.\nAm I the asshole if I leave him?

      "description": "I attend a private gym that I pay a good amount of money for, and I have found that in the past few weeks, people have been bringing their small children to my Zumba class. When I say small children- on Tuesday someone parked their scroller with a 1.5 year old child in the back of the class, and a woman brought her 5 year old child to class today. I reached out to management last week, and they responded by putting a small printed sign on the door that stated that no children under 9 were permitted in class. However, this is clearly not stopping anyone. When I emailed management on Tuesday about the baby, they never bothered to respond.\n\nI pay good money to attend this gym, and I don’t mind when kids of the appropriate age join he class, because they follow the teacher’s directions and participate like the adults do. However, the smaller children NEED supervision- a woman today had the nerve to ask the 10-year old standing behind me to “watch the child” while the mom danced on he other side of the room. For reference, the 10-year old is not friends with this 5 year old, and she does not know this mom. I don’t think anyone in the class should be responsible for having to watch out for a small child that is too young to properly participate. I fear that if I accidentally bump into a child that’s running around the studio, and they get hurt, that I’ll get sued.\n\nThis gym offers kids programs, so the parents can work out while their play in the “Kids Zone.” This is not a manner of the parents having no options- these parents simply don’t want to use the options available to them.\n\nI’m considering no longer attending the classes because of this. It doesn’t seem like this is bothering anyone else in the class. AITA?",

Our house isn't a sty, because I do all those things on my days off or time off as it allows. Is it wrong of me to feel like she doesn't value my limited amount of free time? \nToo much time in my opinion is spent on tablets/phones to get anything done, then she wonders where the day went. \n\nAITA for being mad when I get home and need to burn an hour or 2 doing simple things that could have been done while I was not home?\n\nI don't know what I want out of this post.....sorry for the ramblings, if it doesn't fit feel free to delete it.",

      "description": "This is going to sound incredibly petty, but please hear me out.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both play Pokemon Go which is a mobile game. Over the weekend, there was an event where you could catch shiny Pokémon for a limited amount of time. Shiny Pokemon are essentially the exact same as regular ones, except they're a different color [example](https://i.redd.it/a54wjs8xlv121.jpg). \n\nMy favorite Pokémon is Gengar (which is relevant info for later). My girlfriend's favorite Pokémon of all time is Bulbasaur. There is no Pokémon she loves more than Bulbasaur. During the event, she caught one of each type *except* Bulbasaur. I caught shiny after shiny and was able to get multiple of each Pokémon. I even caught two Bulbasaur. \n\nI caught my second Bulbasaur just as the weekend ended. My girlfriend was there and she was clearly distraught because the event was over and she hadn't caught one. I could tell she was sad and asked why she was sad because at least we both had caught shinies.\n\nShe then expressed her disappointment that we had played all weekend in the cold rain only for her to catch everything but her favorite and that it felt like a slap in the face. She then started crying (which is when I started getting annoyed). She said it was because I did a dance every time I caught a shiny while she was still empty-handed. My dancing was meant to be a joke and I felt it was very obvious that I was joking, but she said it felt like rubbing extra salt in the wound because this happens every time there is an event. To be fair, it's true that I always get significantly more lucky than her but RNG is the mechanic of the game. Some are luckier than others.\n\nShe then mentioned the time when there was an event for the Pokémon Gengar. On this day, she said that by the end if I wasn't able to catch a shiny, she would trade me hers even if it was the only one she had. In the midst of crying, she admitted that she didn't feel entitled to my second Bulbasaur, but that it disappointed her that she would be willing to sacrifice her single Gengar for me when I wasn't able to sacrifice one of my two Bulbasaur for her.\n\nHowever, even though I did catch a few shiny Gengar on Gengar Day, I wouldn't have felt entitled to her Gengar. Even though Bulbasaur isn't my favorite, I still wanted to keep my second one so that I could have the second evolution as well. I did not want to give it up. My annoyance was heightened by the fact that she acted so childish over a mobile game.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?",

Game was heated and I just ignored everything because it was a close one and just communicating back and forth with my friends. After the game I call my cousin back and he didn’t pick up (still hasn’t responded) and I noticed he posted a Instagram video about the situation and being pissed and deleted me as a friend.

      "description": "Hey guys, so let me explain a bit better.\n\nMy girlfriend 23F (who I have been with for over 7 months but known each other for about 4 years) and I  21M were at the Airport earlier today since I slept at her place in order to wake up early and help her with getting her to the Airport by 5:30 AM before I go to work. We decided to eat breakfast at the starbucks there and then say our farewell goodbye until this Saturday when she returns from seeing her granma.\n\nWhen we get to the starbucks, she asks for what she wants while pulling her card out, and then she proceeds to pay, and I ask: \"are you going to offer anything for me?\" And she says: \"you can pay with your money\" in a very normal attitude. This made me a bit upset since I have pretty much paid 90% of the stuff that we do or consume when we are together, including vacations and such. When we sat down she realized that I was upset and asked me: \"are you going to get something?\" And I said: \"no, i dont want anything\" to which she replied stating that I was a child for reacting like that. Unfortunately we were in a hurry and had to leave to the Security checkpoint, and she refused to hear any of my explanations of why I was upset. Which is not that she didn't got me coffe or whatever. I am upset because of the way that she just said: \"you can pay with your own money\". I tried to tell her that I always try to pay for everything and I mostly do, and she replies saying that if i am rubbing that in her face, and that also she always offer to pay stuff too even if its half-half (which is true), that none of us are obligated to pay each other's stuff. \n\nI try to explain her again that the issue is not that she didn't got me something, but rather the way that she said that. \n\nAnd it may sound bad but I really can't stop thinking about all the times that I just oay for everything and anything doesn't matter the price.\n\nWe are now upset at each other with little to no communication (she is in Cuba, we are both from there) and she even refused for me to go and pick her up at the airport when she comes back.\n\nI have tried to look at this from other angles, but I can't seem to find anything that I did wrong, except from the fact that maybe I should have saved it for a talk for when she comes back.\n\nNow my questions is: AITA?!",

Although I live with my parents I said yes 1 night is no problem. X then proceeded to ask me if she can stay until Sylvester since she wanted to celebrate with the same people I was going to celebrate as we have the same group of friends. She has an own apartment but it is 2h away so it sucks if she has to drive 6h just because of those 3 days. I said I need to ask my mom but I am sure it is possible. After all this I took a shower, cleaned my room and sat on my PC as I waited for her.\nAround 3am she texts me stating that she is sleeping at her parents home and asks me if she can come the next day in the morning. I said I usually sleep till early afternoon in my holidays but I will get up at around 10am. She says that's fine and she will come at around 10.\n\nI woke up today at 9:45, got up and got dressed. 15 past 10 I text her \"so what now\". I got my answer not before 11am where X stated \"I'm going to go for a coffee with friends and then I am driving home to my apartment\". I got kind of upset. I asked her why that is and she explained she had nowhere to stay and didn't want to annoy my mom.\n\nI then said to her \"next time pls be so kind and don't make me wake up early just for you. Do I look like an idiot with whom you can do whatever you want?? If you want to treat someone like dirt then go search for someone else\"\n\nShe then said \"Dont you think that is a bit much....my family is falling apart and all you think about is yourself\" I told her that this is bullshit and she blocked me\n\nPls note that the entire conversation was via WhatsApp.\n\n\nIt is not about me having to get up early or taking a shower but it is about me not being a fool. I have promised myself to not let anyone treat me like a lesser being anymore. It is about my self esteem. I cannot just always say \"Yes\" and \"Dont worry it is okay\". Also, this is not the first time she pulled something like this off.\n\nI spoke to my mom about it (God bless mothers are a thing) and she said she can understand me and that I am NTA.\n\nI still want more judgment and more opinions on the case\n\nAnd sorry for my bad English I am not a native speaker.",

I’ve entirely unpacked and settled in, including putting all my clothes in the drawers and starting an art project in the only space in the house that will allow it (it’s the only place consistently quietly that the new puppy can’t get to that also has a surface of the right hight for my drawing board). \n\nMy sister text me three days ago telling - not asking - that I move out of the bedroom to make room for her and her fiancé. This would include repacking all of my belongings to move into the loft the next room over, which has no privacy. I said no, but I know the expectation is that I’ll move  out for her anyways. That wouldn’t bother me if she was only going to stay one or two nights, but she called my dad yesterday and we don’t know how long she’s staying. She’s already started the drive out here (she lives in another state less than six hours away), and she’s making plans for her fiancé’s grandmother to visit us while they’re here. Presumably it’s going to be at least a week. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that they should take the blowup bed in the loft, not me? I’m going to be here until the 3rd of January, and during that time I got a part time job as an event worker, so I’ll be coming home very late some nights extremely tired, and wanting to just sleep somewhere comfortable. My sister is on vacation and supposed to only be here 1-2 nights. \n\nTl;dr - I don’t want to move out of the guest bedroom for someone whose going to be there for less time than I am, but I know it’s going to cause a fight if I don’t.

      "description": "Last night I was drinking with my roommates and my girlfriend. I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 8 months now. When we were falling asleep she told me that a little before we met she signed up for multiple sugar baby websites because she needed money to travel. I was immediately speechless. She is a very reserved girl who never did casual hookups and I really liked that about her. She told me how multiple old men sent her messages asking for pictures. She says that she never sent them any photos. Part of me questions if that is true. I initially reacted by asking her why traveling was more important than her self respect. She did not like that and immediately started to cry. We argued for several minuets and I felt so differently about her. I lost some respect for her when she told me that. Then I went out for a smoke break to collect my thoughts, and when I came back I apologized to her for saying the things I did and I thought I felt okay about it. But I can't stop getting the thought out of my head of her sending old dudes naked photos. I really wanna bring it up again but I feel like I'm the asshole. ",

She’s always had a nose ring on one side, (which I always liked) and just added the septum today. I had no idea she had planned to do this, and when I asked her when she’d decided she told me she’s wanted it for a while, but never wanted to talk to me about it because she was afraid I’d tell her I wouldn’t want her to. I still haven’t told her I liked it, because honestly I think it’s a little much, and I wouldn’t feel right lying to her by saying I liked it. I’ve always considered myself an open minded person, if a little conservative in home life, but always up for a good-faith debate, and flexible. Am I just way off base here?",

      "description": "We had a test, an essay for a English based course and the teacher was late. I am (was) the class rep so i acted as the medium between the students and the lecturer but the day I volunteered to be the class rep because no one else was, i left class without taking her contact details. It was the 3rd week of school and I didn't have any motivation to really give my best yet. I also somewhat hate the teacher because of a few actions here and there that I pieced together her personality was at the very least mildly awful so that paired with my lack of being interested at the time cause me to not even want to speak to her.\n\nThis week, when we were supposed to have the test, i came to the class early. I waited the allotted time, I checked the staff room, asked them to call her without them getting an answer but I couldn't get her. I couldn't be bothered with another absentee lecturer (I'm getting that a lot for certain classes) so I left. To be fair and not to let the other students assumed I just left them out the loop I told them that the time to leave was approaching and they could leave. I left and told them why and they can if they wanted to. Some left but most stayed as i heard from another member of the class he was the one that also told me that the lecturer came to class. I searched for the lecturer after I saw him and found her [lecturer] in the classroom that the class had just had the test in. \n\nShe told me that the class stated that I was encouraging them to leave and that I left because I didn't want to do the test. She also said I was in the wrong for not waiting because she could have been late for any number of reasons like her having a flat tire or meeting in an accident (her words, not mine). She said as class rep I should have waited at least an hour before saying that anyone could leave. She also broke the news that the class had selected another rep (even though it was clarified in the group that she selected them, not the class).\n\nShe also claimed that as class rep I was to lean towards helping out her and what I was doing was more or less fighting against her as I didn't want to take the test and that if I wanted to do that I should have been a Student Union rep.\n\nTL;DR I left class early and told the class why and that they could too but the lecturer said I'm at fault and that's why she removed my voluntary position as class rep. \n\nAssume that I wrote this a little biased because this sounds kinda biased towards making me seem like the victim. Take my words with a grain of salt and ask me questions for clarification. I want to know if I really handled this wrong.\n\n",

We don’t speak because he’s put me in danger due to his substance abuse and alcoholism, and he’s mad at me for not condoning his behavior.\n\nHis girlfriend, who is several years younger than him and younger than myself, has always been extremely rude to both me and my parents. She enters their house without acknowledging my mother when she answers the door, she rummages through my parents’ fridge/cabinets without permission, she shouts and laughs late into the night when my parents are trying to sleep, she even has some of her mail sent to my parents’ address because “[my brother] said I could.” Initially I simply gave a nod when I saw her, but now I just don’t say or do anything. My parents don’t want to ban her from the house for fear that my brother will get angry and engage in self-destructive behavior (but that’s another issue altogether). Brother said I’m an asshole for “not welcoming her,” but I assume it’s better that I say nothing than blow up at her. Does that make me an asshole? ",

I also told her that I didn't want to decorate because decorating was the one time my parents wouldn't constantly argue, they would tolerate each other for enough time to decorate the house, and it felt as though it was shitting on a special part of my childhood to do it with her and her fiance. \n\nShe started to get extremely upset because she felt as though I was obligated to help since I live under her roof (I do not, I spend the majority of my time with my dad and visit her occasionally), and she continued to act extremely passive aggressively towards me for the rest of the day. \n\nEventually, I caved and agreed to help decorate the tree to make her stop treating me in such a way. I'm leery that I may have been the asshole while decorating because I was visibly upset and unhappy through the entire process, and I refused to even act like I was enjoying it in the slightest.\n\nSo, people of Reddit, I turn to you.

      "description": "My son is on Reddit daily and will recognize my post immediately, so a throwaway would be pointless.  Will still try to keep identifying details out to maintain his privacy from his friends.\n\nMy son graduated HS in 2012.  He spent that first year working full time in a warehouse with a particularly demanding boss.  He learned a lot about the workforce and developed an amazing work ethic.  But he quickly realized that he wanted to obtain his college degree so he started community college part time.  About a year later he got an apartment with his then girlfriend.  He still was going to college and working.  After a year he wanted to come home so that he could go to school full time, work part time and finish school quicker.  This is where things go downhill. \n \nWe were happy to have him come home and concentrate on school.  We told him that we'd pay his car insurance and phone but he would be responsible for his car payment.  We also stressed that he would have to help out around the house in lieu of rent/utilities.  He would be responsible for cleaning his bathroom every other week, helping with dishes, trash, and vacuum once a week.  Suffice to say, he barely did anything.  It caused a lot of tension in my marriage.  We had many sit down convos with him, it would get better for a week, then right back how it was.  \n\nFastforward to last summer...he's been dating a really great girl who we like and they made plans to go to a university out of state starting Jan 2019.  Her home situation was very stressful, she already put in 2 years at community college and 1 semester at a very hard local university, and she has a great work ethic also.  So we decide to offer for her to stay with us until they go.  Within 2 weeks of her moving in the plan changed from leaving in Jan to leaving in August!  Not what we signed up for.  We have a sit down convo and they want to save up more money before they go, she's going to work 2 jobs, they need more time to find and apt, etc.  So we all compromise and decide June 1st will be the move out date. \n \nFastforward to Dec and I'm about to lose my mind.  Our son barely does anything at all.  He might clean the bathroom every 6wks, he might put dishes away every 2wks, virtually nothing.  She has cleaned the bathroom twice since Sept.  That's it.  \nI was over it.  The day after Xmas, I sat him down and told him he had to pay me $100/mo cleaning fee and they had to be out by Apr 1st.  I told him I was starting to resent him for not helping, that I've taught him everything I can as a parent, that I'll always love him, but it's better for our relationship if he goes sooner rather than later.  He was livid.  He's barely spoken to me since.  \n\nI feel like I made the right decision as a parent because it really felt like enabling at this point.  But I also feel horrible because maybe I'm being too hard and expecting too much?  I just know that I love him and my heart is breaking.\n\nTl,Dr: kicking my son out for acting entitled",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so bare (bear? Bare?) with me.\nBefore the other before I need to say I was a bit scrawny back as a 12 year old, easy to push around. Now I'm taller than the rest of my family and not as easy to push around.\n\nBefore I get into the incident at hand, I need to explain a bit of whats happened in the past. So my older sister used to bully me, in the sense that she was degrading me at every moment and basically treating my like a slave, naive me thought it was just how older siblings act. After a hell of a long time of that and many other things that aren't relevant happening she left the house at like 16 ish, I was 12 at the time. And so 3-4 years later she just magically comes back to the house with 0 prior warning as to what's going on (my dad brought her back without telling my mum who is the person who runs the house). And so 3 weeks of her constant shit and I just stop talking to her because she's a mega bitch, but at this point was the last straw.\n\nBTW: at the time of the incident she's 20, I'm 16\n\nThis point: my cousins came over to the house to visit (lovely kids, but they're young and get rowdy) and I was playing with the youngest when I see my younger sister (not mega bitch older sister) putting her foot against the older cousins back (who is still fairly young), I don't scold her but I do tell her not to do it because you don't kick people. MB (how I'll refer to older sister from now on) decides this is prime opportune to mock me for whatever reason, and after tons of her shit I just told her that nobody was talking to her and to butt out. She didn't like this and got pissed. \n\nFF to after I've helped put the kids in the car as it was getting late and they needed to go home. Before I went outside MB ran upstairs for a minute, waited until I came back inside and waited for me in the living room. My mum tells me to do something so I ignore MB's presence for now and do what she says. When I come back in MB comes up to my face and starts threatening me. Due to me not being scared of her and being taller I stood my ground as she swung at me once. I didn't retaliate straight away as I was taught to let girls swing once, but if they think they can do it again restrain them. \n\nAs I stepped back she got in my face and swung again, so I did what any sane person would do, and restrained her against the sofa, through a mixture of pushing her, using my weight against her and pulling her hair once (keeping in mind this entire time she's still attacking me). I get off her after she's no longer able to hit me and push her away. When we're both stood back up she still swings at me but I hold her arm to stop her. Of course I'm pissed at this point so I scream at her at the top of my lungs to go die or leave because I'm sick of her shit. \n\nSo she scurries off to my father's house to tell him what happened, and because she hit me multiple times before I retaliated I felt I was in the right. \n\nMy father comes home and screams at me I'm in the wrong, which is complete bullshit. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\n\n",

      "description": "So here's the deal: I recently moved to the States from Canada on a fiance visa to be with my now husband. Due to the circumstances I am unable to legally work for a couple months while we work on getting me my employment authorization document, adjustment of status, etc. I have a lot of time to myself since my husband often works long hours but I've been enjoying the time to re-immerse myself into old hobbies, volunteering, and re-decorating the house. It's very relaxed but I had a super-stressful job beforehand, and, coupled with the move, it's really nice to finally have a break.\n\nMy husband's sister has children (1.5y &amp; 3y) who are wonderful -- but who I suddenly felt expected to babysit whenever. Since I am not working currently his family seems to have the impression that I am just sleeping the days away or otherwise doing nothing -- which my husband and I have told them was not the case. A lot of times I would barely get any notice. Like maybe a text an hour or 2 before she's at my doorstep dropping off the kids. However I do not enjoy playing babysitter at all. I don't even want kids of my own and watching someone else's every other day is starting to drain me. \n\nMy husband and I talked it over and he agrees it's a bit much -- after all, watching the children cuts into our own personal time that we get together. So recently I've told his sister that, no, I wouldn't be around as an on demand babysitter anymore. Unless it was an emergency I wouldn't be available to watch her children every other day. This wasn't taken well by the family. In their view she's a struggling single mom and I'm just a lazy person who rather sit on my ass than help out family. I've put my foot down though. I've told them even though I am currently not working, I do have ways to spend my free time and do not want to spend that time babysitting. I have my husband's support but I still feel really bad for making things awkward for him with his family. Also despite feeling like I've been taken advantage of by the SIL I sympathize with her situation -- and his family are good people for the most part.  \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to babysit my SIL's children, even though I technically have the time and space to do so?",

      "description": "I've posted on her before and this is about that same person I had an issue with last time. For simplicity, F is the friend, and GF is good friend.\n\nGF was texting in the group chat how she was trying to have less negativity in her life by working on being less jealous and by holding less grudges. F said that jealousy and grudges are bad and can be healthy. GF got a little annoyed and they had a little spat. Towards the end of it I went on the chat and said that jealousy is mainly toxic.\n\nF replied by saying that letting it control you is bad ( I agree) but using grudges as a way to avoid people isn't. Then she said that \"jealousy is natural, don't pretend you've never had it\". I never said I didn't feel jealousy. Then she said that I was basically saying that sadness is toxic. This continued and I was responding with small sentences disagreeing with her, but trying to stay calm and explain my opinion.\n\nF kept trying to put words in my mouth and was making conclusions so I finally snapped and told her to shut up and let me tell her what I mean without being accused every ten seconds. She agreed. I explained that I thought jealousy in small doses isn't good but isn't super bad, but that jealousy is a slippery slope that can easily lead to toxic emotions.\n\nF changed the topic to grudges and said they were healthy and useful for getting rid of toxic people. I sent her the Google definition which said that grudges are persistent feelings of bad feelings (which made F's point invalid because she said you could forget about a grudge for years at a time). F just said a persistent thought is impossible.\n\nI gave her a personal example of what I've gone through with jealousy as I have a lot of feelings of inferiority that stem from being jealous.  F told me that those feelings weren't toxic and that there was a big difference between being sad and being so jealous it's toxic.\n\nWe argued some more, and finally I told her that jealousy isn't healthy and that I was done with the argument. F just responded by saying that she thought jealousy was neutral and there was not hurry to fix it.\n\nI'm left wondering if I should have been more calm or even just left the issue alone. I'm evening wondering if I should be friends with her anymore because she has done this thing before by calling me manipulative for telling her that I've gone through a painful experience and I couldn't forgive her friend for convincing people she was going to do that experience for laughs. \n\nTL;DR: friend and me argued about if jealousy is toxic and I'm left wondering if I was a jerk in the fight and if I should even be her friend anymore.",

      "title": "AITA- For Making my best friend feel like shit?",
      "description": "So for some context me and my best friend, whom I'll call Alison for the sake of this, have been pretty close ever since we met in 8th grade. My Junior year of high school I had to move I was lucky enough to to have moved back to graduate with my friends and I was able to get my last class with all 3 of my favorite friends. This was August 2017. Now me and Alison had a plan of going to Atlanta at the end of September but about a week before I scolded her for cheating calling her actions stupid and she should know better. She texted me that night saying I was being unfair and then her mother texted me saying it was rude calling her stupid and should apologize for making Alison cry. I did but told her if she doesn't like something I say she should tell me then and there not over text. We went to Atlanta (me driving us to and fro)\n\nFast forward to 2018 she comes out to me that she's bi sexual which i was excited about her telling me so I ask how long she's know and why she didn't tell me before (she didn't want her family to know). Couple weeks later she tells me she's dating this 9th grader. She and her girlfriend and the girlfriends friends are who she is mostly hanging out with so I kinda felt left out and tried to arrange plans to hangout with only her and some time her girlfriend. Doesn't go so well. We're hanging out less but since it's tennis season were mostly hanging out then. On the way back from an away game I'm tired and start trying to joke around the way we usually do by making fun of each other (and our flaws). She isn't in the mood and is only looking at her and Everytime I ask if she's ok she says she is. Once I get back to my apartment I get a text saying that I was being an asshole for saying nasty things about her. It hurt knowing I caused her pain so I wrote back saying sorry and to correct my actions in the moment she said she will. \n\nFast forward a month we're all making plans for the senior trip. She and our friend (let's call him Dave) have decided they are going to sit together. I'm worried because she started only answering me with short messages or phrases. I feel like I have done something to upset her again so because I didn't want anything to be awkward around us I confronted her and asked why she we weren't connecting like we used to and she simply said that she was just busy from school and that's all and that she wasn't upset with me so I took her word for it and kept planning our trip to Florida with our school as well as the trip to Savannah in may that we had decided to take(she tried to see if I would take her girlfriend and her best friend but my car doesn't fit that many people and luggage so I declined idk if that made her mad).\n\n2 weeks latter we get to Orlando I'm stressed trying to have fun but also hang out with people I haven't been easily able to hang out with (I had a lot of shit on my plate). So I wasn't able to hangout with her. The next morning we get back to school and I was supposed to take Alison with me but she called her mom and her mom picked her up so I didn't really care I was tired. I get back and I get a huge long text saying that she was scared to talk to me because I would make comebacks and that I had changed and how I was the reason we hadn't been talking as well as how she missed to \"old days\"...\nI snapped I started crying I was stressed and tired and while I'm sure she felt the same way she just had to have this happen! So what I had written in response was that she was the one who changed not me and I had people to back me up. And that making fun of each other was just my way of showing my love, I will say I went overboard and called her self absorbed, and that I made fun of everyone the same way I did her it was in good fun. So asked her why she didn't confront me a week ago when I asked her what was wrong if it wasn't something that I just did that made her upset. She asked why I ignored her at the park and I said I didn't told her the same reasons as above-mentioned. She then had the audacity to ask why I decided to sith with one of my other friends and not her when she had already planned on sitting with Dave before I could ask. Then she continues to blame me for things that went wrong or could have been prevented by simply talking and I told her she should take responsibility for what she does wrong as well. She told me I was causing her stress from my \"mean comments\" to which I replied that she never tried to stop me not once has she told me that I went to far. Every time I tried to talk to her it felt like I was being ignored I still have the texts in the end I told her to own up to her wrongs because I said sorry and I owned up to my wrongs but if she wasn't willing to do that then we shouldn't be friends. \n\nBy the time may rolled around she had said sorry and we still went to Savannah(again I drove back and forth) where her GFS best friend showed up but her gf couldn't go because her parents didn't want her to go unless someone else took her. I ended up being the third wheel.\n\nWe didn't talk too much after wards we took prom pictures and went laser tagging with her gf(whom her mom doesn't know about still to this day despite taking her to prom), the best friend  one of our other friends and my bf at the time. We took graduation pics together and we didn't talk for a while I invited my two other favorite friends and another really good friend to go to a escape room( I feel bad that I didn't invite her but she was not someone I was really that happy to hang out with at the time.\n About a month later she called me in the middle of the night (I was visiting family so 2 my time 12 hers?) Crying about how much she missed hanging out and I felt bad and agreed I had been missing her but I still feel like I was an ass for doing allot of shit that made her upset. We talk a little more now but I still need closure on weather what I did was bright or not from a outside perspective.",

There are some days where i stayed a little bit later (like up to an hour) but only a couple of times so very rarely.\n\nToday we didn't play as I got home late after having coffee with some workmates, and the friend in question had to leave for work by 9 (4 in their time) no prob there, I decided to play a singleplayer game, it had been a while since I had played on my own and I missed it. At around 11 they message me asking if I don't have work tomorrow, I say I do and joke how staying up this late is a bad decision on my part.\n\nThey're pretty mad at me now, as I almost always stop playing at 9 when playing together, but now that 'they're away' I'm staying up 2 hours later than usual. They unfriend me pretty quick soon after. \n\nSo I guess my question is, am I the asshole for spending less time playing with them, than I do playing by myself.",

Recently, he showed me her profile on Instagram and I was disgusted by what I saw.\n\nL is barely 13 years old. I know his friends aren't my business, but I just find it incredibly sketchy that my 18 year old boyfriend is friends with a middle schooler, and I openly disapprove of this. I think she needs to find friends her own age, and I have this opinion of all friendships with such a dramatic age difference at such a formative age. Maybe my issue with this stems from the fact that I was repeated abused by older 'friends' as a 12/13/14 year old girl, but the whole situation makes me really uncomfortable to the point where I can't even hear him say her name without feeling kind of sickened by it.",

      "description": "Everything in these exchanges is quoted (except for one paraphrase, and I know for a fact that the paraphrase is an accurate representation of the statement). \n\nAt my school, I’m on the debate team. In my debate type we’re in teams of two. Now, for a bit of context, the coach of the team is already a bit frustrated with the members of my debate type, so we try to smooth relations with them whenever possible. There was a tournament scheduled to go on today, that I was not going to with my partner, but there were two pairs of partners going to it, one varsity pair and one novice pair. \n\nToday, the day of a tournament, while we were at school, a member of another partnership (I’ll call him “X” for clarity) messages his partner (Y) asking if he could get any Adderall. Y responded with no, and said that if X wanted Adderall he could get his own *at this point Y didn’t know that X was planning on taking it for the tournament*. About a minute later, X texts back and says (paraphrase) “I got some Adderall, you should pay me back $5 on Monday”. At which point, Y informs my partner, who shortly informs me. We communicate over text, and Y decides he’s not comfortable going to the tournament. \n\nAt the same time, we let one of the novice partners (Z) know (in person) that Y will no longer be able to give him a ride to the tournament. Z asks why, and so we tell him about the Adderall. Z thinks about it for a little, and says that he’s not comfortable with going to the tournament either. (Bit more context, varsity members have a huge influence on how novices act, so I was also worried about the influence that X’s behavior would have on Z. I didn’t want to draw him into it, but I didn’t feel comfortable letting Z go to the tournament with X if Z wasn’t informed of the issue) At this point, my partner and I decide that we need to let our debate coach know, since this will mean both teams dropping from the tournament. So my partner, Z, and I talk with our coach, and let them know what X was doing. The coach thanks us (mentioning that this could’ve jeopardized their job had X gotten caught) drops both teams from the tournament,  and says that they will talk with the administration, X, and X’s parents. \n\nThen, we message a group chat for all of the members of our debate type, informing them that both teams have been dropped. X is informed of this, and when he asks why we tell him that we informed the coach. At this point, X gets angry at us, saying that telling her was “unnecessary and uncool”, and accusing us of trying to ruin his life. \n\nPast that point, X gets angrier and angrier, even going so far as to admit that he was trying to shift the blame on to Y.  \n\nX said \n“I'm asked to do something” \n“I do it, and then I am demonized while I'm not present” \n\nto which I responded \n“If you’re trying to shift blame to Y, stop”\n\nX then sent \n“If you're trying to ruin my life, stop”. \n“It should be on him”. \n\nIn that order, no messages in between, so it’s clear he wanted Y to take the blame.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve had to deal with a team conflict this serious, and X seems extremely angry. So, am I the asshole for letting the coach know?",

      "description": "\nA little bit of context: \n\nI was living with my grandmother when my friend (25M) offers me (19M) a room so I can get away from my abusive family. I take it and agree to pay for half the rent and food, plus gas for rides back and forth to work. \n\nEventually his finances became a bit unstable so I agreed to pay for all the rent and he pay for the food, which results in me paying more towards things than him and I don’t mind a bit. \n\nEventually he’s become very controlling about finances. I can’t get anything that isn’t a basic necessity without him berating me about it, saying I have a shopping addiction or feel high of buying things. \nKeep in mind this is after paying for my due share or all of the rent and food or all of the food. To clarify when I say “all” I mean the amount needed for both of us. \n\nLast two weeks he’s been the worst due to his car breaking down and him needing to get a new car, if he were to fix his current one it would cost him more than if he were to buy a new one. I agree to help pay for his car and also pay for the rent and food so he can save a bit to get the car. \n\nAll of a sudden he then wanted to know all of my financial transactions and bills and why I have them or why I do them and pre approve them thru him.\n\nIf anyone’s wondering why I didn’t just move out on my own, I had recently arrived from another country where I had lived with my parents who were extremely abusive and was just a bit confused on everything. \n\nAnyways, the AITA question.\n\nI bought a measuring tape for my waist, which cost 1.99 online. After tax it was a bit over that but I don’t think that’s the big issue. \n\nI get the package and as I bring it in he asks what it is, I proceed to tell him how I got it and how much it cost. He then flips out over it, but doesn’t say much due to his Uber arriving for work. \n\nLater he rants at me thru text messages, telling me how irresponsible I am. How he can’t trust me, that we should split the bills evenly. I tell him that I didn’t think a 1.99 USD purchase is worth mentioning or even a big deal, it’s not like we were broke and our paychecks will come in a few days and I can help him get his car. I tell him sure we can split the bills and he can start paying his part. \n\n Then goes on to say how his life sucks, how everyone is against him. How’s he’s just human clay for everyone? Talks about how everyone doesn’t give him a break, says I don’t care about him. Then says that, that has made him very angry, wanting to end it and how depressed he is. Also says he feels like he’s taking advantage of. \n\nAfter talking a bit he’s agreed to pay half of everything and wrote up a contract and so on. Currently in here feels very tense. \n\nAITA for this, I’m trying to think if there’s any way I could be, outsider opinions really welcomed...\n\nI’d do a tl;dr but I feel it would miss too many details. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway for anonymity. Also, sorry for the long post, but I felt like a detailed timeline would be best. Anyway, here goes:\n\nI broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason I broke up with her at the time was because I felt like she was becoming manipulative. She had mental health issues I tried my best to help her with, but the emotional burden was getting really heavy on me especially since she would guilt trip me/threaten to self harm/threaten to kill herself if I wasn't able to satisfy her need for validation, etc. While I wanted to help, I felt like I was not in a good position to do so. \n\nWhen I broke up with her over call, it actually went pretty well and I thought we could end on good terms. An hour after the breakup, she texted me \"oh by the way, I cheated on you lol\" (almost verbatim) which made me angry as shit. Particularly because the way she said it made it sound like she didn't care and specifically tried to spite me. Turns out a few weeks into our relationship she made out with some guy at some party while drunk, and I was out of the country. \n\nI told her how angry I was, but after a few hours she messaged me again saying she didn't actually cheat on me and it was just something she made up to hurt my feelings. Why she would make something like that up is beyond me, but I told her her manipulative behavior plus her immaturity meant I didn't care if she was lying or not, I was done with her. \n\nAfter that, I tried to cut off communication. She would still message me, literally threatening to kill herself if I didn't reply, and even went to the length of sending me suicide notes and sending pictures of the building she wanted to jump off. This was super fucking alarming, but I also felt like she was trying to manipulate me into staying, so I had to tread carefully. I told her to please get professional help because I couldn't help her anymore, and then stopped replying. \n\nAfter a few weeks, she messaged me saying she got professional help because of the breakup, and she thanked me for that. I replied that I was happy for her, but stopped replying again to continue to keep distance from her. Sometime after this I found out from one of our mutual friends that she wasn't lying about cheating on me after all, so I got angry again and really didn't reply to her messages.\n\nOver the next few weeks, she would message me almost every other night, first sending me Christmas greetings which I didn't reply to. Then she got increasingly angry, she started asking if we could please talk because I was making her have anxiety attacks every night, which I still didn't reply to. She said she just wanted to know what she did wrong, which I felt like I already detailed in the breakup and after it. After a long time of this happening, I decided to just message her that I had nothing more to say and I didn't owe her anything because of how she treated me. She continued to message after this, and I decided to block her on Facebook.\n\nI hadn't heard from her in a couple of days until today, when she messaged me on Twitter (I hadn't blocked her there) and told me something. She said that she had wanted to tell me this since December, but the fact that she \"cheated on me\" wasn't the full story. She said she only found out later on that at that party where she was drunk, she didn't willingly make out with the dude but was forced into it. She only found out about this afterwards because she wasn't fully conscious that night. She said that I didn't let her tell her side of the story, and that I was making her lose sleep and fuck me for being so stubborn.\n\nI had no idea that was the case, because when she told me she just said she cheated on me. I feel terrible for her having to go through that. At the same time, I had no way of knowing the truth there because she told me a different version of it. I kind of feel like she's gonna tell her friends (in our shared friends circle) that I'm an asshole for breaking up with her and treating her like that after having to go through such a thing. AITA for being mad at her, ignoring her, etc. when it turns out I didn't know the full story? ",

Jump to day where I texted her happy birthday and hope she was having a good day so far. She text back her husband got them a hotel room the night prior and today was a surprise. (They have been separated the last 6 months and are deciding to try and work it out as of late) I told her I was excited for her. An hour ago I was checking my Instagram when a picture of her and our other friend from work pops up from an hour ago. I immediately feel hurt and confused. I texted her half joking half hurt confronting her. She told me it was an old picture and she has been with her mom all day. This is where I continue joking to lighten the mood and she just tells me to ask her next time instead of jumping to getting mad. I jumped to getting upset bc this is literally every holiday and every birthday to the point my husband told me why do I even bother getting upset.

      "description": "I (17M) needed a graphing calculator for my college course which I just started and I was looking for a used one as a new one was way too expensive and I only needed to use it for less than a year. I agreed to buy a calculator from someone who used to go to the same college as me and we were supposed to meet today. However, before I was supposed to meet him, one of my friends who I was with happened to have the exact same calculator and decided to let me use hers for the duration of my college course as she would only need it again next year.\n\n After this happened, I didn't need to buy a calculator anymore so 1 hour before we were supposed to meet I messaged him that I had to cancel. I understand that this was very short notice and I felt bad for the seller so I apologized profusely. He didn't take it well and proceeded to send me a lot of messages some of which said \"you fucking confirmed with me, I didn't ask you to pay a deposit because I thought you were nice. You can take the calculator and sell it to your friends but you are not flaking on me 1 hour before we meet. I even lowered the price for you and got it by express shipping so you can get it by this week\". \n\nAt this point I started freaking out because I had never been in this situation before and I'm not a big fan of confrontation, so I apologized again and said  \"You have every right to be angry, I'm not doing this to you on purpose, I'm not doing this to you for fun, but I really cannot buy the calculator\". He proceeded to reply with \"I'm gonna expose you on Facebook, what a flaker, you're going to be famous in \\*college name\\* I'll ensure that.\" \n\nAt this point I was shitting bricks and I even removed my profile picture on Whatsapp because the last thing I want is to be exposed online for something like this. My last reply to him was \"I'm genuinely sorry bro. Wasn't my intention for this to happen because everything on my end was very hectic as well. Apologies for the late cancellation\" \n\nto which he replied  \"I saved your name and picture\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my family and friends what happened and they told me not to worry about it but that didn't stop me from feeling extremely nervous. \n\nAITA?",

I don’t use a lot of toilet paper, and it’s even the free one ply our college gives us. \n\nThis morning I noticed one of my roommates (I have 3) put up two post-it notes about how we need to use a certain amount of toilet paper. I took them down because they were pretty passive aggressive. From the way they were written it seemed as though we don’t know how to use a toilet. \n\nOf course when she noticed they were gone she got pretty pissed off. She sent IN ALL CAPS a pretty pissed off message to all of us asking who took the post-it notes down. I didn’t say anything, but she probably will figure out it’s me. If she writes anymore I’ll probably take them down. I don’t think she needs to put up post-it notes to remind us how much toilet paper we should use. I could have out of spite use a lot of toilet paper, but I didn’t. I just took down the post-it notes. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "There’s a girl I’ve been seeing for about four months now.  Things have been going good.  We have a lot in common.  \n\nEarlier today though she told me she had to have a serious talk with me.  She told me that she is schitzoeffective, which upon my own research is like schizophrenia with added mental illness on top of it.  She also told me that she didn’t work like she told me, but was on disability for this illness.  I really didn’t know what to say.  She explained that she hadn’t told me until now because in the past when she’s been upfront with people about it they start treating her like she’s either dumb or dangerous and that she’s neither.  That she just wanted me to get to know her before I judged her for her illness like people in her past have.  \n\nI was as tactful as I could be.   She wanted to know if I had any questions, but I felt like she had been lying to me the entire time I’ve known her so I didn’t really want any answers from her, I wanted to do a little research about it on my own as I don’t really have any experience with this kind of illness. \n\nSo I told her I needed some time to think and went home to read up on it.  From what I’ve read it is unfortunately a deal breaker kind of thing for me.  While she might be stable now and could be for a long time, it’s likely that there will be multiple breaks for her.   There’s also a lot of evidence that this illness can be passed on through the mother’s side of the family so if it were to ever get that far any children we would have would be at risk.   She’s a great girl and I wish her the best, but it’s just too much for me to handle.  \n\nI don’t know how to go about telling her.   I know she’s had a lot of bad experiences with people turning her away because of her illness and I hate to add to that list, but I feel like if I lie it’s going to be obvious that I’m lying.  ",

With traffic and my work schedule, I would be driving an hour and 15 minutes for the gym and to go to work. My bf doesn’t drive, so I’d have to drop him off at home. I have other clients that I drive to during the day. I suggested getting a new treadmill for home use and he disagrees.

Unfortunately I learned yesterday that the landlord’s kids are starting uni next year and therefore they will be taking our unit (for some reason they didn’t tell me that until I wanted to renew the lease a month before the end of classes). \n\nSo right now I’m staying here for summer term, both of them are leaving. The plan was for me to find temporary roommates and they come back in the fall. But after news broke out they were unsure if they wanted to get a new place together because of the cost and living arrangements. \n\nI’m desperately trying to find something for the summer and finals start in a week, when that happens no one will have time to do anything related to housing. So AITA for talking to some other friends to see if they are interested in being roommates (I really dislike living alone or with people that I don’t know). Right now it’s not serious, just throwing the idea out there, I did give my roommates until the end of the week to have a more clear stand.\n\nTl;dr: have to move out of apartment, gave roommates until end of the week to decide if they want to stick together or not but I’m already talking to other friends as potential roommates ",

Therefore, I get TONS of mail that are intended for other women with the same name all over the north american continent. Now I have to clarify that it is mostly their fault for giving my email as theirs for all sorts of shit. Mostly junk email like form clothing stores and such, but I get important stuff too like bank account statements, services statements, social media accounts, dating apps, travel reservations, job emails, etc. Everyday I get at least 10 that are not for me and are not spam, so I cannot block them. At first, I tried to do the right thing and inform the people involved that they were writing to the wrong person. But nothing changed, if anything more emails that are not for me arrived. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been happening for a good 13 years or so, and I am tired, I don't know how to make them stop giving my email as theirs. So I started messing with them. Cancelling travel reservations. Cancelling dental and beauty parlor appointments. Sending mean emails to their colleagues. For some, I have their addresses and phones, so I also order shit to their house, usually with the message: you should not give my email as yours. One has written back calling me an asshole and what not, and threatening to sue me. I don't live in her country so she cannot legally do anything.  I just replied that this would have never happened if she had not give my email as hers. Am I the asshole reddit?",

      "description": "So a little bit of backstory: I’m an only child, and my whole life, my parents have been shoving me in a certain direction (Joining the police force) and in my country, joining the police force is kind of a big deal. Anyway, I was complainant my whole life. As a kid, I would not be able to play with my cousins and friends, because all I did was study, I would see my cousins playing around my grandparents’ house but I’d be stuck in the room studying under the supervision of my parents, but I really didn’t mind because I was doing it for my parents. I thankfully always got good grades, mostly A+’s. This was my situation until recently(three years ago, when I became a sophomore). When I became a sophomore, I decided that I’ll study according to my own schedules, and that I’ll handle my studying by myself from now on. My grades stayed the same for the most part, out of 12 subjects, I only ever got a maximum of 4 A’s, and the rest were all A+’s.\n\nThis is where the conflict happened, the time when I decided that I want to study on my own was also the time that I realized that I didn’t want to join the police force. While sure, I did not want to join the PF, I also did not know what I liked doing, because my whole life, what I liked was what my parents told me to like. So I was lost and I didn’t know what to do. In sophomore year, I convinced myself that I liked business, and that I wanted to become a “successful entrepreneur “ in the future, so I took a couple of business and leadership classes, on top of my other subjects. Fast forward to my Junior year, I was back to being lost, but my guidance councilor helped me find myself little by little. \nBy the beginning of my senior year in HS, I realized that my true passion was in psychology, and that I wanted to study psychology in university instead of joining the PF. When I told that to my parents, as you’d imagine, it didn’t sit well with them, so I decided to make a new plan, which was trying to get a sponsorship(they would pay for my education, and I secure a job with them if I keep my grades high enough) from the PF, and study a double major in Computer Engineering and psychology, the first degree (CE) was for me to meet the requirements for joining the PF, and the second degree was for my own sake, and what I liked, this was a middle ground between what my parents want and what I wanted. Anyway, I told this to my father, and the words that he uttered from his mouth were some of the harshest things to come out the mouth of a “loved one”. He told me: you’re not enough for a double major, you can’t even get good grades in HS, you can never manage a double major. After he said those words I lashed out, how could he say such words after taking away my childhood? How could he say that after I worked my ass off to achieve a goal that was not mine? How could he say that after I tried to find a middle ground that satisfied him? Those were my thoughts. AITA?",

      "description": "My wife and I are in our early 20s and have been married for 6 months. She is the cooker in our relationship as I cant cook anything except for eggs and toast. She has always made Western food such as steaks, baked potatoes, pasta, sandwiches, etc. She is a good cook but yesterday I casually encouraged her to make something from her background, like fried rice or tofu or noodles or something. \n\nShe makes awesome egg tarts and whenever we go to her familys house they cook very delicious and exotic meals that I’ve never even had before.\n\nShe said she doesnt really know how to cook those things because her parents and grandparents never taught her to cook (she was kind of spoiled). Thus she can only make simple Western food.\n\nI told her she should embrace her culture and that her meals would be way better than ethnic take out. However she said if I wanted it so much I should cook it myself. I told her I can’t because I am super white and the most “exotic” meal from my background is poutine. \n\nAITA for encouraging my wife to be more in touch with her culture?",

      "description": "I don't really know how much background to give on this. I don't want to tell my entire life story. If I was looking for a bunch of circle jerking and validation about how much my parents sucked, I'd post in raisedbynarcissists, but I don't want that. I know my parents suck, but I don't think that's an excuse for me to act like an asshole. So here I am. \n\nMy parents are emotionally immature and selfish people. They did a lot of shit to me that my therapist says is abuse. I'm still wrapping my head around that. I know that I spent a lot of my life bailing them out of bad situations and doing things for them that they should have done for themselves. My mom treated me more like her best friend or her spouse than her kid.\n\nBecause of the years of doing too much stuff for my parents and letting them rely on me for everything, I'm bad with boundaries. It's hard for me to tell them no or to avoid getting over-involved in whatever bullshit they have going on at the moment. So I have to create these strict rules about being in contact with them. Only if I told them the rules, I think they'd freak out. \n\nSo I don't come right out and say \"Hey I'm only going to call you on holidays\", I just pretend to be too busy all the time until it's a holiday. I think they figured it out, because they stopped calling me except on holidays. \n\nExcept last week they had an actual emergency. Like there was something like a burst pipe at their house or something and if it isn't repaired quickly the house could be condemned and they could end up homeless. And old me would have swooped in and fixed all of this for them, or at least emotionally supported them and spent hours on the phone with them and soothed them through all of this. And instead I just sent like 3 or 4 text messages and then when my mom started getting real dramatic about it I just stopped answering because I couldn't deal with it anymore and it was giving me anxiety. \n\nSo here's the heart of the question: Am I the asshole for not telling my parents the truth about our relationship and boundaries? Am I the asshole for not making it explicitly clear that they can not rely on me the way that they used to? Am I the asshole for just leaving my mom's texts on read instead of saying something like \"Hey, I'm sorry but I can't help you with this?\" \n\nI'm feeling pretty fucking guilty about everything but I also feel overwhelmed by the idea of talking to my parents any more than I already do.

He likes to message me while he's at work. Its one thing when he messages me during his lunch or other breaks, but he tends to message me whenever and I don't want to get him in trouble at all.\n\nSo at first, I told him not to message me while he's at work but he simply just tells me that I'm overreacting (sometimes I do), a worry wart (and I am one), and to not worry (easier said than done).\n\nAfter a while, I just ended up ignoring the messages (though still read them incase its an emergency) and don't respond until its either his lunch or he's off work. I really do not like ignoring people, especially my boyfriend, but I also don't want to get him in trouble and even potentially getting him fired.\n\nSo am I the asshole for leaving him on read?",

      "description": "So this is my first post on reddit and English isn't my first language so please excuse possible errors. But this is a long one so there's a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I know each other since 2016 and in the beginning of 2018 we got together after being very close friends. But in 2017 he had a girlfriend, that he only knew for 2 months and he was 1 month in a relationship with her. I told him it was really inappropriate since she has just gotten 16 and he was almost 22 years old. Then I started really not likeing her, tbh due to jealousy but also because she is 2 years years younger than me and at the time she bragged about her self-diagnosed mental illnesses, about hurting herself and how a special snowflake she is (puberty duh). One time he even ignored me for days because I got so angry about her. We had a picknick, I had and still have problems with my hip due to a bone anomaly and my mobility is at times reduced. But he left me alone to clean up because she wanted to be picked up. Then I texted him if she was too dumb to come herself and why he didn't help me. Since then she basically hates me, she blocked me everywhere but they broke up after a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor more than a year they ignored each other. We/he saw her often but she didn't even bother to say hello or even look in our/his direction. Approximately two months ago my former school had a prom I was invited to and I asked, almost begged because it was a special event for me, him to come and as he doesn't like proms he told me no but he said he would at least pick me up there, since it was very late. But then a man went unconsious at the bar he was in, he helped him and called the ambulance. His ex was there too and she didn't knew the man but apparently she got a panic attac so my boyfriend ditched me and took care of her and drove her about 50km home. I ended up having to go home early, because I had not enough money for the cab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I asked how it came that they had contact and he told me, that she started talking to him again and that they are good friends again (remind you they talked for about 2 months, more than a year ago). I started getting suspicious since he didn't told me anything until then and only because I was not very pleased that he ditched me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then they started having more and more contact, meeting every friday and saturday at that bar, her texting him following him on instagram asking him for advice on anything. Then I told him that I don't appreciate this at all and told him to back off a little from this situation because she clearly is into him. She even broke up with her current boyfriend, with whom she was almost a year together. He got very angry and told me to back off because it's none of my business who he befriends and it doesn't matter if it's an ex. I reminded him, that I'm okay with his other exes, with whom he texts from time to time because they are friendly and respectful to me and he knows them even longer than me. But he was going on, telling me as a matter of principle he doesn't refuse friendship requests, especially from someone with very few friends. The disscusion turned into a fight and I demanded, being very enraged, to stop contacting her. For me alone the fact that he got angry so fast was a warning sign. He even told me that if I ever speak to her in a bad way or even do something to her, I could erase his number, because I am a vicious person. The disscusion ended and a few days later we were okay again I'd say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe, still refusing any form of backing off, continued meeting her at that bar and she started texting him very often, at night, at day, even after they met she still texted him further on the same evening. So once I decided to convince him to take me to the bar with him and surprise, surprise, she was also there. He looked at his phone before we got there and said: \"Just a warning, she will be also there. If you don't behave I'll send you home and I'll sleep at my mother's.\" So I already was pissed, because he told me such a thing but I went to the bar and sat at the table with his friends. He apparently told the girlfriend of his best friend to have a talk to me about the issue with his ex. Me, not being up to date, I expected, since we are not bestfriends but still we talk about private issues and us originally liking each other, that she would understand me, but also apparently my boyfriends ex started hanging out with my boyfriends friends and she took my boyfriend's and his ex' side, saying she is nice and I should stop worrying and let them be friends. As soon as his ex came her and my partner of course started talking, then she came to our table just to distract the girl I was talking to, whispering things in her ears, ignoring my attempt to being friendly and saying hello. Even after she went home and my boyfriend sat at my table she texted him and as I was talking to him he just said \"aha aha\" while texting her back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we went home I told him that she was impolite and he said he wouldn't do or say anything, as she wasn't mean to me and she is allowed to ignore me. A fight started, since after all the fights I was already so tired of his shit and told him again to stop hanging out with her, if he wants a relationship with me. He also went on to tell me, that she is clearly not interested in him since she tells him with who she slept/sleeps atm. I was furious and stopped talking to him and went to sleep. But in the morning I lost it again when she texted him AGAIN (after she already texted all night). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also am pretty sure from the context and the behaviour that she more or less starts turning him and his friends against me, since that \"friend\" at my table told me how I shouldn't be so petty and she has serious health and mental issues and I should not take \"her only good friend away\" because she is such a nice person, since she got to know her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then we haven't talked much besides him telling me what a horrible person I am for wanting to break up their friendship, especially since she has few friends, as he says. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I really the bad person in this situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTD;DR: Out of nowhere my boyfriend started being very close with his most recent ex, that ignored him for over one year and I want it to stop.",

      "description": "This is a pretty dumb situation and seems super childish but whatever. Will try make this as accurate as I can as I genuinely don't think I'm in the wrong here but idk I might be a major dick.\n\nBasically, moved into a house with 5 other people, some of them friends and others are just people I kinda know. Everything was perfectly fine for a couple months living together but after awhile one of the house mates got annoyed with me as she didn't think I was doing my fair share in regard to taking out the trash. I'll be honest, I wasn't doing as much as my other house mates because I am quite a minimalistic dude, eat all my food and so the majority of my rubbish is just the odd plastic rapper and I felt like I shouldn't have to take out these gross trash bags with nasty food and other random shit it in it.\n\nAnyway, this house mate asked me to put in my fair share of the cleaning up so I complied as I didn't want to cause drama or whatever, I'll just deal with putting away their gross shit in the bin. What really bothered me was when this house mate talked to another behind my back and said some random nasty stuff about me (\"he's just some troll that sits in his room all day\" I don't if that even matters, and how would she even know??). This was so surprising to me because to this point I had a decent relationship with all of these people, and had done nothing to wrong to them in anyway so I just felt really hurt by this and I confronted the house mates, obviously they denied saying it but I could hear their entire conversation as the walls in this house are really thin (maybe I shouldn't have listened but I heard my name). I let it go and just got on with the trash and I just moved on despite being hurt.\n\nFlash forward 3 months. This house mate has barely looked me in the eye or cared to even acknowledge me when I enter the room, treating kinda shit. I've heard her continue shit talking me here and there but that's whatever I think she's just kind of a dick.\n\nWhat's made me make this post is what happened this weekend. Where I wasn't here for 4 days as I was seeing my gf and I came back to a bunch of rubbish bags to clean up as it was my turn. I didn't think it was fair for me to clean this shit as I thought it was silly for me to have to clean this massive mess that had literally nothing to do with me, let alone the fact that I barely contribute to the trash as it is... After not doing it, the same house mate comes knocking on my room asking me to clean it up as it's my turn. I comply (unhappily of course) and say I'll do it. Three hours later I haven't done it as I was planning to do it when I left to go to the gym, she comes knocking on my room and asks me to do it again (annoyed at this point as I was planning on doing it I don't need to be told like she's my mother...), I said I will when I go out, and as she walks away she muttered \"just do it now not like you ever do anything with your day ever\" (again, no idea where she gets this idea from, that I'm some lazy loser??). I heard her and then went to get ready to go out, don't do the rubbish because fuck that she's acting like a dick for no reason again and it's not my mess. I get back home after some hours and obviously she's in my house mates room straight shit talking me.\n\nAfter all this, I've decided fuck the trash, I want nothing to do with it now, I've been a pushover to this point, I'm just going to throw all my stuff away in the bin in my room so I have nothing to do with the trash and I can just do my own shit. I've blocked her on all social media as I want nothing to do with someone I think is toxic and I plan on just ignoring her and being awkward with her till our lease is finished (this June).\n\nNot sure if I'm the asshole here though, maybe I should just get on with the rubbish and I created drama out of nothing? Not sure, I feel like I've tried to talk to her in a calm and reasonable way but she just doesn't care to look me in the eye and have proper conversation about this that isn't behind my back. I'm mainly hurt by the way I've been treated and didn't care too much about the trash at all.\n\nI know its a long post about a dumb topic but I'm not the best or most concise of writers so sorry about that!",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account, thanks for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in a relationship with someone I love very much, and who requires a lot of attention from me. She loves to cuddle and be held, and I stop what I am doing several times a day to hold her for a bit. She also shuts down when she’s spoken to harshly and is not the greatest at cleaning up after herself. I was a neat freak in my past life but have learned to temper my response to messiness, so we can reach compromises on how often we clean. Being in a messy home gives me anxiety, so I have had to sit myself down and get myself to accept that as long as we’re living together, I will not have full control over our space, and I cannot constantly nag her to pick up after herself.  She is also not great with time/space boundaries, and likes to be together a lot. When she is feeling bad or anxious, I sit with her and talk through what is going on, and hold her, etc. I’m a fairly independent person and do not need a lot of support, so a lot of our energy is focused on her. All of that said, she is loving, kind, generally respectful of my feelings, smart, very funny, and we share the same opinions on almost everything philosophically/socially/politically. We are pretty good at communicating, I have voiced my concerns about everything above and we’ve been working on those issues.\n\nLast night she and I had a few glasses of wine and went to bed. Once we were in bed, we started cuddling, and I put my hands in her pants and started running my fingers through her pubic hair/rubbing the hair around/generally playing with it. This wasn’t meant to be sexual, it just feels nice because she has a full bush. She asked me to stop, I did, and we went to sleep.\n\nIn the middle of the night, we woke up, and she asked me if I remembered the night before. I didn’t quite, I’d had a lot of wine (we were celebrating something). Then as she started telling me, I remembered. Both my girlfriend and I have been victims of sexual assault. I asked her if what I’d done was triggering for her. She said it was. I told her that I was very sorry, and that I would not do that again.\n\nWhen we woke up in the morning, she was still acting off. I asked her if she was still having feelings about what had happened last night. She said she was, and I told her again that I was sorry. She asked me why I did that, and I told her that I only meant to cuddle, I was not trying to initiate sex, and I was sorry. She said she understood. I again said that I was sorry, and she said it was okay, but she was silent. I asked if she wanted to speak about it more or if she’d rather speak to someone else (we are both in therapy). She didn’t say anything.\n\nWe got out of bed and she was silent and barely speaking to me. When she did speak, it was with flat affect, and she didn’t make a lot of eye contact. I figured that she was still processing the event and would talk with me when she was ready. But then she started kicking things around and just seemed generally upset. She was ready to leave for work, and I was still getting ready. I told her that she didn’t have to wait for me if she wanted to go, and she decided to stay, still angry/upset. At this point, I have to admit I became a bit frustrated. I asked her why she waited for me if she was so angry with me. She made a sort of, “are you kidding me?” look but didn’t say anything to me. I wanted very badly to leave for work without her, because we weren’t getting anywhere and also, it would have been quicker and more efficient for me to leave without her (we work about 15 minutes away from eachother in the city, she was driving, I wanted to take the subway). I told her I was going to leave separately, and she became even angrier. So I came back and we got in the car together, to have the tense, miserable car ride that I had been trying to avoid. And because she would've been late if she dropped me off first, but her work has a free parking lot and mine doesn't, she ended up dropping me off at one of the subway stops near her work anyway.\n\nI can’t tell if I’ve behaved badly or not. I am completely, 1000% behind the premise that when it comes to sex, boundaries are boundaries, full stop, no explanation needed. And because we are both survivors of assault, I am also 1000% behind the idea that she gets to decide how she reacts to an event that triggers her. If she feels like being angry, for any amount of time, after we’ve spoken about what happened, that is absolutely fine. If she *needs me to be there to receive her anger*, but not directly respond to it by continuing to ask what I can do, that’s fine as well, although I admit that’s coming up against some of my limits too. But a sexual assault trigger is a trump card in my book, so do what you need to do.\n\nMy concern is that I can feel myself saying, “fine, but this is it” in terms of coddling her in other parts of our relationship. And I’m not sure if that is a healthy way to be feeling, and I am especially suspicious because it’s coming up after I’ve been told that I made sexual advances that were unwelcome, and am having negative feelings around being treated like I’m some predator. I don’t want to be retaliatory, I absolutely want her to tell me when she’s uncomfortable and I’m glad she did. But if she says she’s uncomfortable, I stop doing what I’m doing, and apologize when it’s brought up later and ask her what she needs, then I’m not sure what else to do. I have a feeling that she wants/wanted me to cradle her in my arms, speak gently to her, and let her do whatever she wants around the house after this as far as not picking up after herself, and I am having a very strong negative reaction to that. I *know* that it is absolutely inappropriate to tell someone that they are overreacting to a sexual trigger, but I can’t help but feel like she could be using this incident as a tool to mold us into the dynamic I know she’s wanted. If I’m wrong, and what happened has really triggered some awful memory, then I absolutely should cradle and coddle her until she feels better, and I should be ashamed for getting angry at her this morning. But if she is blowing it out of proportion to get us back to an unequal relationship dynamic, then I am absolutely furious that she would stoop so low.  Am I the asshole for even asking this question?\n\nFYI we are both women, if that matters.\n\nTLDR: I massaged my girlfriend in a way that made her uncomfortable, I told her that I was sorry, but she is still very angry with me. We’ve been working on having a more equal relationship as opposed to one that is primarily focused on her, and I am worried that her reaction to this event is stemming more from the fact that she wants to be coddled than anything else.  AITA for questioning this?",

I know my older sister (29F) is so open to my Mom, to the extent where my mother will even know the latest gossip between my sister and her friends back then.\n\nStuff she did when I tried to open up:\n\nDisregard my request to handle my nanny discreetly for being physically abusive to me as a kid (I wasn't the naughty type).\n\nSaying \"I don't care about your friends, I only care about your score and how you perform in school.\" when I tried to talk about my friends.\n\nDidn't make me feel safe or encouraged/give any good advices, and used my bullying back in school as a joke until now.\n\n\nSince then, I bottle things up more from her, but two years ago, she started to force me to open up, because she is worried.\n\nSo I started to open up.\nWhat I talked about and her responses:\n\nThings to her about my major since she isn't familiar with it, but it seems like she always forgets what I told her, which means I must explain again and again. Because of age, she said, but when it comes to my sister's friends, she even remembers who is the name of my sister's friend's boyfriend. \n\nShe used my story about my ex to prevent me from dating since apparently I am not pretty enough so guys who want to date me are guys who only want to use me. \n\nShe doesn't let me see psychiatrists for my panic attack, saying that I can stop my panic attack by opening up to her; and wanted to bring me to a friend of hers who learns hypnotherapy for fun, and when I refused, she demanded me to tell her all my secrets since it seems like I am scared that I would blabber stuff through hypnotism.\n\n\nI decided to tell her to stop trying to open me up since it makes me super uncomfortable and stressed. She said I shouldnt open up to my bestfriends, but I MUST open up to her since we are family. \n\nI tried to explain that it's not my style, that I am a human and I have the right to choose how I communicate, that she can't expect me to be the same as my sister. \n\nI also told her about how she did all those in the past, and she told that I shouldn't be narrowminded since it's the past, and start opening up to her; yet I don't see any changes.\n\n\nTLDR: My Mom is pretty abusive imo and forces me to open up like how my sister does, when I am not comfortable with it due to cases in the past. She also doesn't want to respect me when I told her I can't do it. AITA for not opening up?",

      "description": "So going into this I'm not sure how to word things to express them as truthfully as I can, from my point of view at least, but here goes. I got into a relationship a couple of months ago with someone who's genuinely lovely, and I don't want to paint her in a bad light at all. I genuinely do care about her, she's great. But she's also a bit of a proverbial mess, for lack of a better way of saying it. A whole bunch of paranoia, anxiety, depression, to the point where she doesn't tell her therapist what's up because she'd probably get sent to a mental hospital. But she meant really well. So for some reason I got in a relationship with them. For a while the relationship is going alright. But it stops going so well after a bit, at least from my point of view. It starts to me to feel like I'm just looking after her and making sure she doesn't just relapse into a much worse state than she's in, try to kill herself again etc. And it starts to get to me pretty badly, so I end up stressing out, anxiety related things etc. So I decide that enough is enough, I shouldn't stress out this much over someone else, and purely for my own sake I decide that I'm going to end the relationship. But retrospectively it seems like that was the very wrong thing to do because I'm scared she's going to go back to trying to kill herself again and that a) she's going to die, and b) that it'll be my fault. \n\nAnd the kicker is that she's had nobody there for her most of her life, really. Her mother is pretty distant but also quite abusive, and she was taken out of school for the last few years of her high school education by her mother, so she hasn't got any friends like that.  \n\nI guess what I want to know is, was breaking it off the right call, for my own sake? Or am I just being a selfish asshole? ",

      "description": "Tonight my boyfriend and I had planned a nice pizza and sleepover night to celebrate being together. Every month on the 3rd we usually spend time together and plan something nice. We both decided last night would be better instead as we both don't have work today. He works early shifts in the morning (had done a 6am-12pm yesterday then went to the gym after for a bit) which I understand can make him tired but he definitely gets enough sleep before work (sleeps around 10pm). It's always difficult when he gets tired as he gets moody if he stays awake but also gets annoyed if he sleeps, so either way it's not good for me, it's always difficult as I never know if I should wake him up. Tonight he ended up lying down and falling asleep around 7.30pm (we were watching Netflix together) so I finished the episode and changed it over so he wouldn't miss any more (I'm fine rewatching the episode with him). I had nothing to do so I was scrolling on my phone from around 8.30pm till 11.30ish. He woke up a few times and every time he woke up he'd huff and say sorry (for sleeping but it didn't sound like he meant it at all). Somehow we ended up arguing around 1am. I woke him up to switch sides of the bed, I also filled his water bottle up and put his phone on charge for him (didn't argue specifically because of moving), I came downstairs and lay on the sofa till 3.30am to give him space and time to calm down. When I got back upstairs, he ended up waking up again, I asked if he wanted me in bed with him and wanted to cuddle and his response to both was \"I don't care\". Recently I've spoken to him about how his attitude and the way he speaks to me makes me feel unwanted/unloved/not good enough. We ended up arguing again because he asked what was wrong so I told him that tonight felt like a bit of a waste to me because I had nothing to do and didnt really have company. I offered to go home earlier on in the night but he told me to stay, which he then threw in my face later on that I could have gone home. I explained that I wasnt annoyed with him sleeping but I was just bored and lonely which he got annoyed at and started accusing me of complaining at him to wake up and sit up (which I didn't do because I knew he would get grumpy). It's now 6 in the morning and I'm back downstairs on the sofa (again after the 2nd argument). I haven't slept yet because I always find it very difficult sleeping on an argument, he's currently asleep in his bed.\n\nI do understand he's tired and I do feel for him because I know it's not nice, but I end up getting upset because he gets so moody and becomes rude to me even when I try help. I explained that I knew he was tired but he didn't help himself by lying down as he knows it always makes him sleepy, and also said that he had enough sleep so it can't be that. He then threw it in my face that I don't \"actively exercise\" so I wouldn't understand what it's like. I feel like this was a dig at me personally, I'm not fat but I guess I am chubby, I weigh 138lbs and am 5'4\". I used to do a small home workout in my bedroom, all core activities to tone up, I haven't done it for about a year so my tummy isn't toned but I personally don't hate it- I like my body, but whenever he mentions something negative I always end up disliking it. I have an hourglassy figure and he always seems to like my body and compliments it when it suits him (like when I send pictures).\n\nThings have been rocky recently so I know that won't have helped tonight but I feel like I'm slowly losing it because I feel like I try more than enough to make things good and do little bits here and there to make him happy and help him.\n\nTldr; planned special (ish) night with boyfriend, he slept very early, woke up later and argued because I said I was bored during the night, he got annoyed at me and accused me of being annoyed at him (I explained I wasnt) I'm now on the sofa because he told me to leave him alone",

      "description": "AITA for making my husband mad or is he the asshole for calling me names? \n\nMy husband and I got into an argument this morning in which he called me a cunt twice. I said, really, youre going to call me a cunt again? Because we had just had a HUGE fight a couple months back where he called me a cunt a few times and I told him it was unacceptable. He promised not to do it again. \n\nWhen I called him out on the name calling this time he said yes, really he was calling me a cunt because I was being a cunt and he would continue to call me a cunt for the rest of our lives if I was in fact being a cunt. \n\n\nJust so you know, here is some information about the behavior that he thinks requires name calling: I had called him and told him we might have overdrawn our bank account again. (We didnt, but i was worried we had. He wants me to keep 500 in all the time from now on) So i told him we might have overdrawn and he was really mad. Last week when we overdrew because he didnt deposit his check he said it wasnt a big deal even though we paid 250 in overdraft fees). This time he was annoyed because he gave me enough to keep 500 as the zero balance (in his opinion anyway). So he was mad, and i said flippantly, whats the big deal. Quit freaking out.\" Which is what he says to me when Im upset about something. He said it last night, for example, after our four year old didnt put the lid on a water bottle after saying she dis, and then knocking the bottle onto my side of the bed, soaking my sheet and blanket. I was annoyed with my daughter for this and was telling her when he told me I needed to \"chill,\" because it \"wasnt a big deal.\" He said i was yeling at her, but I wasnt--though i was obviously annoyed and frustrated. \n\nAnyway, so I guess i wanted to give him some of his own medicine. I said, what 's the big deal? Why are we having this conversation. It's not a big deal. Why are ypu freaking out.\" He responded by calling me a cunt more than once. When i told him I didnt want to be called names, that i didnt call him names, he said he would call me a cunt whenever i am being one and he has no intention of refraining from this behavior. He then said i needed mental help because im unbalanced. (This is his other go to when Im angry at him: Im either crazy or a cunt)  \n\nAnyway--am i the asshole for throwing his dismissive comments in his face (quit freaking out) to provoke a reaction? I have begged him to quit telling me, it's not a big deal when Im upset but he refuses because he thinks he is in a superior position, more able to judge what a big deal is than i am. Or is he the asshole for breaking his promise of not calling me a cunt and then basically saying he would call me names whenever i deserve it? \n\nEDIT: Some people have commented on the missing $500. It wasnt spent. I just forgot to transfer it from VENMO before making a land payment. Venmo is new to me and im using it at my husband's insistence because he doesnt want to put his whole check into our shared account anymore as he wants to use the allowance system and control the money better.

      "description": "This happened a week ago. All my friends and her friends are calling me a massive asshole, so looking for confirmation here. \n\nLast weekend we went out with some friends, ended up at a club. For some background, my gf has a really thorny family history with her sister, who’s like some professional runway model even though I think my gf is a lot prettier. Regardless, it gave my gf a huge complex and constantly puts herself down appearance wise. \n\nSo we’re at the club having fun when I go off to get some drinks for everyone. When I come back I see my gf and her friend whisper talking and some other guy turning away and walking off. They tell me this guy just walked up to my gf to try to chat her up and ask for her number. I’m like whatever and didn’t think it was a huge deal. \n\nWell as the night went on my gf started acting REALLY weird, like she was simultaneously quiet and really snappy at me. It got to the point where she was acting like she’s going to cry, putting her hands over her eyes, so I brought her outside and we just sat on a curb for a bit. Honestly I had thought something really bad had happened to her, like someone had groped her or something. \n\nSo she’s huffing and puffing and acting distressed and I’m begging her to tell me what’s wrong. She asks me not to judge her and I said of course, and she says that she feels horrible because that guy from like an hour ago had hit on HER and not the girl she was with. I was like..and that’s bad why? And then the floodgates opened.\n\nShe was cursing and crying basically, calling that guy all sorts of names but all it boiled down to was the fact that he was quite unattractive apparently and very short/overweight even tho he seemed like just some normal dude to me. Honestly I was a bit taken aback. I told her he probably just thought she was pretty and wanted to talk to her, but my gf was convinced it’s because he thought she’s more in his “league” than the girl that was with her. So I’m trying to comfort her while losing my patience now but I really lost it when she started calling him “Apu” (like from the Simpsons, he looked Indian but not sure if he was). I was like ok nope nope nope it’s too late to deal with this crap anymore and I got up and basically just hailed a cab home. \n\nThe next morning my phone blew up from my gf because she couldn’t believe I left without telling her and stranding her at the club. She said she had to get a ride off of a friend and cried the whole time. I told her that I’ve been very supportive of all her self esteem issues but I have a limit too. After another day she calls me EXTREMELY apologetic saying that she was just upset in the moment but she doesn’t want to break up over this. \n\nWe’ve been in limbo since this and everyone is telling me that I’m overreacting. I don’t know. The stuff she was saying when she was upset was EXTREMELY vile. From the racist comment to everything else. My sympathy just plunged to the ground. But now everyone is telling me I fucked up and that I owe it to her to hear her out and that everyone makes mistakes when they’re at their most vulnerable. I’m really second guessing what I did and I do feel guilty for just leaving without telling her. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "This is my first post, its something that has been  really bothering me so I just had to talk about it, at first I would like to apologize, English is not my first language, im so sorry if I made any mistakes. Here we go.\nSo my family and I went on a trip, in which I came back before everyone, so I stayed alone at home taking care of our 3 cats and doing some chores, I'm not really into staying by myself, so I just did my chores and left to my grandparent's house (we are not neighbors, but live kind close to each other,I can go by feet but its better by car). So this weekend I was kinda back and forth between my house and their's. \nMy mom would be back home at Monday morning, so I would make sure the house was clean since she's very very very strict with my chores. Sunday came up and I decided to leave everything on spot and spend all day with my grandma. Then my father texted.\n\nFather: Your mother is coming back today, she broke her phone, ask your grandmother if she can buy another one.\n\nI aks my grandma, and she says yes, so I answer.\n\nMe: She said yes, what phone she will get, she needs to know the price.\nFather: Same as yours \nMe: ok\n \n(30 minutes pass)\n\nFather: did you already bought the phone?\n\nSo, that's when the shit started happening. My grandfather is obese, which means that he can't move that well, meaning that we can't just go out very quickly or unexpected (my grandmother doesn't drive) public transportation is WAY too dangerous to use at night. So I didn't expect to then to think I would go out to buy the phone.\n\nMe: I thought I would go tomorrow, right now if I leave at the time I get there the mall will be closed.\n\nI thought it was over by that, bOY was I wrong.\nMy father and mother (via my dad's phone) started texting my grandparents. I don't know what they talked about it I just know they were texting.\n\nFather: Your grandmother will leave her card with you \nMe: ok\n\nAt this point I pretty done with is situation, since my grandfather was felling really guilty for not moving around and being able to leave unexpected, and my gm was just overwhelmed by having to pay a cellphone, which is REALLY expensive here.\nMy father text me again.\n\nFather: Your grandmother doesn't have enough money on her card today, she will go the bank tomorrow. Your grandfather will leave some money don't worry.\n\n(Some explanations: my father is an teacher, and my mother is unemployed, we been to difficult times so I would expect him to ask them money, from any emergencies and fresh food)\n\nMe: ok\n\n(An 1 hour later)\n\nFather: Your mother is coming back, don't forget the money, your grandmother card doesn't have enough limit.\n\nMe: ok\n\n\nSo... I ask my grandma \"You are going to buy the phone?\", I asked cause I didn't know since the limit thing. She replied \"as soon as I enlarge my limit\".\n\nMy mother leaves at 9pm, she would be making a 5 hour trip. She gets here at 2am. I was sleeping but got up to take her bags. We finish taking everything out.\n\nShe says \"go to bed, its late, tomorrow we can talk\" I only agree and go back to bed.\n\nMonday morning, I wake up first, she's probably tired... I do my chores and go back to bed to just stay in my computer.\n\nShe wakes up, takes a shower, and then comes to my room.\n\n\"Did you got the money?\" \nI replied \n\"Yes, it's on the table next to your pc\" \n\"Were is the card?\" \nI look at her \n\"I didn't get I thought --\" \nShe doesn't let me finish\n\" I asked you one simple thing and now you mess everything up!\" \nI didn't know how to answer, my mom gets angry very easily and I don't know how to deal sometimes\n\"I can ask grandpa to bring it, he would be here to bring lunch anyways\" \nShe has fire in her eyes \n\"LUNCH?\" She just closes the door.\nI sigh and text my Gp.\n\nMe: can you try bringing GM's  card here? I thought she wouldn't use so I didn't bring.\n\nHe doesn't answer.\nMy mother comes again to my room tries to use my phone to make a call but it's so stressed she cursed everything away and LEFT HOME.\n\nI started calling my grandfather. He answers the third time I call.\n\nMe: Can you try to bring the card? My mom will need it I thought she wouldn't.\n\nGf: I cant rn, my car is not starting, am going to call for a mechanic.\n\nMe: okay, I'm going to you to pick up.\n\nMy mother gets home while I'm making the call.\nI started to get my things to go to get the fucking card. \n\nMom: WHERE ARE YOU GOING?\nme: I'm going to grandma's to get your card\nMom: YOU DON'T HAVE TO \nme: why? \nMom: CAUSE YOU FUCKING DON'T WANT YOU TO DO SHIT \nat this point I'm just done but tried to keep as calm I could \nMe: I will go and come back fast, I'm just trying to solve this fast, the info was messed up and I thought I shouldn't get it.\n\nI tried to explain.\n\nMom: JUST STAY FUCKING HOME!! I GONNA START DOING THINGS TO YOU LIKE YOU DO TO ME! YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW THINGS WORK. \n\n\nI came back to my room and stayed quiet like I don't fucking exist, now that my father is blowing up my phone with all kinds of text, I need reddit to tell me if am I the asshole, cause I didn't pick a credit card? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Never posted here so sorry for the format &amp; length. Also posting from my phone.\n\nAbout a guy we'll call R &amp; his now ex we'll call A, both of whom I've never met. R was drinking one night at a friends, got plastered, tried to drive home. He caused an accident with someone who is a friend of mine who we'll call M. M had to be flown to a hospital in a different state in life threatening condition: brain damage, broken bones, etc.\n\nA confronted me via messages about a post I made- how I cant wait until his birthday so he can be thrown in real jail &amp; he should've been the one with all the injuries. She calls me all kinds of things and says, \"he wakes up screaming at night because of it\", a whole sob story. We had a long conversation about R &amp; M, stuck to our peoples sides &amp; left it not liking each other.\n\nLater, I get a message from A saying I was right about R. She left him because of threats, emotional abuse and manipulation. He hits himself if she says no to sex with him, threatens to report she was taking advantage of him sexually since he's 17, she's 18. A bunch of shit. I say get a restraining order, report he's broken bond (driving when he's not allowed) &amp; harassing her. She has all this evidence on her phone of what he says &amp; does to her but wont report him. I thought about reporting him but I didn't since i have zero evidence.\n\nI talk to her about stuff that's going on with her because R has alienated A away from her friends &amp; she felt alone. I felt I should be there for her. She sends me stuff about R; a video of him racing his friends car 3 weeks after the accident with M and news that he wrecked a different friends car. He just doesnt care.  I said this is perfect, now she has real evidence against him. But she did nothing. I push myself away from her because I don't understand why she doesn't do anything with all the evidence, she just wants to complain about it.\n\nA: why haven't you reported him yet?\n\nMe: why haven't YOU reported him? You're the one involved, the one with all the evidence, you've been personally wronged. Call the police &amp; get an RO.\n\nA: I dont feel like getting an RO.\n\nThis week:\nA finally goes to the police.\n\nA: got the RO but haven't reported him. Im scared he'll know its me so will you come report him so it will be under your name? I dont want to be involved. Also, could you under-the-table stir some shit up for him to email me or DM me so he'll violate the RO?\n\nMe: what? No? What if he screenshots it and uses it against me? I can't afford to get in trouble because of him.\n\nA: Well it depends on how you do it. You'll figure it out.\n\nMe: No I'm not doing that. Hes broken bond multiple times, been behind the wheel &amp; drinking, harassing you, thats enough to get him in serious trouble. Im not going to harass him for you, Im sorry.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nAITA for not getting more involved than talking to her &amp; advise her?",

      "description": "So my best friend, who I will call H has been my friend since we were 13. During high school I was in foster care and I faced a large amount of physical/sexual/emotional abuse from my biological parents, and H always supported me through my battles with mental disorders. Then I was kicked out of my home and my relationship with H went into a downward spiral. I very rarely saw H because she was spending so much time with her new friends from college. I confronted H, and she apologized and claimed it was because of “school” and “work” taking up a large amount of her time so her schedule was always packed. I then met my significant other, who I will call D. H never cared for D and made this fact very clear, and she screamed and yelled at me after D picked me up and I slept at his house for our one-week anniversary. She told me I needed to let someone know before I went out with boys I “didn’t know very well” because “I could end up getting in a bad situation”. I moved in with R after a month of dating and H refused to drive out to see me, even though it was only a 30-minute drive. She always had excuses saying that the “drive was too far” and that “I didn’t help pay for gas”. I told her that I would never put a monetary value on her friendship and she said that was not fair, because I wasn’t the one who had to spend money to hang out. At the time, I did not have my driver’s license or a job, so this really, really hurt. I called her a selfish bitch that cared about money more than her best friend, and she ignored this. I later apologized for my outburst. We started to talk again, but it was never quite the same because she was always hanging out with T. I went through 5 pregnancy scares, and she NEVER ONCE was there to support me through these scary times, and I told her that she was not a good friend for not supporting me through my problems.\n\nNow, D has proposed to me and I am ecstatic. I already have it planned out, and picked a MOH dress to match H. You can imagine my shock when I was given a very confident NO. When I asked why she informed me that she felt she could not live up to MY expectations and that she felt that I had “taken advantage” of her ever since we had finished high school, and that she did not feel comfortable committing to something this major when I have spent the past few years “bumming rides and cash off of her.” The only time I have EVER had her pay for me was when I was going through depression and I asked her to bring me food, and she only did this ONCE. Other than that, she has driven me around only a handful of times, so overall I would guess that she has only spent $50-60 on me. I brought this up to her and she LAUGHED and said I was “proving her point that I was only focusing on myself and my own problems.” I have not spoken to her since. My fiancé tells me that she is being a huge bitch and a terrible friend, but when I asked one of our mutual friends they agreed with H. Am I being the asshole???\n",

      "description": "*All included names are fictitious, but the situation is too real*\n\nBack in August, I introduced my roommate and longtime friend Joey to my friend Monica, whom I met in a class we shared in the spring semester.\n\nIt didn't take long for Joey to develop a very strong crush on Monica, and they've already gone on a handful of dates. However, unbeknownst to Joey, his feelings for Monica are unrequited.\n\nIn my private discussions with Monica and Joey, I've gleaned some very important details about the situation.\n\n1. Monica is aware that Joey \"probably\" has feelings for her, but they've both been very passive about discussing their relationship. She's been waiting for Joey to confess his interest in her so that she could let him down. So it looks like for better or worse, she's been stringing him along for at least four months.\n\n2. Joey has told me in no uncertain terms that he likes Monica. In fact, he's already begun to refer the two of them as a couple despite it not ever having been communicated.\n\n3. Monica has feelings for me. And damn it all, I can't conceal my emotions too well. I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her too just from how much I blush with every little hint (read: very obvious sign) she gives me. I'm pretty sure it's because she likes me that she doesn't like Joey.\n\nI'm not the type to go behind someone's back. I've already relayed all the information I've listed here and more to Joey. I made it clear to him that I have feelings for Monica and that it's likely that she actually has feelings for me. His reaction has been expectedly poor, basically outright denial.\n\nI've encouraged Joey to talk to Monica about the situation, but he still hasn't, probably for fear of rejection. It's been about six weeks already and two weeks ago, I made him an ultimatum: In a week's time, I would talk to Monica about the situation to get things straightened out if Joey didn't do it himself.\n\nAs you can guess from the wording, I still haven't talked to Monica about it despite saying that I would. I really want Joey to get the closure he needs by doing it himself, because I'm sure the whole situation is painful enough and I don't want to hurt his feelings any more than they already are.\n\nThat being said, I don't want to continue to put this part of my life on hold for the sake of Joey's feelings. I feel like I've waited long enough and said everything that I could to be as transparent as possible about everything.\n\nSo with all this in mind (and more, if you need more information), would I be the asshole if I made a move on Monica?",

      "description": "Little bit of context here... My parents are getting a divorce soon. My Mom suddenly told us she was extremely unhappy and she needed \"a month\" to herself. 2 months later and we come home to find most of the furniture in our house gone. I live mostly with my Dad, only seeing my Mom a couple of times a month. My sister lives mostly with my Mom. My sister comes to stay 2 days out of every week. Before I got the rats she was living with my Dad and I for the most part. I think me getting the rats stopped her from coming to the house as often as she used to. Now, I come from a relatively wealthy family and we have a large house with a granny flat outside. For my case, it was a storage room that I cleaned up specifically so I could have pet rats out there. My sister knew I wanted rats and she has fought the idea of me getting them for YEARS. My Dad happily agreed to get them when my Mom left because he knew they would be able to cheer us up like nothing else, as my Mom refused to let me get some when she lived with us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister doesn't have a phobia of rats, but she absolutely HATES them. I've known this fact for years. Before I got the pet rats I would mention wanting to get them to my Dad and he said no multiple times until he realised just how happy it would make me. I was actually at my Mom's house when he told me I could get them (I had jokingly been texting him about getting them and he said I could get them if we put them outside). I was visibly shaking. My Mom turned around and saw me and she literally thought I was gonna pass out. That's how excited I was. I told my sister to get her mentally prepared for me getting the rats and she FREAKED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit and as I said before she stopped coming home a lot. She claimed it was the quietness of the house, but I still feel bad. I feel like the asshole, but I also don't. I'm completely understanding of her hatred for them, so I don't show her photos or even talk about them in front of her. She's seen them before, but that's because she went out to see them. They've never even been inside the house. They bring me so much joy and happiness, but I'm crushed. My Dad loves my sister and it hurts him that she doesn't come home as often. He doesn't blame me, but I blame myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got pet rats KNOWING that she would hate them and would react badly, but I also love them so much. They're my little babies and I spend so much time with them. I'm conflicted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also point out I have 4 cockatiels as well and my sister LOVES them. She didn't want anymore pets because she thought I couldn't take care of them, which really isn't the case at all. She made it clear for years she would rather die then live with a house filled with rats. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for getting rats when I knew my sister would hate them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Next day over lunch my sister was showing me the pictures of her in the said dress to get my opinion about it, in the hindsight it was my cue to shower customary praises. Here is how the conversation went.\n\nMe: it’s good.\nSis: I know it doesn’t look so eye catching in the picture but it is very beautiful when you see it in real.\nMe: but shouldn’t it look beautiful in pictures too, because picture are the reminisce of the moments. When you look back at those pictures years later you regret the not so eye catching dress you were weari......(*stopping mid sentence)\n\nAs I was saying these words, I was feeling the intensity of each word and its impact on my sister. She immediately started regretting buying the dress and started telling how she wanted a slightly cheaper dress(~$42 cheaper) but the salesperson over there directed here towards this “boring” dress. She immediately called up the shop to stop them from doing any alteration and customisation that she requested, but they informed her that they had already dispatched it for the said instructions. She just starts crying.\n\nI offered her to buy the second dress \n but she refused it.(she and her fiancé are funding their own wedding without taking anything from parents)\n\nI am feeling like shit right now.",

      "description": "So last night my sister invited me out drinking with her and some friends of hers (acquaintances of mine) and we had an overall good time and it was a blast, however something from last night is just bugging me.\n\nMy sister's friend has, in previous encounters, expressed her interest in me, and it was mutual. However, my sister told me that her friend has a lot of baggage, and that she'd prefer if I didn't pursue her. No problemo, I'll respect her wishes and just drop it. From previous encounters I know this girl has a lot of issues with trusting men because she's had a bad stretch of guys and I feel for her on that.\n\nHere's where the issue of last night comes in, one of my sister's friends is a shameless womanizer. He's a great guy and I enjoy his company, but he is very honest in that he likes to date and sleep around (no judgement there I've done the same). My sister has also previously had a fling with the guy. So my sister was progressively pushing them together over the course of the night and by the time I left to go home they were making out in the bar. I'm concerned that my sister has set her friend up to be hurt by a guy that she knows is a womanizer when she knows her friend is looking for an actual relationship. While it technically is none of my business it's the kind of behavior she's exhibited in the past where she's unintentionally set a friend up to get hurt by trying to play matchmaker and not taking into consideration the consequences of her actions. I would like to confront my sister about this kind of behavior and how it can it be toxic not only to her friend but also to her friendships with people and her friend circle.\n\nSo WIBTA if I opened my mouth and told my sister that it probably wasn't a good idea for her to push them together? I'm torn on this one\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Sister set up her friend that wants a relationship with a guy who is not really a relationship kind of guy. I think she didn't think this through and just set her friend up to get hurt. I want to tell her that but am unsure of if I should.",

      "description": "So... My SO and I have been dating for just shy of a year, living together for about 6 months. I always knew she had mental issues, but she seemed to manage them to an acceptable degree, and during the first while, I didn't mind.\n\nHowever, after we moved in together, especially the last 2-3 months, it's gotten... Really bad. Anxiety, depression, general mental health issues, and it's become so bad recently that it's dragging me down too. We've talked about it many times, including the possibility of getting professional help, but she refuses, she only wants to work on it herself, or at least with my help.\n\nHowever... Nothing has changed, in fact, it's arguably gotten worse since we took active attempts to get better. This is where the second part comes in. Her lifelong dream is to have a family, 3 kids, a dog, suburban house, the works. I've never cared much for it, but never had much of an opinion on the matter either. However, recently, I've started to have an epiphany that I might not want that life... At all. We've discussed it before, and we agreed that I would tell her again if it became a real thing, and she would understand. Life goals change, that's just how it is. However, I'm not sure if I just, don't want that life at all, or if I don't want it with her... With all her mental health issues, I don't see her being able to be a good mother (daily anxiety attacks, caused often by disruptions in her daily rhythm... And kids aren't exactly predictable), and I'm scared I'd effectively be a single father.\n\nNow, the dilemma is... It's true, that I don't think I want the same future she does. 90% sure, but there's still a chance. However, the main reason is her mental health. I don't think she'll get better unless she gets professional help, certainly not better enough to look after 3 kids and a home. But she's made it very clear that she will never go to a psychologist, or similar, again (bad previous experiences), and nothing I can say will change that.\n\nSo... WITBA for using the \"I don't want kids after all\" excuse? We've talked about it before, and she's said she'd understand, these things change sometimes. I feel like it'd be easier for her to handle than her mental health, which is a... Very touchy subject for her. On one hand, I feel she deserves to know. But on the other... It won't change anything, she won't see a professional anyways, so what does it matter?\n\nPlease do give your opinions, I'm a bit at a loss here.\n\ntl;dr: I will probably break up with my girlfriend due to her unwillingness to seek help for her mental health issues. Should I tell her the truth, or tell her an, also true, but less so, reason?",

      "description": " \n\n* My TA encouraged me to join a group with 2 other girls. My team members did most of the proposal before I arrived to the group, and said it was only fair that I had to do most of the final paper.\n* The week the proposal was due I was busy every day from 8am-11pm so I couldn't meet up that week, but offered to do whatever work I could. They asked me to edit their proposal, so I edited it.\n* Last week, I got sick with a flu and got pink eye, so sitting up and using my eyes was difficult. I also had two final exams last week, and 2 on this recent Tuesday. The final paper was due today at 5pm.\n* One group member said, \"get your sections to me by Monday night\" so they could have the final draft ready by the time that office hours on Tuesday. I told her that I would try my best, but that I was sick and had several finals, so it might not be the greatest draft.\n* Monday night, I've written up a rough draft. I sent it to them around 11pm with an apology and an explanation that I had to study for my other finals the next day, but I'd have the final draft ready by Wednesday.\n* Group member texted me at 2am when I was still up studying for finals. She said that she had never wanted me to join the group in the first place, that I left all the difficult parts for them, that she didn't care what was going on in my life because I had the whole weekend to work on it, that I'm a student and I should know better how to behave in a group project, that she was \"so very sorry\" for whatever was going on in my life but that I can't complain because they did the project proposal for me. She also said that I could do my own project if I couldn't keep up.\n* She responded \"ok\" to my apologies. I told her I would continue editing the paper right away, and did so. She told me \"Fine, have it done by Tuesday night then. is that good enough?\"\n* I e-mailed the professor asking if I could do the group project alone. He was curious as to why I wanted to do the project alone 3 days before the deadline, so I explained the situation. He understood and told me I could use the same concept and the same work that I had already done.\n* I texted my group members that I was doing my own project, because I couldn't work with them anymore. It was causing me a lot of distress because honestly I'm sensitive and not used to being talked to in that way. I removed most of my work from the paper and wrote my own version of the parts they had completed, and turned in my own version.\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr\\*\\* Group members presented me with an early deadline that I was unable to meet, group member was upset that I didn't get it done because of sickness/finals. I left the group and did my own project. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Long story short we both went to cosmetology school together about 2 years ago and are still, essentially still learning. She has done some good work and did my hair before but back in October I sent her a photo of a color and cut that I wanted to try.\n\nWe agreed and met up at the salon where she is apprenticing. She did the cut first, which was basically a one lenght shoulder length bob, maybe some long layers towards the ends and a fringe. Well somewhere towards the middle I can tell she is doing shorter layers, and cut a hole! Basically I had a mullet (and yes it's still growing out as a mullet) when she did my color I brought it up and asked of she thought she cut a hole. She said she thought she did but cross checked and it was fine. It was not. It looked ugly straight and I could even tell she struggled with making it look pretty once styled. For photos, she basically posted a shot from the back with my head tilted up. Optical illusions. I felt horrible. I knew she cut most of the length from the front and chopped into it all around the crown. If I put my hair in a ponytail it looks like a bob. It wasnt the cut I asked for and she didn't even cut a bang.\n\nSo I had some girls at my salon try to do some damage control because I knew it'd be a week before we were both free to try and fix it. All they could do was give me a side swept bang to try to blend thelayers but the damage had been done. \n\nThe next day I texted her and said that it did turn out to be very choppy and she cut a hole in the front (actually 2 holes for each side) I mentioned it didnt look right and I was having trouble styling it. And that we all have off days and it happens.\n\nWell she never replied or acknowledged my text. She had replied to every other message since we met except for this one. In school we are taught to apologize and try to make things right by trying to fix the cut. She could have had me come back and let her mentor assist her to try and fix it.\n\nWell it's now March, and she never replied or acknowledged my concerns. My hair is finally growing out but it's still a mullet and will eventually have to be cut again to even out the two lengths (ear length and shoulder length) my boss is nice enough to trim me every couple of months to help keep it growing nicely. And eventually when I have some length I'll let him cut my hair.\n\nI texted that girl today and let her know I didn't think it was cool she never replied or acknowledged her mistake and tried to make things right.\n\nThat was earlier this morning and she still hasn't replied and I realized she unfollowed me on IG. Maybe even blocked and unblocked because it shows I dont follow her either (I never unfollowed her).\n\nI have hated this cut since the moment she jacked it up and the color doesn't save it. I have to see it/deal with it every day. I know it's just hair but shit takes a long time to grow back. I figure it will be better closer towards the end of the year.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "I rarely go on tinder, and when I do it's mostly just for shits and giggles. I just like swiping through when I'm bored and almost never get a real conversation going. Recently someone super liked me and he seemed friendly so I matched with him.  We started talking about our common interests, etc.\n\nThen he asked for my number, and it all got too real for me. Even though I'm in an open relationship, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable actually dating or hooking up with another person (my partner and I have kissed other people, but neither of us have gone further). I told my friend the situation and she got all mad at me, saying I was leading people on by not being upfront about what I want in my profile, etc.\n\nI told the guy my situation and he said he wasn't looking for anything in particular either, so I'm not sure why my friend thinks it's such a big deal? I understand that tinder is a dating app and people have certain expectations, but I don't think I owe them my full story right off the bat. I wasn't flirting with him or anything, I was just having a casual conversations and I did tell him after a bit so it's not like I was really hiding anything. I feel like I shouldn't be responsible for people's assumptions, and matching with someone on tinder doesn't necessarily mean you're definitely going to want to date/hook up with them no matter what your situation is, so what's the big deal? AITA?\n\n\nTL;DR My friend got mad at me for talking to a guy on tinder and not immediately telling him I'm in an open relationship, and that I'm not super interested in dating/hooking up, just looking for conversation.",

      "description": "My grandfather passed away in early December, and while I was very saddened by his passing I chose not to attend his funeral. This is because the majority of my family is fairly spread out throughout the US, so any visits are rather costly with airfare and hotels if someone doesn't have room for my fiance and I to stay for some time. And unfortunately we're one of the many families living paycheck to paycheck, so we don't exactly have a lot of extra money to spend whenever we feel like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it's not that I didn't want to go, and we did have some money available, but spending it on travel costs could've likely meant that we wouldn't be able to afford our mortgage payment for the month, especially since this was around the holidays so it would've been extra expensive. Sadly this was something my mother didn't seem to understand, and she was very upset when I told her I would not be going. She was very angry with me and went on about how all my many cousins and other family members were coming, it's so selfish of me not to attend my grandfather's funeral, I'm just being cheap, she planned the funeral closer to Christmas so I could be there for the holidays and now I'm ruining her Christmas, and the like. This phone call ended with my mother in tears and hanging up on me, so of course I felt like absolute shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe funeral came and went, I didn't attend, and my mother has barely spoken to me since our exchange over the phone - she didn't even answer my call on Christmas day. Many of my other family members shared the same sentiment as my mother, that I was selfish, cheap, etc., though none of them offered to pay my way out there. I'm very sad that I wasn't able to go to the funeral, and I'd like to think my reasoning for not going is justified, but I can't help but wonder should I have tried to do more to get there? Should I have just paid the mortgage late, or maybe return some Christmas present I'd already bought by then, and does it make me an asshole that I didn't? I'm sure my mother would say I am, and part of me does feel like maybe I didn't try hard enough, but I'm very torn.",

      "description": "Obligatory mobile formatting apology. \n\nSo me(26) and my girlfriend(25) are set to get married, when and where I could not tell you as of yet. We're aiming for a fall 2020 date so we have some time. It's looking to be a medium sized event that we're mostly paying for ourselves with our parents handling the \"extras\". Most of the decisions have been made by her, which I'm completely fine with. She wants a Disney themed reception which each table representing a Disney couple. A song from her favourite band is going to play at our first dance. So on and so forth. The colours were techically picked by me, I don't hold ownership over the idea and she can change them if she wants they just happen to fit our tables Disney couple. It took some convincing but I also got to choose the song that plays while we exit the church and if I can convince them, a charity group can have a presence at our reception. \n\nOur current stand still is over my groomsmen. \n\nShe insists on having her nephew and brother stand up with me. I disagree. \n\nHer nephew is currently 16 and in all honesty, I absolutely love the kid. We're thick as theives and are each others lifeline at boring family functions. Shes rather close to him as well, he was raised by my girlfriends mother and thus has a more brotherly relationship with my bride to be. \n\nHer brother is 12 and they are rather estrange because of their age difference. He's a good kid just our conversations are that typical adult/child \"how you doing, buddy\" chat. My girlfriend will admit that their relationship is a distant one. \n\nAs for the rest of the wedding party...\n\nI have 3 people lined up and she has 5, not including her niece(which is a whole other conversation). If this were an issue of evening the sides I have 2 others I could stand with me but even then she wants her brother and nephew up there. \n\nI disagree having them up there primarily because I feel I should choose my groomsmen. While She says that since they're family they have to be a part of the wedding, I agree just not as my groomsmen. As ushers sure. My own son(7) I don't want as my groomsmen and even though she wants him to be, I'd rather see him as the ring bearer.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole here ? ",

      "description": "Some background: My boyfriend and I live together about 20-30 min from the airport. For most trips he’s gone on, I’ve dropped him off and picked him up at the airport (including his family on one occasion). The only exceptions to this have been when it’s in the middle of the workday or I’ve been out of town myself. I don’t do as much traveling without him, but he’s never picked me up or dropped me off at the airport for various reasons. \n\nThe story: so a few days ago he was coming back from a trip with one of his best friends. When I asked him beforehand what his flight times were I told him I’d be able to drop him off but since he was getting back at 2:30am and I had work training that started early, he’d have to find his own way back because I needed sleep. He wasn’t thrilled about this, but didn’t complain. While he was on the trip, the Ethiopian air flight went down, and lo and behold he was scheduled to be on a flight with a Max 8 on the way back. Naturally, he was freaked out and got another flight but was still on a Max 8 for the first leg of the trip. This flight got him back at 1am, which was still way too late  for me as I often struggle to stay awake past 9-10pm. He doesn’t like watching TV shows with me for that reason; I normally fall asleep mid episode. I was nervous about his first flight and kept on checking flight tracker to make sure everything was ok, and fought to stay awake while waiting for him to text me that he landed safely. That was 10:30pm, and even then I drifted in and out a few times. Needless to say I was asleep by 1am when he called me that he landed and to ask if I was picking him up. I was like “...no?” not thinking anything had changed from our previous agreement. \n\nHe gets home and he’s mad I didn’t pick him up, complaining it cost him $30 and that he thought it would’ve been nice to have someone be excited to see him after the scary plane ride. I told him from my perspective, he had landed the scary flight already, and I wasn’t worried about the second flight (if the second flight was the Max 8 I definitely would’ve picked him up). I also maintained that airport rides are a favor not an expectation. It’s been a couple days and he’s still mad at me about it. AITA?",

      "description": "Alright so my younger brother (6) and younger cousin (8) have developed a close friendship lately and YC has been coming over to our house practically every weekend. YC has been touching YB inappropriately multiple times; things like putting his hands down his pants, head in his shirt, grabbing his face etc. everyone says it’s normal for kids that age to be doing things like this but it makes me uncomfortable and whenever he sees me catch him, he stops, leading me to believe he knows it’s inappropriate. they’re also extremely LOUD. They sit in the living room practically the entire day playing video games and yell and i cant stand to sit in there at all. even when i’m in my room i can hear the yelling and i have to put my earbuds in and listen to something to drown it out. I know he’s just a kid but he makes me so uncomfortable and i feel bad about it, AITA? ",

We’ve been roommates since August and it’s now November and I haven’t had a good nights sleep since I moved to college. I haven’t said anything to her yet because I didn’t think it was right for me to ask her to sacrifice her sleep for mine, but it’s gotten to the point where I’m close to tears because I’m always so tired. I either can’t fall asleep, wake up multiple times a night, or get woken up at four in the morning all because of her TV.\n\nI’ve tried everything, I’ve tried sleeping pills every night, sleep masks, ear buds, and any combination of the three and I always wake without fail.

      "description": "Happy New Year everyone! TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nI participate in a club at school very actively, and leadership positions within the club were being picked for another rotation. A friend of mine (a junior), who I met last year and have bonded with, applied for a position and didn’t get it. I should mention that she is extremely petty and sensitive and will blow up spontaneously on the slightest things (I’m sure you all know those kinds of people).\n\nThe position was filled by a senior, who has done some outstanding work for the club such as organizing events, taking charge when needed, etc. However, he came down with some sort of sickness and wasn’t able to come to school for a long period of time. The reason he was absent though wasn’t widely known, and I only knew because I was also somewhat close friends with him. A lot of people in the club were giving him crap behind is back for being absent, as the club required no truancies since there is much to be done. \n\nDuring an after school potluck, after the positions were announced, she went up to me and told me “that the people picked for these positions were stupid.” I asked what specific position was she referring to, and she said the position she applied for. She claimed (raising her voice) that the person who got it (the senior) was never here and that he did nothing for the club.\n\nNow, when I heard yet another person talking crap about him, I finally got fed up and defended him. I said, matching her volume, that he was absent because he was sick, and pointed out that if she was absent people wouldn’t say that she was “never here.” I also mentioned that he did a ton for the club, and named the specific things he did. \n\nAt this point, she started crying. There was a semi crowd around us, but mostly friends/acquaintances, all familiar faces. It wasn’t loud crying, no sobbing, but you could see tears. I apologized and said that I didn’t mean to come off as angry or directly hitting her. She ignored me, and despite me repeating once or twice more my apology as I thought maybe she didn’t hear me, I still got no response.\n\nShe then texts my best friend, who is in that semi crowd, who saw everything, and they walked off and talked. When he came back I asked him (my friend) if she was pissed at me, and he replied with a stern “yep.” He explained to me that she had a lot going on at that time with her boyfriend and that I tipped her off. He said she needed someone to be angry at, and I was that person. \n\nI didn’t think too much of that, reasoning that it would all blow off and we’d be back to normal after this break is over. But it seems I was wrong. I have streaks with her on Snapchat, and I don’t open streaks that others send to me. I didn’t realize that she stopped sending me streaks, and that I was continuously sending her snaps with her not returning them. One day, I see “*insert her name here* is typing...” I thought “huh? Is she apologizing?” \n\nI was wrong. She sent a chat saying, “I’m sorry who is this? I don’t talk to jerks”. I at first responded *sigh* then sent this:\n\n&gt; *insert her name here* I’m not going to apologize again, I understand that you were going through some stuff that day but all I was doing was defending someone that was also going through a lot; if that constitutes being a jerk then I guess I am one. You know for a fact that what I said I had no bad intentions towards you or anyone else, so please don’t take that out of proportion. To me you’re still a friend, and it’s probably not the same way, and that’s fine. I would much rather have you be my friend, but I tried to mend things, successful or not. I hope you had a Merry Christmas and will have a happy new year!\n\nShe replied  “so *my best friend’s name here* told you what happened?” And I said, “no, I asked him if you were mad and he said yeah, you were going through some stuff” and she left me on read.\n\nI’m pretty convinced she doesn’t like me, but not sure. It hasn’t bugged me that much per se, as her opinion/friendship was always rocky, but I don’t want friendships to end, nor do I like people severely disliking me.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nTL:DR - friend applied for a club position, didn’t get it, and bashed on the person who did get it. The person was absent from school for a while due to a sickness, but few people knew why he was gone, and everyone was giving him crap for it. After getting fed up with everyone saying crap about him, I snapped at my friend by saying he was sick, and that he does a lot for the club. She cries, and I later find out that she was going through some stuff that day with her boyfriend. She texts me a few weeks later, saying “who is this, I don’t talk to jerks” and I send a paragraph (see above). ",

      "description": "So a little background, I am a single gay guy in my 20s but I am not really that into \"the scene\". I have been out for about four years and maybe gone to gay bars less than ten times total. Mentioning all of this to explain that I don't really know how things typically work in this kind of space. Also important, when I do go to gay bars I go to hang out with my friends. I am not opposed to meeting someone in person but anything past chatting with someone I meet in a bar isn't my style. \n\nA bunch of my friends (all straight besides me) and I went to one of the bars in town. We are all dancing together as a group and it is late in the night so I am pretty drunk. These two (gay) guys come up and talk to one of my female friends. They're on the opposite side of the group but I can hear them laughing and occasionally glancing my way.\n\nEventually one of them walks over and starts talking to me. He introduces himself and says I am \"really cute\". I say thanks and he says that his friend (the one still talking to my friend) really wants to buy me a drink. I am (drunk) confused and I ask why his friend wasn't the one who came up to talk to me. He says that his friend is kind of shy and was too nervous to come over himself. \n\nAs I mentioned before, I am not really here to meet anyone but that was a pretty huge turn off. I'm a fairly confident guy and I am attracted to confident, sure-of-themself people. Some guy sending his friend over to see if I \"liked him back\" felt very middle school to me.\n\nI take a second to think and respond with \"Your friend is really cute but I am not interested in a guy that doesn't have the balls to come talk to me himself. Sorry\". I say it in a very nice way and do a little (probably slightly patronizing) shrug. He heads back over to his friend and they disappear. \n\nAbout ten minutes later the friend pops up next to me and introduces himself and asks to buy me a drink. I don't miss a beat and say \"Dude I'm really sorry but I am just not interested in a guy that sends his friend over to tell me you think I am cute. We are in our 20s... sorry\". My tone wasn't rude but I probably could have been a little nicer about it (drunk directness). \n\nWell he looks like I slapped him in the face. I have no clue what his friend told him but I hasn't expecting instant rejection. He does a 180 and stalks away. Most of my friends saw and heard us and it is instant chaos. Half of them area like \"dude why were you such an asshole!\" the others defended me and said I wasn't really rude, just direct. Some said I was being petty and he was just utilizing a 'wingman' and others agreed that it was very middle school.\n\nSo we are turning to reddit to see if you all have any opinions. Thanks!\n\n",

      "description": "Okay so a little background to my relationship with my dad. My dad is pretty strict but can also be very nice to me and my siblings and he has made huge contributions for my interest in music for example, escpecially since he’s very interested in music himself. Of course I am very grateful about this. In my later teens (I’m 19m) we have built somewhat of friendship since we share alot of the same interest. He has got somewhat of a bad temper though and he is very stubborn. I could be hard to deal with when I was younger because I did alot off dumb things with my friends and I hated almost all my teachers (now I love all of my teachers). This could make him extremly angry and the occasional slap has been awarded for my missbehaviour. Nothing to traumatasing really.\n\nNow I’m in the last grade of swedish highschool and to get to the point. I was feeling sick the other night (I still am) and felt that I couldn’t go to school. As soon as I realised this I also knew my dad would be unhappy about it. He proceeded to tell me that I was being lazy and told me to go to school anyway. I’m not saying he was wrong but it kind of pissed me off (I guess I have inherited his temper). I proceeded to angrily tell him that I’m old enough to decide wether I’m well enough to go to school. I want to believe that I am humble enough to understand that I probably did not sound as mature as it seems. I went into my room, called in sick, and went to bed. He proceeded to storm into my room, calling me a spoiled middleclass brat and so on, also calling me weak. As the true millenial I am I became somewhat offended and started talking back whilst laying in my bed. He told me to shut up whilst walking out to shout at my other brother for something. Note; Telling someone to shut up in Sweden is a bit harsher than in english. Hence (the fuck). I told him ” you shut (the fuck) up” back and he turned back into my room, grabbed me by the throat while I was still laying in my bed and said something along the lines of ”don’t you ever tell me to shut the fuck up you understand me?”. I got mad and went to school because I did not want to be in the house anymore. I mean school worked out okay so maybe he had a point.\n\nWas I being disrespectful to my father or does he need to calm his tits. Maybe the throath grab was a bit to much? I don’t know I’ll leave it to you guys.",

The thing is, though, that I kinda panicked and finished about the rest of the project because I was worried he wasn't going to do it this night. I realized this, and I kicked him out.

      "description": " We’ve been planning to move in together for the longest time, then she gets a boyfriend, they’ve only been together 5 months but has known each other for longer and already want to move in with each other. My biggest pet peeve with him, is that he hasn’t asked her to be his girlfriend, he just started calling her that. \n \nShe’s moving into a one bedroom, in 6 months she’ll be able to put in a transfer request to a bigger apartment so that i can move in. She said i have 6 months to save up money so that i can move in. But she didn’t bring up that she’d be moving him in...I don’t think it’s fair to me, to stay on the lease when he can be on it. The only problem is, is that he’s on probation and the apartment runs a background check on the applicants. She’s asked me to stay on the lease because he’s almost off probation, and she won’t be able to get the apartment by herself. But i think if she really wanted to move in with him, she should wait til he’s off probation...if she even can get an apartment with him.\n \nShe told me that she asked him if it would be okay if i moved in with them in 6 months and he said it’d be fine. Nobody that i know of moves out with their boyfriend and in with their best friend, that’s unheard of. I even told her that i wouldn’t move out with if i moved in with my boyfriend. I personally don’t want to move in with them, id feel like the third wheel all the time. I might as well get my own spot.",

      "description": "TL;DR - I feel like my friend is treating me in a second rate manner despite the respect ive shown him, and barely initiates plans\n\nHey guys, i recently started my first semester in college to study music after graduating high school year early.\n\nWith that being said, i am working part time, as a full time student, with some responsibilities at home in addition to personal responsibilities such as learning to play guitar and diversifying my musical tastes. My schedule is kind of full.\n\nMy friend Brent (name changed) ive known off and on since 7th grade, but since 11th grade ended, and we regularly talked, has moved an hour away and attends school in that town. He is only in town on saturdays, and i have a class on saturday that ends at different times depending on how long the lecture is.\n\nBrent and i like talking about music/guitar and otherwise have a lot in common, and he expressed multiple times that he wanted to record some short project with genres that we both like, as it would help both of us to have a demo we produced to include in a portfolio of work.\n\nI decide to take saturday evening off from work in order to have some time to work on this project and hang out with brent or other people in our friend group.\n\nSaturdays come and go, and despite how much brent complains about how much the new town he lives in sucks, and that he really wants to do something productive, anytime hes in town, we get nothing done, or he hasnt spent any time writing ideas down on his own. Worth mentioning that im always the one calling him to do something and letting him know im out of class. if he just wants to chill out, he goes to his other friends house and doesnt ask to see what im doing or if id like to join.\n\nI understand im not entitled to his time every weekend, but i tend to include people in those sorts of situations, and its very frustrating to see brent constantly complaining and then squandering the time to do something when hes in town.\n\nI text him about this and how i feel hes regarded me as a second rate friend despite the respect ive shown him. He ends up saying that in spite of some related arguments ive had with one of our mutual friends (whose house he stayed at a lot during high school), he would still like to talk to me, just not as much as his other friends that hes known longer, from my POV confirming what i just told him.\n\nAm i the asshole for cutting off contact and reluctantly talking to mutual friends due to him being an awkward topic?",

      "description": "Hi everyone, how we doin?\n\nI live in a non-smoking apartment complex in Australia (where pot is illegal) and my downstairs neighbour has a habit of smoking herb on his balcony at night. This is noxious as fuck because the smoke and smell drifts up and comes through my apartment if I have my door open to let the breeze in - because its hot as hell and the air conditioner is expensive. Last year this was happening 3-4 times per week from about July on. \n\nAs the temperature started going up my roommates and I got tired of it and I posted to r/drugs asking how they would like this situation to be treated. Some feedback was good and I ended up deciding to drop a note in their mailbox because I cannot get to their floor (my key only gets me to mine, the ground, and the roof). Note basically said:\n\n\"Hi mate, part of the reason I chose this place is because it was non-smoking. I know there's nowhere you're allowed to light up and your balcony is the safest place but you really should have considered that before you moved in here. If you do it again I'll tell the rental agent.\"\n\nI went on holiday about 2 weeks later and in that time I didn't smell anything. When I got back after a week there was a note in the elevator saying:\n\n\"We would like to remind tennants that this is a non-smoking apartment complex, regards, management\"\n\nI figured someone else probably dobbed him in, or at least complained about someone. I thought this was a good sign. Two days later he was smoking again. So I complained and told them who it was. I was coming back to the apartment two weeks after that and his balcony had been cleared out. I assume he's left. Either evicted or chose to leave.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "AITA: So basically I (20F) have recently had a major change in life plans. As an in-recovery addict, I constantly struggle with mental health. This came to a head five weeks ago as I recognized the pressure of the future ahead of me, and I took a hiatus from work and college and traveled around the country hiking, sightseeing, and finding ways to feel fulfilled. I ended up working at an opioid clinic helping lead recovery groups, and found myself happier than I have been in a long time. The clinic offered me a full-time job post-graduation.\n\nSo what's the issue? I am from New York, and the job is based out of Oklahoma. Further, for three years, I have been working to graduate college with my father's goal in mind: medical school. I've been accepted to four medical schools, which is exciting, but not at all how I think I want to spend my life. My dad is incredibly attached to me (and I have been attached to him, too, since I went through treatment) and breaking away from all that (especially his lofty expectations for my future) feels really good. It does not, however, feel really good to him.\n\nHe is absolutely livid, and I haven't even told him how definite the plan is yet. I asked for his opinions, and he told me I 1. would be making a huge mistake, 2. would be disappointing everyone in my life, and 3. would end up dying in the street addicted to drugs without his support system and goals to look forward to. He thinks I am being irresponsible and rash, and has been very clear about it. He said I am being an idiot &amp; an asshole by \"throwing away the future\" he \"built up for me.\"\n\nI just don't feel like I'm throwing anything away, because I don't even want to be a doctor. These are his dreams for me I am abandoning, and I'm developing my own goals and future in place. I feel genuinely happy about the idea of being independent and a productive, functioning member of society. I keep trying to explain this to him, but he thinks I'm being stupid and, basically, spitting in his face. \n\nI didn't think I was being an asshole, but now I feel like maybe I am? Should I just follow through with medical school? I'm really confused now, even though I felt so sure of my new path before speaking with him. I want to lead my own life, but I don't want to disappoint him. Help!",

      "description": "I’m sitting on a bench still waiting as I type this. I took my little sister (14) and her friend, we’ll call him Andy, to Six Flags today. Everything is going well until we rode on one of the largest coasters they have here.\n\nAndy was going with my sister on the ride, and he had his phone and wanted to put it in one of the cubbies while he rode. Totally a bad move, but he’s a kid and just wasn’t thinking. Well one of the attendants told him he couldn’t do that, naturally. According to him, they said to put it in his pocket. He said he couldn’t do that. They said too bad, that he can’t leave it on the side.\n\nAgain I understand the logic in this because they do not want to be responsible for valuables. I get it. However, when he tries to get my attention to get me to hold it, he says they STOP him and tell him to sit down in the seat, preventing him from reaching out to me. Lo ad behold...his phone disappears on the ride.\n\nSo we go to “Lost and Found”, which is where they tell us to go and I get this story on the way. Lost and Found was futile, as we waited for 15 minutes outside a closed window. I had to ask someone if we are waiting for someone to show up. I got a “Oh they’re in there!” And sure enough, she was. She could see us the whole time.\n\nI told her what happened and got a mumbled “go here” as she handed me a card with directions on how to enter his info online in case they find something. I thanked her and asked if there was a manager I could speak with briefly.\n\n“No.”\n\nI’m sorry - what? I asked again, this time with a more incredulous tone in my voice, “There’s not a single manager in this theme park I can speak with for a moment?” She sighed heavily and walked away to grab a security guard. They whispered for a few moments, laughed for another few (all while about 2 feet away from myself and my little sister and Andy), when the security guard asked “What’s the problem?” I said I wanted to bring something to their attention and ask a few questions. “Like what?”\n\nNow I’m getting upset. I ignored her question and said “Is there not a manager I can speak to? I understand if they’re busy. I don’t mind waiting.” She scoffed and said “I mean yeah, but I don’t know where they are.” I said that’s fine, and I don’t mind waiting.\n\nIt was then that the security guard walked away without a word, the “lost and found” woman swiftly slammed the window closed on us, and we are left without an answer.\n\nSo here I am, 22 minutes and counting, waiting on a cold bench just to explain to a manager what happened. I don’t want them to pay for the phone, I don’t want the attendant fired, I don’t want a search party sent out. But as a former customer service manager, I simply want them to know how the situation was handled to prevent it from happening again. \n\nSorry for any formatting/spelling issues. I’m on mobile.",

      "description": "Basically, a while ago, a girl asked me to prom (end of school dance/senior prom/ball whatever). This was during another school dance that she invited me to. This was about 9 months before the actual dance, so I was a bit surprised, and she's very popular, so I kinda assumed someone would have asked her, but we were good friends and got on well, so I said yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, from there, things started to get awkward. She started talking to me less, and didn't reply to messages as much. She was slightly drunk when she asked me to the prom, and I thought that maybe she was having second thoughts. I spoke to her alone one day, and asked if she was sure she wanted to go with me, I had heard someone else had asked her, and that she was going out with a guy - no hard feelings if she didn't etc. She basically said that she still wanted to go with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, one of my friends clearly has a crush on her, and is getting in the way of both friendships. (Note - I couldn't care less if he has a crush on her and am not trying to stop anything happening). I haven't spoken to this girl since before the winter break, and am worried things are going to get awkward before the dance. This guy always positions himself between me and her, cuts me off in conversations, and flat out ignores me when she's nearby. This makes it very awkward to talk to her, as he is always around wherever she is, so I can't ever get a word in. I'm worried that he wants to go to the dance with her, and is trying to make that happen by making me disappear.

Basically, I want him to stop getting in the way of both friendships. I don't want to bring it up with him, because I fear that will make it even more awkward, but am worried that I'm being an asshole for being short with him, and that I'm being an asshole to the girl who asked me to the dance by not talking to her either.

      "description": "I moved in with my parents last year after I broke my ankle and couldn’t do much for myself. In the year between sister moved out, parents got divorced, I became the primary breadwinner, though not nearly as much as my former stepfather. My parents have yet to formalize their divorce so my income (since Ive become more mobile, work in service industry so no walking means no paychecks) has been going to keep the house going, particularly since my stepdad has been withholding funds from my mom when... he feels like it, I suppose. \n\nWe got a new roommate my mother picked to make finances easier in the beginning of February. We’d been sliding by before but a new roommate meant I might be able to save (!!) . He’s a nice enough guy, just seems like another dude in his forties that likes beer and snowboarding in CO.\n\nSince it’s been me and my mom, we walk in each others rooms all the time. Closed or not. Doors have locks, but why would we? We both have pets and so there’s the [cat+dog]-cat, dog [cat x cat] situation going all the time... the pet in question will scrape at the door and you let it in. Not necessarily to chat, but more of a functional door opening.\n\nI was about to lay down but I heard a cat scratching on her door, so I got up to turn off my light and let the cat in her room so I wouldn’t hear it scratching all night. Open her door and she’s perched on the nightstand with new roommate going at it behind her. I quickly closed the door.\n\nshe came out a short bit later (abt 45 minute) and asked me if I was pissed. I am, for complicated childhood reasons. But am I the asshole for opening the door?\n\nI tapped first, if that matters.\n\n",

      "description": "So, obligatory this is a throwaway account. \n\nThis problem starts 3 years ago when my friend (we'll call her Ellie) fell pregnant. About 5/6 months into her pregnancy Ellie developed an allergic reaction to her cat Pudding. She and her husband discussed the solutions at length and decided they didn't want to get rid of Pudding altogether, so they asked me to look after him until the baby was born. \n\nI want to be clear here, the deal was I looked after the cat ONLY UNTIL the baby was born. I did this on the condition that Pudding got along well with my own cat, and he did so I took Pudding in. \n\nI adopted Pudding from her, but there was no contract, and no official documentation. Ellie dropped him and his toys off at my house, and I started paying for food and other toys, etc. \n\nThe baby was born months later, healthy and beautiful. However, Ellie and her husband decided that with a newborn they didn't have time to take Pudding back. I'd grown to love him anyway, so I agreed to keep Pudding. At this point, there was no agreed return date for Pudding. As far as I was concerned he was mine now. \n\nIt's now 3 years after the baby was born. Ellie and her husband have been to my house a few times, never specifically to see Pudding but he's obviously been there. My other cat and Pudding have got on extremely well, and I absolutely love him. \n\nEllie came to me the other day and told me she and her husband had discussed it and they want Pudding back. They said they want to raise their child to grow up with a pet. \n\nThis is fair enough, I'm not completely oblivious to the fact that Pudding was their cat originally. However, I have raised Pudding for 3 years now. I've paid for vet bills and food and housing when I've been away. They've never discussed having him back, never shared the cost of raising him, and never specifically come to see him. \nHe has been my cat for three years. I love him as much as I love my other cat. \n\nTherefore, I refused to give Pudding back to Ellie. I told her he's mine and I care for him, but she thinks I'm obliged to give him back because he's hers. Our mutual friends have refused to pick a side, and this has put a wedge between Ellie and I. \n\nSo, AITA for keeping Pudding? Does he really belong to Ellie or is he now my cat? ",

I've kindly asked him to not take all the special snacks as I wanna enjoy them together, and to stop eating gifts we bring back. Sometimes he also eats ingredients I need to use in a meal, like a tub of sour cream. He promised many times he'd be more attentive of what he grabs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward, we've just come back from Italy and I got some fancy meats for a friend of mine there.

      "description": "At least once a month my family and I play a board game, watch a movie, etc. One game my siblings and I like is 20 questions. We can choose to be anyone or anything as long as it’s not something abstract like “determination”. We get pretty competitive, and have agreed on stricter rules over the years. Each time there’s a grey area, the rules get bit more defined, but there will still be a technicality that gets us arguing for half an hour. \n\n\nOne rule we vaguely touched on is being too specific. Ex. \n\nCorrect:\nGuessing Hershey’s when the answer is chocolate\n\nIncorrect:\nGuessing LeBron James when the answer is the Lakers \n\nIf it’s the latter, then The whole argument was weather or not my brother’s guess was the former or the latter. \n\n\nWe usually choose to be an obscure celebrity or location, so I thought I was being clever choosing to be a human organ, specifically the intestines. Around question 12 he starts getting pretty close and thinks he’s ready. He guesses that I’m the stomach, and seeing how close he is I thought I would be a good sport told him to keep going. When he asks if I expel waste he said I was definitely the anus then. When I told him what I was and that he was wrong he made a big fit. We argued for a while, but everyone els just wanted to move onto the next game. He said didn’t want to keep playing unless I admitted he was right. Everyone agreed he was right, but I was annoyed he was acting like a baby when most of my family were saying he was wrong before hand. I called him a loser and to go and cry somewhere els.\n\n\nI’m still not too sure if I was wrong or not, but there was no way I’d have admit it with his pissy attitude. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying this is not my dog. He is my mother in law's. Five of us live together (me, husband, mil and our two kids 6f and 1m) plus mil dog who is a large breed. \n\nThis dog is a terrible dog. I don't normally say that about animals as I love them all. But I hate this dog. He's aggressive towards everything. He can't be around other dogs, men he doesn't know (he's worse if it's a guy he doesn't know that has a hat and beard), kids, and loud noises. Most of the day I have to keep this dog in his room with the door blocked so the baby doesn't get to him. In the 2 months of us living all together he's snapped at my baby 5x. Once he bit my son's face, not horrible but that's not the point. My mil just brushed it off and blames my son who just happened to be walking past the dog, wasn't even paying attention to the dog and he still got bit. \n\nFor some reason, I agreed to take this dog out once a day to go to the bathroom since I'm a stay at home. But his listening skills when it comes to me have gone down hill. Last week the dog almost pulled me and my baby who was in my arms down the stairs (I have to walk down about 15 stairs to take him out). I was pulling hard enough on the choke chain that the dog was coughing and at the same time trying to stop him with verbal commands, but he kept pulling us down icy stairs. Luckily I managed not to fall and no one got hurt. I confided to my husband that the dog doesn't listen to me and I am scared next time the dog will actually pull us down the stairs and we will get seriously hurt. My husband told me to stop taking out the dog since he agreed it's not safe, not to mention if another dog is outside and this dog doesn't listen to me something bad could happen there too. \n\nWe both told my mil what happened and how I don't feel safe. She lost her mind telling me that I'm not good at it because I'm not firm enough with his commands (I do it just like everyone else). She then said she will, \"f***ing come home on lunch to take him to the bathroom.\" This was 3 days ago and she has yet to come home to take him out. Me being a caring person refuse to let her dog suffer and have continued to take him out too the bathroom. I've been waiting until the dog comes out whining to take him out in case she actually comes home to do it. \n\nYesterday the dog again didn't listen and tried to pull us down icy stairs. I'm at a loss. Mil's not doing what she said she'd do and I'm continuing to be pulled down the stairs by her dog. I can't just let him suffer because of her. But I don't want my child or myself to get hurt. She also refuses to talk to me about what her dog is doing and is continuing to bitch about me not taking out her dog to my husband (I don't think she knows I'm still taking him out). She says if she comes home to take the dog out she won't get off until 6pm. She has an hour lunch and it takes less than that to drive home, walk the dog and go back to work and she's still would get off at 5pm. I think she keeps saying 6pm to guilt me into taking the dog out. \n\nAITA for telling her to come home and take care of her own dog? I already take care of everything else at home and two kids which is more than a full time job. She says I won't understand unless I have a job but even when I use to work full time I still took care of my kids and pets and never asked someone else to do it. And if I did, I always checked in with them to make sure everything was okay and she can't manage to do that or say thanks. \n\nSo random people of the internet, AITA? ",

He says doesn't that guy over there look just like Sam but like from the future?!?! so I tried to be sly and look and it seriously looked just like his brother but 20 years older, i turned around and laughed a little and agreed.

He took the picture without that man noticing, but when i looked over the old man sitting diagonally across from us was frowning and whispering and saying \"they're taking picture of me\" then his wife shot me a dirty look and both her and her husband left.

It was really cold out, to his credit. But since he wouldn't tell me specifically what he was after it threw some red flags.

      "description": "Recently my roommate wanted to take me out to dinner as a token of appreciation for hooking him up with a job. I accepted his offer. He took me to a Mediterranean place. All the entrees were under $10... I ordered a Greek salad and a drink. He then proceeds to order about $40 worth of appetizers and entrees. I didn't say anything at the time because I assumed he was just extra hungry or something. Once the food comes and I start digging into my salad he tells me that he got all this food for me to try some. I told him no thanks and just ate my salad instead. Then he then told me I should take my salad to go and eat what he ordered for me instead. I insisted that I could eat my salad and no more. Eventually it went back and forth and I ended up eating half of a piece of falafel just to appease him. We each finished our respective meals and started boxing up what's left. He says \"hey you can take this for your lunch tomorrow.\" Once we get home he unpacks the leftovers and puts them all on my shelf of the fridge. The next day I did not take any of it for lunch and he called me out after work so I ate something that vaguely resembles a gyro again to appease him. That was four days ago. Today he saw me and pointed to the remaining food in the fridge and said \"you must eat this before it goes bad\"\n\nAs soon as he's not in the house I'm going to throw it out. Why is he so insistent on shoving food down my throat? Should I have ate more of it? I'm on several medications that affect my appetite so sometimes I just can't eat more food, especially not fatty Mediterranean food. ",

During those three days I didn a lot of hippie healing(arnica, comfrey, and other herbs) I brought the o.g. x rays in and they took new ones. The doc said my wrist was healing so well that I didn't need a cast and that I could treat it like a sprained wrist, I.e. no major activity for 4 weeks. \nI told him that wasn't possible as the ski resorts were due to close in exactly 3 weeks and I needed to get more days in. I wanted a hard cast to protect my wrist just in case I fell while in the park. \nHe went off on me and told me how stupid I was and how foolish my parents were for allowing me to shred. With a broken wrist. \nI ended up leaving the office with a cast and rode another 18 days thanks to my saftey cast. \n\n\n\n\nTLDR; AITA for \"forcing\" a doc to give me a cast that wasnt 100% needed since I was healing so fast so i could snowboard the last 3 weeks of the season?

      "title": "AITA for limiting contact between MIL and my daughter? (Very long)",
      "description": "Some backstory: Mother-in-law (MIL) suffers from bipolar disorder and PTSD. The PTSD is from dealing with her adult son's heroin addiction and him ODing a few times. He was clean when I met and married my husband (11 years ago), but started using again roughly 2 years ago. His relapse brought out the crazy in her I had really only heard about (from my own husband) until that point.\n\nBrother-in-law (BIL) lived with MIL and my father-in-law and they would often have our 5/6 year old daughter (now 7) over to their house or take her out to do things. It made me uncomfortable, but my husband didn't see the problem so I let it be. When it became obvious that brother-in-law was not just temporarily relapsing, we made it a rule that we didn't want our daughter around him at all. He moved out to do heroin 24/7 or whatever, so it didn't seem like it was a big deal.\n\nIt all started innocently with MIL not telling us that he was at their house when we'd go to drop our daughter off. Or he would just magically be there when we would pick her up.  We gave them several chances with this, but they'd totally ignore our wishes because \"he's not high on anything right now\" etc. They finally realized that we were serious (though this was still an occasional issue) and we thought everything was fine and they'd keep daughter away from him.\n\nWell last spring, after going to the mall with MIL, my daughter says something along the lines of, \"Something weird happened and it's making my belly hurt thinking about it.\" I asked about it and she stated that on the way to the mall my MIL had stopped at a gas station to talk to BIL. Apparently MIL and BIL got into a verbal fight that ended with both cussing each other and MIL crying. She also stated that some random girl came up to the car to ask MIL if she was giving BIL money. I flipped my shit (not in front of daughter) and told my husband that I was done, his parents would no longer have our daughter alone. He thought I was overreacting, but agreed not to allow them to have her alone anymore.\n\nA few months later, husband laments that MIL didn't realize that what she did was in violation of what we wanted, etc, and asks me to give her another chance. Now MIL is known for being emotional and stuck up BIL's butt, and I don't trust her to make the right decision if BIL calls needing her while she is alone with my daughter. So I tell my husband that she can take her out to eat and to the mall on the condition that father-in-law is with them the entire time. That way, if she goes ballistic for whatever reason, there would still be one rational adult around. This maybe sounds like a stretch, but she had called my husband sobbing on Father's Day and asked him to go with her to the area hospitals to look for BIL. Why? Because he simply didn't answer her multiple phone calls. That was not the first time, or the last, that she flipped her shit about BIL. She has done this right in front of us before, or over the phone with my husband if we're not around. She withholds information from husband about BIL a lot to cover for him, and because husband is very vocal about how big of a turd BIL is.\n\nSo the day comes and she picks daughter up and claims that FIL is meeting them at the restaurant. I'm already annoyed by them driving separately, but bite my tongue. They go out, and being a little paranoid, I have my husband call to check on them after a few hours. MIL answers the phone and states they are at the mall painting and FIL \"just left\".  I'm annoyed, but let it go. That is...until I find out that FIL actually didn't go to the mall with them at all, and took off after eating. FIL calls and states the truth without any hesitation, which I find odd. So I begin thinking this whole situation may be partially my husband's fault, and that he is not explaining things clearly or something. However, MIL made it seem like FIL just left (IMO lied to us) so I also think she must have understood the situation enough to try to manipulate it. \n\nSo at this point I have 0 trust left and tell my husband that his parents fucked up their last chance and I'm done. It's been roughly 8 or 9 months now and they haven't been with daughter alone once. Just the other day I heard MIL tell my daughter that she wants to take her to the spa at the mall and she'd need to \"ask Mommy\" about it. Then a few days later, my husband suggests I have MIL come over to babysit while I'm attending an online meeting upstairs. I basically ignore these comments/suggestions when they're made, but I know it will only be a short amount of time before I'm straight out asked to reconsider. I'm actually shocked it hasn't come up sooner. \n\nThis whole situation has made me feel like an asshole at times, and not others, I truly go back and forth. My husband has accused me of always hating his mom and seeing an opportunity to get what I wanted (less of her). Some relevant, yet bias, info: MIL often talks negatively about people, put service people down (for their physical features) if they piss her off, and is just generally a negative, emotional black hole of despair. I've also heard her say a few mean/accusatory things about her other granddaughter's mother \"accidentally\" in front of her. So I was never 100% trusting of her alone with my daughter to begin with. In other words, maybe I am overreacting to the situation considering I didn't really trust and definitely didn't like her before.\n\nAnd I honestly do feel guilty about keeping MIL and FIL away from their granddaughter, but we still visit with them at least once a week. Daughter doesn't question the sudden lack of alone time, and sometimes even hides away from them when they visit (I have no idea what that's about, she won't tell me and she doesn't do it with any other visitors. I think it's because they spend the entire time talking about boring stuff with husband.) This is way too long, I'm sorry, so just tell me already: Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I’m aware that smoking inside is gross. My question isn’t about the gross habit. It’s about this particular situation. \n\nI live in a 100+ year old apartment building. It’s not a complex, just a really old building with about 10 units. The owners inherited the building from their parents, who inherited it from their parents, etc.  The most recent owners wanted to tear it down to build condos, but something in the will (? I honestly don’t know.. I know it’s some sort of legal issue..) prohibits them from doing so. As such, they care little about the building and fix just enough to avoid lawsuits. It has always been a smoking building, presumably for the entire duration of its existence. \n\nRecently, a new girl moved in and has been leaving notes on the exterior door asking the other tenants to smoke outside because she can smell the smoke in her apartment. I understand that is an inconvenience, as she doesn’t smoke. \n\nIt is also an inconvenience to smokers, as there are no covered areas to smoke outside. If it’s nice out, I honestly don’t mind to take it outside. But in the rain? The snow? When it’s -10 out? I really don’t want to oblige. \n\nMy boyfriend says it’s easy to just step out and smoke and come back in. I think it’s asking a bit much. Here’s my reasoning: \n\n1) This is a smoking building. Nearly every apartment within a 2 mile radius is non-smoking. If that preference is so important to her, she can live in nearly every other building in town. \n\n2) There is no lease in this building. It is month-to-month rent. She can leave at any point with 30 days notice. \n\n3) She knew upon moving in that it was a smoking building. The hallways smell like cigarettes and weed constantly. It’s gross, but it’s obvious. So it seems to me that she expects the entire building to adjust to her preferences instead of adjusting to the building. \n\n4) I’m aware that for my health, I should quit smoking. And I should definitely quit smoking inside anyway. But should I do it to appease her? I don’t think so. I should do a lot of things. I don’t think those choices should be made for me by a stranger who decided to change the rules of the building. The landlords don’t care. The other tenants have said nothing. It’s really only her. \n\n5) People have been smoking in this building for over 100 years. It’s already covered in nicotine. \n\n\nPlease, tell me if I’m being an asshole or just a gross indoor smoker. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I were going on an international trip together. I had packed a few days in advance and he was planning to pack the night before. He expressed interest in rearranging my suitcase (I like things to be around their counterparts--ie shirts with shirts, pants with pants, etc-- whereas he prefers things as compact as possible, even if that means like things aren't in the same place). I expressed that I liked the way I had organized things according to my packing list but if he felt adamant about changing things I was willing to go over the suitcase with him. Note this wasn't a matter of changing the weight/size of luggage just rearranging things inside. I had a medium sized suitcase for most things and a backpack for carry-on along with my purse.\n\nHe packed his bag while I was sleeping but he also rearranged everything in my bags, not only in the checked luggage but also taking out items from my carry-on to my checked luggage (such as medicine and jewelry which although I might not immediately need them on the trip, it would be disastrous-in the case of medicine-or upsetting for value/sentimentality-in the case of jewelry if things were lost). When I woke up and realized what had happened, I was really upset. Our flight was an early morning flight and I had planning on just getting the clothes I had picked for the flight on top of the suitcase and being ready to go. It really threw me off that I couldn't find anything in my suitcase and I felt like having my medicine on carry-on was absolutely necessary to fix (he knew I had a small pillbox in my purse that held a couple of doses so it is not as if I couldn't take my medicine on the plane but again if the medicine was lost for our week trip it would have been a huge problem). Because I was very upset and it was very early I did complain about what had happened but in the end sucked it up and went to the airport. But at that point, he was upset that I had been upset and made me apologize over and over (at least five times). It was just a stupid thing and it was a lovely trip but I felt like it weighed on me that he had done something I begged him not to do and I was the one who was the bad guy for getting upset.\n\nI struggled for the beginning of the trip to figure out where things were in my bag. While he was getting ready one day, I told him that I too had rearranged his bag to make it more efficient and he was livid. He ran into the room with our bags and yelled at me for messing things up because he knew how to organize things but I didn't. Of course, I didn't actually rearrange his things because I wouldn't want to inconvenience him but I couldn't wrap my head around how I ended up being the bad guy on both sides of the scenario.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? For getting upset over such a silly thing as luggage? For feeling like he had a double standard about luggage preparation because he thought he was the expert?",

Last weekend we had two pretty good dates and ended up admitting that we liked each other, held hands, etc. I thought things were progressing smoothly, but come Monday of last week she starts barely talking to me or replying to my texts. I thought she was just nervous about an audition that she had Thursday, so I was trying to give her space while encouraging her and letting her know that I was there for her. Things went well Thursday, come Friday and she dumped me. She told me that it wasn't my fault, that I was a really kind guy and did nothing wrong, that it wasn't fair to me to keep going because she wasn't ready for a relationship, that she had issues of her own that she needed to settle. And I know that that's the truth, and I respect her for breaking it off in person.\n\nWhich is fine. I understand that no means no and that it's over, I just wish I knew *why* and I wish she knew that some people want to actually hear what's going on with her so they could help or just try to make it easier. I liked her for a long time, that sort of thing doesn't go away overnight and I still care for her.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm pissed. I feel played; I don't understand why she bothered going on dates with me, even told me she liked me, if she wasn't ready for that. I feel led on. Is it wrong to feel that way? I haven't really told her how I feel (don't really plan to). AITA for feeling this way?",

Whenever they have to talk to me, they demand my full and immediate attention, that means eye contact and everything. Not usually a problem until they want to talk to me at the most inconvenient of times (like when I'm changing) since my bedroom door doesn't have a lock they can just barge in whenever they feel like it, doesn't matter what I'm doing. Whenever they do happen to open my door when I'm not wearing clothes I tell them to give me a second so I can get changed but they never listen, (especially my grandma, this is mostly about her) she'll be in my room, like door opened all the way so anyone can look in and she's a good 5 feet in the room. I'll say something along the lines of \"Get out of my room I'm not wearing anything\" and she'll tell me that I'm being disrespectful and rude to her and that I have to respect her cause \"You always respect your elders\". I can't reason with them (Believe me, I've tried) so all I can do is yell until they leave.

      "description": "It's been a few weeks since we've last had a  disagreement about this and the situation has now been resolved. However, I'm not happy with the solution and so I'm wondering whether it not that means I really was the asshole all long.\n\nFor the past couple of years, I've been particularly lending my mom money accumulating to the point of almost 4 grand. It was only until spring of last year this stopped and we decided that the best way forward was to cut this from my rent, almost as if I paid upfront.\n\nI was only due to pay rent from last spring as that was when I turned 20, and so it worked out well. \n\nRewind to fall, and she starts using my credit card (she is an additional cardholder). She states that she will pay me back as soon as she can, and so this would be separate to her existing debt. I thought this was fair, and being aware of her other repayments I offered to pay those off too so she would only have to worry about paying me back. I also made this offer because I knew that it would be extremely difficult for her to juggle those existing debts and this new one with me. Fast forward to December and now the money she's spent on the card and the money I've given to cover rent has accumulated to a few hundred more than she could afford.\n\nWe had agreed that from the new year onwards she would start paying me back, however, because she can't afford it she's requested for it to be added to the old debt and so to be cut off via rent. This in and of itself, is not unreasonable but the fact that she changed the nature of the agreement does annoy me. Also, she did not take initiative regarding paying off her other debts as I had offered and so she's right when she says she can't afford it.\n\nUnfortunately, me and my mom don't get on financially and she has multiple times said to me that I'm financially unkind and that I don't lend money with the right intentions, that I'm greedy and calculative. This what ultimately led to our last argument about this weeks ago whereby she called me out for this, and for numerous other - I felt - unnecessary personal things to the point where I got upset and just gave in.\n\nThere is also the complication that I always intended to move out after graduation (summer 2020), but based on the calculations of the last debt I would have had only around 7 months left to actually pay. My mom told me that she wouldn't ask me to pay seeing as it wouldn't be long before I moved out, and so it would be in poor taste. However, adding the new money that would be 4 months extra. She has too said that I should pay until the day I'm out because I'm an asshole and so the precious deal is not something I am deserving of.\n\nI appreciate the financial struggle that my mom is going through and I really did want to help her, however, I am only a student and just because I have got savings doesn't mean I should just give in to her every whim. I appreciate I do have a responsibility as I live here, and if she needs the money then that's fair enough. I just felt as though, I did not deserve for it to be such a personal decision. I also understand that it is a hard time for the family, especially for her as her sister is ill added on to mom's existing anxiety I can excuse how she talked to me. I also do agree that I probably did talk about repayment too much, and I do try getting too involved in her finances. I don't want to get into too much detail, but really we shouldn't be in this position where we're struggling so much financially and being the youngest of the two daughters I don't think it is fair.\n\nThe situation has been resolved, and agreed upon, and I'm going to pay my way until I leave. And although it is a fair conclusion, I am still upset with everything and how it was handled. She's given the card back and has taken the details off her online accounts and it does seem like she really won't be taking any more money off me, but I still didn't get a proper apology for the way she spoke to me (I apologised for talking back), but maybe I am in the wrong and so I don't deserve it. I don't feel inclined to bring this up again considering how much time has passed and how hostile it got so I just want to know: am I the asshole for seemingly not wanting to pay my way?\n\ntl;dr - Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay further rent even though we already had an agreement beforehand?

Morally though, isn't even the tiniest possibility of ruining an entire family something that should be avoided? Just tell me if I'm being a dick or not so I can stop thinking about it please...",

I then go back to work at 930 until roughly 5/6pm every day. \nI come home, I help out around the house, clean, bathe the kid sometimes I cook. Then I play video games until 9pm followed by a movie with the wife until roughly 11pm.\n\nWeekends are a completely different story, I get woken up at 9 by my wife and I tell her every time that I’d like just one day to sleep in, not until 2pm, but like 10/1030am because I’m tired from waking up and working long hours.\nWe proceed to get into a pretty heated argument about how when I’m home she expects me to do just as much as she does (which is understandable) but she asked all her friends about me sleeping in and they all tell her to “wake my ass up” “what the fuck parent wants to sleep in?” Etc etc.\n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to sleep in, once? Not every weekend and not until the afternoon, but just one day til 10/1030?",

This has been planned for nearly a year, with almost 6 more months to go. My SO has known about this trip since I first began planning it and has wholeheartedly supported me in going, but the past month or two has started getting more and more hesitant, to the point where she's said she doesn't want me to go because she'll miss me (it'll be a trip of around forty days). I'd love for her to come along, but she doesn't like the idea of hiking/walking for weeks and that's totally okay. My heart hurts for her because I'm going to miss her tremendously and I hate the idea of being away so long, but my friends and I have been gearing up for this for nearly a year and many more months to come, and it all sort of hinges on me as I've been the main planner and have been to where we're going. I don't really know what to do, I'm leaning towards going ahead with the trip but it leaves me with a guilty conscious, yet I would have one anyway if I cancelled on my buddies. WIBTA if I go?",

      "description": "So for some background info. my older brother has claimed to be a “university student” for the past 5 years. I think he did initially attend but dropped out sometime two-three years ago. He has lied to my parents twice before about being close to graduation. Last summer he lied and my parents told everyone he was about to graduate and bought him a new suit and then the day before his supposed graduation he told them that he actually has to complete two more courses before graduating. Then again in the winter he told them that he was graduating and then the night before we were all supposed to attend his graduation he told them he had lied and that he didn’t pass his classes and isn’t graduating. \n\nNow he has told them that he is enrolled in those last two classes that he needs for graduation and they truly believe that he will be graduating in the spring. \n\nI honestly didn’t believe him because he lies all the time so I asked him today to show me his schedule. He has been putting this off for months and so today he finally logged into his school account and tried to trick me into thinking he is still in school, but I’m not that stupid and looked into his account some more and found out that he is not registered in any classes and is lying again. \n\nI want to tell my parents because I think the fallout will be a lot more worse if they found out later on then now. I’ve tried to convince him to tell them the truth now but he is angry at me and has told me to stay out of it. \n\nI don’t think I should stay out of it because I don’t want to lie to my parents. I think he is being incredibly selfish and immature and this whole situation is stressing me out like crazy. The last time my parents found out that he lied about graduating, my mom legitimately fainted and was sick all night. My dad also has a heart problem and I’m worried for both of their health. I know it’s gonna be really bad when they find out but I don’t think we should prolong this situation any longer. \n\nReddit please help me out! What should I do in this situation? AITA for wanting to tell them the truth? ",

The unspoken rule is we need to all agree with what we watch. If anyone says they dont want to watch something we pick another thing. \n\nThe sister's dad is in town for the week starting today. The sisters were picking him up from an airport about two hours away before picking up the husband of one of the sisters. Sister one prepped a roast to cook all afternoon and popped it in the oven before leaving. As I was the only one home for the evening I walked her dog and gave him dinner as well as fed her cat and gave him his insulin shot. Then I prepped the side dishes and cleaned the kitchen so everything was ready when they got home. \n\nWe were all dished up and ready to put something on. One sister suggested show X. The visiting dad said he had never watched the show and would love to see it. I objected and told them I had watched the first season of the show multiple times with different people and was very tired of it and wanted to see anything else. The dad tells me too bad and puts it on. \n\nI took my plate to go eat in my room as I very much did not want to see show X again and was mad I was not being listened to. I feel like I did a fair amount of work tonight and have every right to get a say in what we watch but the visiting father is accusing me of 'sulking' for not getting my way. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I met her through Tinder and we hit it off right away and were fwb for awhile but she didn't want to date. Said she wasn't a big fan of dating because things just get more stressful. I asked if she could be a little more specific about what she found stressful cause I wanted to be the one to erase those stresses. She opened up about some shit that happened in her life and how she had revenge porn of her spread online. I wasn't too sure why that mattered for a relationship, but she said she didn't want to date someone who used porn because of her dislike for it. She gave me several reasons why she disliked it but those aren't important. I told her I wasn't a big fan of porn and if I had her as my girlfriend I would cut it out entirely. She was so special to me and it seemed like no big deal. \n\nWe started dating soon after and things have been great until she found out I've been using porn. This was a couple days ago and she has been very distant ever since. Told me she felt disgusting and didn't know if she could stay in a relationship with me. I don't fucking understand. Everyone watches porn. Sometimes I just want to get my rocks off and look at something else for a change. I think it's ridiculous to expect your partner to get off without EVER using other people. I know I said I could cut it, but that's stupid. I kept watching it because she wouldn't know and it didn't impact our relationship in any way. Didn't change how I viewed her and didn't ruin our sex life. I think she's being ridiculous right now for distancing herself and being so extreme, saying she doesn't think she can date me over PORN. It feels stupid just typing it out. She's making me seem like a total jerk and this isn't something I want to talk about with my friends IRL. So here I am. AITA?? ",

      "description": "For some context here, I was born during the summer in a country in Europe that guarantees citizenship there until the age of 22. So, sometime before you are 22 I have to go back there and live there for a year and join their and society to regain my citizenship. Ever since I was a child, my mom told my older sister (who pushed back on the issue but ended up going) and I that after high school we would be going to take a gap year and going to Europe, which neither of us wanted to do, but figured we'd deal with later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am a high school senior, fully in the college process, having heard back from exactly half of my schools, and there have been some smaller arguments between my mom and I, but nothing too big. However, recently I got accepted into a really great, relatively affordable school that I love, and I was hoping that because of this, my mom would be lenient and say either I could go to Europe during college (which we both agreed I probably would not want or be able to do) or that I didn't have to go after all. We got in a big argument yesterday where she feels that her heritage is being attacked and that I don't respect where she comes from, but I am really not interested in going. All of my friends are attending college next year, I don't really care too much about my relationship with my birth country, and I'm really excited to go to college but don't want to wait a year. Her points are that having an EU citizenship is amazing and that it opens up the doors for so many opportunities, and she calls it an insurance policy in case anything goes wrong in the US. Yesterday in our talk though, she basically put a gun to my head and said \"you are going to Europe for a year or I am not paying for your college\" which I would have needed to alert colleges to earlier to get a bunch of financial aid. AITA for pushing back so hard on this, and feeling like I'm being forced into a year of something I really don't want to do, or is she right with this really being a great opportunity I'm not seeing and that I'm offending her heritage?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’ve been working with him a lot &amp; he’s been doing a lot better! A few weeks ago we went to the dog park &amp; after he got a little too excited, a mastiff went after him. Thankfully he was fine, but I did get a few bite marks. He seems to be regressing socially since the incident. \n\nThe dog park I typically go to has 3 separate areas. A small dog park, a large dog park, &amp; one for all sizes. The peak time when there will be the most dogs is on weekends &amp; outside of work hours (evenings typically). I want to take him to get him out &amp; about for some exercise, but I’m not sure how well he’s going to do with other dogs/people yet. I was planning on taking him outside of peak hours, when there’s typically no one, and use the park without anyone in it. If someone tried to join us in the park, would it be rude of me to ask them to take their dog into the other park?\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "Two weeks ago my whole family reunited for a vacation on the coast. On the second to last day we went diving. My (24M) cousin (21F) lent me her iPhone 7 Plus in a waterproof bag that hangs around the neck and I used it as a flashlight while submerging. Somehow the string of the bag broke and I lost the phone to oblivion. \n\nEveryone in the family agreed that it was my responsibility to buy my cousin a new one and while I don't agree (if it had been my phone I wouldn't have made anybody else pay for it given it was an accident) I felt for her and knew her parents wouldn't buy her a new one so I said I'd do it. I even tried to give her my own phone but she refused. \n\nThe thing is she obviously wants a new phone STAT (she currently has a lousy back up) and I can only send her part of my paycheck every month or save up and mail her a new one in 7 or 8 months. \n\nShe's trying to convince her parents to use their credit card and she's aiming for a goddamned iPhone X in installments. Her parents say she needs to choose a cheaper option and they also need ME to get my father to agree to pay on my behalf every month if I fail to do so. \n\nI'm pissed that my cousin is making the situation tense between everyone instead of waiting and handling this between us. I put my foot down and said I only owe her the amount her old phone was worth on the current market and won't involve my parents. If hers decide to use their credit card it's on them. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "Hi guys, \n\nSo this happened last night. For context, I (22M) have been dating this really cool girl for the past 4 months (22F). We have also been a friend for basically the past 4 years. We have no issue with our relationship, except with the relationship with one of my best friends (22F) who has been one of my closest friends for the past 10 years. We now have what I consider to be a platonic friendship.\n\nAlmost 2 years ago (before my now girlfriend and were even considering dating), we had exactly two moments where we made out, one of which where we were both in relationships - meaning we both cheated. It was bad, we know, but we were both in really bad (abusive in my case) relationships. All said nothing came out of those incidents. We discussed it, but neither of us has any romantic or sexual feelings toward the other anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo long story short, a few nights ago, this friend (who now works as a tech consultant) had to go visit a client who's office was really close to my place. The office was a 5 minutes drive from my place, v.s an hour commute from her place. Since she had to meet the client very early in the morning, she asked me if she could sleep on my couch, so that she would not have to deal with the long commute. I said that it was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I called my girlfriend to tell her about this she got really angry. My girlfriend feels that even though I say that the friendship between me and this friend is platonic, it is not, and what I did exhibit a lack of boundaries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI argued that letting close friends sleep on my couch, regardless of gender is something that I've done in the past many times and she's was okay with that, but this situation is different because she doesn't like that specific friend. So the act of letting my friend crash at my place is not inherently wrong, it just feels wrong to her because she doesn't like that specific friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, my friend slept over, my girlfriend got really angry and we had a long talk about it today, and we are now okay, but I'm left wondering, AITA?",

      "description": "Its been over a month since this incident occurred and I still feel bad about it. I think I was in the right to cut her out of my life but there's a small part of me that still feels I was in the wrong.\n\nThe long and short of it is that my friend, we'll call her Shana, decided to cheat on her wife. That's not why I removed her. To her credit, she apparently stopped the cyber role play fucking and flirting with her friend because she felt bad and it never escalated beyond that. However Shana's wife found out about it because the person she was being intimate with got salty and exposed her to one of their friends and their friend happened to be a friend of her wife. So the logs were exposed.\n\nAs you can imagine her wife was unbelievably pissed. They were married only 5 or 6 months prior to this. Shana's wife wanted a divorce ans bought a plane ticket to send her back to her home country and forced her to leave. I was pissed because I hate cheaters HOWEVER I comforted Shana and tried my best to be supportive. \n\nI got everything plus the whole 9 yards. Shana felt bad about the cheating, took responsibility for it, and cried so many tears about how much she only wanted her wife and no one else. Then I grew weary. Shana told me that she had a diagnosed multiple personality disorder and it was really her alter that was cheating and not her because her alter likes to sabotage everything and actively works against her which is something I never once heard of in my 2 years of knowing her. Red flags started popping up but I gave her the benefit of the doubt here.\n\nWhat follows next pissed me off so much that I ended up cutting her from my life right there. Apparently her wife ended up forgiving her and no longer wanted a divorce. I was happy that she was going to give Shana another chance. But Shana deadass told me that she brought up that now she wants their marriage to be open and be polyamorous. Her wife accepted saying that she's okay with Shana fucking other people but she herself doesn't want to do it. \n\nI immediately grew sour because of how sketchy this sounded. I would think that if you only wanted your wife you would, in fact, only want your fucking wife and not IMMEDIATELY suggest wanting an open marriage upon being forgiven. And it seems that she cried over not actually betraying her wife's trust but getting caught. After everything she told me it seems like she's trying to use polyamory as a way to actively cheat on her wife without it being called cheating and, to me, it seems like her wife is so madly in love to the point where she's being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, AITA?",

We talking to each other for about 6 months when I developed a crush on her but after while I stopped cause I value this friendship to much. Around a year after knowing her she started talking to new people you know like popular kids and we started talking less and I don't blame her hell even I started chilling with the \"cool kids\". Now fast toward to where the trouble began  Eventually we ended up in the same group of freinds but it was different she would barely acknowledge me and use me as the butt of some of her jokes. I started questioning our Freindship at this point. Now fast toward to a couple days ago when I made the realization that I know nothing about her. We didn't know each other for three years we just knew  who each other was for 3 years. So I decide to end our freindship. I un add her on social media and just stop talking to her like she's been doing. Fast forward to now me and some of my football freinds are sitting at lunch and one of them asks \"hey aren't you freinds with x\" and I respond no and I guess she found out and texts me (we haven't texted in 8 months at this point) saying I'm a snake, 2 faced, and that I'm selfish for ending it after 3 years, she then goes in to insult my weight I am overweight but I'm currently cutting it in football. This gets me mad so I respond with \"shut up were not freinds u don't even know anything about me in fact tell me my favorite color or some of my interest if we're such great freinds\" as of right know she hasn't responded it's been 2 days. I know I handled this badly and got to heated now I feel like shit and that maybe she's right. ",

      "description": "Hey guys,\nfirst time posting and english is not my mothertongue, so please have mercy.\n\nSo I (M23) met this girl (F21) online and we know for about around 2 years. Last week we met the first time in person. We live ~8hours apart.\n\nWe went out at Friday night and got drunk. While I was \"only\" a bit drunk, she was actually wasted. On our way back to my hotel she vomited all over her clothes (top, pants, shoes). The plan was actually that she rides a train home, but it was too late and I wouldnt have let her go home alone in her state anyway.\n\nSo after what felt like 4 hours we arrived at my hotel and I took her to my room. I gave her a shirt and sweatpants and told her to get changed in the bathroom. After some minutes i asked if everythings ok, but didnt get an answer. So i went into the bathroom to look after her. She was sitting on the floor unchanged and crying. She told me she is in a fresh relationship ~1month and she had a guilty conscience for getting drunk. \n\nBetween her and me nothing sexual happened and I wasnt even planning it. Just two friends hanging out. Had the feeling to throw that in.\n\nI once again told her to get changed and brushed my teeths in the meantime. After I got back in the bathroom she was sleeping on the bathroom floor, still unchanged. I woke her up and helped her to undress and put on my clothes. Because she wasn't able to do it or didn't want to do it. I don't want to share a bed with someone who is full with vomit and I don't think it would have been right to let her sleep on the floor, because there was only one blanket.\n\nWhile she slept in the bed I washed her clothes in the bathtub as good as possible and hung them up to dry. After that I went to bed aswell.\n\nThe next morning arrived and she couldn't remember a thing. I told her what happened and told her that she changed herself. \nI just felt it was the right thing to say, because it's was the first time we met in person and she's in a fresh relationship. I didn't want to make her feel guilty again.\n\nI thought about it the whole week and wonder if it was the right thing to do. Should I tell her the truth?",

      "description": "My brother and I were hanging out with a friend of his. His friend is gay and I guess my mom didn’t know, so she started asking him questions. One of the first things she asked was “What color of boys do you like?” and he got awkward and uncomfortable. I told my mom she can’t say that, in a joking way, and she doubled down and said “No, I mean do you only date your own race or do you like white, brown, asian, latino....” My brother just flat out said “mom, you’re being racist.” She got really defensive and said “What? I’m not allowed to have preferences? If I only was attracted to black men would that make me racist?” \n\n\nMy brother’s friend and I both tried explaining that it IS okay to have personal preferences but telling everyone is pretty weird; it’d also be rude to tell someone you’re not attracted to them specifically because of their race, as it is something they cannot change. She half conceded and left the room, asking my brother to come with her. I heard them arguing and she started crying and saying she’s the “best mom ever” and she’s only ever taught us kindness and acceptance. \n\n\nI later on tried to bring it up again, but my brother was there and he can’t help but throw jabs and insults at my mom. They got really heated over it again, so I told my brother to shut up for a minute so I could talk. I tried explaining that small differences in the way you talk to people can really change the way you’re perceived by people. Asking a black gay boy what “color” of boys he likes is not the most tasteful or appropriate thing to say. She said she didn’t ask what color of boys he liked and that our “oversensitive millennial brains” misheard her and twisted reality. \n\n\nAt this point, I knew the argument wasn’t worth having. My mom isn’t the kind of person to complain about “snowflakes” and the like, so I knew she was just deflecting by throwing insults. I told everyone to quash it and go about their business. My mother is not an emotionally mature woman. She’s been addicted to drugs for half her life and never properly socialized. Now that’s she’s sober, she’s learning how to be an adult and a regular member of society. \n\n\nShe also didn’t grow up like me and my brother. The schools we grew up in were incredibly diverse. People of color are not a novelty to me or my brother. Most of our friends are not white and we don’t think about it too much. My mom likes to bring it up a lot. She tends to fetishize people of color. She recently saw some baby pictures of my brother’s girlfriend (who is asian) and hasn’t shut up about who she can’t wait for them to have kids because she’s always wanted that “flavor” of grandbaby. I think don’t she means any harm but she seems to confuse attraction for acceptance. (e.g. “I’m not racist, my girlfriend is black.”)\n\n\nDespite all this, she’s still my mother and I love her dearly. I feel like I could’ve handled this situation better. I don’t feel like it was appropriate for my brother to accuse her of being racist in front of his friend, but it also makes me uncomfortable how she treats POC (and gay people) like they’re a novelty. \n\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole? \n\n\nTL;DR Mom asked black gay friend what “color of boys” he liked and we told her it was inappropriate. She got really offended and I’m afraid I hurt her feelings, but she says a lot of weird shit about POC. AITA?",

      "description": "Hello! FTP and on mobile, sorry if this is difficult to read.\n\nMy son and his cousin both have their first birthday in September, this is my first child, this is my cousins 4th child, but her first girl.\nMy husband and I have already started planning our sons first birthday parties. He's having two because we currently live in a different country than our families and are flying back for two weeks for his birthday and we are planning one for each side of the family because of travel restrictions on both sides. We were planning on inviting everyone from my side and doing it as a family reunion type thing since a lot of us haven't seen each other in a while. Well, today my cousin messaged me and said her parents are planning a family reunion in September at their new house with lots of land and she's planning on having her daughters party that weekend and asked if I wanted to just combine their birthdays and get a smash cake for my son so he didn't feel left out. I'm kind of upset about it. I know my son won't remember it but my husband and I will. We are planning on flying a long way and my husband taking all of his work leave specifically to celebrate our sons birthdag with our families. Should we just suck it up and be happy we get to do it with most of our family there even if it's not his party or should we push to have it be his day? There would likely be more people/children at her daughters birthday party and if she didn't come to my sons there will be no other kids there.",

      "description": "This happened last night and I've been stressed about it ever since.\n\nI have two kids and we aren't strict on them swearing. As long as it's in our house and they're not using 'angry' words, it's fine. So dropping something and swearing is fine but telling your sibling you hate them when mad isn't, regardless of swearing, because we're supposed to talk, not yell, right?\n\nLast night my brother-in-law facetimes my husband. He's in the living room and answering whatever question it is BIL has. My youngest is coming down the stairs, almost trips on the cat, and goes 'Aww shit, Cake!' Facetime ends, I think nothing of it until 10 min. later when he calls back saying we should apologize for her swearing because his inlaws were in the room and offended. I was the one who answered this time and I said I was sorry. Then he said I needed to apologize to them. I said, sure hand the phone over but he says his wife thinks I should call her parents directly, they'll give me the number etc. \n\nNow, I've never met them. They live very far and I didn't even know they were in town. I'm an anxious person, I hate making phone calls. I said, I'm already on the phone, you can give it to them now or put it on speaker phone but I'm not calling. Then I said I had to go because it was late and needed to get the kids in bed. He called back and talked to my husband and apparently they thought I was rude. At the time I didn't think so, but I'm also a people pleaser and now that's outweighing my anxiety. \n\nSo should I call and apologize? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I’m on mobile, apologies for the formatting. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nSo, I just found out today that my cousins on my fathers side are all unvaccinated with the exception of 2 of them. (I have 9 total on that side). \n\nMy aunts and grandparents swear that vaccines do the usual cause autism and such blah blah blah, with the twist that they also believe they’re made from aborted fetuses. Which in their eyes means you cannot be christian/pro life and be vaccinated at the same time. \nI am the oldest grandchild on that side, and I also have a younger brother who is super close in age to me, we were both fully vaccinated before any of these cousins were born and both had no issues (obviously). However when the next closest cousin was born and needed her vaccinations, she cried when the first shot was given so my aunt refused to continue because she swears she “heard the autism working through her”. So, after this none of the others were vaccinated. With the exception of two boys who were adopted, so legally they had to be. In that case, my grandparents held a prayer service around them and prayed for god to make the vaccine faulty and forgive them. \nMy parents have tried relentlessly to teach them and they refuse to budge on the subject. \nWhen I heard this today, I immediately told my family that my future child will not be around the cousins until my child is completely vaccinated. \nNow, my mother and father think that I’m being too extreme and that it’s not a huge deal. Saying that because I’ll be vaccinating my baby, that I should not be worried. \n\nSo here’s the question: Would I be the asshole to continue through with this? It would certainly hurt my grandparents and aunts for them to hear this from me, but I feel that my future child’s well being comes first. Do my parents have a valid point? (I should add that I am not currently pregnant, just had this conversation with my parents earlier) \n\nTLDR: Grandparents and Aunts are anti-vaxx in regards to my 9 cousins, I told my parents I won’t let them around my future children, parents say that I should let them around since I’ll be vaccinating my own child anyways.

      "description": "When i was starting my final year of medical school, I told my girlfriend upfront that I wouldn't be able to celebrate her birthday on the actual day as it was 1 week before our finals. This was an exam that would test us on everything we learned up to that point and would greatly influence where we got a job or whether we could get a job at all. I'm not the brightest student in my cohort so i was genuinely worried I would not do well.\n\nI told her that I would only get her a cake and a card but that we would celebrate in a big way after the exams. She was also a medical student and in the same year as I and when she agreed, I thanked my lucky stars she could understand the immense pressure we were both under.\n\nFast forward a few months later to my birthday, she plans this elaborate weekend getaway. (I should have seen it coming guys...) I am absolutely blown away but at the same time i knew that there's no way I could pull something like that off a week before finals and i tell her as much a few weeks after our trip. She said that she understood and that our exams were the priority. Once again i thanked my lucky stars for having such a loving and understanding girlfriend.\n\nThe months crept by and pressure was on, we went through stacks of practice questions and hundreds of exam scenarios just to prepare for the exam we were only a week away from the paper and the pressure was on!\n\nAt the stroke of midnight, I suddenly hear a sniffle comr from behind me. As i turn around my girlfriend suddenly breaks down and sobs uncontrollably. \"I can't believe you didn't celebrate my birthday!\" she screamed. In between her cries, she tells me that after all our years together she couldn't believe that her friend rather than me was the first person to wish her a happy birthday. That birthdays are extremely important to her (she never mentioned this before) and I should have done something. \n\nI do my best to apologise, go out of my way that day to buy her flowers arrange a nice dinner, cake and presents a week before the biggest exam of my life in order to appease her but it seemed like the damage was done. That was the first of our few big fights and a few months later we broke up. When she broke up with me, she mentioned that that incident was one of the reasons she lost faith in me.\n\nI don't know how to feel about all of this. Should I have read the signs a little better? Should i have been clearer with my intentions? I feel incredibly wronged but then I wonder if I'm in the wrong.😶\n\n",

He was the only one I can normally converse with since he liked games that I liked and had the same sense of humour that I have.\n\nJohn and I hung out for a month before he asked me out. I said no and told him that I thought we were moving too fast. He told me that it's all good. A week after, I started hanging out with a new friend I made outside of our friend group (let's call him Sam). When John heard about this, he started saying that he was jealous. I just tried to ignore this and move on, but he kept stating how jealous he is, giving me \"subtle\" hints to not hang around Sam anymore.\n\nI started getting closer to Sam, mainly because his culture is quite similar to my culture, and I feel more comfortable being around him that being around John. One day, while talking to Sam, John came to us and introduced himself to Sam. He talked to Sam about me as if he owned me, referring to me as \"my Anon\" and putting his arm around me in front of Sam. I felt very uncomfortable and just got up from my seat, leaving quickly. At night, I confronted John about this incident via text. I told John that what he did was wrong because I am NOT his property, and John apologized profusely for the way he behaved. I still couldn't get over being treated like a property, so I just ghosted him. I blocked him, never said a word to him in real life, and basically just turned around whenever he was walking on the path I'm heading towards.\n\nIt's been 3 months since then, and I'm starting to feel guilty about ghosting him like that. I know I don't owe him anything, but our friend group has dwindled a bit because of this, and from what I saw and heard, he almost has no other friends because of his anti-social personality. He also did apologize, so AITA?\n\n\nTl;dr - Anti-social guy had a crush on me and got jealous I hung out with another guy, treated me like his property in front of the other guy, and apologized when confronted about it. I still felt angry about being treated like his property, so I ghosted him anyway. Now he barely has any friends. AITA?",

      "description": "This past weekend some friends and I went shopping and stopped by this petstore in this dilapidated strip mall. It was big but they had a lot of \"going out of business\" signs. There were puppies there and the store manager said that a few of the dogs would be \"destroyed\" when they eventually leave for a multitude of reasons. It was probably a combination of the mimosas we had earlier + the cuteness of the puppies but I ultimately agreed to buy one of the dogs because I couldn't stand the thought of it being put down. \n\nWhen my husband got home later that night he was furious that I had spent so much on a new puppy without telling him. He told me I was probably duped by that store and I don't disagree, but I also believe I did the right thing bringing that puppy away from that horrid store. He is mad that I did all this without asking him and I did apologize but I feel like he should cut me some slack. I only acted out of compassion and was just a bit overwhelmed by what that store manager was telling me. And besides, getting a cute puppy is hardly the worst thing to happen to anyone. I feel like my husband is overreacting and going overboard with making me feel bad now. \n\nSo, was I or am I the asshole for getting that puppy?",

      "description": "Full Back Story: Growing up I was the only guy in my house, with a twin sister, 2 little sisters, and a single mom. For unique reasons all 4 of us are within 2 years of age. It was really rough growing up and being so outnumbered all the time so i love to \"bro out\" for lack of better words. \nCurrent story: TDLR at bottom We are all in early 20s. Once we all graduated high school my mom moved into a much smaller house 20 minutes away and allows us to live in the old house for very cheap (she doesnt make money or lose money, we pay utilities, taxes, etc) until we get on our feet as adults. My 2 little sisters both took the deal(while me and twin where in college, they didn't go) and have since bought their own house or moved out the area. I recently graduated, moved in and got 2 roommates, keeping 1 bedroom open for my twin if she decides to live with us. The thing is I don't want her to. We live together during the summers and dont get along. We went to the same college and went out together and had fun, shes one of my best friends, but when we are together too long we arnt nice to each other. My 2 roommates are long time friends and Id say now they are just as much friends with my sister as with me, they have no problem with her moving in. \nThe thing is , I love the atmosphere of the house, its the definition of a bachelors pad (pool table in dining room, bench press in living room, bikini posters, deer heads, etc). Im worried that my sister might kill the vibes living here when she could very easily live with my mom 20 min away(for free) and visit whenever. The only thing is she has expressed excitement for being roommates and I really don't want to hurt her feelings because she is sensitive and its not like its any more my house than hers. \n\nAdditionally, my little sister that moved away is talking of maybe moving back in and sharing the room with my twin. This would be 100% a nightmare, my little sister is not easy to get along with and those two sharing a room would be awful for everyone involved. The thing is my mom said little sister cannot live with her(for above reasons) but twin can. Plus I wouldnt mind little sister living here as much because she would just stay in her room all the time and because she is intellectually disabled and she worries me being alone in the city. \nTDLR; Mom lets us stay in other house for very cheap. I moved in made it a bachelors pad with 2 friends and don't want my twin sister to live here. WIBTA to tell her this as it will likely hurt her feelings",

      "description": "Hello everyone, so here goes. It began on June of last year. My friend and I had been planning for months to go on a trip to Japan, we saved up money, looked at attractions, and many other things.  His dad works at an airline in Mexico which is where our plane was gonna leave, and the plan from the beginning was to get cheap airline tickets from his dad because apparently its a thing!  Keep in mind, tickets to Japan are not cheap, they can cost upwards of up to $950.00, which is why when he told me this, i was amazed that we could get a ticket for $120 back and forth, sounded too good to be true.  Well a couple of days after this, he starts telling me that there will be complications with the searing, this and that...next thing i know i had decided, screw it, I’m just gonna buy a regular ticket, and he agreed.  he tells me to talk to his mom, who is going to go with us to Japan, for the dates of departure  and arrival so i can buy it, she gives me the dates and i buy them.  Well, turns out the dates she gave me were incorrect, telling me right after i buy them, so what i do with that ticket, is that i save it for another time (with a 1 year extension, for some reason i couldn’t use it on the date i wanted, but its okay since they told me we would be going next year again for sure, and i was down for that!!).  I go ahead and buy another ticket, we go to japan have lots of fun and then come back.  Its February now, and I’ve been asking my friend when were gonna plan the next trip because i still have that leftover ticket, but he keeps changing the topic or ignoring the question entirely, and when going to Japan, you need lots of time to plan ahead.  Should i ask him for the money back or make a deal where he gives me half the money because we both shared the fault, or is it my fault entirely and should i just suck it up and accept the losses.\n\nI don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this.  \n\nSorry for any misspellings, english is second language.",

We were getting increasingly more intimate in our relationship and I wanted to make sure he was comfortable. One day, I said “I know what happened in your past and I just want you to know I wouldn’t do that to you. I think you’re amazing and I want to go at your pace” or something along those lines. He got really mad at me and told me he didn’t like that I brought that up. I apologized and he was still all pissy. \n\nI ignored him for a couple days which just made things worse. When we started talking again, he began to flirt with other girls and pretty much just be an over all bad boyfriend so I would break up with him.

      "description": "This is kind of a long story because it’s been an issue that’s been festering in my family for a long time that just blew up about 2 hours ago.\n\nAnyways, for some background, my younger brother (14) has very violent tendencies and has a binge eating disorder. I (17 F) was away this weekend at my base for military training. During my lunch break, I get a text from my mom that basically is telling me that my brother binge ate all of the ice cream she had set aside for our dying grandmother (she won’t eat anything but ice cream). I text her back and told her that he ate all of my travel snacks for the drive up to my base too.\n\nAfter this, (this is what I’ve been told by my other siblings, I was away this weekend) my mom confronted him about eating grandma’s food and he got really defensive and called her worthless because she doesn’t have a job. She doesn’t have a job because she used to work at a prison but they wouldn’t hire a CO to protect her (she’s a nurse) while she was treating patients. After that, he physically attacked her. My father sat there and did nothing. My sister tells me she walked in on our mom staring at the wall and crying after this happened.\n\nOn my way home the next day, my mom calls me and tells me to explain to my father how my brother treats the rest of us (he treats everyone in the family poorly and has drawn knives on multiple occasions). She did this because dad often enables my brother’s behavior by defending him every time he hurts someone. Not to mention, he often makes racist comments to our adopted Asian sisters.\n\nI come home around 9 PM, the house is tense but quiet. Next day, today, I’m just chilling/cuddling with my boyfriend in my room. I get a phone call from my dad telling me to come to the living room to work stuff out with my brother. Eventually the whole family gets involved. My mother is telling my father that she doesn’t feel safe anymore and that she wants to leave (brother is 2x her size, dad doesn’t defend her). Dad is telling her that she’s wrong for abandoning the family. Most of us side with mom because we agree she shouldn’t have to live with this. I start explaining to dad that he is enabling the kid and since he only listens to our father, I believe it’s his responsibility to try and change his behavior. If any of us say anything to my brother it usually turns into us being physically or verbally abused. This never happens with my father because my father is the only person in the house who is larger than my brother.\n\nThen mom starts bringing stuff up related to his brother’s murder. She tells us that he wasn’t murdered as an innocent man like dad told us and that he was murdered because he raped a 13 year old girl. Dad’s face was absolutely horrified. I could tell he never wanted us to find that out. Mom goes on about how his brother never had any consequences growing up and turned into a felon and that our brother is on the same path. She says she’s leaving as soon as grandma dies and that she’ll press charges against him if he lays a hand on anybody else. Personally, I believe mom bringing this up was meant to hurt dad rather than to make a point.\n\nI defended my mother in this whole ordeal and really dished it out to my dad. I honestly feel bad because I do love my dad, I know he didn’t do any of this on purpose; and I wish I hadn’t gotten involved but I didn’t have much of a choice considering both parents were contacting me for help throughout the whole issue. Now my dad doesn’t want to talk to me. AITA? I’m really concerned about my relationship with my dad over this, but at the same time I’m concerned about my wellbeing (&amp; the other females in my family) as my brother is violent.",

      "description": "Sorry for poor formatting as I am on mobile.\n\nBest Friend’s Mom = BFM\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that there was no personal motivation behind why I did it. As some back story, my best friends mom owned a cafe. They were struggling with finding employees so I agreed to come in and train for free (important later on). After about a week of training, I started working as a solo employee opening up the place (also important). After working around 3 shifts, we had a disagreement and I was fired. Not upset about it. The next day, they close the place down for financial reasons.\n\nHere’s where the wage violations come in. A few days after the scheduled payday, I checked my bank account and there was no paycheck. I sat on it for a week before deciding to text her asking why I hadn’t gotten paid. Long story short, BFM deflects on the reasoning, gets very mad and proceeds to call me “a piece of work.” \n\nI really needed the paycheck. Later I posted on a certain law-related subreddit asking what to do. They suggested filing a claim with the Department of Labor. Doing what any sensible teenager does, I check with my friends. They say go for it, so I do. \n\nToday I got a call from the department. We talked and it was mentioned that I, being a minor, wasn’t allowed to work as early as I had. My agent said it might be helpful to get in touch with BFM to let her know, essentially saying pay me or pay fines.\n\nWell I did and it blew up in my face.\n\nMy best friend calls me screaming saying we’re through and how I shouldn’t have attacked her family like this. Now all of my friends are saying I’m an asshole for reporting her over a few hundred bucks.\n\nWas I the asshole?",

      "description": "My fiance and I share the same first name - exactly the same spelling. She has an unusual, difficult to spell last name which she hates, people misspell it on a daily basis. We have been together for a few years and even I get frustrated when dealing with people getting it wrong (dinner reservations, plane tickets etc) so I understand how annoying and inconvenient it must have been for her for her whole life. She cannot wait to have my 'regular' last name. \n\nI should also mention that we are both women. The jokes that come when meeting new people get old real quick. \n\nThe more I think of sharing the same last name the more I don't want to. It seems like its going to open up a massive can of worms - things like opening mail, bills, future child custody and even signing off on emails is just going to be confusing for nearly everyone we interact with, having two moms may already be confusing for our future kids let alone dealing with day cares, schools, doctors etc. I'm going to get really sick of *\"which Jane Smith are you?\"* I'm also not a fan of the prospect of having to put my middle initial on every correspondence and every interaction for the rest of my life. *'Yours sincerely, Jane A. Smith'* I think would make me sound like a right punce. \n\nTo me, it seems that changing her last name won't actually make her life any easier, in fact I think that it will be worse and bring me into the mess at the same time. \n\nI've subtly mentioned that it won't be a good idea to which her response is that I don't know how hard it has been for her her whole life. When I brought it up again her response was to just stare at me as if how dare I bring it up again, so I've just let it be for now. The wedding is ages away, there is no way this changes my feelings toward marrying her. \n\nWIBTA if I take a stronger stance on this? ",

AITA for wanting to still be friends with my friends who are moms and NOT wanting to only talk about their children? Or wanting to see them away from their children?\n\nKids are great but I still want to hear other things about their lives. I know that their days are filled with potty training and pick ups at day care but they must still retain some part of themselves that doesn’t have to do with their kids, right? I’d like to hear about how work is going or about the new podcast that they are listening to or basically anything besides the kids.\n\nI’m not saying that I mind hearing about their kids, but I wish they would make it a little bit more of a priority to still maintain their old friendships. I have some friends that spend our phone conversations interrupting our conversation to talk to their kids. \n\nMy own mother tries to tell me that I don’t understand how hard and time consuming parenting is and that eventually, down the line, when their kids are older and more self sufficient, they’ll be able to have lives again that include friends that don’t have kids. \n\nAITA for not wanting to wait seven years for my parent friends to decide that they have time to have friends?",

      "description": "Just a little background info, We've been dating a little over 3 years now and he's been renting a room in my house for about a year. He's a great guy, but I can't handle the amount of laziness and slob that he is.\n\n\nNow, I'm a tidy person, but I don't go overboard and I think I'm reasonable to what I would like help with. I clean the bedroom and my childs room to my standards but I'm okay with the rest of the house, problem is, the rest of the house doesn't get done unless I do it or my child does it (or tries her best to help)\n\n\nI've asked numerous times to help do the daily chores around the house like dishes, sweeping, laundry, etc. But he won't do them. He does the dishes occassionally and I've only seen him sweep once, and that was when I went through a bad bout of depression.\n\n\nIt's not just the chores that's getting to me though, it's the amount of dishes that are left in his room for weeks, cups and glasses for days left on the bedside table, rubbish that is left on the counters, food scraps in the sink, tea bags left lying around, drink spills that left unclean, piss thats left lying in the toilet bowl, empty boxes left in the frige/freezer/pantry... I could go on.\n\n\nThe highlight of this slobbiness was when my child had to show him how to use the washing machine because he didn't know how. She's 5.\nEven after that, he only put a select amount of clothes in the dryer and left the rest in the washing basket for me to hang out.\n\n\nI had a talk with him the other day about how I was getting exhausted cleaning all the time and picking up after him, having to round the house for items that aren't where they should be. I even asked why he doesn't hang out laundry, or fold clothes, or even recycle the clothes that he doesn't wear. He simply responded with \"I don't want to\".\n\n\nI'm fine with doing the bigger chores such as cleaning out the gutters, but this guy won't even take out the bins..\n\n\nAITA for wanting to break up over his laziness?",

      "description": "Heads up, this is being posted on mobile so my apologies for any formatting issues.\n\n\nMy brother is getting married! Yay! I absolutely love my future sister-in-law. We aren’t super tight (we don’t hang out just the two of us) but we get along well at family functions and have some inside jokes. They are getting married in July and we already have to travel for the wedding. No big deal!\n\nI just got the invite for her bridal shower. Her friends and family are from NYC and her mother is hosting the shower in her tiny apartment. My mother, grandmother, brother’s godmother, and dad’s girlfriend have all been invited too. We are expected to either take the train to the city or drive/train to attend the shower. We live about 4 hours from the city. At this point, only my mother and myself are even willing to consider going. It’s too much for the other family members to do in one day. We were not offered a place to stay overnight. We really can not afford a hotel in the area she lives in. \n\nWe offered to throw her a small shower for everyone here since we are all family and want to celebrate. She does not want two showers. I should say that my brother doesn’t want two showers. I have not spoken to her about this, but I know my mother has spoken to my brother and he was livid at the idea of us not attending. \n\nI feel this is a lot for her to ask of us. It would be about 8 hours of traveling in one day for a 2 hour shower. Would I be the asshole for not attending the shower for these reasons? My husband thinks it’s absurd to go, but myself and my mother feel like we have to. ",

She was initially going to move with her parents back in arizona but they have since changed their minds and told her she can't move back because they're already housing my ex's sister, her bf and their 2 kids so the house is full. I understand this is a sucky situation to be in but I told her I am not responsible for her because we aren't in a relationship anymore. I told her she should couch surf with one of her friends but she keeps telling me that she doesn't want to dump her problems on her friends like that and that it would be humiliating for her. I feel like i am up against a wall here. The job market for her line of work isn't the greatest in our city so her finding a job could take a while. \n\nI really dont want her in my life or in my apartment anymore, I am over her but she insists that i am being heartless even though i gave her time to find a new place. i want her to leave by next monday because i know if i let her stay here it'll be months before she finds a job and a new place to live",

      "description": "TL;DR bottom. \n\nEver since I was little, I hated going to people’s houses. It’s like having a mini-panic attack walking through the door of someone’s home because I won’t eat there, I won’t drink there, I find it super stressful to use their bathroom, I don’t even really like to use their furniture. I actually get so stressed that I feel physically ill. It’s not just friends, I don’t go to my  family’s houses either, I barely go to my mothers house. Because of this, I just avoid going to houses. Everyone knows that yes, I do want to see you, and if you don’t feel like visiting me, we can always go out somewhere and do something. Never been a problem with anyone in my life, it’s not like I never see them because of it...save for one person. \n\nI met my best friend in middle school, a decade ago. I went to her house sometimes but very rarely. She ended up bringing it up, so I told her what I told everyone else. I made a little extra effort to go to her house once in a while and things were fine for a bit, but then I tapered off. Once or twice a year she would get angry at me and every time we would have the same argument, just a little more in detailed as I got older, and I’d beg her to please just let it go. \n\nI hang out with her at my house, or the bar, or a concert, or fishing, hiking, eating, movies, etc. I enjoy spending time with her, but I rarely go to her house. A few days ago, she asks if she can come down and do her homework, I say yes. I get home from work and get a text saying she decided to do it at her house instead. After my shower I text her that I’m ready, no response. \n\nShe texts me out of the blue saying it’s really bothering her that I won’t come to her house, that I’m being a hypocrite because I went to my boyfriends house in high school. I told her that’s because I was dating him and still rarely went to his house to do more than meet him. Said I avoid *everybody’s* houses and I’m willing to go anywhere with her besides that. She said I’m “making it sound like it’s a part of my personality when it’s not” and “you don’t even want to work on it for me.” It has never not been a part of my life,  it doesn’t pose an issue to me, my family, my friends, boyfriends...only her. \n\nI compared it to if she was afraid of snakes. If I knew she was that anxious about them, that she would avoid them at all costs, I would never ask her to force herself to come stand with me in a snake room. I wouldn’t be pissed off at her for not wanting to work on that for me. She won’t speak to me, I haven’t heard from her in days. \n\n\nTL;DR I have super anxiety about being in people’s houses. Everybody in my life is cool with it, except for my best friend. Argue at least once a year, I apologize and beg her to let it go. She compared herself to my past boyfriends and I compared it to her being terrified of snakes and I’d never force her to be around them. She refuses to talk to me. AITA?",

      "description": "For starters, I’m a teenager. While I’m not trying to make an excuse for my behavior, I’m just trying to say that my emotions are out of whack (especially with birth control) and I want to know if I’m in the wrong and how I can change.\n\nI went out for the day with my mom to go clothes shopping, it’s something that we needed to do but hadn’t picked a specific day for. This past Saturday I had the day off of work, I was going to ask if we could go clothes shopping that day but the night before my mom was a little upset because I wanted to go to a friends house for an hour or two. This friend likes to drink/party and she doesn’t want me to associate with them for this reason. The next morning wanting to see if she was still upset with me I went out and tried to ask if we could go, but she was still upset and I decided not to re-ask. \n\nBecause of this I made plans with my boyfriend, we planned to make breakfast and just relax and do homework at his house for the day. I started to get ready and my mom seemed to get better so when she asked if we could go I eventually agreed. I told my boyfriend I wouldn’t be able to come over but I would be later that day.\n\nWe were gone for majority of the day and I honestly had fun, I love talking being able to talk with her so it was nice to have a 2 hour car ride to do just that. Bonus because she let me play my music during!\n\nNow this is where the problem started, I was rather upset during this so I’m going to try to say it as un-biased for you as I can. (Also sorry if I sound robotic, trying my best to not type/sound like an idiot on mobile).\n\nBefore driving back we planned to go out for dinner, seeing that all the restaurants in town were filled we decided to drive back home and eat at a restaurant in our city. Up to this point I forgot about going over to my boyfriends house until he messaged me when I’d be over. I’ve spent almost 12 hours with my mom at this point and seeing as it was late and this was the only day I’d be able to see my boyfriend due to soccer matches he was in for Friday and Sunday, I asked if we could take our meal to go in order to save time and see him. \n\nI realize this was a dick move to try and cut time with my mom when she wanted to get dinner but they way she reacted was over the top. She started yelling at me saying that the whole day was wasted and I was a user who only needed her when I wanted something. All this for wanted to take wings to go and eat them at home? I was willing to eat with her, I just asked if we could take it home. She claimed that I was a ungrateful brat and I only wanted to spend time with my boyfriend. Which I think is weird and hurtful considering I pushed back plans with him to spend time with her. \n\nShe still isn’t talking to me, and is rather cold to me since Saturday. Even during the car ride she wouldn’t talk to me, my dad called her and she vented to him about how I’m a terrible child who only wants to use her and won’t spend time with her. \n\nI realize that I maybe shouldn’t have asked to leave/take the dinner to go in order to cut time with her, but I feel like she shouldn’t have reacted that way for me just asking a question.\n\nPlease let me know though, if I’m the problem I should really fix it before it gets worse.\n",

      "description": "Recently my cousin invited me to a wedding that is slated to be in in the fall of this year. He invited a lot of people to his wedding, from what it seems it's mostly friends and family, and invited guests to bring a +1. I don't really have a +1 besides my parents and I don't really want to be around them the whole time.\n\nI've never really been to close to my family, I've hung out with my cousins when I was a teenager but after college a lot of stuff happened. In 2016 I lost my older brother and a lot of the family reached out to me but my cousins never really mentioned it, probably for the better because I was in a real state of disliking the family only coming together for that. Recently my cousin has nonchalantly been pushing more conversative ideas that make me find him distasteful and actually pretty hateful.\n\nI brought this up with my parents saying that I didn't feel comfortable going to his wedding. I didn't tell them why I felt that way just more of a \"why would I go if I dont support them\" type of thing. But my parents say that I should be supportive of him because he's my cousin and that it's a family event, I should show good graces towards family as a social obligation.\n\nAITA for not putting my differences aside for this one event even if its more so to make my parents happy than it is for my cousin?",

My unit is right next to another apartment complex, and my neighbor's is in that other apartment complex (but not mine) that are all owned by LRC. I can frequently hear my neighbor's dog barking at random times all throughout the day, and I usually hear it about once a day when I am home. I have been mostly able to ignore it up till now, but he was barking fairly late last night (I have to go to bed early for 8am classes). And I've remembered LRC has a no pets rule, in fact on their website it says in all caps \"NO PETS ALLOWED.\" I'm also finding piles of dog poop around the section of grass that separates our buildings. So Reddit, WIBTA if I complained to LRC and made them lose the dog or get kicked out?",

She had a reputation for being quite... promiscuous. Now, normally I have no issue with that. Girls can do whatever they want, ain’t none of my business. But she would often talk to me about other dudes she was also being sexual with (for lack of better words). One time she even sent my friend nudes while I was sitting next to him without him even asking. I really liked her, but she just saw me as another dude to fuck basically. This slowly started bothering me more and more, until one night she was telling me about this dude she was sending nudes to, and I just gave up. I blocked her on snap and iMessage. During the time I talked to her, it really fucked with my mental health, but ever since cutting off communication I’ve been a lot happier and back to my normal self. Did I do the right thing here? Am I an asshole? \n\nAlso, I’ll probably have to see her tomorrow as winter break for my school ends tomorrow. ",

      "description": "I recently left the church I have been a member of my whole life. My wife is still a member and attends every week. I intentionally didn't mention what sect, because I want you to judge objectively, not based on your personal religious preferences. \n\nMy wife wants to take him, and I want to disallow it. \n\nI have 2 primary reasons why I think I'm justified in this:\n\n1. I want him to be free to choose what he believes or doesn't believe about religion. I feel that young children by default believe what adults tell them, so by being subjected to adults and authority figures all passionately teaching the church doctrine as fact, children's right to choose for themselves whether to believe is stolen from them. \n2. Teaching that if you disobey god's commandments, you will go to hell for eternity and are unworthy to be in god's presence is a form of psychological abuse, IMHO. I have had massive psychological damage and low self-worth my entire life because of this, and am only now breaking away from it. \n\nMy wife and I both agree that we will respect his decision when he's older, but I feel like if he is \"forced\" to believe before he can defend himself, that a lot of the damage will have been done. Once he's old enough to think for himself, (12?) of course I will allow him to go. \n\nShe's also on board with letting him not go if he's LGBTQ+, but again, by the time he would know that, the damage will have been done. \n\nObviously both of us should have an equal say in how the child is raised, but I feel like my method of not teaching him anything about religion and her method of having a large community of adults actively trying to indoctrinate him are apples and oranges. \n\nLetting him go every other week is an option I suppose, but I think that that's still ample opportunity for brainwashing. I could actively teach him not to believe but I would feel like an asshole about that, and it goes against my philosophy of letting him decide for himself. I will definitely teach him as much as I can about science and critical thinking, and to ask thoughtful, logical questions about what he is learning at church. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "The day my niece was born, I was obviously excited. But that was it, just excitement and curiosity. I didn't really feel love. I hadn't addressed the thought until I heard my other sister (not mother of niece) talk about how everytime she sees her, she's filled with a sense of love.\n\nNow, she's about a year old, and everyone in my family talks about her so endearingly. I wanna clarify that I don't feel jealous of the attention or anything like that, I just genuinely can't relate to what they say about her. I don't feel any connection to her past the obvious \"Aw cute baby\" feeling. And I can never grasp conversations about her either. Like, I don't understand how they can all talk about her so long because I just get bored immediately. Our family group chat is just full of pictures of her and then people proceeding to send many, _many_ heart emojis, call her cute, etc. It also isn't that I'm trying to act all cOoL and eDgY by not liking a baby, I just sincerely can't relate to how everyone else feels. And I feel really bad about it. I always try to interact with her, but it comes off as awkward and forced, which makes it obvious that I don't really want to be doing it. That, of course, makes my parents quite frustrated, especially when the baby's calling out for specifically me.\n\nI really wish I could relate to how my family sees my neice because, well, it feels like when people are referencing a movie you've never watched, and you try to keep being in the conversation with no knowledge of what they're talking about. It also seems as if this feeling is going to keep being there as I become older and reach the age of having children. That's going to be a major cause for me being a black sheep in the family (my family's pretty gossipy and throughout the years, I've heard various comments about other people along the lines of \"I don't understand how they don't want children, seems crazy to me\"). It also just feels like I'm constantly being rude around my sister and her daughter even though I don't try to.",

I'm the only one he calls by the wrong name. \n\n\"How goes it, Eddie?\"\n\n\"Eddie, why are you stacking those like that?\"\n\n\"Eddie, that's not how you use the coffee machine!\"\n\nAt first, i let it slide because i just figured he was senile and didn't know who i was. I corrected him, he called me by my name for about a day. The next day, he kept calling me Eddie.\n\nTBH i wouldn't mind it, this guy is kind of a prick. He isn't above me in terms of position, we hold the same position. He's not a manager or anything. But he corrects me on every little thing. Even though i'm doing it the way the boss told me.\n\nMy first day stocking shelves, i was apparently putting the stuff up wrong. I was putting top shelf items on the bottom shelf. The manager corrected me. While the manager is trying to show me the right way, he shouts across the room. \"Now Eddie! I know you got more sense then that! Put that stuff on the bottom shelf where it belongs!\"\n\nThe manager was already telling me how, but he chose to embarrass me in front of the entire store.\n\nHe makes fun of me for being on a diet. I got a salad for lunch and  he started mocking me \"Hell, Eddie, that's not enough to even keep a damn bird alive!\"\n\nSo, i finally snapped. I shouted at him that my name wasn't Eddie.  \n\"My God, My name's not Eddie! Jesus, if you're gonna act like you run this place, at least get my fucking name right!\"\n\nEveryone in the store was staring at me and i feel kind of guilty.

      "description": "Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night I work until 3am. Boyfriend works till 4pm Thursday, and has Friday and Saturday off. He’s worked about 45-50 hours this week as he always does but just so happens to be sick this week (a cold, deathly af I know) every week is always the same always where I get home I go to sleep at 3-4 and wake up around 11-12 the next day and get ready for another long night at work. The days I do not work and he has off he sleeps in till his heart desire which is way more than eight hours he’ll sleep like 12 just because.  So we’re talking through text right now and he’s going to see a apartment for us tomorrow at nine am as we are trying to move. I told him to take the baby and he kinda complained and said okay only if I can sleep in Saturday. Mind you I’m working until three tonight and Friday night. Friday he has off but is seeing the apartment (which I’m covering his half for security deposit and first months rent initially, which I sent out all the emails and texts for fifty plus apartments which some of them I will see myself when I’m not working) then he is moving some of his ex girlfriends shit which has been in our current apartment for a year he’s moving it with her brother out of the apartment and to her brother vehicle, it’s not even a lot of stuff. And he’s sick with his deathly cold.  This is turning into a bit ridiculous fight and he’s saying every excuse to try to sleep more when HE CAN SLEEP EASILY TEN HOURS OR MORE TONIGHT TOMORROW AND SATURDAY! It’s pissing me off because I sleep till noon he seems to see this as “sleeping in” even though I worked till 3-4 am.",

They don’t just “beep” once... it’s like “BEEPBEBEEP BEEPBEEP BEBEEEEEEEEP” as their pulling up. They also have people beeping over the weekends and in the evenings around 8-9pm. I don’t know if they’re breaking an ordinance or anything... but I feel like it’s fucking rude and obnoxious to beep around other houses like that unless the street is blocked or there’s some kind of reason for it while driving.\n\nBecause we own our house and they rent I don’t want to be an asshole and open up a can of worms if they decide to respond by harassing us in some way... since it wouldn’t be very easy to move. Should I just live with the beeping or try to find a way to ask them to have their friends stop? Would I be the asshole if I said something? These are grown ass adults btw.",

      "description": "I went to college in a big town (3h away from my hometown), and lived in an apartment in the outskirts of the town. Students like me moved mostly by public transportation, bus, metro, tram etc, so when me and my friends wanted to have a night out I would usually go a friend's apartment dressed comfy and get changed there, I didn't want to ride late at night in heels and a dress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, me and this girl (Maria) I was friends with decided to go dancing that night, it was just the two of us since the others weren't feeling like it. So I took the train, went to her apartment, got changed into a short dress, heels and clutch, leaving my comfy clothes and big bag (with my house keys) there, and off we went. We took a taxi to a club neither of us went before, super hyped and a bit tipsy (we drank a bit before leaving her place, cocktails in the clubs are like super expensive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time me and my boyfriend (who lived in my hometown) were in a rought patch, so after a while, while we were having a good time dancing and having fun, he texted me that he was going to sleep. I left my friend queueing for the toilet, telling her I was stepping out of the club to call my bf real quick and that she could find me right in front of the entrance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe ended up arguing over the phone, me crying and such, was drunk and probably looking really miserable since a girl and a guy I didn't know went and sat with me, trying to cheer me up as soon as I hung up. I actually talked with them for a while, and then realized I hadn't seen my friend. The two helped me look for her, and in the crouded club I ended up losing the girl while the guy stayed with me. After looking everywhere I was getting really worried, went back out and tried to call Maria. She picked up at like the 10th call, and told me \"I couldn't find you so I went home with this guy I met, I'm at his place now\". I was like WTF, my house keys were at her place and she left me, drunk and alone, at a club??? Pissed and worried, I had her tell me the address to this guy's place, I was going to get her and go back to her place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI explained the situation to the guy who stuck with me (Mark), and he wanted to accompany me to the taxis (bless his gentle soul!) but I refused, he had already been so gentle, I was good by myself. Still gave me his number and asked me to text him if needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo off I went, on wobbly heels, drunk and muttering while superpissed at Maria for leaving me like that. As I was going, there where 3 guys going my way that were like \"what's the matter, u ok?\". In my drunk and pissed state, I told them my situation and they offered me a ride. Big alarms going off in my head, in a car with 3 guys I don't know?? No way! They told me they were Carabinieri (like police), and showed me their IDs. A bit unsure, I accepted the ride. While driving, the guys where telling me \"you're ok with us, but don't ever accept a ride again from someone you don't know ok?? Always be safe\", which honestly was making me shitting myself coz I was realizing what situation I got myself into. Called Maria again, told her to wait for me at the door so I could see her when I got there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end the 3 guys actually drove me to her, I cannot tell you the relief!! I thanked them endlessly, and watch them go. Maria wanted me to sleep a the guy's place (are you kidding???), I called a taxi and took us both to her place, got my keys and went home. I started drifting away from her after that. I couldn't trust her! She surely was the asshole that night, but am I the asshole for cutting her out of my life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have a friend whom I've known for years who lives with her abusive parents.  She's in her 20s, but isn't \"allowed\" to learn how to drive; hang out with people; or have a job outside of working from home, for her mom's boss, who pays her $100 a week for 30+ hours of work.  She has very few friends, maybe 2 or 3 she relies on for support. She's in college, but her parents always guilt her into giving them her scholarship money (and spend none of it on food or the counseling and medications she needs).  They actively push her toward breakdowns in order to keep her under their control.  She's not at all at fault for her situation, but...\n\nShe won't let anyone help her, and won't do anything to help herself.  She has access to free counseling at school to help with her mental issues, but refuses to use them because she \"already knows what her issues are and how to fix them but is too lazy\" (her words, not mine).  She's had multiple people offer for her to stay with them while she finds a job and gets her feet under her, but she refuses under the guise of not wanting to freeload, even when given the option of a \"live-in maid\" situation or an agreed upon payment plan.  She wouldn't let herself or anyone else notify authorities when her 15 y.o. sister was being fed roughly four meals a week.  Every day, she talks in our group chat about how awful things are, but ignores everything we say.  If she says something hurtful to one of us, instead of apologizing she blames her situation and how she \"can't get the help she needs.\"\n\nI've tried everything from offering to buy her food to stash at home, to letting her become my roommate, to paying for meds.  Nothing has come out of any of it, and it's been literal years.\n\nI'm at wit's end, and I don't have the emotional spoons to keep trying to reason with and be one of her support mainstays. I've got my own personal mental shitshow to deal with, and it's getting to the point where I care about her situation more out of moral obligation than actual sympathy.  I don't plan on cutting contact, but I'm *tired* of listening to her complain about her situation, offer solutions and advice and sympathy, get completely ignored or even attacked, rinse and repeat.\n\nSo, WITBA if I took a step back and just let her situation run it's course, at least until she's got enough of a grasp to accept help?",

Next week I'm going back to London for work without her, which happens to be the next stop on the band's UK tour. I mentioned to her that I might get tickets to see them again, maybe even get standing tickets (we couldn't get standing tickets when we went to see them together because the venue didn't allow under 18s in the pit).\n\nShe told me flat out that if I went to see them again without her she would be furious. I asked her why and she struggled to say precisely, but I think it had more to do with me seeing them without her rather than kinda preserving the sanctity of the shared experience or whatever. \n\nI think this is pretty unreasonable and tried to make the case that me seeing them without her when we've already seen them together shouldn't make her upset or angry, the goodness of that experience shouldn't be diminished by me having an additional good experience, but she wasn't having any of it. She told me there was no point trying to convince her, she would just be gutted if I saw them again without her.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I went to see them again without her? Seeing them together was a really great sibling experience for us and it was a Christmas gift to her, so I'm very conscious about kinda poisoning that memory for her. I could lie and go and see them without telling her, but I don't like lying and if she asked me if I saw them again (unlikely but possible) I don't think I'd be able to lie to her.",

I emailed back saying \"hi, here is my number, ###-###-####, let me know what time works for you.\"  We went back and forth a few times over email and settled on 6 PM the next day.  During the exchange, he hadn't given me his phone number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTomorrow rolls around, and I emailed him a few hours beforehand asking to confirm that he's still on for 6 PM, and he emails back saying yes.   6 o'clock rolls around, no call, no email, no knock on the door.  6:15, no call, no email, no knock on the door. 6:30, no call no email, no knock on the door.

And then another email 7 minutes later saying he was leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'll admit that I should've checked my spam folder, but I think that he also could have put in some effort.  I gave him my number, he could have called or texted.  He knew the exact address, he could have knocked on the door.",

      "description": "Hi.\n\nI'm going to try to keep some details light, as the issue is very sensitive right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my wife were living long distance for years, and in different countries while doing immigration related paperwork. We're finally living together, in a very small space. Not only that, but its an entirely new country, and I had to go through the whole immigration process to be here. Its been hard, emotionally, uprooting my life and adjusting to a new environment like this, leaving family and friends behind, quitting my job and all my old routines. I've been trying to adjust, but needless to say, its hard and takes time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I had an argument some time after moving in together, and the issue kind of escalated into something more, I feel. I told her that I felt as if she didn't respect my personal space. I repeatedly told her that I need some spaces in our house that are just \"my space\" because it currently feels like I just moved into \"her house\" and all of my stuff has been just piled in a corner for 2 months because I have no where to spread out and get comfortable. She insisted that everything was \"our space\" but I told her that I just don't feel that way yet, because there's nothing of mine here yet. I asked her if I could move some things around, and she got defensive about it. I asked her if she would be ok with me moving her night stand, her clothing racks, her personal items hanging on the wall, and she basically said no because those were her things. She wanted to put shelves on the wall, but in areas that I dedicated as \"my space\" (the video game area, my night stand, my computer work area). I told her that I don't want shelves there because I have to reach behind the monitor/tv a lot and I don't want a potential head injury. As well, we have a cat, and I don't want the cat to get hurt from a shelf collapsing. I feel like my reasons were reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I reiterated \"see, you understand what I'm saying. You wouldn't want me moving your computer station, or hanging things around your night stand, because those are your personal spaces. Why I can't I have a personal space? Why do you feel its ok to dictate what goes in, around, or above my personal spaces? That's not fair. I want this to be \"our space\"  too but right now its 99% your stuff and I don't feel like I'm at liberty to just put my stuff out without it becoming an \"us\" issue.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also started hanging some posters, organizers, etc on the wall, and she freaked out and started screaming at me because \"we can't nail anything to the walls\" because she wants good landlord reviews. I told her that small nail holes in walls are considered normal wear and tear for apartment use, and its not a huge deal. I also mentioned to her that it feels hypocritical that it was ok when she wanted to put up shelves, but when I want to put something up \"I'm putting up nails carelessly without thought.\" She kept insisting that it was a serious problem nailing things to the wall. When I finally was able to convince her that nailing small shelves and posters to the wall is ok, her reasoning for being upset shifted. So she agreed that nailing things up was ok, but the problem was that I wasn't respecting her, because she said NOT to nail things up, and because I didn't think it was a huge deal (nor did I expect it to be one) that I was disregarding her feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her that I don't feel like she's respecting me, or my intelligence either. I've had lots of history with landlords. If the lease says you can't nail things up, then you shouldn't. If the lease says nothing, its generally ok so long as you don't put a fucking boot through the wall. Our lease had no mention about normal wear and tear from small nails. It should be fine. And I told her if she really is worried, we can buy a small can of drywall and go over the less than 1mm holes. Its not a big deal, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after talking her through everything and calming her down, we both came to the agreement that we can nail things to the walls, but if its large items in shared spaces, or in the other persons personal spaces, it needs to be agreed upon. And I told her thats all I wanted from the start. That I simply didn't want wall shelves in possible head injury zones (which is a lot of in our very small apartment). So, we hung up some lights and various other things together, and I kept reminding her, as calmly and gently as I could, that \"we're fine, everything is fine. See, no one is hurt, its not the end of the world.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMove things forward a few days, and something of a similar nature came up again. I wanted some personal space/time to do something, and she wasn't respecting that. I brought it up again, that I feel like she doesn't respect my individuality. This argument shifted to her accusing me of \"being controlling, arrogant, and manipulative.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis really blind sided me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat was weirder about this is that no one else in my life has ever accused me of such things, not previous partners, friends, family, not even people who don't like me have accused me of being manipulative and controlling. And she's never brought this up in the years we've been together too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I take her thoughts and feelings very seriously, so I considered it for a second. I tried to identify if any of my behavior was cruel or unusual. I wasn't sure what she was referring to. I calmly asked her for some examples of how I am controlling, and she listed the incidents above. I explained to her the same things I've explained here, and before: that I just want certain spaces to myself, the same as she does. I want to be respected and have my thoughts and feelings considered. Nothing more or less. I thought maybe she understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to let it go for now. The next day I talked to an old friend, one who I've lived with before too. I asked him to be brutally honest (which he's good at), and if he ever thought that I was controlling, or manipulative. He said, \"you have strong boundaries, which is not a bad thing. Some people find that to be 'controlling,' but I've never felt like you've wanted me to think or act in a specific way.\" Which I told him that's basically what I thought. I have boundaries and self respect, and a sense of personal space. I don't feel like I've overstepped anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to bring this issue up with her again. That I didn't feel respected. This whole event led to her rolling her eyes at me, getting increasingly angry, and stomping off into the other room. I felt as if I couldn't have been any more clear about what I was trying to say. I broke down into tears because I felt like I was talking to a wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I was sobbing for a few minutes, her whole attitude changed. Now she was willing to listen, and ask me what's wrong. I said \"I feel like you don't listen to me. I try to stay as calm and caring as I can, and you escalate to anger. I'm trying to just tell you my perspective, tell you how I feel, and if you don't want to hear it, you yell, you shut me down, and that's that.\" She seemed to understand, and reflected on the behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we are here again, weeks later. She's accusing me again, of being controlling, dismissive, and arrogant... that I am unwilling to respect her feelings. We've had this conversation a few times. \n\nI ask her \"can you give me some examples of my controlling behavior? If I'm doing that, I want to know so I can change.\" \n\nShe says \"I can't think of any examples.\"\n\nI tell her, \"If you can't give me examples of this behavior, then what am I supposed to reflect on? I'm trying to see this behavior in myself, but I don't. I really care about your feelings. If you feel I'm being hurtful, I need to know how so I can do better.\"\n\nShe says, \"I don't have examples. Its just all the time.\"\n\nI tell her, \"saying things like 'always' and 'all the time' and 'you never listen' is extreme and hyperbolic, and it gets us no where. I can't do anything with such vague accusations, especially if I don't see it in myself, and you can't identify any events where I've actually done these things. All it does is make me question my own sanity and my own self perception, and that doesn't go anywhere either. So what am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do?\"\n\nShe says, \"I don't know.\"\n\nI tell her, \"Then I don't know what to do either. I've told you very explicitly how I think, and how I feel. I need to you to be able to verbalize your own thoughts and feelings. I want to understand, but you're not giving me anything to work with.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? She is accusing me of everything that I feel she is doing. I bring up very specific events where I've been hurt, so we can work on it. She can't give any examples and instead says my behavior is \"always\" and \"all the time.\" If she does give me an example, of when I disrespected her, I apologize, and explain my point of view and that I didn't mean any harm. Then she accuses me of dismissing her feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says she feels like \"everything she does is wrong\" and again I tell her that is hyperbolic, and I don't think that about her. But also simultaneously, everything I say gets shot down by her as well. I feel stuck, and we didn't used to talk to each other this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the difference, to me is, that I don't feel like I've changed the way I engage in disagreement. I try to listen to what a person is saying, understand how they're feeling, empathize, correct any misunderstanding they might have, or I might have, and reach a compromise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like we get stuck on the \"correct any misunderstanding\" part, and she blames that as also being me \"not caring about her feelings.\" But I just don't understand where these feelings and accu",

      "description": "To make a very long story short, my parents (especially my father) are emotionally and verbally abusive, and have threatened violence on more than one occasion (he definitely needs his own post on r/justnofamily but that’s for a different day). I recently got engaged to my boyfriend of almost six years; during this entire time, my parents have made snide remarks on everything about him. He’s a bit older than me (he’s 28 and I’m 23, we started dating two months before I turned 18), they gripe about his job, his schooling, occasionally his physical appearance, and continue to try and set me up with other guys, especially ones from their church. I always tell them to stop, and they will for a while, but it’s clear they have no respect for either of us or our relationship.\n\nRecently the apartments we’ve been looking at have become available to rent. They’re between our jobs and only 15 minutes from my school, and the rent is extremely good compared to everything else in the area. We figured it would be a good idea to get an apartment now since we plan on getting married in October, and when I brought this up to my mom she flipped. Asked why I couldn’t just wait to finish school to move out, why I couldn’t wait on getting married, etc, and I just reminded her that I’m getting married and asked where I would live. She suggested getting a trailer out on our land near their house but to me that’s basically the same as living with them. She’s been huffy ever since but whatever. I don’t think my dad knows but he’s been even more of an asshole recently, screaming and cussing if I disagree with him on anything (especially politics) or say I don’t feel like going to church, which is the main reason I’m hoping to move out.\n\nSo my question is: would I be the asshole if I went down to low or no contact with them after I move out? I want to give them a chance to not be assholes but I don’t think they’ll ever respect us or our relationship.",

      "description": "Hey guys! First time poster, long time sorta lurker. And i was wondering if I was the A-holio for a situation I was just in.\nSo for context, I'm an 18 year old dude. My dad just got remarried (christian household) to my step mom a year ago and they have been working through many things. I have kinda been the one that doesn't like starting stuff when it comes to bringing up issues, so the rest of my fam is very passive with me and doesn't have many problems with me. (Not that i don't have any)\nCut to a sunday morning, i'm not feeling too well and got up too late for early church service. So they say I should still go, just to a later service, and that it works out well because they need someone to pick up my step sisters. (Twins, 5 years old) I say okay and go.\nI get to the pick-up area, and my step mommio is there with the kids (she teaches sunday school) and is stressing out a little, and has a friend of hers with her. A 20 ( 21? ) year old lady who was in a lot of abusive upbringing, i don't know her and just met her that morning. Step mom asked me to take her to work because she doesn't have a car. Fair enough, but I only have four seats. and I don't know her, so i say no. She goes on a small tangent about how she can't do this or that, and that I have to take her because I'm the only one that can. (Out of a lot of church people that would i think...?) I say no again, and that she isn't my responsibility. She then said \"well fine i guess you wanna teach sunday school huh? I can drive your car for you\". (Uhm. No. I paid for it, it's in my name) so i sat there in disbelief with my mouth open for a second and a fourth (or fifth?) Time said no. And left. \nApparently she ( her friend ) was crying when my step mom took her to her job because she felt like trash when i didn't want her in my car (I see that and understand that... but I don't have seats or know her...) She then had a good old fashion talk when I got home about how I was rude and disrespectful. Which I did apologise for.\nNow not to skew your vision, but after this is where I drew the line. She told me \"If I took all you kids (me and my siblings, Who had an emotionally abusive mother) emotional abuse, it wouldn't hold a candle to hers.\"\nSo I walked out of the room... And I don't know if i should feel bad or not...\nand I know I can (and probably was being) the A-hole, but do you guys think ITAH?",

      "description": "3 years ago I bought a house with my then partner of 5 years.  She couldn't afford the down payment, so I covered most of it and she paid the mortgage until our investment was equal.\n\nA year later, she left me and moved out.  She said she was extremely tight on money.  I still had a bed there, so I told her I'd take over the mortgage and when we sold we would split the according to vested percentage.\n\nI moved out last year.  I'd just gotten out of a hospital for depression and knew sleeping there would be bad.  She and my mom packed up the house and she found a property management company to rent the house out.  She said she wanted to pay the mortgage again.  We used our old joint account for rent income and mortgage payment. The rent fell ~$400 short of the mortgage, so we each transfer half each month.\n\n4 months ago I wanted to get rid of the house so I could finally cut all ties to her and try to move on.  I met with her and talked about options.  She wanted to continue renting and she didn't have the money to buy me out.  We agreed to offer the house to the current tenants without a back up plan.\n\nJanuary I left my job because of my depression.  I've recovered a lot, but 3 months with no income have gotten me into pretty sad state.  I have a few hundred in my checking and I put last months rent on a credit card.  I still have 10k in lines of credit.  So I've been working (poorly) on getting a job.\n\nI asked her to meet me after I realized  realized I couldn't pay my rent.  She said she wasn't ready to meet so I just texted that I was in the red and couldn't cover the mortgage.  She said she would see if she could cover it.  A week ago she called to say the tenants didn't want to buy yet and wanted one more year.  She wanted to know if it was ok.  I just told her to do whatever.  I know it's wrong, but I just don't want to deal with that stupid house anymore.\n\nToday she moved half of the money and we had the following conversation:\n\nMe: Did you decide not to cover the mortgage?\n\nHer: So you for sure cant?\n\nMe: I cannot put money into the shared account. I can put it on my credit card and xfer from the shared to my own\n\nHer: What is gonna happen next month?\n\nMe: Dunno\n   Trying to get a job before rent is due\n   Was hoping the house would be sold by now\n\nHer: The house wasn't gonna be sold by now anyways. They have 2 months.\n\nMe: ok\n\nHer: Well what do you want to do?\n   I'll just do it.\n\nMe: We already had this discussion 3 months ago and two weeks ago\n\nHer: K\n\nMe: This is why I wanted to actually talk about this is in person...\n   What is it that you're going to do exactly?\n\nHer: Emily I just transferred the money in.\n\nMe: I can put it on my credit card...\n\nHer: I don't care. If that's what you want to do then do it. If not, then don't. I just transferred the money in so we're covered.\n\n\n\nAm I the asshole in this conversation?",

I can't help you right now.\" \n\nThen she starts guilt tripping me about how I ignored her texts and how she always responds to me and how if I communicated better she wouldn't have to ask.\n\nTo which I shoot back that everyone is sick, the kid won't sleep, she's screaming, I'm exhausted, and I DID communicate that she should buy whatever she wants, just don't buy anything huge and that I told her I liked the Fisher Price pirate ship and that I don't like character clothes.\n\nShe continued acting like a victim and saying I'm mean. She continued up until 5am. My kid didn't sleep the entire night. \n\nShe has a tendency to do really nice things but it's on her terms and is sometimes really inconvenient and if you do what I did and don't show you're undying appreciation she gets offended.

      "description": "I’ve always loved my mom because well she’s my mom but I haven’t always liked her. I lived with my mom up until my junior year of high school then I moved out of state to go with my dad who was stationed in Maryland. We had our fair share of arguments when I lived with her and I always that well maybe it’s because I’m a teenager and I’m being a brat but I’m 21 now and thinking back at it some of it was so unwarranted. \n\nFor instance in high-school I had  slighty below average basketball game and she called me a bitch for being upset  with myself in front of all of chili’s and she continued on until I cried and never did I get an apology. She also beat me in front of my school because I underhand tosses the keys and she dropped them so she got upset then lied to my dad and told him I threw the keys at her face. She used to sneak by door at night even on weekends and randomly come in to take and check my phone. \n\nRecently I visited her and from the very moment I landed she saw my new earrings and said “I guess I have another daughter, why do you have the beard it’s hideous”. She very very very rarely calls me handsome but she only calls my little brother nice things. She is stubborn too “I told her and my dad they drink wayyyy too much caffeine” and she said I don’t know what I’m talking about so I look it up and show them that I am right and my mom says “you don’t anything, you’re studying computer science not medicine talk to me when you graduate”. She constantly belittles me calling me “sissy boy” “bitch” “dumbass” you name it! There is just so much shit she has said so many times she’s hit me and so many times she’s made me cry. I even told her how I had depression and she told me “I worry about things too much that aren’t important “ and that I’m a sissy.\n\nBut then she’s super manipulative because she’ll hit you with “I cook for you”, “I fight for you” , “I’d die for you” “I woke up at 5 am after working till 2 am to take you to your basketball practices other kids would’ve walked” “I’m proud of you for going to school” (which I didn’t mind) I’ve had a gf for 4 years that she won’t even acknowledge she just calls her my “friend”. \nI don’t doubt that she loves me but I don’t think she respects me and I think they come hand in hand if you truely want love from someone. I think of it like this you can’t show partial affection it’s like your half assing it, it feels like when someone lets you borrow something just to hold it over your head constantly but instead of borrowing anything she gave life to me so that’s what she uses.",

She’s taken every over the counter painkiller and it does fuck all for her. Then one night she started balling uncontrollably and said it hurt her every time she exhaled, so I suggested a doctors appointment for the next morning but she refused, got offended even. As the night progresses it gets worse and I’m on the verge of picking her up and throwing her in the car and she just cusses me out and says I’m being a jerk for not respecting her wishes as she wanted to wait two weeks until she had a break from school. But I told her I was worried at the possibility of her drifting off and stop breathing entirely in her sleep, to which she said she’d be fine and she had important things in class the next morning anyway. But I was adamant about taking her and in the end she just tossed me out in anger and I hasnt spoken to me since despite my attempts to speak to her. It’s been 3 days. So AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for calling 911 to report someone I didn't know might have attempted suicide?",
      "description": "I'm sorry, if this post is a little messy and difficult to follow, this just happened about an hour ago and I'm still pretty shaken up. Like any teenager in the twenty-first century I've made my fair share of borderline inappropriate suicide jokes, so I just want to start this off by saying I take every \"edgy\" remark with a grain of salt and calling the police really was the last thing I resorted to. Also, I live in Germany, so I didn't literally call 911, but the German emergency number, but I'll be referring to it as 911 for the sake of simplicity.\n\nThis afternoon, a mutual follower messaged me on instagram and told me he was going to commit suicide. This is not an unfamiliar situation to me, I've talked multiple friends out of moods in which they might feel like doing something stupid, so I attempted to have a conversation with him, asked him if he had anyone he could talk to, if he wanted to talk to me about it, stuff like that. The messages, which were mostly audio recordings, grew increasingly serious to the point where I was starting to think he could be in actual danger. He told me he had deep cuts on his upper arm and I told him to call 911 more than once. Still I thought he might be exaggerating and he didn't talk about any injuries anywhere near his arteries.  I also told him to get professional help which he said he'd been getting for years now. After a few hours of me trying all kinds of arguments to get this stranger to change his mind, he sent me a picture of sleeping pills. When I asked him how many he'd taken, he was very nonspecific. His speech was slurred, which obviously he could have faked, but I tend to take people seriously when they make suicidal threads because I have had a bad experience with someone who was not kidding about it. I proceeded to tell him that I would call 911, if he didn't respond within the next few minutes. I thought if it really was just a cry for help, he would answer immediately to avoid the police getting involved. Now I didn't know his real name, address or telephone number, all I had was the city he lived in, as stated in his instagram bio. At this point I really didn't know what else to do, so I called the police and told them about what had happened. Long story short, the operator asked to speak to my parents over the phone and two policemen arrived at our doorstep about 15 minutes later. \nTwo minutes, two fucking minutes before the police arrived, the guy texted me back and told me he'd thrown up the pills and was okay. He still sounded like he was about to pass out and his speech was even more slurred than before. Now I was standing there like an idiot, two annoyed policemen asking questions and treating me like the biggest idiot on the planet when I repeatedly told them that I didn't know the guy, nor had his real name, address or phone number. Just to make the situation even more embarrassing, I broke down crying in front of them. The older one of the two kept lecturing me about \"giving out my personal details to strangers\" and how he thought the account was probably fake (I can assure you, it was absolutely not, also I literally had multiple recordings of his actual voice which made it very obvious that he was in fact not a 50 year old man trying to \"talk to young girls\") and was completely irritated by the concept of talking to someone without seeing their face in real life. The younger one took me slightly more seriously, he took a few photos of the conversation, made a video of my screen while I played one if the audios and we eventually managed to get the number of the guy who was messaging me, so they could attempt to track him down and get help to him, if needed. I stopped texting him after that, knowing I couldn't tell him I'd called the police because I didn't want him to panic and hurt himself again and I honestly didn't want to continue the conversation because it's sort of messed up to send serious suicide threats to a complete stranger. \nAfter that, I had to listen to another lecture by my parents (my mother thinks I'm suicidal now, because why else would I keep talking to someone who threatened to kill himself, not like humans feel some sort of obligation to help in these situations) and I just feel terrible about the whole things. The officers told me I'd done the right thing calling the police, but still suggested that teens who cut themselves shouldn't be taken seriously concerning these kinds of threats and that I really should have known better. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for calling the police because I was worried and possibly having them show up on this guy's doorstep later that night?\nAm I the asshole for wasting those officers' time while there are probably a ton of more important things going on that they should have been looking after?\nAm I just naive for believing he might be in actual danger?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to my grandma's house for Christmas this year?",
      "description": "Every year for Christmas, we go up to my grandma's house about four hours away. However, in recent years it has just been very stressful and not fun for me. My grandma lives in a tiny mobile home, we have my grandma, uncle, parents and my sister all there at once. I have to share a bed with my parents and it's a full sized bed...yeah it doesn't work, I had to end up sleeping in the hall. My sister gets one guest bed and my uncle gets the other...\n\nPreparing to go for the trip is stressful, and my dad tries too hard to make everything perfect. When we are at my grandma's house, my uncle believes that my sister and I should be servants when there and if we don't jump up to do the dishes right away he complains about us. We are not opposed to helping, but if something isn't done right away, he gets on our case. \n\nThen my very old fashioned grandma, in recent years, hasn't been that warm to me. The ONLY thing she has been concerned about in the last few years is if/when my boyfriend and I are going to get married. If I tell her no, we aren't getting married/don't know if or when we will get married, she kind of huffs off and doesn't really talk to me for the rest of our stay. It is literally the only thing she cares about and if she doesn't hear what she wants, it's like I'm dead to her. It really hurts my feelings and on top of my dad stressing out over everything, my sister being grumpy about everything, my uncle getting mad at us for not helping out quickly enough...it just doesn't seem worth it. Plus, I have work the next day and we always drive up Christmas Day and come home the next day. \n\nI don't really have time off of work yet as this is a newer job for me. I explained to my dad that I likely wouldn't be going up with them this year because I have work the next day and he basically demanded that I ask my boss for the day off and that I \"needed\" to tell him that I have a 93 year old grandma and that this is probably her last Christmas.\" We have no reason to believe this, aside from general health issues with getting older, she's doing just fine. \n\nSo now I feel like my dad is guilting me into going. And I really don't think that's fair. My grandma put me in tears last Christmas when she was upset that my boyfriend and I weren't getting married, because it's \"sinful.\" With all of the other BS I have mentioned, I just really would like to sit this Christmas out. \n\nI am not, and have never been close to this grandma. I know that most people will say to just go, it's family, yes, it may be her last, just suck it up and go. But I am 30 years old and I should have a say in who or where I spend my time, especially if I just end up being miserable the entire time and I do have work the next day. \n\nHowever, the other issue I am running into is the fact that my boss gave me a day off to use for doing a project for him outside of work hours...but I was planning on using it next week because my boyfriend and I are going out of town for his work and I thought it would be nice to get out of town and get a break from my family (at 30 years old, I still live with my parents because California, yay). \n\nSo other than this one day that I have off, I don't have any other days off yet since I am not past my probation at my new job. So I know my dad would be upset if he knew that I was going to take a day off work next week, but not to go up to my grandma's for Christmas...\n\n I really don't like the idea of giving in to my dad guilt tripping me and demanding that I go. Because if he can guilt trip me this year, then he can do it next year and the next. I know it sounds morbid, but if this *isn't* her last Christmas (and like I said before, we have no reason to believe it will be, but I know, you never know) each year moving forward, he's going to say that until she actually does pass. Plus, by working remotely next week, I wouldn't be able to work the same hours I would in a day because of traveling, etc, so I'd have to put in hours to make the time up and that's really jumping through hoops to go see someone who is going to be upset that her granddaughter is a spinster. \n\nI really do not feel like I would regret not going, even if this did happen to be her last Christmas. I know it sounds terrible to say but I'm just being honest. \n\nFamily is important to me, but so is respect. I do not get it from my grandma, I do not get it from my uncle and my dad is trying to make me feel guilty, which also challenges respect on his end. \n\nSo, would it really be terrible to *not* go given the circumstances? \n\nAITA for not wanting to go?",

I told him that if he does that again, I’ll break his nerf gun.\n\nThe next day, the kid does it again so I yank it out of his hand, and smash it on the pavement as hard as I fucking can, and pieces go flying everywhere. The kid starts crying in front of his friends, and I just walk back home.\n\nAm I the asshole? You decide.",
