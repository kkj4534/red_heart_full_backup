      "title": "AITA for wanting nothing to do with my partner/baby mama when she is on Xanax?",
      "description": "Backstory is we are very much in love, very happy, have a wonderful life and a wonderful son. Last weekend I had a scary situation at work that has her all stressed out, and a friend gave her an undetermined amount of xanax to help smooth her over.\n\nBut ... She is not an easy person to be around on any benzo. It inhibits her emotional control and causes extreme insecurity. For fairness sake I would like to point out that this is my opinion, based on living with her for the last 5 years, and although it is an opinion based on observation and experience, i am by no means any sort of expert or psychologist.\n\nShe found the bottom of a cut off t-shirt in a drawer in our bedroom, and asked me what it was. Told her I had no idea, looked like a fragment of clothing, ive never seen it before. \n\nHer - then why was it hidden?\n\nMe - I thought you said it was in the drawer?\n\nHer - yeah, hidden in the drawer! (Getting louder now)\n\nMe - babe, what do you think it is, why are you so pissed? This is fucking stupid\n\nHer - I dont know what it is, but its not mine, and I want to know why you hid it!\n\nSo I walk out of the room, not interested in this argument. I take the our son out in the backyard to play. I know I am NTA at this stage of my admittedly long post.\n\nShe tries to talk to me a few hours later, tells me i was overly angry, that she wasnt accusing me of anything, she is blameless and doesnt understand why I am so angry (I was frustrated, but never raised my voice, I left the room and busied myself elsewhere to de-escalate). I tell her that when she takes xanax her reality and short term memory are so warped that I dont want to speak about it until she is sober. I tell her I withdraw, I love her but have no desire to fall into the trap of trying to talk to someone who disagrees with me on the fundamental nature of what literally happened a few hours ago. \n\nShe for sure thinks I am the asshole. I received about a dozen texts after I fell asleep last night that included the gems \n\n\"you hang out with (my friends) and they do them. I already felt crazy (because of scary work event weekend prior) and so its not even the Xanax its just me.\" \n\n \"You look more suspect about this recent shit that I.... I'd drink a bunch too if someone wanted to kill me... just how come you judge me, and hurt me. And separate from me, like my opinion doesn't matter. If you died, I'd die..... that made me crazy.\"\n\n\"Im just too tired ok. Go to sleep. I wish it were with me, but you hate me and Can't stand to look at me so.... just do whatever makes you happy. Crushes me but I'm tough\"\n\nSo I leave it up to you Reddit, do you agree with my lady love, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA if we expect the neighbor to pay for half the fence?",
      "description": "I guess it should be \"Are We The Assholes\" cuz it involves the whole family but whatever\n\nOk, so for a little backstory I've lived in the house I'm in for basically my whole life. It's a little house in a small town with a nice backyard. Growing up, I was friends with my neighbor's kids (We'll call him Bert.) We grew apart, but the families have always been amicable. My dad and Bert even used to do the bit from \"Tool Time\" where they talked over the fence, haha. So, suffice to say we had a good relationship with them. \n\nA few years ago a minor tornado hit my town. No big deal, but our fence on both sides was knocked down in places, we covered the holes with cyclone fence. The fence was really old and decrepit anyway- about 20 years old in a state with lots of rain, so the wood was all chipped and mossy. Now, my dad does fences for a living, so he already hated that fence, and had been planning for a while to replace it. We just hadn't had the money to do so. We talked to our other neighbor (Igor), and he agreed to cop in for the cost of materials (my dad could easily put it up himself, so labor wasn't an issue.) Now, despite my dad being a professional, not only did Igor help pay he offered to help. \n\nHowever, when we asked Bert to chip in, he refused. The fence was technically on **our** property, so he didn't think he was responsible for it. I've been in his house, I know his kids, so I know they have the money to at least contribute a little, but he wouldn't budge. I also know that they're definitely better off then we are, and they know that we're definitely borderline poor. \n\nWe shouldered the cost ourselves, but our relationship with Bert and his family has since soured. We feel he was being selfish. \n\nTl;dr:\nOur more well-off neighbor refused to help my broke family pay for half of our shared fence, because technically it was built on our property. We stopped being friendly with him because of this. AITA? ",

Then he asked me to move in with him and briefly said the last gf wasn’t really a gf just a girl he hung out with a couple of times. \n\nFast forward, I move in and the ex-gf starts dating the roommate. I didn’t think it was too awkward because I was under the assumption my bf and her went on maybe one date or so and mutually agreed it wasn’t for them.  Guess it turns out she might’ve been a little more attached? \n\nShe won’t say hello to me in the house even though we’re there together all the time, she visits my bf’s workplace with the roommate once a week, and now she’s accusing me of taking her food out of the fridge (which I’m not). \n\nI’ve been super chill, and nice, and have invited both her and her current bf to the climbing gym with me with no response.  At this point though I’m asking my bf to ask if she can just say hello to me when I smile or acknowledge her presence in the house. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "My girlfriend (long distance) and I have been dating for 6 months now and talking over over a year. She doesn't live in the states and doesn't have daylight savings so she doesn't fully understand it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wakeup at 8AM and we call and chat for about 2 hours almost everyday. Well yesterday I had my alarm set for 8AM as usual and wakeup to call my girlfriend who is angry at me because I \"woke up late\". Now mind you my phones clock adjusts automatically and I had no idea that today was daylight savings day. Nothing alerted me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I realized I told her that it must have been daylight savings and I had no idea, my clock adjusts on its own and that it was an accident. She is claiming things like \"how could you not know? did you not feel like you slept too long?\". Well the answer is no, I don't know if that's a normal thing or not? Are people able to tell if they over slept an hour? I sure can't...infact I have sleep apnea and feel like nomatter how long I sleep, I never get enough..which she knows this but thinks I use it as an excuse and over-exaggerate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not trying to paint a bad picture of my girlfriend...there are times I've woken up late or fallen asleep after waking up on accident..I totally get it annoys her even if its not done on purpose..so for this to happen again I get that she's angry about it..but I had no idea it was daylight savings!! I tried explaining but she just says I'm \"trying to reason out\"!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her I couldn't argue about this tonight (since she wouldnt call me today and we didn't talk since) and that I wouldn't want to entertain the argument when I already stated it was an accident and I didn't do it on purpose. I just told her goodnight because she thinks I'm being an ass for calling her out and thinking shes being ridiculous..so I just muted my phone now and will be listening to what you guys think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr: Long distance girlfriend mad at me because I wokeup late due to daylight savings...I had no idea and am now angry at her for being angry at me..Read the post it explains a lot more",

I really want to tell her to strongly reconsider as...well she doesn't really have a chance. Her GPA is close to a 2- 2.5 (based on a resume I saw a few months ago) and she has literally no volunteer/clinical work but she says she'll change it in the summer...\n\nI really want her to wake up and smell the roses and think about something else because she really doesn't have any chance of getting in.

      "description": "oof, okay. Before you judge I beg you to read the whole post and not just the title. Thank you before hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was talking to my girlfriend lately and I told her about this girl I worked with in my hospitality year and that I found her on IG. We chatted back and forth on what we are doing job wise now and how it is for us. My gf seemed to be in worry when I told her that and she responded with \"okay, Good.\", after I told her I wasn't flirting with her. (which she asked me if I was for some reason Idk).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I asked her if she would mind if I flirtet with someone for fun? She answered with yes and that she doesn't want me to do it. I told her that I sometimes flirt with my female friends for fun and without any intentions. They know that I am in a relationship and I've done it before aswell without any intent since they are my friends and I don't want more from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n She got pissed about it and I apologized that I was ignoring her feelings towards this topic and that I was being rude and blatant. She still was mad at me and said, that she was crystal clear about it and doesn't want me to do it. I got mad and told her: ,,I don't want you to get drunk in clubs aswell but it won't stop you from doing that does it?\". She answered with a blatant \"I didn't ask your opinion on that one\". I was perplexed at the fact that she would say it so ruthless towards me. I told her it was rethorical to show her that even if she doesn't want me to do, it won't stop me from doing it, because I have been doing it before the relationship aswell and my friends appreciate that I make them laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Now I am not sure if I am in the wrong or if she is being manipulative. (I've been in a manipulative relationship before so I am very sensitive about it, because I don't want re-live that hell again).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My GF and I were fighting over me flirting with my female friends when we are just having fun and they know me for being like that.",

      "description": "One of my best friends from child hood, we'll call hime Jake is having a baby with his fiance.  My friend is biracial (half black half white) but he was entirely raised by his white mom and white step dad. His girlfriend is black, but again she's not Nigerian or from Africa. I am white  I mean no offence to my friend but he grew up around mostly white people and it was only in college when he went through this phase where he started to really try and be more \"black\" and hang around black people more and behave more about what people \"perceive\" black people should act like and I kinda think some part of it was an act but whatever. Another note is that his fiance isn't really a huge fan of me and apparently when she first met me she got the impression I was racist. I don't really know why but that kinda soured our relationship but were friendly and cordial to each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I was hanging out with Jake few days, he was trying to order monogrammed pillows or something cheesy like that and then revealed that they were naming their daughter Morayo which is a Nigerian name apparently. He kept gushing over the name and I personally just thought it was weird to name your kid from a country you know literally nothing about. So I asked \"are you sure you want to give your kid a Nigerian name. I mean you guys aren't Nigerian.\" He seemed offended and said. \"Yeah but we're black and we have roots from Nigeria anyway.\" \n\nSo I probably should have let it go but then I said in a mostly joking manner. \"So if I took a DNA test and found out I'm like 1% African should I give my kid a Nigerian name?\" \n\nJake got mad and cursed at me a few times and said that tons of \"black\" names are african or arabic  and that I should \"mind my own white business\" and I had no idea what I was talking about. \n\nHe did change the subject after that but I can tell it bothered him. Shortly after his fiance publicly revealed the name on social media and people started gushing about it and his girlfriend made a comment on Facebook about how she was glad they liked it and \"some of Jake's friend's thought it was too African lol\" Like she knows I follow her and obviously posted that for me to see it. \n\nAITA here? I'm conflicted. Like I didn't think it was a big enough deal for Jake to go rat on me to his GF. But maybe I was out of line to criticize the name choice. ",

      "title": "AITA for not helping the women with dishes?",
      "description": "My in-laws have large family holidays (40+ people). The first time I met his family, I noticed there were no women! At mealtime, the women suddenly appeared. After dinner, the guys migrated to watch the football game, and the women disappeared again. I thought they just didn't like football. It turns out that the women spend 2 hours before the meal cooking, folding napkins, setting tables, etc. Then after the meal, the women spend another hour or two doing dishes and cleaning. By the time they were done cleaning, everyone was preparing to leave.\n\nThe next holiday, aunt-in-law mentioned that the women would like to meet me, since we barely interacted. They'd love if I could come an hour early and help set up. I shook off the vague Stepford Wives vibes and I figured, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n\nSo my then-boyfriend and I showed up early. The women looked at me like I had grown a third eye. Aunt declared \"No men in the kitchen!\", he was banished to the TV room, and suddenly I was stranded with 20 people I didn't know. Most of these women are housewives, and it is a matter of pride that they do 100% of the housework and cooking. It quickly became clear that I am inept at floral arrangement and my knife work is not up to par (I know how to cook, but I really don't care if the carrots slices are uneven). One of the women told me not to worry because they will teach me to be \"bride ready\" so I can make my husband proud. Awkward.\n\nAfter the meal, the women started collecting dishes, and I mentioned to my then-boyfriend that we should both help out. But, he was again banished. So I retreated with him to the TV room and hung out with the guys. We played a board game while the women cleaned.\n\nThat was a few years ago, and since then, I stay with the guys during family holidays. I'm the only woman who does. Occasionally one of the women will hand me a stack of dirty plates, or ask for help with prep. I'll help out, but I usually pull my husband in to help, too. When he gets banished, I'll go too.\n\nWe go to family gatherings 3-4 times a year. 10 hours/year of housework will not kill me. Still, it feels really weird and archaic that the men lounge around while the women work. Also, the women kind of freak me out. They are 100% perfect housewives and can be pretty intense. Never a hair out of place. I'm a nerdy tomboy, and I'm way more comfortable with the guys.\n\nMy mom says I'm being rude. If I don't want to participate with the way they run their family functions, I should not attend. By hanging out with the guys, I'm basically rejecting all of the women and their way of life.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My family moved from New York to Florida when I started middle school. They enrolled me in a private middle school that costs $23,700 ish for a year. Surprisingly this is way more cheaper than the private schools in New York and the Northeast region of America.\n\nI had a hard time fitting in. I was younger than everyone cause I was 10 going on 11. I was the only asian person amongst a population of 90% white kids. I haven’t hit puberty and my social skills sucked. A lot of kids have extremely wealthy parents (like an occasional student would belong to a multi-billionaire family). For me, my parents were immigrants and i lived in a rented, small apartment for a while before my parents bought and moved into an even smaller apartment. \n\nIn sixth grade my grades were overall great. If i got anything lower than a B on a test, my parents would get extremely upset if they were having a bad day. I didn’t start getting Cs in quarter grades and Fs on midterms until my final year at that school (8th grade). I was getting bullied severely and was called racial slurs by my classmates. I got little to no support from my teachers. I would turn in my math assignments late and had a geometry teacher tell me I would never be successful in high school. I found no purpose in doing heavy coursework. Colleges aren’t going to see this. I felt like i had no skill in the arts and athletics while everyone else did. I started getting into conflicts with people and I was clearly not in the right mental place. Looking back, I was basically a 13 year old version of Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.\n\nI went to a local public school for high school. I don’t talk to my old private school “friends” anymore except one or two who truly understood what I was going through. I mainly got straight As but I continue to barely put effort into studying. These days my mom says she’s proud of me but I get a different vibe from my dad. Whenever I would complain about my current public school, he would say he gave me an opportunity to succeed in private school, but I didn’t take it. I know he truly believed in me when we first moved to Florida, but since my experience wasn’t a good one, he puts a lot of the fault on me.\n\nTo this day I feel like I have disappointed my parents and I can’t express my feelings to anyone because most people tell me I was privileged and they would disregard what i had to say. So am I the asshole for wasting my parents’ money (3 years accumulated to over $70,000)?",

      "description": "I have known my boyfriend for ~15 years (we have been dating for two) and been aware that he has thoughts of wanting to be a girl, which moved to being transgender during the early part of our relationship. \n\nWe went to buy clothes, to a makeup store so he could learn and be recommended products, we even went to a wig shop together - but, I digress. \n\nAt the end of a few weeks he came to the conclusion that he was more comfortable presenting as male since it was *easier* and I accepted that. He threw away the makeup but I kept the clothes because I figured it was something that would come up again he has been struggling with this for a while.\n\nJump to today and he wants to start experimentation again. Okay, cool.. I'm totally fine with it. He tells me he took all of his old \"girl\" clothes back.\n\nThis time, a few days prior, he told me he was fed up with social media and all the bullshit - so he was deleting the apps from his phone. \n\nBut last night, he mentioned he knew he said he was done, but he created social media accounts and was liking the support. He said he was using transgender related subs to get feedback but that he had to *watch out for being hit on* and that *maybe he was going to see what it's like being a girl on the internet* meaning being harassed and constant unwanted messages, this made me uncomfortable. The conversation went something like: \n\nMe: Why post pictures unless you are seeking attention or WANTING to be hit on? \n\nHim: It's not like that.\n\nMe: I would never post photos of myself unless I was looking for people to tell me I was cute and send  PM's. \n\nHim: Have you ever tried to be something you weren't for your entire life? \n\nMe: No.. but.. I guess I don't understand but it feels weird. Give me a while to figure out why I feel this way.\n\nHim: *5 mins later* I deleted all of the posts and accounts. I don't think I should have to, but I don't want you to feel uncomfortable. \n\nThen he proceedes to sulk and pout the whole night.\n\nI never asked him to delete the accounts nor would have. I just asked that he give me time to process the information so I could figure out exactly why I was bothered. \n\nIt's frustrating and I don't feel included. When I ask why he feels like he needs validation/approval from the outside world he turns it around stating that I don't, and could never understand. \n\nBut it's confusing for me to also question my sexuality and be with someone who is male presenting half of the day, and wearing a skirt the other. It's hard and it seems like the only thing that matters is him being comfortable and reassuring that he looks good. I should also mention that he is closeted none of our friends or family know.\n\nAm I the asshole for being uncomfortable? Or should I be excited that he has a \"support system\" in subs that are focused on posting photos of yourself for compliments and PM's?",

      "description": "Okay, so. For starters, I don't believe I am an offensive person by any means. I'm very soft spoken and in fact, most people ask me to repeat myself in conversation. \nI don't curse in public and I'm typically very polite to people in general. Mentioning this because I feel as if it plays a role on whether or not I am an asshole. \n\nI [28F] just spent the week with my sister [22F] since we couldn't see each other over the Christmas break. We are super close and we joke around a lot. She is one of the few people I tend to lower my guard around and let lose with. \n\nSo, at some point when we were talking at length (about some drama with her friends) I referred to a situation as being, \"retarded.\" \nI stopped and said, \"ugh, I really gotta stop saying that. Sorry, it's something I've been working on.\" \n\nThen, she very quickly told me that she's been meaning to talk to me about it because she heard me say it ONE other time this week. What kind of bugged me was her concern, as if a said something that personally offended her. So, I asked what her deal was.\n\nWell, she told me she was working with mentally handicapped kids  this past summer. That during their training, they were repeatedly asked not to use words like that, for obvious reasons. She told me she is now hyper sensitive to this because she doesn't want anyone in that situation to feel offended. \n\nThen, she said she was worried about me losing my job (or something along those lines) because I use that word. I told her that I don't use it often and that if anything, I only refer to a situation as \"retarded.\" That I would never just drop that word aloud, in public or anything. \n\nBut I also don't think it's anyone's job to be offended for another group of people. I think she kind of blew it out of proportion after I acknowledged that I was working on it. \n\nShe put me down and compared me to our grandmother who says things like, \"oh you know how the blacks are.\"  (She's 80 years old; the rest of our family is not racist or anything) \n\nSo, do you think I'm the asshole for not apologizing to her for this? \n\n",

      "description": "My Girlfriend (22) and I (24) have known eachother for 3 years, we've dated on and off during that time, but only now has it been pretty serious. When we started going out I knew her family was somewhat dificult. Specifically her mother. (Her Father is deceased)  \n\n\nMy GF likes to boast about her independence, but at the same time, she is heavily influenced by her mother on things such as how she spends her money and what plans she makes. I have a faint suspicion that her mom is rather manipulative towards her.  \n\n\nIt has been a common ocurrance that we make plans several days in advance and she'll cancel a few hours before just because her mom got an idea to do something. I understand that sometimes plans have to be modified, but this happens at least once a week and honestly, Im sick of it.   \n\n\nI've talked to her about it in gentle terms using careful language. She understands this bothers me (A lot). I do not like being a \"slave\" to the wimbs of her capricious mother. I'm starting to resent the \"participation\" her mother has on our relationship. She is very attached to her family, and I feel bad for basically making her choose between her family and myself at times. I support her in her love for her family, but I don't want it to be a crutch in our relationship.  \n\n\nAm I The Asshole for being bothered by this?",

      "description": "I’m a 25 year old guy. I had moved away for college and medical school a while ago but I’ve been back in town for a bit. On more than one occasion I’ve been asked about my plans for children and I don’t want kids. The reasons are multiple - not interested in parenthood, really interested in my career as a doctor, don’t want to subject a child to a world that’s running out of resources and being overpopulated, to name a few. I’m not so concerned about my feelings for not wanting children - they’re my feelings and they’ve lead me to the decision that I don’t want kids. However, I’ve been accused of being selfish for not wanting kids. Knowing the connotation of the word selfish, I have a sort of guilt and feel like my family thinks I’m a little assholeish for not only sticking to my guns but having my ideas not be in line with theirs. Is not wanting children really selfish? If so, how? Am I an asshole for denying my family what they so desperately want? I don’t understand...the kid my mom is imagining I would make isn’t even real...it’s like, totally fabricated. It’s so far removed from reality. It’s not a kid I’ve ever thought about. How does not wanting kids make me selfish and an asshole? At what point do choices that are good for you but frustrate others truly become selfish? I see this as almost a like moot decision. I’m not doing...anything. In a way I think a lot of my friends and colleagues have had some selfish motivation in wanting children (“it will make me happy, it’s what you’re supposs to do, it’s the next step”) but I fail to see how not wanting children is selfish.",

      "description": "Today is my birthday and over the last week or so my husband has been asking me what I'd like to do. My only real reply has been to go get my hair done. Day before last I told him I hadn't made an appointment so it probably wouldn't happen.  \nLast night a co-worker reinvited me and the hubs on a brewery crawl but I joked (in front of my husband) that I wanted to spend it on the couch to which the look on my husband's face was one of, \"Really? That's lame and you can do that any time\". I told him it was absolutely cool with me if he wanted to go on the brewery crawl, just bring me home food afterward. He said no. Anywho, I felt guilty that my husband felt he couldn't do anything for me for my birthday so I made an online booking at an Ulta salon for the afternoon.  \nFastforward to the appointment, he drops me off and I'm all good. Come time for him to pick me up he's there with a couple things for him that he needs, and he takes the printout the hairdresser gives you to take to the checkout. At the checkout he then turns to me and tells me to pull my card out.  \n\"Umm, what?\"  \nNeedless to say, I end up paying for my haircut AND his things. Outside the store he asks if I feel beautiful now, salty, I said, \"Yes I do. Thank you for the present, me.\"  \nHe got mad at me for being mad and making him feel bad. He attempted to justify it by claiming I knew he didn't have money for this kind of thing. Not having money is one thing, but never during all the times he asked me what I wanted to do on my birthday did he say he couldn't afford to pay for a gift he was insisting I choose.\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So me and my GF have been dating since October, and we live 2 cities apart (2-2:30 hrs) and I come to visit her every weekend (since I work during the week Monday - Friday), if not, every other weekend by car. Last time I was over at her place (so this last Sunday) I brought up the fact that I wanted her to come over to my place, because I needed a break from driving so much, and she got very sad and defensive by me asking her to do something like this. I asked her why it was a big issue for her, and I told her that I would pay for the bus/train fare, no problem, but she says that she can’t visit me because she’s scared of travelling on the bus/train for long periods of time. I didn’t want to make it obvious, but this has clearly upset me and I have been distancing myself more and more from her. To me, this is a huge red flag. A little background to this, I lost my car in an accident in November (due to snow, nasty situation) and for all of November and December, I used any methods, any means necessary to come out to see her. Bus, parents, co-worker carpooling, train, and the list goes on, so she has all the means to come and visit me at least once on any weekend she wants to, but she won't... I even had to walk to her place at one point which took a whole 30-40 mins (because I was carrying groceries for her out in the snow), and now that I’m asking her to come and visit me, she won’t. Also, since the snow is becoming a lot heavier these days, driving is an absolute nightmare, but I don't care because it's scarier to not be able to see her. I feel like in a relationship, both parties should pull their weight and if she really loves me like she says she does, it shouldn’t be a problem for her to come and visit me. WIBTA for wanting to breakup with her because of this?\n\n\nTl;dr: I drive to see my GF every weekend, if not, every other weekend, and when I asked her to come visit me, she says she won’t/can’t. Makes me feel like I’m pulling a lot more weight here than I should be, and I feel that what she is doing to me is very unfair.\n",

      "description": "All parties involved are in our 20s. Fiance and I are 5 years younger than SIL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago my fiance and I were at his family's property. My fiance and his brother were going to go out riding. I asked fiance's sister if I could ride her sled. She said yes.\n\nIt is known in the family that I do NOT have a lot of experience riding--haven't rode much since I was a kid.\n\nI was following BIL. A few minutes into the ride (on the trail) going 15-20mph, I was unable to make a turn. I crashed into a tree and wrecked the sled. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSled is totaled, but it had full coverage on it. \n\nIn the accident I broke my arm and had some other injuries. So far medical bills have been about $5k out of pocket (high deductible health insurance unfortunately). SIL's insurance does not have injury coverage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSIL paid $5500 for the sled. Insurance totaled it and is paying out at $8500. Deductible is $500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFiance and I decided that $500 to cover the deductible was a fair amount, especially since SIL is making money on the sled. We paid SIL in cash this week and she/his parents are pissed that it is all we are going to pay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

Essentially, I can give 15% discounts to friends/family unlimited but I can get 25% discount for myself for each type of product every year (so if I bought a phone at 25% off this year, I no longer have 25% discount for phones but I still have a 15% discount for phones and 25% discount for our other products).\n\nAnyway, I’m quitting soon so I publicized to my Facebook that if anyone needs a 15% discount, I can hook it up. My friend hits me up and asks to purchase a computer worth over $2,000. However, I hadn’t bought a computer this year so I still had my 25%. I bought the computer for him with my 25% discount but charged him for the price of the computer originally quoted (15% off), and I pocketed the other 10% (about $200 or so). I didn’t tell him about this but I feel like it’s a win-win situation. AITA?",

      "description": "My ex and I were on and off for 5 years from high school into college, and frankly, our relationship was toxic. We kept finding our way back to each other, but after a few months, we would start having the same fights where she accused me of not putting in effort even though I was spending time seeing her/talking to her every day. Then she'd dump me, usually over text, and I'd keep my distance, but I often missed her. The highs were high and the lows were low, and I'd end up reaching out (usually, she reached out and reinitiated once.)\n\nHere's the crux of the issue: in 5 years, we never once had sex. She always had an excuse for why she didn't want to have sex with me. She wasn't a virgin or anything, she just refused. I can count on one hand the number of times she got me off in 5 years. I was constantly frustrated and incredibly horny and she'd often lead me on with false hope and then shut me down again. She would rarely say \"no\" outright, but she'd move away from me or say she had a headache or something. There was always something. For FIVE YEARS.\n\nThings came to a head 2 years ago, when I got so frustrated with the lack of sex and overwhelmed by how horny and neglected I was feeling that I kept pushing her because she didn't say no. Nothing actually happened and she ended up taking a call from her dad in the middle and leaving. The next day I was blocked everywhere. Phone, email, social media, everything.\n\nI got a lot of therapy to help me recover and move on from our relationship. I've been tempted to reach out or ask friends about her, but I've resisted because I know we aren't healthy for each other. However, therapy helped me realize that I needed to move on, and in order to do that, I had to own my part in the problems we had and our final breakup and apologize. I was still blocked in most places, but I just googled her and her linkedin came right up. I didn't ask her for anything in my apology and told her I wasn't expecting a response, but I just needed to apologize to clear my conscience and move forward.\n\nShe never responded to my message, but some of our mutual friends, including ones I haven't talked to in a long time, started coming out of the woodwork and calling me an asshole for reopening the old wounds of our relationship. I was just trying to get closure, but no one will see my side. AITA?",

      "description": "Background is that we have been friends for almost 20 years, literally since we were in diapers. We’ve been through several formative events together and were inseparable through middle school. \nWe fell out of touch for awhile and reconnected a few years ago. However recently it’s really dawned on me that she’s super self centered, as in if I vent about anything she’ll completely ignore it and bring the conversation back to her and her problems. And it’s not like she’s going through a crisis, it’s literally almost always boy problems or her telling me about her most recent hookup. \nI’ve also been in the process of bettering myself (working out, spending less time on social media, eating healthier, etc) and I feel like I’m super productive. I’m not a prude by any means but she smokes a shit ton of weed and that’s something I’ve simply grown out of. It wouldn’t bother me but it does make me feel like we’re on totally different wavelength. \nAnd the cherry on the cake is her racism. It’s not super “obvious” but she makes little comments about how she could never date a POC or places are “ghetto” when they’re really just not predominately white. Or she’ll cross the street if she sees a black person walking towards her. Which is all bad enough but it’s worse because I’m dating a POC. \n\nTLDR I have an old friend whom I’m realizing is taking a completely different path in life than me. So am I the asshole for basically ghosting her?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend are together for a few months. Everything is going well except for one thing - when she drinks, she turns into a completely different person: makes offensive jokes about people's weaknesses (sometimes to their face) and doesn't consider how they might take it, casually shares very private information about herself as well as other people (including me), talks very loudly, and generally acts like a stereotypical drunk-teenage girl even though she's in her late 20s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confronted her about this a few weeks ago, after she introduced me to her best friend that she hasn't seen in a couple of months by taking us both to a restaurant. At first, everything was fine, but after a while, the two of them got drunk, lost track of time and started gossiping about people they both know from high school and I don't know. I got a little board and didn't really mind, but after about three hours of this I told her that I wanted to go home, but didn't mind if she wanted to stay out with her friend. She ended up coming home about three hours later, and went to sleep after I rejected her attempts at coming on to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning I confronted her about this, and she took it really badly. When I said that I didn't agree to sex the previous night because she acted very sloppy and I wasn't into it, she took it as if I said she's disgusting, which I made clear I don't think that. She said that because the things I criticized her for are not things that put her or anyone else in danger, than I don't get to police how she acts when she's drunk, and now I'm wondering if I'm the Asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: she really is not an alcoholic. She doesn't drink very often, and she really is a responsible drinker. My issue is that the way she acts embarrasses herself and me. Another note is that this behavior is nothing like the way she acts when she's not drunk, and that I truly, deeply, love her for how she is when she's sober. She has this idea in mind, that the way you act when you're drunk is \"the real you\", because this is when all the masks come off (which I highly disagree with. How is your behavior when you're on a **mind-altering substance** \"the real you\"???), and that me criticizing the way she acts when she drinks means that I don't like her as a whole, which is not true.",

      "description": "  I’m basically at a crossroads and I’m considering the possibility of cutting off my mother’s financial support as soon as next payday hits. To give a bit of background, she doesn’t make much and neither do I, but I get enough to get by and still have some money left that I use for groceries, medicine, other things we need, plus every now and then, to buy myself something nice or go out for a drink or get a pizza.\n\nIt was 100% ok up until December when my sister ended things with her now ex husband and moved in with us. My mom already knew, but it was just then that I found out about my sister’s drug habit. She had no savings, no sort of money, no assets, nothing. Since then she has started a “rehabilitation” process, and is 100% reliant on my mother, which doesn’t make much. In addition, she has and outstanding court date due in may, for trafficking charges.\n\nThis basically means that within days from getting paid, my mother runs out of money, and ends up relying on me to buy groceries, medicine, whatever. Usually I wouldn’t mind, but I’m basically subsidizing my sister’s habit of staying home all day netflixing, sleeping. We only ask that she help up with cleaning and tidying up the house but she regularly doesn’t bother to do even that. She also has no respect for me at all, despite knowing that I’m keeping food on the table for all of us throughout most of the month. I’m also having to hold back on my own plans to keep us fed.\n\nI know, I have a complicated relationship with my sister, but my mother’s insistence on her, despite her 2 recent episodes (caused my mother to be worried sick and miss work), and jumping in to defend her at all costs when I say something, has begun to wear out my patience, no to mention that I’m having to tap into the meager savings I have in order to keep from hitting a negative bank balance. \n\nIn the most recent episode, she traded a cell phone we got her for next to nothing for drugs, and was gone for a whole day and night, leading to my mother becoming stressed and missing 4 days of work due to her depression flaring up, causing her to binge on vodka. This basically means I’ll end up having to cover these 4 days of expenses.\n\nI’ve spoken to my mother about trying to pressure my sister into taking her treatment more seriously, trying to look for a job, and being more appreciative of what we’re doing for her, but this has fallen on deaf ears, and now I’m already beginning to feel the financial burden of carrying both of them. \n\nRecently, for whatever reason, my sister has “worked things out” with her ex husband, and they’re back together, although, he lives in his mom’s house for the time being. According to my mother, he will start helping out with my sister’s expenses, but I find it highly doubtful it will happen.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I cut off financial aid to my mother? Bear in mind, there is a good chance my mother would go hungry.",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend for sleeping?",
      "description": "The title sums it up. My boyfriend has a problem with staying awake when we have plans to call. We've been long distance for 6 months, and had this problem the entire time. He says he can't help himself if he's in bed and tired and I've said that it's fine as long as he says goodnight first, so I'm not anxious about him being mad at me. We always end up in a cycle where he falls asleep, I get really anxious and stay up late crying thinking he's mad at me, he wakes up and promises next time he won't go in his bed if we have plans or if he's really tired he'll say goodnight. This lasts for about a week and then the whole thing repeats. \n\nToday we were on call watching Netflix and I remembered I had to get something from the library (for an assignment due at midnight). I got stuck in the elevator and around the time I got out, he stopped responding. I didn't notice immediately but once I did, I started getting worried he was mad at me for taking so long. I texted him a lot of apologies and eventually called him. This is where I'm mad: He let me apologize and apologize for taking so long and kept saying \"it's ok\". It was only after I asked explicitly whether it was me taking so long that made him ignore me that he said no, he was asleep. This made me kind of annoyed—he let me keep apologizing instead of cutting me off to say he wasn't mad and had just been asleep. I clarified whether he was so tired that he'd fallen asleep at his desk or whether he had gone to his bed knowing that we had plans to call back and finish the episode and he confirmed it was the second. I needed to cool off so I said let me call you back in 5 and hung up. He called back but I declined it, then he texted me saying he was sorry. 7 minutes later I called him back and no response. It's been half an hour and no response to any calls or texts so he's clearly asleep. I broke up with him over text, saying that my anxiety over this repeatedly happening (to the point where I'm sometimes afraid to hang up even if I have to go to the bathroom because I feel like I'll come back and he won't answer and I won't know what happened) is too much for me to handle right now. I'm at a really low point with my mental illness and there's a lot going on at school. \n\nClearly I don't think I'm the asshole right now, but there was another time I broke up with him over this (also over text and while he was asleep). When he woke up he called me and started screaming at me and punching his phone (we were on FaceTime so it was kind of scary, which sounds dumb I know) and saying I was abandoning him and being selfish, I didn't love him and I wasn't understanding enough. I felt terrible and we ended up getting back together. I know this reaction will happen again when he wakes up. I just wanted to get an outside opinion on whether this is a stupid thing to break up over before that conversation happens, since even though I don't feel bad now I know I will then.",

      "title": "AITA For Wanting My Boyfriend to Marry Me?",
      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 years this January. We have never broken up or anything like that, and have lived together for 7 years. We even moved across the country together three years ago and have two cats together. I am establishing all of this to illustrate that our relationship is very stable and solid and that we have built a life together.\nNow for the issue – I currently have a full time job (with benefits), but I am planning on applying and attending graduate school soon (within the next year). My boyfriend and I have discussed marriage multiple times over the past few years, and he is always reluctant citing that he does not support the institution of marriage and is not religious (neither of us are), so why would he want to get married? From my point of view it would be for a practical purpose, which is financial and medical benefits, not at all religious. I have also told him I do not have any desire for a wedding, I’d be happy just going to the courthouse on a weekend – the marriage day itself is really of no importance to me at all. \nI’m beginning to feel a bit resentful about this, because while I do understand that he is not religious or anything, to me it is about him actively making both of our lives more difficult by just refusing to get married for seemingly arbitrary, idealistic reasons.\nFor full disclosure as it does relate to the situation, I have struggled with depression and anxiety and he has been very supportive, even helping to convince me to get treatment shortly after we got together (within the first 1-2 years). Things have been much better for the past few years in terms of me taking responsibility and being proactive about my care, but there have been times in the past when I unintentionally put him in the position of both partner and therapist. Obviously this is not good or fair to him, and I have been seeing a professional for about a year and am stable on medication so this issue is essentially under control now. I do understand that this had an impact on our relationship, but we seemed to have moved past it at this point as things have been stable for a while now.\nThe other logical reason he has to not want to marry me is that I do have some credit card debt. However, I have made it extremely clear that I do NOT expect him to take on any responsibility for this debt even if we were to be married. I have been taking very active steps to control my debt over the past year and have managed to make significant improvements. I also owed him some money from when we moved across the country (he paid for the AirBnB we stayed in initially as well as the security deposit on the apartment, and we had some vet bills from one of our cats recently) and paid him back most of it a few months ago. This is to demonstrate that he is aware that I have been extremely proactive and responsible about my finances recently, compared to how I was when we met and for the first few years of our relationship.\nSo with all this in mind, AITA for feeling resentful that he does not want to get married?\n",

      "description": "Resubmitted, first one got removed because I used AMITA instead of AITA. \n\nUsing a throwaway because idk if anyone I know browses this subreddit. This is a pretty specific story, and I don't want anyone I know finding my reddit user. I'm starting to think that this is one of those cases where I wasn't the asshole initially, but the way I dealt with it made me one. This is gonna be kinda long, theres a few important points here, (theres a TLDR at the end). \n\nSo pretty much, I just finished the worst class I've ever taken. It was so horrible because of who taught it. I cant even say \"the professor who taught it\" because the prof who should have taught it didnt actually teach it. He had his SON teach it. His son (will be referred to as Dr. sometimes) has a PhD in the field, but hasnt had any actual teaching experience aside from a couple stand alone lectures nor does he work for the university I go to. For some reason the prof assigned to the course wanted his son to take care of teaching the course, instead of doing it himself. This is understandable, and tbh I don't see it as an entirely bad thing. Its a good opportunity for Dr. to learn how to teach/run a course which is good for him and his future students. Unfortunately, the execution of this was extremely poor.\n\nProf pretty much let his son have full control over running the class, and we ended up learning next to nothing. It was a course on Special Relativity (SR), which when first introduced is supposed to be a more conceptual thing with some math thrown in to it because its so damn weird (seriously if youre ever in the mood for your mind to be blown look it up its so cool). Every single professor and grad student I've spoken to (so A LOT) is in full agreement with this, including professors who taught the course in past years. But instead of that, he ended up teaching it like a theoretical math class (this is a second year introductory class btw). The course was 3 months, and we spent most of it being taught other things and only ended up doing SR in the last 2/2.5 weeks of the course, and there are a few aspects of it that we didnt even cover. The rest of the class was modified Newtonian dynamics (changing the classical equations to fit what we see in real life) which just included a bunch of math; other math stuff; and particle physics (which upper years in the 4th year particle physics class didnt even know how to do). To be fair, this is important stuff, but it's not the point of the course. We ended up learning next to nothing about SR, and what we did learn was crammed in to the last few weeks of the course so we didnt even have enough time to actually digest what we were learning. SR is REALLY weird and completely un-intuitive, so to really get it you have to spend time sitting with the subject matter and thinking through it and doing some conceptual problems (I was told all this by profs and grad students). We did none of this. Everything I know about the subject I learned using online resources I found myself, and theres still a lot left to learn about it. So we may have learned some other random stuff that is important to physics, but we didnt learn what the course was meant to teach us.\n\nNot only that, but the professor who was supposed to teach it was repeatedly told by other professors before the class started not to let his son teach it. The department head said that the son could teach the tutorial section of the class, and that the professor should teach the rest. He was also advised not to let the son teach by other professors in the department. Fast forward past the first few weeks of the course, and it got back to the department head and other professors that he was letting Dr. teach the class. He was told to cut it out. He didnt. The class representatives went to him on behalf of the students to ask him to cut it out because of how bad the course was going. He still didnt. Then we wrote the first test, and it went horribly. Do you think he cut it out? NOPE. He still let his son teach, but made the 2nd and 3rd tests pretty easy so the average would be higher. The class was still running horribly, and he was still being told to cut it out (some professors even went to the Dean to complain on behalf of the students) and he never took over the class. He said it was going fine becuase the averages were higher on the 2nd and eventually 3rd test, but that was only becuase he made them easy enough so if you went to class only some of the time you could do well. He even started treating students who complained about the course like crap after this. If anyone went to him for any advice about the class, he would baisaclly tell them to drop the class, and be rude to them. He just started to brush off everyone's concerns because \"well the 2nd test was good\". So I'm mad.\n\nAnyways, we wrote the exam the other day and we had some extra time left. So some of my classmates and I wrote letters to him on our exams. Mine was 2 pages (single spaced) and included the following general messege/some lines (not exactly, only what I remember):\n\n*- I was looking forward to this because I had heard great things about you, but it turned out to be worse than the horrible first year mandatory classes taught by professors who didnt know how to teach becuase we didnt learn anything*\n\n*- You had an obligation to us but you failed miserably.*\n\n*- You thought you knew better than everyone in the department. Open your eyes, you didnt. You should have listened.*\n\n*- You treated your students horribly. You owe the class representatives an apology, and I have no words for how you treated some of my classmates when they went to you for advice.*\n\n*- You made everyone in the class feel stupid, and pushed people to drop out of the program completely.*\n\n*- We learned next to nothing about SR, despite that being what the class was meant to teach and us pouring hours of time in to this class*\n\n*- Its appalling to me that you let it get this bad.*\n\n*- I'm extremely disappointed at how this whole class played out. We will be going to the Dean about this.*\n\n*- I hope you're happy at how this turned out, none of the students are.*\n\n*- I hope your son can learn something from this experience, at least one good thing would come out of it in that case.*\n\nThere may have been some other stuff, but I just don't remember. I think that was the worst of it.\n\nThe thing that just REALLY makes me mad is that he doesnt get how horrible that class was. I don't know what hes on, but he doesnt seem to get it. I spoke with another professor about this and he said that our concerns were heard by everyone in the department. Hes right that they were heard by everyone. All of the other professors have been more than willing to help us out with this, and have been apologizing to us about it even though it wasnt their fault. It was so bad that the department head ensured us that we would all finish with good grades, but tbh its not even the grade that I care about. Its the fact that we didnt learn what we were supposed to. Its like everyone but the prof  heard us, and understood how bad it was. If he did, he would have cut this shit out a long time ago.\n\nThe thing is, hes usually a pretty nice prof. I've heard nothing but good things about him, about how he is inside and outside of the classroom. I do have respect for him, I just think what he did was absolutely despicable... and it seems that he doesnt see anything wrong with it. And its that specific part that just really gets to me.\n\nI know that I tend to go off on things when I get mad. It's something I've been working on but I'm starting to feel like this was one of those times where I said things that I really shouldn't have said. My classmates and I will be going to the Dean to speak with them about this, and I'm starting to feel like it was best to just voice my concerns at that meeting (now that I've calmed down and talked to a prof about it). I also filled out a course evaluation where I called his class a \"cluster fuck\" among other things, its just that I don't like to hide behind the anonymity of the course evaluation (I did point out that I called it that in the letter). Everything I said on there I would say to his (and the Dean's) face, and fully intend to repeat what I wrote in my course evaluation/letter to their faces. Everything I said was true. But I do feel like I was being an ass writing that letter. Like it just wasnt appropriate not because it wasnt true, but because it wasnt the right time. I also didn't exactly make a huge effort to go about this in the nicest way (what I wanted to say included lots of colourful language and was much meaner, but I do actually respect the prof so...)\n\n**TD:DR a professor had is son (who has a PhD) teach a class, when the son has no experience and doesnt work for the university. This was against the advice of literally everyone in the department (including his boss). The class went terribly, we didnt learn what we were supposed to, but he made the tests easy enough that the average was decent. He started being an ass to students who went to him for advice. If you had anything bad to say about the course, he would treat you badly. Classmates and I wrote him letters on the exam about this (some of what I said I included above) and will be meeting with the Dean about how bad this was. Now I'm starting to feel like I didnt handle it well.**\n\nSo AMITA for calling out my should-have-been-professor on the exam? Or should I have just left it to the course evaluation/meeting with the Dean? Also, was the way I put bad or should I have made more of an effort to be nicer about it? Thanks for your input! \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questi",

      "description": "So, this happened around two years ago. Last time I mentioned it on reddit I was surprised at the negative response I got. I was thinking about it today and decided I'd ask here to maybe get a wider pool of responses.\n\nI used to work as the front desk manager for a medium sized economy hotel. Due to no fault of our own, hiring was damn near impossible. It wasn't a problem exclusive to us, I know this because if you drove down the main drag, literally everyone in our area was hiring. My girlfriend at the time worked as a manager in retail and they had trouble getting and retaining staff. My mom was a recruiter for a vehicle rental company and she had trouble getting a suitable pool of applicants.\n\nWhen we managed to set up interviews, we were lucky if anyone showed up for them. We had to make a list of people not to call because people would keep applying on Indeed over and over again then never actually show up for their interview (we suspected it had to do with the quota for how many jobs you had to apply for while on unemployment).\n\nWhen we managed to actually hire someone, it just wasn't working out. The job itself wasn't particularly demanding. At least not for the desk, housekeeping is another story. I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to clean dirty hotel rooms for $9/hr. I wouldn't do for my salary. Anyway, people would either never show up for their first shift, or last maybe a month. During that month they would be unreliable, calling in multiple times, always at the last second or being unreasonably late for shifts. \n\nThe AGM and I were working an obscene number of hours, usually with little to no notice.\n\nEnter Britney. She wasn't a stellar candidate, but she was the only candidate. She had customer service experience and some night shift experience, so we thought we'd give her a try. In the interview I stressed to her the importance we placed in reliability.\n\nThe day she came in to fill out her employment paperwork, she tried to get a free room saying she would pay for it when she got her first paycheck. We don't let employees stay at the hotel period, so that was a definite no. But the AGM was a big softy, so he gave her an employee discount voucher to use at another hotel under the same family. She set up a room at a hotel about a mile away.\n\nTwo days later she was due to come in and train. I'd given her a specific time to be there. That time came and went. No sign of her, no word from her. I called the number I had reached her at to set up the interview and it had been disconnected.\n\nSo I start all over and post a new ad online for the job.\n\nAround two hours later she finally calls, claiming that she had gotten herself stranded in the suburbs and had lost her wallet and phone. Supposedly she had borrowed some random person's phone to call me. To me, this all sounded like a lie. I informed her that missing her very first shift without any kind of notice showed poor character, and I didn't think I could rely on her to take care of the hotel. I told her we would not be moving forward with her training.\n\nI could tell she was disappointed, but she didn't argue.\n\nSo, was I the asshole? Both the AGM and GM agreed with my call, but when I shared it on an askreddit thread about firing people, I got called heartless. I understand that shit happens, but ffs, it's your first shift, one of the earliest chances to make a good impression on your new employer. Even if she had called minutes before she was supposed to arrive I would have rescheduled. I don't think I'm unreasonable.",

      "description": "I am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  Recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  I thought, fine, I trust him, and he has other female friends.  \n\nSoon I noticed the way he talked about her was different.  He seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  It bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and I am 36, but once again, I trusted him, so I left it alone.  \n\nOccasionally when he was texting her I would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  \n\nOne day I came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  This bothered me.  When he got off the phone I told him how much it bothered me.  I asked to see the messages between the two of them.   He said that they were private.  \n\nHe mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  I told him I felt this was too intimate of a conversation for \"friends\" to be having.  \n\nHe mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  Red flags went off in my mind.  I told him he needed to stop talking to her.  He refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  \n\nEventually I decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   I figured I would want to know if I were him.  He said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.   \n\nAfter all of that, they broke up.  She told my husband to stop talking to her, therefore ending their friendship, and my husband and I are in a weird space now.  Am I the asshole for ruining three relationships?",

So I never pass up the chance to make a little extra on the side so occasionally I sell food or gaming systems I don't use. However getting someone to fork over 60 bucks is hard even for me. So I turn to my friends. I tell them that the product is more than it actually is for example a snes I wanted to sell I would have sold for 60 bucks I tell my friend that it is 80 bucks. then I say i will give you the \"friend discount\" and sell it for 20 dollars cheaper. But in reality I charge them like I would anyone else and I just pressure them into buying it with the friend discount. This has worked on a few occasions. I know it's not right but my philosophy in life is \"take every opportunity even if it means risking a limb (friend in this case)\" So tell me am I an asshole or an opportunist?",

      "description": "Hey people of Reddit, I'm nearing the big day of my wedding and certain aspects seem to be going to hell. \n\nTo start off, my fiancée and I have been dating for 8 years and engaged the last 2. After all this time we finally decided last month \"Screw it, we're getting married in May\" and have been planning our wedding since then.\n\nThe wedding is going to be small and only consist of our closest friends an family, about 30-40 people total. Neither of us want a particularly large (or expensive) wedding. I have quite the large family so to keep the wedding small I only invited the family members that I actually talk to. That meant that out of my 5 siblings I only invited my older brother's family. My other siblings I never talk to and honestly can't trust most of them to behave at my wedding. My mother (Mom) was invited though and she was not happy about not inviting my other brothers and sister to the wedding. She constantly is pestering me to invite them, but I am standing firm on not doing so. \n\nLast week we finally sent out the invitations for the wedding and again Mom was not happy with me not including my siblings. More over she became furious when she also found out that I invited my grandmother and aunts from my father's side of the family (who we'll refer to collectively as FAM). My father passed away a couple years ago in case anyone was wondering why he is not involved in this. Mom and FAM hate eachother. Mom has hated them all her life and told me stories of how they are terrible people. I only ever heard my mother's side, and Mom is infamous for stretching the truth or exaggerating to be made the victim. Mom tried telling me not to invite FAM and invite my siblings instead, as she can't even stand being in the same room is them. Again I stood firm on this. I assured her that she and FAM will be sitting on opposite sides of the banquet hall and never need to interact. On top of that FAM promised to not even confront Mom at all during the weddinh.\n\nThen the other day Mom gave me an ultimatum: either I kick out FAM and invite my siblings or she will not go to the wedding. So I told her \"fine, you aren't going\". Now she has until early May to change her mind and to act like an adult for just one day for her son. She didn't respond for a few hours and later gave me some BS that I put her in the hospital due to stress. I doubt that actually happened.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my mother and my other siblings not to come to my wedding? I know they are family, but at the end of the day this is **MY** wedding, and not hers. FAM may not like my mother, but they know how important a wedding is and will set their differences aside for me and my fiancée. Is it wrong to expect the same from my own mother?\n\nTL;DR- My mom doesn't like who I invited to my wedding, so she tried force me to uninvite them for her benefit. I said no and told my mother not to come if she can't get over that.",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so sorry for any mistakes or stupid formatting.\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for about two years and just recently got engaged. I have a few years to actually plan out our wedding, but when it comes to our bridal parties I'm a but worried his family is going to throw a fit because I dont want his siblings, more specifically his sisters to be my bridesmaids. \n\nFirst and foremost, I dont care who is in my fiance's party. He has two sisters and a brother, so if he wants to put them in his party thats fine and dandy. But his family and I have had a rocky relationship. We started out okay, his older sister loved me and his parents thought I was great. Then they found out I was bisexual, and even though we are in a hetero relationship, I was all of a sudden the worst person ever. They called me a faggot on the regular, along with other insults like bitch, slut, ugly, etc. My fiance would defend me when they said such things, and it got to the point where they kicked him out and he had to come stay with me or he would have had to live on the streets. They tried to cancel his student loans and his lease for his apartment. Luckily none of that went through and his education wasnt effected. His family didnt speak to him for months. They invited him home for Christmas last year, and as soon as the holiday was over they sent him back to his apartment. They told him that everything wasnt okay and they wanted it to appear fine for the rest of the family. \n\nNow, as it stands, the past summer and the past few months with them have been a COMPLETE 180. We slowly have hung out with his family more and more, and I feel like they've gotten to know me instead of judging me based off of one or two facts. I love this, and I'm so glad that I have a better relationship with his family. They are happy for us and genuinely excited that we are spending more time with them. \n\nWith that being said, I still dont really want his sisters being bridesmaids. I'm not nearly as close with them as anyone in my potential bridal party. I'm hesitant to make plans with them considering how quickly they have changed their minds about our relationship in the past, but I can already see his family throwing a bitch fit over this. \n\nI feel the need to include that his older sister was engaged, and it was up for debate as to whether my fiance and I were even going to be invited to the wedding. This caused an argument about how \"sluts arent invited\" and my future mother in law had to step in and defend me. \n\nTLDR; My future sister in laws and I have a rocky past relationship and I dont want them to be bridesmaids, but I'm afraid this will cause issues ",

      "title": "AITA for using my biological father's Netflix account without him knowing while he ignores the fact that I exist?",
      "description": "Some background - 17 year old guy, biological parents divorced when I was at least 5 and I went to live with my mom. In court it was determined that my biological father (will refer to him as biodad, reasons later) would be the one to pay alimony if anyone was going to, but my mom, being the kind person she is, decided to let it slide. I would see him every once in a while but I lived with mom.\nFast forward to 6 or 7 years ago when I was 11 or so, my mom remarries to my stepdad (whom I refer to as dad, hence confusion with titles) and we move in with him and his two children. His wife/their mom passed away many years before. From here on out the visits with biodad become even fewer and further between, essentially being holidays and 3-day weekends.\nAnother fast forward to this past year or so. My dad and I have agreed (with mom's consent) that my relationship with biodad has zero benefit to our family, and that we should slowly start reducing the number of times I see him. He has tried to poison my beliefs with his, which are essentially that HE agreed not to pay HER alimony, and that HE was the one that made sure they separated peacefully. All not true, obviously. And also, he decided to smoke weed in front of me on several occasions and every time we would go visit it was at his convenience and so he would have to do as little work as possible, and when I was there he was working so I was chilling at his (my grandparents, his parents', I should add) house. If I'm gonna chill I can chill at my house. He lives 2 and a half hours away in Delaware.\nWe start cutting him out pretty well and make some good excuses, and he buys it for the most part. This goes on for a bit until the beginning of December. What he does before a holiday is essentially pester the fuck out of me with texts like \"Hey got any dates for our visit yet?\" Or \"Hey do you know when you can come down?\" And it got to the point where I was sick of it.\nMy parents and I carefully crafted a response that used legitimate excuses (stretching them a bit) to say \"I can't come to you, but maybe you can come here and we can go out to dinner\" and he doesn't buy it.\n15 or so minutes later I get a response - \"I don't think so. Maybe next year. Merry Christmas.\" Then - \"Don't bother responding that's bullshit and you know it\" and \"take care\" and my parents and I are just kinda meh about it. Another 15 min and I get two more: \"btw lose my number\" and \"asshole\".\nThen he texted my dad. He essentially said \"hey I don't think I can trust [mans_best_comrade] tonight can you keep an eye on him? We were arguing and I just laid him out\" which was so manipulative I had to laugh.\nThey called the next day and my dad essentially listened to him scream about what an ungrateful, condescending asshole I am. That's all that was.\nSo here we are, and he hasn't said a word to me since the \"asshole\" text. However, I've been using his Netflix account for years since he offered it to me, and I just thought about the fact that he probably doesn't know I'm using it without his permission. Is this a dick move or is it alright given the circumstances? (Keep in mind I'm fairly certain I'm NTA with the texting situation, I'm asking about the Netflix deal) \nReally sorry it's so long it's just a lot of background!!! Thank you!!\nTL;DR toxic Biological father called bullshit on excuse to not see him, is now pretending I don't exist to teach me a lesson, but I'm using his Netflix without him knowing.",

      "title": "AITA for encouraging my depressed son to go to college 1500 miles from home?",
      "description": " My son is 17 and a junior in high school. He has been receiving treatment for depression and anxiety at a psychiatric practice for about 2.5 yrs. He usually sees a Physician Assistant(PA) for meds every 2 months and a Therapist every 2 weeks. I see changes and think it's helping, but our son doesn't talk about it often and we don't ask.     \n  We live in the US in a small town with a university of about 25,000 students. The school is pretty well known for some of the science and engineering programs. We've lived here about 2.5 yrs and don't have any other family ties or long time friends here.   \n\n  \n  For the last year or so our son has been talking about a career in Computer Science/Software Development. He takes AP and honors classes. His grades are decent but not great due to the depression. He has a 31 ACT score and about a 3.0 GPA. His top choices for college are two universities several states away, about 1500 miles. One has around 7,000 students and is more selective. The other has 30,000. They are close to recreational activities he enjoys. We told him that was great, and we thought he'd get a good education and have fun at both places. We've scheduled school visits during spring break.   \n\n  \n  My husband and I met in graduate school and have advanced degrees in science and engineering. We'll pay for all his undergraduate education. We'll support any decision our son makes. Our advice on college is:   1) Go to a 4 year university with graduate programs because you'll have opportunity to work on some interesting research projects or in a lab.     2) Go to a school in an area that you want to live because you'll have more contacts and recruitment from that area. Have fun. Don't worry about graduating in 3 years.     3)Don't go if you're not ready because it will be a waste of money. You can live at home as long as you want, but we'll expect you to work and help out around the house.   \n\n  \n  After his appointment last week, our son told us the PA didn't approve of his college choices. He said, “ I think you'll want to go somewhere closer to home. What about x college?” X college is a small private college with no graduate programs and 1,700 students. It's about 60 miles from here.   \n\n  \n  My first reaction was WTF?! Why would the PA discourage our son from one of the few things that excite him? Why would he give our son the impression that he couldn't handle it? If he thought our son should stay close, why not suggest the university in town?   \n\n  \n   Now I'm doubting our advice. What if his depression gets worse, and we're not there to see it? What if he doesn't take his meds? So, AITA for encouraging my son to go to college away from home? Maybe our son needs a closer support base. If he doesn't like it or needs to come home, he's welcome back. But am I setting him up to fail? ",

I asked her the same thing on Friday and she changed the subject again but I decided to take the gamble and just drive back on Saturday. Anyways when I get back I text her and say when does she plan to come over and 2 hours later she says \"hey I hurt my back today I'm going to go home and take some medicine and stay home\" and that pissed me off.

      "description": "I struggle with a variety of emotional disorders that make life difficult, and there are certain things that can completely ruin my entire day; lack of sleep, and negative interaction at the beginning of the day are the ones that. I also have seasonal depression in the wintertime, which doesn't help. I've been under a lot of stress lately with not getting enough hours at work and looking for a second job to stay afloat, so I'm barely holding it together. I've been living a pretty normal life for a little over a year now, but it wasn't always that way. I was homeless for over a year several years ago, in which time I fell in with a bad crowd and was using drugs. Fortunately, I never became addicted, and I managed to get back on my feet, but misery loves company, so my former \"friends\" never stopped trying to drag me back down to where I started out with them, so I eventually moved out of state for a fresh start.\n\nThere was one friend I stayed in contact with from when I was homeless. He's not a bad person, but he is a drug addict and a compulsive liar. A lot of what he says is actually true, especially his more unbelievable stories (I've seen indisputable proof backing up most of those types of stories from him), but he always lies about little things, and it's easy to tell when he's lying. What he says won't make sense in whatever context it's in, then he'll eventually forget his own lie, slip up and tell the truth. I try to be a supportive friend because I'm the only sober person he talks to aside from his family, but whenever he comes to me with a problem and I try to give him advice, he minimizes whatever it is that he came to me about, ignores my advice, then repeats the whole cycle all over again when it bites him in the ass and he needs someone to talk to. Lately, almost everything he comes to me about revolves around this addict girl who has robbed him, cut him with a knife, tried to have people go after him, and so much more. I keep telling him that he needs to either cut her out of his life, or stop coming to me for advice every time he ignores my advice and ends up in a bad situation because of her, because I really don't have the emotional capacity to deal with it.\n\nAfter several days of not hearing from him, he called me yesterday a few minutes after I woke up. His speech was all messed up, and he told me he got set up. He said he met some random supposedly sober girl on Facebook, she invited him to hang out, and ended up taking him to a house full of addicts, where they drugged him, robbed him, and held him against his will for a few days before he was able to get a hold of someone else's phone and call his brother, who came and got police involved. I feel like I could have been more supportive, but I got upset with him and told him his story didn't make sense, that I just woke up and had a job interview later in the day and couldn't be starting my day on that note, and he either needed to go to rehab or stop talking to me altogether. He basically ignored me, started minimizing the issue while simultaneously complaining about how bad the situation was, so we went around in circles for awhile. I eventually calmed down enough to have a productive conversation, but that all went out the window when he slipped up and mentioned that this \"random girl he met on Facebook who he never met before\" was actually the same girl who I keep warning him about. I got upset, went off on him for burdening me with this and lying to me yet again after ignoring my advice, told him I was blocking him on everything, and didn't want to hear from him until he went to rehab. As I hung up the phone, he was pleading with me, saying I'm all he has besides his family. I followed through and blocked him on everything, but I'm worried that the way I spoke to him, as well as losing a positive influence, could lead him to more self-destructive behaviors. I feel horrible for the way I handled it, and I just really need some outside perspective to know if I was really in the wrong. Maybe we're both assholes, idk.",

      "description": "Me and my sister have a close relationship due to how we relate to each other and our experiences in life. My sister usually asks me  to do stuff like getting something from the store or helping her out, reason for this is because in a few years I'll be moving to a different country for a job and don't want things to end on bad terms y'know? Anyways recently she got her Phone stolen at her job and asked if she could use mine and I said yes knowing she is a girl and having to go outside late can be dangerous.  I just wanted make sure she was safe. and I also know she loves social media and that it would suck not to have anything to do all day but I told her there were times when i wanted it back but she seems to give absolutely 0 fucks, coming home 4 or 5 hours after the time I told her i wanted  the Phone back. Just this week I told her that i wanted it back cause i had to go to school and she fucking left! 2 fucking times in a row she said she would give it but left! She fucking left! So I called her out on it and she pretended being stupid and innocent so I asked my Phone back she later came back to ask for it and the convo went like this.\n\nMe: Nah, I deleted all your apps you can fuck off\"\n\nher: Wat??\" \n\nMe: I said you can fuck off, you dont seem to care about the rules I set up so i dont care about your needs either\"\n\nHer: Well wat do you mean? I told you already I needed it for my job\"\n\nme: No you need it consistently 24/7 you have a 8 hour job but u have the Phone all fucking day even when i tell you to give it back you dont seem to care, im tired of ur shitty attitude. \n\nHer: I already fucking told you im trying to get a new Phone but i lost my ID\" \n\nMe: Whos fault is that? Your Phone being stolen doesnt mean that mine should be too, you always talk shit about X being a bitch to you but look at how you behave, im always so nice to you and all u do is shit on my face. (X is another sister) \n\nHer: I never do nice things for u? Wat about clothes i bought when we went out that one time\"\n\nMe: You mean the ones I payed you back for?? Youre so fucking disgusting, I gave you 3 fucking weeks for you to get even one of those silly nokias that cost no more then a fuckin chocolate bar\"\n\nHer: Atleast give me the Phone to tell people I'll be off fo awhile\"\n\nMe: I said FUCK OFF YOU FUCKING STUPID BITCH!\"\n\nAt this point I was just so frustrated, I never ask her anything she uses my products, money, laptop, clothes, xbox and she doesnt seem to care about anyone other then herself. Didnt even have the decency to return my Phone so I can call my School! But now  she doesnt have a Phone and wat if something happens to her? And I do have other things besides phones to use.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting my Phone back?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He's always been kinda disrespectful of my boyfriend, more specifically telling me I deserve better and \"he's not smart enough for me\". On Christmas day we were hanging out, and this friend kissed me on the lips and then physically tried to pull me close. Naturally, I freaked out and sent him home. Since then, we've been trying to repair our friendship but it hasn't been going well. He gets upset when I want to hang with my boyfriend, and he's still telling me he'd be better for me. \n\nAfter a couple months of this, I've had enough. I told him what he did on Christmas perminantly ruined our relationship, and I no longer want to try and fix it because I'm still uncomfortable and unsafe around him. When I tried to explain why we couldn't be friends anymore, he straight up told me I was wrong, I didn't know what I was doing, and I was being unfair. He now wants to talk in person. I'm positive he's going to try and convince me I'm being unfair and he deserves a billionth chance to just be friends. \n\nAITA for being angry he thinks he can tell me how I feel, and for shutting him out in the first place? \n",

She became very upset upon finding out that I was still in contact with my ex, even though I feel it was harmless. My partner had asked me in our previous conversations about cheating whether things were resolved, and wanted to be connected on social media before her trip. I accepted her invite to follow her Instagram, but I use it sparingly. \n\nI know my partner is uncomfortable with my past, but I don’t feel like I need to share everything when I’m not about to cheat again. She keeps saying that I’m hiding things from her.

      "description": "I met this guy on Hinge, a dating app that's geared towards serious dates and \\*relationships\\*. We really hit it off and had a great first date together after a few weeks of chatting. He was new in town and starting his graduate program at my uni, so I was kind of showing him around a bit. \n\nAfter the first date we both knew we really wanted to see each other again, so we scheduled the second date for the very next night. Things were going great—we had a lot of fun—until he suggested we \"get out of here\". We wound up at my place, where we hooked up really awkwardly and, well, he had trouble staying hard. I did my best to reassure him that it was no big deal, and it wasn't. We were both drunk, we were both nervous, and frankly I felt that we had gone to bed way too quickly. We had gone from parting with an awkward hug on the first day to sleeping together on the next. Still, though, we cuddled and watched videos until the early morning, and he went home. \n\nWe tried to talk like normal after that, but when I tried to joke about the previous night he shut me down and explained to me that he really liked hanging out with me but that he \"couldn't do this right now\". He insisted on being friends, and reiterated that he really liked getting to know me, but was firm that he didn't want to be intimate with me anymore. I was frankly shocked—we had gotten on so well, and what had gone wrong was so small in the grand scheme of things. But it is what it is, and people's feelings change, so what can you do?\n\nThe thing is, I ghosted him after that. I hated to admit it, even to myself, but I'd gotten attached to him and what he said really stung. I felt like I could see the future of our acquaintance stretching out before me, us carrying on with \"business as usual\" while I struggled to push my feelings down. Hoping against hope that one day we'd be intoxicated enough to fuck again. Unable to move past it because I would never be able to put aside the hope that he was just scared and secretly just \\*waiting\\* for the moment to confess his true feelings. \n\nI've had all of one relationship that could be considered anything close to serious. Aside from that, I've pretty much only had casual flings with people. One of the reasons I didn't think to just say \"no\" to this guy during our second date was simply because I was so numb to the idea of having sex with someone after a few hours or even minutes that I figured that I should just get it over with and figure out the details later. \n\nI feel shitty for doing what has essentially been done to me by guy friends in the past: revoking my friendship because the person didn't see me romantically. He's new in town and he probably \\*does\\* really want friends, really badly, because it's scary to be in a new place. I feel shitty for justifying the ghosting as \"well I'm going to graduate soon, what's the point?\", even though this graduation has \\*finally\\* come after 4.5 excruciating years. I feel shitty because I know I'm not ready for any of this, but I went for it anyway. I feel shitty for pursuing a relationship when what I really need is therapy (which I can finally get, thank God, when I graduate). I feel shitty for not fixing myself before trying to be with someone else. AITA? ",

Lately, she has been receiving a lot of payments because of things that may or may not be illegal (peep the throwaway), and it’s been getting annoying. Last night, she looked away while taking out cash and the machine ate the card. I won’t be able to get to the bank until Monday, and they’ll probably have to mail it out then. I honestly don’t mind waiting, I just am mad that I’m waiting over *her* mistake. I’ve told her I was sick of this before and reminded her that her boyfriend has his own account. She got annoyed that I was mad, but I still went to her FaceBook and deleted the card information. She thus flipped out, saying she’ll remember this if I ever needed anything. \n\nSo, just to be clear, my mother is mad that I (a 17 year old) won’t let her continue to use my bank account for illegal activities and is threatening to stop helping me because of it. \n\nShould also mention that the reason she won’t use her boyfriend’s account is because his is negative, as I’m the only one in the house with legitimate jobs.

We both moved here about 4 months ago) and she doesn't like to be forced into things. \n\nAfter she apologized she said she was jealous of how easily I could talk to people and the ease I had talking in groups made her feel left out a lot. I never try to make her feel left out and I usually go out of my way to invite her out to events and things so I was confused, but I ended up apologizing for making her feel left out. She seemed really bothered by it but I really don't know what I could have done wrong.  \n\nWe had been at a camp all week but she arrived two days later than me so I had had an opportunity to get closer with the other counselors and I actually formed some really strong friendships with them. When she had gotten to the camp I was hanging out a lot with the new friends I had made and I wasn't with her all the time, but it's not like I hang out with her all the time or that's she's my best friend anyway (she actually usually pretty much keeps her distance from me and hangs out with my roommate whenever she comes over). She confronted me on the second-to-last day of camp. I feel like I shouldn't be responsible to make sure she's interacting with people or to give her an individual invitation every time I go do something when everyone else has an open invitation.  \n\nAm I the asshole for making friends easily?

After a few days of deep thinking and a night out with the boys I decided that the best way for me to respect his decision was to break up with him for i am straight and i am a guy and therefore i like girls and he isn't a girl so therefore i'm not attracted to him.  I felt really bad and still do, i made sure to let him know to talk to me if he needed anything and he seemed to understand why i did what i did. But guess who didn't?\n\nThe GSA club at my school.\n\nThe GSA club at my school has a huge influence on who is hated and who is supported and can quickly ruin one's reputation, soon after i broke up with my gf (IBUWGF) his new GSA friends ( Since he was trans he quickly very much supported by GSA (As he deserves to be)) started to call me Sexest, homophobic, trans-phobic and racist (idk why racist i guess if i was sexist and homophobic why not add in race)  all because i broke up with a newly trans guy.

My dad has a lot of other problems that are really stupid and this is just the icing on the top - however I don't wont to bring these problems here as they are way more serious. AITA for not liking that my dog ONLY pays attention to my dad? I can never even call her.

      "description": "Six years ago, my mother bought me a laptop for college. It wasn't a beast or anything but it could play simple games like csgo and dota. Those were basically the two main games I played with my friends. Well a year after getting it, my roommate at the time was drunk and tripped, knocked it off my desk and landed on it. Breaking the screen clean off the laptop and it would not turn on or connect to external displays.\n\nNow, I still go to college full time and work part time at night and living pay check to pay check for my own needs. I have been using this terrible computer for 5 years now because I have no savings or emergency funds at all. Working in restaurants, I would steal food from work to eat. I make about 800 a month and rent alone is 450. With cell phone, car insurance, utilities, gas for my 30 min drive to work, etc, it gets pretty tight. So, I gave up on my laptop and asked a buddy of mine at walmart to grab me a marked down display model from the back. He came out with a 80 dollar gateway laptop that was made god knows when and I opened a walmart credit card to get it. This laptop cannot handle the software I use for my classes (it cant run basically any software other than word or google chrome. I bought shovel knight with a steam gift card I got for Christmas and the fps is so bad that I cant tell if my inputs actually do anything) and I frequently have to use other people's computers or drive to the library and pay for parking to take tests and complete assignments.\n\nEvery year my mom takes my tax refund to pay her back for the 20 dollars here, 20 there that she sends me to help pay a bill or get gas towards the end of the month.\n\nFast forward to now. My sweet mother decided to actually give me my refund this year which is 800 dollars. I thought this would be my only chance to get a new laptop since I never have any sort of savings whatsoever and I desperately need a new computer.\n\nEnter my girlfriend. She makes 40k a year and blows her money left and right. Drops 60-80 dollars every other day eating out, 200 bucks on the weekend at bars, new phone every couple months, a lot of unnecessary purchases so she also, some how, lives pay check to pay check as well. Growing up with not much money, I try to help her budget her money to build some savings but she claims its her money and she can do what she wants with it. Fair enough.\n\nWe are looking at this apartment and they want a lot of money up front and she wants me to give her the 800 dollars to help offset the cost. She admitted that she can easily cover it with her next pay check but said that \"its not fair\" because she wants to get some tattoos with her next pay. I told her I can help split the monthly bills once we move in but I desperately need a new computer and I dont know when I will have the chance to get another one. I'm 23 (i missed a year of school due to financial issues. I have 9 months left) and she is 24 if that helps.",

      "description": "\n\n   So, context, I'm a 21 year old female living in a university apartment with 4 other girls. As this was a university apartment, I ended up with random roommates. I really like and get along with 3 of the girls, but one girl, I'll call her Ella, and I never really hit it off. She likes to stay in her room and doesn't ever acknowledge me when I try and speak to her. The other three are in the same situation, she just pretends she can't see or hear us.\n\n   I was the first to move in, and I kept the place at 66F because I like the cool, but bumped it to 68 the day before I knew the next girl was going to move in because I understand that's really cold for some people. I noticed however that the thermostat began to be set for 74F a few months later, and I'd just dip it back to 71F, right in the middle. This kept happening until one day a note showed up on the thermostat that said \"Please leave on 73 HEAT\". I talked with the other three girls and they were also not comfortable with that, especially as it's a small place and just cooking can heat it up substantially. I couldn't catch Ella, so I wrote under it \"Can we compromise at 71?\". Three days later she had written \"Open a window\" and cranked it to 75F. It drives me nuts when I come home and the place is boiling hot, especially as we are not supposed to open windows in the winter to keep heating costs down, so I started just turning off the heat when I get home to cool the place down and not, in my mind, waste energy. \n\n   Ella also refuses to take her turn taking out the trash/recycling as well because she's \"only there at night anyway\". This is true off all of as, as we are students as well. I tried to send a group text to remind 'everyone' to keep up with the trash when it is their turn (two of us made a list to keep track because of this very issue), and I got a response from Ella saying \"some people make more trash than others so.....\". \n\nMy other roommates don't want to take sides to avoid conflict, but Ella is driving me insane. I'm always too hot and I'm sick of watching the trash pile up for days as soon as it is her turn. I do have severe OCD, and some sensory processing issues, so little things like heat and messes get to me more than most. Because of this, I'm not sure if my irritation is warrented or I'm being a controlling asshole. So I'm asking Reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I live in a 5 person apartment and can't stand 1 of them for various reasons.",

      "description": "Vague title because I didn’t know how to put it all in there without it being superrrrrr long. \nSo I work in a resource center of a very large hospital in the downtown area of a larger city. This resource center is for patients and family members to come and use our computers for research, find hard copies of educational information about conditions, just pass the time, whatever they want to do because being stuck in a hospital can be terribly boring and unsettling. \nLet me just say that I like working here. I enjoy feeling like I’m helping people every day who are in a very stressful environment by answering their questions, giving them directions, etc. What I don’t like is this: there are people who come into this research center literally every day who I am 100% certain are not patients or family members of patients. They just heard that we have free internet and it’s free to print here and thought “hey that’s convenient.” I mean there are a few people that I would bet anything on them coming in every single day and camping out for hours. Unfortunately, there is no way to “restrict” entry to just patients and family. It’s just not set up that way. Even though it literally says on the wall “patients and family.”\nBecause of this, sometimes our research center is full and ACTUAL patients and families can’t use the computers when they need to. This absolutely infuriates me. Also, these “regulars” tend to treat this place like their own living room. Leaving trash behind, printing off sometimes (no exaggeration) hundreds of pieces of paper (this is currently happening as I’m typing this post), and just talking loudly on their cell phones. \nI always treat these people how I would treat the actual patrons of the hospital, but inside I’m fuming. I also realize that these people might not have any other way to access the internet and that maybe I should be more understanding of whatever their circumstances might be. \n\nSo, AITA for thinking that these people are assholes?",

A girl was physically standing in an open spot while a car was trying to pull in. The car was yelling at the girl that since she didn't have car that she isn't allowed to save it for her friend's car who were on their way to park. So basically, if you were meeting some people, saw parking was rough, you would decide to stand in an open spot to save it until your friends arrived. Note; she was standing there before the car tried to pull into that spot.\n\nIs that girl an asshole for pulling this move or is this acceptable in regards to parking ethics? Would you pull this move?\n\nI've had a debate with my family about this and was wondering what the asshole reddit community would think.\n\nPS.

      "description": "Hi! This is my first time posting and I’m on mobile so I apologize in advance for formatting issues. Also, throwaway account, my friend is an active Redditor. Also, very long story ahead, so bear with me! \n\nLast year I (F25) met my friend PJ (M31) while we were both studying for our MBA. We became good friends and ended up moving to the same city post graduation. We saw each other like 2 or 3 times a week and became very close friends. During this time I was also having severe mental health issues and often leaned on him for support. He was good about being there for me and often encouraged me to go back on SSRIs. So, with his support, i did go back on meds. Within a few weeks they started working and I started feeling happier and healthier. \n\nHowever, as the meds got me back into a good mindset I noticed some toxic relationships in my life. I also started noticing my own toxic behaviors and changed myself a lot. This affected my relationship with PJ because I started noticing things about him that made me really uncomfortable. In his defense he always did these behaviors, but suddenly I was like... aware and negatively affected by them. I’ll go into more detail on his behaviors in the comments because of the character limit, but basically I’m recognizing how controlling, angry, mean, and inappropriate he tends to be. \n\nI recently moved further away and don’t make the effort to see him a lot anymore, which in turn makes me feel like a really shitty friend and person. A week ago I had him over to see the new place and he ended up making some sexual and rude comments that really upset my roommate and me. He also refused to let anyone else pick the movie besides him and when he was ready to leave he told me I could drive him home even though I told him several times before he came over that he would have to Uber. When I refused he was verbally angry.\n\nI realize I don’t enjoy spending time with him anymore. Obviously this breaks my heart because he is my best friend and I still deeply care about him and deep down I think he is a good person. Without him I don’t think I would have gotten the help I need. But his behavior annoys, hurts, and offends me. He is going through A LOT of personal stuff right now I want to be there for, but he doesn’t seem interested in getting help. He says that this is who he is, that he’s used to not having friends or anyone who cares about him, and that most people leave him and it doesn’t bother him. I think it does bother him but he’ll never admit it, nor will he admit he cares about our friendship, which also hurts.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for telling him how I feel and ending the friendship if he refuses to change? I feel guilty because I think I unknowingly tolerated these behaviors for a long time because I myself was unwell, but I don’t want to keep tolerating the uncomfortable and inappropriate situations he creates.

      "description": "This saga has been going on for a week but it feels more like a dbz filler arc, except worse because at least at the end of that i can expect a reward. \n\nThis is kinda long so tl;dr is i have a shy gf and my bitch sister made fun of her, so i called my bitch sister a bitch.\n\nMy sister is dating my best friend. Thats pretty terrible as it is, but it gets worse. My sister is a horrible person. I mean like the sociopath getting off on others suffering horrible. During a fight with my best friend she literally told my best friend she hopes his family dies. Yeah.\n\nSo my best friend had a birthday party last saturday. I decide to invite my girlfriend who ive been dating for half a year but doesnt have much exposure to my family.\n\nThe reason she doesnt is because shes 'quirky'. I dont wanna say weird because that has some negative connotations. She had bad acne in her freshman year, plus braces and glasses. She was bullied alot and didnt have many friends.\n\nNow shes a fox imo. No acne, great body, still wears glasses but i think theyre cute. Shes a very talented artist which is how we met. I was trying to find a graphic designer to build a logo for my company. I didnt use her but we hit it off.\n\nNow, the quirky stuff. She had little to no friends so no social interaction so she sometimes does things, like if we're laying down together or im near her she will sort of nibble on my shoulder (no shes not a cat i swear she doesnt even think about it when she does it).\n\nShe also has a nervous laugh that sounds a little like goofy but squeaky. She fiddles with her hands (twiddling thumbs), doesnt look people in the eye when talking, and speaks very fast before laughing. She also sometimes sucks on her hair a bit when shes bored or in her own world.\n\nI dont want to paint her in a bad light, shes also very smart, kind, and thoughtful. She could really be a scientist i think if she really applied herself but college scares her. Shes very shy.\n\nBecause of this shyness she is very uncomfortable around new people. Our dates are always in either dark or less crowded places like movie theaters and parks. We also hang out at our apartments alot. \n\nIn case you couldnt tell i am very much into this girl and could see a real future with her. Shes very important to me so ive tried to involve her with my family. Shes met my parents 3 times, my best friend more times than i can count, my sister zero because i hate her.\n\nBecause she gets along with my best friend she decides to come to his birthday. She even drew him this picture of Vladislov from \"What We Do in the Shadows\" because we all watched it together.\n\nMy sister is there because shes dating my best friend. As me and my gf are in line to get a slice of cake my sister is right in front of my gf and starts her bullshit.\n\n\"Um...could you back up a bit please?\"\n\nTo my gf. My gf was no where near her, just next in line. My gf apologizes but now shes on tilt and starts the nervous laugh.\n\nWe all play quiplash, my gf was coming up with a very long answer and was the last one to select an answer so we were all waiting on her.\n\n\"Oh my god whose taking so long?\"\n\nMy gf freezes, spams some keys on her phone and enters. The final part of her answer is gobbldy gook. She says she forgot what she was trying to say.\n\n\"Well that was worth the wait, haha\"\n\nMy sister again. My gf is quiet the rest of the night. Shes sort of cuddled up next to me and starts nibbling on my shoulder without realizing.\n\nMy sister sees this.\n\n\"Oh my god.\"  In sort of a loud whisper like tone before gesturing to my best friend to look at us. My best friend pays no mind but she does this stupid fucking laugh with no sound thing. And she actually POINTS.\n\nI had enough and i asked her if shes drunk. Shes not but i just wanted to get her to be quiet. Shes says that shes not the one acting drunk.\n\nI say youre embarassing yourself like one. At this point the mood has effectively turned. She tells me to shut up as she wasnt even talking to me, i say the problem is i can hear you.\n\nWe start yelling and screaming. I end up calling her a stupid fucking bitch and i leave. My gf was out the door way before me, she cried on the way back which made me feel like shit. I wanted her to have a good time and impress people with her art.\n\nNow she doesnt want to see my best friend because shes embarrassed. My best friend says that both me and my sister were assholes and i apologized but part of me thinks i had no choice but to defend someone i care about. AITA?",

      "description": "My partners parents have quite a bit of land and a few animals (sheep, pig, dogs), about an hour drive from the city where I live and work. They made travel plans to go to Europe for a month to visit on of their daughters. Initially my partner was going to house sit, but he just recently found out he had epilepsy after having a full-blown seizure. He didn't get his license taken away, but I didn't feel comfortable with him driving an hour back and forth every morning and evening - just in case. So, I offered to look after the animals and the house for a month. \n\nOnce the parents got back from their holiday, we all caught up for dinner. At the table his parents pulled out all these gifts from their travels and handed them around to partner and his sister. Now I'm not greedy or I don't expect things, but i thought - even a fridge magnet or a funny card? I suppose I just grew up in an environment where my parents would of course bring something back for someone who has done them a favor. \n\nI didn't get angry or annoyed or anything, I just felt a little bit hurt. I suppose it was just an appreciation thing. Am I being selfish? AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not buying some skis because they were too \"girly\"",
      "description": "Posting on behalf of my brother who just had a AITA moment.\n\nSo my brother (31M) just came back from buying some ski's for an upcoming trip at a local secondhand sports shop. He knew one of the staff members that worked there through a mutual friend but a different staff member helped him try and find some ski boots. She gave him lots of good advice and was super patient with him. They choose a pair and went to look for skis even though the shop was closing in about ten minutes, although he wasn't aware of this at the time. The staff member who was helping him worked out he needed a certain size of ski which they didn't currently have in the men's section. Instead she found a pair in the women's section which would be her best recommendation in terms of size. The skis in question were coloured gray fading into indigo with cursive writing and plastic sparkly bits on the side. He checked them out but told the staff member, who was female, he didn't like them because they were too girly. The staff member who he knew, who was stood nearby challenged him a bit on it, not in an aggressive way, but saying \"Oh come on. Does anybody really care about the whole gender thing?\" and told him a story about a boy who came in the day before and bought bright pink skis and how great it was. My brother just said he wasn't making any point about women and he should like the design of the skis he bought. He asked to see if there were any other options but the staff member who had been helping him became slightly abrupt, her body language become  more closed off, standing with her arms folded. She got one other pair out but didn't really give any information about them. She'd been super helpful and informative before and it seemed like there was a sudden shift after the comment. When my brother asked her some more questions about the skis she held up her hands and said \"I can only advise you. You need to make a choice. These are your options. We are closing in one minute\".\nHe felt uncomfortable and didn't want to spend $200 on skis so he only purchased the boots and left.\n\nHe was bothered about the experience afterwards and explained he found the design overall was targeted towards women in a way that was slightly patronising and gendered in his opinion.  For him 'girly' was the appropriate word as that was the style the skis had been marketed as. For him, he'd rather buy his first skis with a design he identifies with more but felt he was treated a little bit like he was an asshole for not liking the boots and pressured to buying a pair he didn't want. So was the shop assistant an asshole for the way she seemed to react to my brothers comment or was my brother the asshole for not following her recommendations because he didn't like the style and using the term \"girly\"?",

      "description": "For starters this happened when I was around 10 or so which was 13 years ago. I think of this event often and while I do fell bad I also feel like it was justified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one day during late elementary or early middle school I was going home with my best friend for the weekend. During this time I would get migraines everyday a few hours before school was over which caused great pain which made me irritable and asocial. On the bus was two of my friends neighbors which I'll call Amber and Beth. Amber and Beth were both picking on me and just being a bother while I just wanted to be left alone until my pain finally subsided. After 5 minutes of asking them to leave me alone I decided to just play some soft music on my mp3 and eat a pudding cup I saved from lunch. Amber seemed to finally get the message that I wasn't in the mood to deal with them but Beth would not have it. After failing to get my attention we pulled up to our stop. As I am grabbing my bag Beth jumps up and grabs my pudding and smashes it into my shirt (which happens to be one of my favorites) and this sets me off. I chase her off the bus into the yard and start yelling at her about how she is a fat b and that she is so annoying. She then runs home crying while Amber berates me for being so mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think everything is over so I go inside to get something for my migraine which is now much worse. Only a few minutes later the phone rings and my friend says it's for me. Beth's mother calls me from her work to tell me how horrible I am for making her innocent child cry for doing nothing wrong and demands I go and apologize which I refuse. I explain what happened and she still believes I was in the wrong for my behavior. I told her I'm not going to argue and hand up. A minute later my friends mom calls asking for me. Apparently Beth's mother called my friends mother to yell at me too. After dealing with her my mother calls saying she was getting calls from some lady yelling about how I was bulling her daughter. I explain to my mom what happened and my friend agreed with me. She simply asked I try to be more level headed next time I deal with her and I agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this I never really spoke to Amber or Beth again but I still think about it and how I could have handled it differently.

It had a weird smell and it was repulsive. Maybe because of some hormones during pregnancy idk.\n\nI just couldn't. She understood that something was up and asked me. I told her that her vagina stinked and she needed to clean up before we can do anything.

      "description": "So me(20f) and my ex(20m) dated for two years. He was the fist and only guy that i had ever been with (even kissing). I broke it off (because i was unhappy with the relationship) in june 2018 but since im stupid I slept with him a couple of times until august. Then i decided that i couldn't put up with it so I just answered his texts as friends (i'll explain why)\nSo this guy is really crazy. Im serious. My mother once called the police because he was doing a scene in front of our house. During fights he would kick doors, one time even ripped his shirt and tried to jump out of the window of the second floor when I tried to end the relationship.\nWhen i was living in a house with 3 housemates in college he would drive 30min (from my home town to the city i was living) and ring the bell at 3am because I didnt answer the phone. He was about to join the army in october and i wanted to be suportive so i kept answering his messages because i didnt want him to feel bad and give up on his dream. He told me it would be my fault if he didnt got in because he wasnt good psychologically because of the eay I treated him (as a friend). He didnt got in. Things got even worse. He would text me 20 30 40 times a day, every day. Accusing me of being with other people, begging for attention, just being fucking annoying. Every time I saw a text i just wanted to smash my phone on the ground. I told him to stop or i would block him. 3 weeks ago i had exames and assignements in college and i couldnt deal with him anymore so I stopped responding and then changed numbers without warning. Blocked him in everything. He has since created 6 facebook accounts and sent me around 50 messages in each. I'm tired of his shit so i didnt reply. I havent see him in 3 months and we dont talk in 4 weeks.\nI dont agree with ghosting but i didnt know what else to do. AITA?",

      "description": "So my friend had to go away for a little while due to some reasons I'm not gonna disclose (nothing bad). He told me, while he was gone, to hang out with his gf and to make sure she didn't get super depressed. We became fast friends. Before you ask, this is a totally platonic thing, I have no intention of being anything other than friends with this girl. She's nice and it's good to have some company, since I don't have many other friends.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nThe problem is that this girl is really into partying, drugs, and alcohol. Now, that on its own isn't much of a problem. Live life however the fuck you want, I ain't gonna judge, as long as you're a decent human, which she is, I don't give a flying fuck. Besides, at our age, everyone is like that. The problem is that my friend has no idea about this. In fact, he thinks that she is the exact opposite. That's one of the main reasons he went out with her. He liked how she didn't drink or do drugs and didn't hang out with the \"wrong\" crowd. His gf has always protested against his obtuseness when it comes to these sort of things, but has always remained \"in-line\" while around him. But while away, I've seen this girl straight up chug a bottle of fireball whiskey, smoke pot, and juul. Not the craziest shit in the world but a far cry of what he thinks she is. She's told me numerous times to keep this a secret from him. And I do, and don't feel bad that I do. I know if I put myself in his shoes I would feel awful knowing I was dating a dating a girl under false pretenses. But, I just can't bring myself to tell him. Ignoring the fact that his gf would be fucking pissed at me, It would also have untold damages on their relationship. When they are together, in person, they are on of the best, happiest, and cutest couples I have ever seen. But on the other hand, I'm also really good friends with her bf, so it seems like there would be some obligation there to tell him. But that feeling isn't enough for me to go through with it. Besides, I feel like an issue like this is between them, and should be brought up on their own terms.\n\nSo that's why I'm here now. I wanna know, in this situation, am I the asshole. One one hand I feel like there is an obligation to be honest. But on the other, it really isn't within my jurisdiction to decide what happens in their relationship.\n\nTL;DR: I'm good friends with a guy and his gf. His gf is really into partying and shit. Guy doesn't know, and explicitly hates partying and shit. I don't feel bad for not telling him.",

      "description": "I'm an 18 yo creative freelance developer. I've been freelancing since I was 14, self taught CSS/front end dev, Graphic Designer, and i'm cert. in Google Adwords. I have worked with many small business and larger orgs so I have a pretty dope portfolio...better than most adults tbh. In fact my portfolio is so good I received a job straight out of high school as a digital marketing analyst at a digital agency. I also have participated in many volunteer events. You'd think i'd be able to go to freaking Yale. BUT NO the problem is my average GPA as well as SAT scores. I graduated with a 2.9/1080sat. I was completely disillusioned when I received those rejection letters from even the 'lower level' public U's. It actually pissed me off and I became extremely resentful of friends who I thought didn't deserve their acceptance letters into great top 20 schools. I had been making around $1500/m from the age of 14 and that meant nothing, kids who didn't even know what they wanted to do were getting into better colleges than I applied to just because they studied more but in the 'real world' I was the one who had accreditation. Now i'm at community college and my grades are about the same as high school I average a B-. I'm worried that the same thing will happen when attempting to transfer to a full time U. I'm actually trying a lot more than I did in high school but it's frustrating and i give up sometimes 1) because i am doing basics and i'm extremely uninterested in semi permeable membranes &amp; 2) i'm putting off projects with clients and can't focus on the things i'm interested in. I'd love to open a marketing agency but can't because of school and I can't drop out because of my parents. My real world experience and portfolio should be able to speak for itself instead of a gpa that means not a damn thing in most cases. It's unfair and genuinely pisses me off. Probably sound like a spoiled brat but idgaf the things I've done outweigh my average to below average grades.",

      "title": "AITA for not driving my neighbor to court. Which might result in her being evicted?",
      "description": "So let me start out by saying my neighbor is in continuous hardship. Me and my bf have given her food and pet food numerous times. Jumped her truck 6 times in one week. Twice we had to jump it every few blocks to get her home. We occasionally paid her to do yard. We had stopped because she asked us for an advance and then didn't do the work. A month later she gave back the money after being asked for it a few times. Dispite that she usually knocks on my door multiple times a week asking for favors and if I can I help. \n\nWell two days ago she comes over she's talking about how she's broke and doesn't have any food for her or animals. I tell her if she wants she rake the leaves and pick up poop and we will pay her $40. We have fake grass now so we don't need much done. She says ok that she will be over the next day. She then asked if we could give her the money ahead of time. I didn't have any cash and told her so. She then asked my bf if he had cash...I am not sure why but this really rubbed me the wrong way. He said no.\n\nI told her I'd give her some food. I packed her some frozen meats, rice, beans, six eggs, canned fruit, granola bars, velveeta mac and cheese, a beer, a big container of spaghetti, dog food, and maybe a couple other things. Which was a lot for us. We are by NO means well off. We struggle and have to stick to a strict budget to ensure we don't run up too much debt. Since we had just filled the pantry thanks to tax season I was feeling generous. Plus in my mind if someone is asking for food they must really need it.\n\nBut the next day when she didn't come over to do the yard work I began to ponder if she was so broke why not do a half hours work and make a couple bucks. So I knocked on her door and heard her dogs in the house, which usually means she's home, but she didn't answer.\n\nFast forward to today and she knocked on my door a little before 4pm asking me to take her to court which closes at 5pm. Apparently it was the last day to file something that has to do with her landlord who is trying to evict her. I told her to give me five minuets. I was in my pjs cleaning. I go to get dressed and I thought to myself why am I dropping everything and rearranging my day for her. So when she came back five minutes later I told her I was supposed to have an phone interview at 4, but it was postponed until 4:30 so she should look somewhere else for a ride. Which was a lie.\n\nI kinda feel like an asshole but part of me feels like she is taking advantage of my kindness. She probably knew about this deadline for weeks if not months. If she had asked me a few days earlier I could have scheduled it in. Lately she just seems manipulative.\n\nSo Reddit what do you think? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Geez, who knew Minecraft could be so dramatic?\n\nA week ago Saturday I told my best friend from middle school (we are 18 and in college now) about a server I’m running (let’s call him T) and T joined the server, and I made T an OP.\n\nOur server has some rules like no building in creative etc. and T isn’t a part of the discord, but I informed him on our rules.\n\nWell T decides he is going to build a huge fucking castle right next to our town.\n\nQueue Wednesday The players realize he obviously has used creative which is against our community rules, so they begin messing with him. They start using world edit to remove small parts of the wall, and then undo their edit so it goes back. This goes on for a while and he is getting frustrated. \n\nT proceeds to call me and complain that they’re messing with him and ask me to tell them to stop. I tell him I can’t do that as of then and he should log off it is really bothering him. T proceeds to tell me to ban said players for messing with him to which I said no. Things escalate on the server to the point where I join the discord call and ask them to stop. They obviously didn’t because T got very upset.\n \nThe next day (Thursday) there is lava all over everyone’s builds and our town we made.\n\nOf course everyone in the discord is confused because we are whitelisted, and the person who did it has to be an idiot to grief because I can check server logs to figure out who it is. I check the logs and it was T who did it. I deop and ban him at this point.\n\nLater that day I unban him and reop him because T told me he was sorry. So we play.\n\nThat night I get an onslaught of messages from the community telling me to ban T again because they don’t trust him. I was put in a tough decision so I decided to ban him again because T did grief and the players were uncomfortable with T being on the server. \n\nQueue this evening. T sends me a Snapchat saying he isn’t mad about me banning him, he’s mad that I’m prioritizing the players of the server, over him, my best friend since middle school. I tell him he griefed the server but he believes his griefing was justified because he was giving the players a taste of their own medicine ie: messing with builds. \n\nI told T that it seems pretty childish to be mad at me over a block game and people I can’t control. So I proceed to ask him. “Are you seriously question my ability to be a good friend over a f*cking block game?”\n\nAnd T says “you didn’t have my back and made me feel unwelcome on your server, so yeah”\n\nThat shocked me. It really did. And it’s kind of gotten to me a bit.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for banning my best friend from my Minecraft server? Could I have been harsher on the players and threatened them with demotes to get them to stop?\n\nTl;dr - my best friend from middle school griefed my Minecraft server because he was being messed with by other players and proceeded to tell me I was a bad friend because I didn’t stick up for him.",

      "description": "This could be a longer one \nSo before i start i'm german and my english isn't the best so sorry in advance \nAnd i'm 15 and friends with this girl since wie were  12 \n\nSo it all started when we were in 7th grade we got along very well and became 'best friends' and in the beginning our friendship was alright and stuff and everything seemed okay until she started treating me... Let's say different. It started with not wanting to share her stuff  even though she always took my stuff without asking (which didn't bother me but if i would have done it to her she would have gotten angry) and she always called me stupid for no reason or told me not to whine about stuff when i came to her to talk about my worries. Many times she always made it about her , for example when i said   i couldnt sleep last night until 3 am she would tell me \"oh you know how long I couldn't sleep yesterday??? Stop complaining\" even though i didnt really complain, i just told her normally. \n\nThen 8th grade, a girl from another class came into our class. She was a good friend of mine and we hung out alot which made my 'best friend' jealous. The thing is, yes i met the other girl wayyy more often BUT that was because \n1. i always got asked to hang out (i dont want to make myself look 'cool' or smth by saying that, its just when she asked me i wouldnt say no bc shes a nice Person and i liked meeting up with her. My 'best friend' on the other hand literally NEVER asked me. I always had to call, and when I did, she was almost never free or i had to call 5 other times until we had a date which she then would cancel most of the time anyway) \n2. at this point, i think we both changed personality-wise and we just hadn't anything to talk about so meeting up w/ my 'best friend' was pretty boring \nI still tried  to meet up anyway bc i did not want to lose her yet and thought that its maybe just a Phase \n\nI told another friend how i felt about this Situation and that i don't think the title 'best friends' is fitting right now, and she totally agreed and told me she thinks the same and that she notices how shitty my 'best friend' treats me \n\nThen 9th grade \nThe other girl i hung out with alot changed classes  again so she wasnt in mine anymore. We still keep contact but it isnt as close anymore ( which is okay with me ). Anyway, 9th grade was pretty okay bc there was noone else she could get jealous of, but we just kept on changing in different directions. Which resulted in her insulting me all the time over super banal things like i remember one time i forgot my math stuff bc i thought we would have physics that day and i told her all jokingly like \"ohh i thought we wouldnt have maths haha\" and she just said \"omg you are so dumb \" which wasbt a joke i mean maybe thats just her personality but that just isnt how u treat your best friend or am i wrong?? I wasnt to hurt over that, i mean she just called me dumb its really no big deal but that happened sooo often over the most normal things it just got annoying and i told her that and she just said ohh but im not serious which is bullshit i knew her at that point i can tell exactly when she is joking and that just wasnt it. She still can't share, she is super egotistical, she constantly  jokes about others and laughs about Jokes about me but when you joke about her or i laugh abt a joke about her she gets angry and stops talking to me for a day or so (for 1 stupid joke i mean come on)  \nThere i already held on to her for too long imo but i always thought maybe she will change again and be like in the beginning of our friendship but noo never happened it just got worse\n \nThen 10th grade to today \nWe were in a friendgroup of 4 where we would contsantly joke abt one another. AS i already said, she cant take Jokes. At all. I don't say she had to change, she just didnt fit in our friendgroup acting like that. We sometimes have a bigger break between the lessons in the morning and the ones in the afternoon. We always hang around  at a bakery and we like to do some silly stuff cause we're teenagers you know... And my 'best friend ' just always tries to shame us for that. She rolls her eyes, tells us to shut up, stops talking if you poke some fun at her, etc... It's just annoying. She still didnt stop insulting me, still the same sh*t with the sharing and almost never meeting up,.... \nAnd here it begins to start getting messy. \nHer moms birzhday is on Halloween. She always talks about how she thinks Halloween is stupid and that she doesnt celebrate it bc they go out eating with her mom. No Problem, i hang out with others on Halloween. But noooo she doesnt want me to do that. I had plans to hang out with two other friends this year, and when she heard about this, she got upset. (Well she thinks that i replaced her with one of those friends i wanted to meet up with even if we barely See each other cause that girl lives pretty far away and there are two other friends in my class i See way More often so i don't get why she thinks that the one who lives far away replaced her bc there are other options which would make way more sense) anyaway, the thing that made me finally tell her that i don't think we are best friends anymore is the fact that she didnt talk to me for 3 days straight even though we sit together in almost every room at school. When i finally asked her why the Heck she ignores me, she says that she thinks its bad from me that i didnt ask her to do something on Halloween even though she ALWAYS tells me that she IS NOT FREE ON Halloween bc of her mom. So i didnt even bother asking, and now shes upset about that. There she also told me that she feels replaced by that one friend  (as i said, makes no sense at all)\nSo there i got angry . \nEverytime she made me feel stupid bc of the dumbest things, everytime she wouldnt give a thing but take everything, everytime she would ignore me for hours because of one joke, everytime i tried to talk about something only to get a super flat response, it just hit me.\nI stg i tried to save this friendship. I tried to meet up, i tried to get a conversation  going, i tried to ignore all the mean things she said, but NOTHING came from her side.\nSo i told her all those things and that that is maybe why i do more stuff with others and that we can still talk and just not be 'best friends' anymore. Since then she doesnt talk to me at all and talks sh*t behind my back. Very nice.\nI'm sorry if this seems overdramatic, it's just this left me feeling kinda bad and thats why i am posting this here. Was i overreacting and she did not treat me bad at all? Was i too harsh? Its just i had waited for so long i just had more than enough. \n\nTL;DR felt treated unfairly by best friend since a long time, decided to cut 'best friendship', now feels bad and thinks maybe was too harsh.",

      "title": "AITA For Talking About My Fiend Without Her Knowing?",
      "description": "Tl:dr  \nAW 'copies' me and my friend's interest and styles and we talk about it without her knowing.  \nHere's some context:  \nMe: A semi-extrovert who likes anime, manga, writing, reading, and recently BTS and K-pop.  \nGP: My friends who talks about my other friend with me. She likes to say she's an emo kid and she loves Panic! At The Disco.  \nAW: Attention Whore as GP likes to say sometimes. I don't know if all her likes are her's but I know she likes BTS and everything Korean. Also maybe everything me and GP like too. Has a step-dad and complains a lot about family issues.  \nOkay, the story begins. I'm transferred to a new class in the 2nd week of school. It was a High Honors class I think or SIG. You must have an average of 90 or higher to remain in that class ( Slightly relevant ). I knew most of the boys in the class from my old school and most of the girls if you could say that. ( I let them cheat off me a lot on every test and homework. Pretty sure that's the reason why they kind of like me. ) I found my quiet kindergarten bestie and we instantly reconnect as besties. Sadly my other quieter 4th-grade bestie was in a different class. The first day of the class it's warm outside and we decide to go out. That's when I met AW and GP ( A few others too ). They were on their phones watching something hidden behind their bags. I do the same and my quieter 4th-grade bestie does the same only with my phone only.  \nNow, this continued for a few days before we actually spoke to AW and GP. We bonded about many things and it seemed like we all had the same interest. I said I liked BTS and Anime so did AW. I thought nothing of it because many girls like BTS and anime. GP mentioned how she loved musicals.  \nNow here is where it starts. We start gushing over Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, Mean Girls, and Heathers. We start rocking out to the songs and listening to them whenever we could. AW could only say   \n\"I like that too!\"  \n\"Yeah, that's my favorite scene!\"  \nI figured she wasn't a hardcore fangirl so I showed her Hamilton. I started the shit-storm. We all started singing \"The Schleyer Sisters' when we wanted each other's attention. I found out later that AW had pretended to binge all the songs and only knew the ones I showed her. Around that time GP started telling me more about AW.   \nPrivately.  \nShe said things like.  \n\"I just said that joke\"  \n\"I told her that before.\"  \n(One of her recent things was \"I told her I loved Sailor Moon. I even wrote a fan fiction about it. And I told her about how my Auntie introduced it to me at a young age but now she's telling everyone the same thing but about herself.\")  \nI at first simply ignored them and nodded sympathetically. I didn't really partake in the conversations at first. Until AW started being cold to me. According to GP, she had said that I was verbally abusive and didn't care about her at all. Which is wrong. I was just tired of hearing about how her stepdad sucked. But I never said that and just stayed on my phone, read, or just nodded.  \nI started getting annoyed and shared my experiences with AW which were mostly her trying to steal my art style.  \nNow just this Friday she broke down during last period in Gym. I was doing a few girls homework and helping GP. She was crying next to my number one new bestie ( I liked her bubbly personality. ). All I had heard before she started crying was \"I just don't feel like I can tell anyone expect \\[ kindergarten bestie \\] about my problems\"  \nI comfort her and hug her. I tell GP but she was skeptical. The day before AW had told me I would 'feel' on Friday when I made the joke I had no feelings. She was going on about how she doesn't feel accepted and that she needs to change herself to everyone's likes.\n\n( Does that excuse you for copying her bio and her profile pic? )\n\n  \nOf course, I explained that makes it worse. She said that she had a lot of pressure from her Dad screaming at her and her mom and she was going to stop making friends. GP seemed to think she was just trying to be emo since lately, she was wearing all black. She said that there was one person that makes her feel terrible every day. Weirdly it was a girl we barely hang out with as a group \\[ We suggested ourselves but she was quick to decline that we were suspect \\].   \nAm I the asshole?\n\n  \n( Also, GP made jokes about AW sucking her dad's you-know-what because she always sucks up to him. But like she also nicknames us pr\\*stitute, wh\\*re, sl\\*t, h\\*e. She also calls white people white-trash. I don't know if it's justifiable though. )",

      "title": "AITA for taunting my dead dad's girlfriend?",
      "description": "throwaway for safety\n\nSo my father died yesterday morning.\n\nI went No-Contact with him and that entire side of the family about 15 years ago and haven't looked back since. He was violent, abusive drunk to me, abusive to my mother, and abusive to my half-brother, who I don't really have nor want a relationship with. He was a violent drunk, and the son of a Nazi Officer during WWII. He was also known for having multiple girlfriends at multiple times, usually to take their money and feed his alcohol and tobacco addiction. He was a shit human being with no redeemable qualities. We will refer to him as Fritz.\n\nYesterday morning Fritz finally dropped of a heart attack, and we're all relieved and actually happy about it, like winning a lottery we didn't even realize we entered. But his girlfriend-of-the-year (who we will refer to as Jane) is pretty broken up about it. My mother reached out to Jane to wish her the best and express her condolences. Jane dropped a \"To tell the truth\" bomb, which she pined over the fact that my mother caused Fritz's two only sons to \"abandon\" him and wouldn't talk to him, especially in his time of need. She expressed regret over the fact that my half-brother and I never bothered to rebuild the relationship and meet the \"rest of the family\".\n\nIt was very obvious that my father filled Jane's head up with lies and played the \"poor me\" game the way he did his entire life. And my mother didn't appreciate playing the blame game when she was simply trying to be nice. So she responded:\n\n&gt;\"Fritz had two different sons, 10 years apart, with two different women, in two different cities, in two different situations, and they both decided to cut off contact, and they both feel zero regret or grief. Perhaps if Fritz took some responsibility for his actions for once in his life, he wouldn't have felt so alone when he passed.\"\n\nJane ended up sending a bunch of nasty messages before blocking my mother completely. So I sent a message to Jane,\n\n&gt;\"Jane, I'm sorry for your loss. But you have known him for literally 1/25th of the time that I've known him. You do not get to comment on my or my brother's relationship with him. You don't get to pass judgment on what I chose to do after the trauma I experienced, and you certainly don't get to send nastygrams after we tried to offer condolences. We have no idea who you are, frankly, and we have no interest in learning. There is no \"rest of the family\", he was not part of the family and you certainly aren't either. If he lived for another two years, he would've had another two girlfriends. I understand you thought you were different because he never pushed you down the stairs or sunk his forearm around your throat, I'm understand you're hurt and that this is tough for you, but that does not make you a member of this family. Have a nice day, never contact us again.\"\n\nThe rest of the family agrees that it's a good thing Fritz passed, but my message specifically was a little overboard to Jane. So AITA?",

I have worked for 4 years (I'm 19 going on 20), and she's only worked for a year making the exact same amount as me, though constantly having loads in her bank account (she didn't have to pay rent prior to us moving in together, I had to pay rent at my parents' house) because I like to waste my money on guitars and things I don't need.\n\nWe moved into an apartment that had a $1,400 deposit, but only $700 a month which is a *steal* considering the quality and location of the apartment. I couldn't even contribute 1/4 of the deposit at the time we had to pay it, and she had absolutely no problem covering it as long as I would pay her back my half in time. I offered anything I could, but she declined because she's a goddamn saint.\n\n9 months later, we're still living at the apartment and we haven't even brought up the money I owe her. I worry about it constantly, and ***really*** don't want her to think I'm taking advantage of her in any way. I do my best to make up for it by covering our \\~100 power bill each month, as well as our $70 internet bill, but I still worry she'll bring this up or she's saving it as ammo during our next fat argument, and I know I'll just get really nervous and say something stupid or meaningless.",

I make the entire plate of food, and then I serve it to him. The egg was completely cooked with a runny yolk, and then he tells me he wants a \"cooked\" egg. I didn't know what he meant, so I said \"it is cooked\". I then get barraged with how it's still not cooked and how it's still slimy (which if you've ever eaten an egg before, the yolk isn't slimy, and the whites were set.). I decided that I'd just make him another egg with a cooked yolk and everything and leave it at that, despite how we had argued over if it was cooked or not. Then he continues to ask me, \"are you mad? don't be mad, c'mon.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis irritates me, so I just head off to my room in a heap of anger at being harassed over an egg.

      "description": "I live in a small town about a half hour from a city. There is more to do in the city, so when I hang out with my friend (who lives in the city) we typically make plans to do something in the city. It never fails that a few minutes after we make plans, or shortly before I'm going to leave my house to meet her, she'll message me asking if I can give her a ride or if I 'want to give her a ride.' She owns a car and can drive, but doesn't like to. Picking her up/dropping her off probably tacks on about 10 minutes to each leg of the journey. I know it's a small thing but I get irked by little things that become obligations. AITA? And if I'm not, the other issue is how to politely say no to something like this, keyword being politely as she is a very nice person. Obviously I CAN do it, and I just don't want to. Saying I 'can't' or that I have other obligations won't really work as she can just offer to change the day/time of our meetup to whenever it would work for me to pick her up. And I hate to have to just come out and tell her 'look, of course I could pick you up, I just don't want to' if there's a nice way to avoid actually saying that. ",

      "description": "Hello, this is a throwaway account and I'm gonna do my best to keep my story vague because I don't want the person I'm talking about to find this.\n\nI have a best friend, let's call them J. J and I have been very close for about 3 years now, and for 1.5 of those years, I have been living in a different state. I have come back to our hometown several times since I've moved, including a whole summer, and we would still hang out when I was here. When I'm back in my new state, we don't really talk much aside from snapchatting and posting about our lives on Instagram. \n\nJ and I had a group of mutual friends, but nearly everyone in the group is or was immature at some point and there have been several falling outs between different individuals, but J and I have stayed close. I am the only member of the group that has moved. \n\nI mention our group because J has had a great deal of drama within this group, especially with the members of the other sex, because she has been involved in romantic relationships with most of them. After each one ended, things within the group were awkward for a while and J and her former boyfriend would almost never be close again. In addition to these \\~4 guys in our group, she has had a series of small, short relationships with other guys that she met outside of the group. Each breakup was a bigger deal than the last one, and the way these guys broke her heart got worse and worse over time. \n\nSo along with relationship troubles, J has always had mental health issues - anxiety, depression, etc. In all of her social circles (this friend group and people at her school), people have decided to gang up against her this year, and she has lost a great amount of friends. She tells me I am one of the only friends she has left, which makes me feel guilty for wanting to cut her off, at least for a while.\n\nJ makes me feel bad for still hanging out with our old mutual friends; in fact, she has always been extremely jealous and makes me feel guilty whenever I hang out with anyone that's not her when I'm in town. She asks me \"how I could still want to be friends with\" these people, but I've known some of them longer than I've known her! I used to cut out every friend that she had a talking out with, but after reflecting, I really regret it - I don't think I should have to cut someone out of my life just because J doesn't get along with them. Sometimes, she re-friends these people and then I have to decide if I should become their friend again too or not.\n\nMy main issue with all of her social issues that have been going on is that I don't live here anymore! I have an entirely different, new life in a different state and I really enjoy it. It doesn't make sense for me to still be this close and involved with someone who lives over 1000 miles away. I don't wanna get involved in her drama because it honestly doesn't concern me.\n\nJ has also rubbed me the wrong way occasionally throughout our friendship - constantly bringing up issues that are very sensitive or things she knows I am very insecure about. I have always had to pay for her - meals, groceries her mom needs, clothes that she either \"borrows\" from me or insists on making me buy for her because \"her mom is broke\" or something. I understand that money is tight in her family and its not my place to judge how other people manage their finances, but if she needs new clothes so bad, i'm sure her mom could find the money or they could get her secondhand stuff. \n\nI've always had a car and driven her everywhere we go together and I constantly picked her up from appointments, school, friends houses, etc. I was happy to do it but always having to give her a ride on top of always having to pay for her because she \"had no money\" or \"forgot\" her wallet puts the car thing over the top for me. \n\nI think the icing on the cake was when she compared her most recent serious relationship, which lasted a month or two (I was out of the state so I barely knew what was going on) to my relationship that lasted 1.5 years and involved long distance dating and my ex boyfriend moving from our home to this new state to be with me. My relationship ended 8 months ago, but I'm still transitioning out of it and she knows how upset the breakup made me. The way she implied these two relationships were the same was like a slap in the face - not to mention that hers was between two 15 year olds and mine involved me from ages 17-19 and him from 16-18. \n\nWIBTA for cutting her out of my life? I feel like she's asking an awful lot from me to be her friend and keep supporting her when I live so far away and have my own life to attend to.",

I ask her if it's still happening and she says no, it stopped about 20 minutes ago. I asked if she thought it might be heart palpitations and she gets upset with me and says \"just tell me if you can take me to the hospital or not\". I tell her I can't (she doesn't wait for my explanation, says bye and hangs up). She texts me and says her mom is taking her. I tell her I'm sorry that I came off like an ass on the phone, and I ask if she could please keep me updated on on how she is. She replies \"nah\", so I don't really know if she is ok or not. The thing is, normally I would drop everything and take my loved one to the ER, but this sister has a habit of doing this (gets weird pain, goes to ER, she's dehydrated or something) every few months. I'm currently trying to set boundaries with her because she has a history of bossing me around and I usually just do what she says. She doesn't have health insurance right now and I wanted to make sure it was really necessary for her to go to the ER. Now I feel terrible and I'm super worried about her.

      "description": "My ex-girlfriend and I broke up because of no common interests, I didn't like making plans with her, having one of my interests come up, and then I was having to miss out on those.  Which happened more then I would like.  I felt she tried to monopolize my time which took away from my interests/hobbies.  So I broke up with her stating that its because we have no interests together.  After a while, she came back to me and said that she understood and that she would no longer monopolize my time and would let me have my free space to do my interests.  I told her that if you want to get back together with me, whenever my hobbies or interests come up that whatever plan we had beforehand will become void and I will prioritize them guilt free.  I tried to tell her that this is a bad idea for her and she shouldn't agree to these terms because after a while you will resent me for picking my interests over you.  She still agreed to the terms even after I very clearly and bluntly stating them.  Then it happened, we had plans, and one of my interests came up, so I baled and did my thing.  Then it happened again...and again, with me still doing my thing.  My roommates believe that I am an asshole for doing precisely what I said I was going to do because it still hurts her and they know this because she still complains about it from time to time.  They think I am abusing the terms and using as a pass to do whatever I want whenever I want and that even though she agreed to those terms, I shouldn't treat her like that.  I told them that I respect peoples free will of choice even if it's not in the best interest of themselves, that I am not responsible for the actions of others and it would be arrogant to assume that she isn't happy even if she does complain about it every now and then.",

      "description": "Some time ago I met this guy whom i dated once and it was weird right from the beginning.\n\nHe didn't wanted to talk about anything. Just sitting and \"feeling\" the presence of the other, which made me feel uncomfortable. And he wanted to decide on everthing, like my drink or my menu.  \nAfter we had dinner, we went to a bar (I'm really bad at turning down people because I have a big issue with standing up for my self and thus ending up in some bad situations).  \nOn the way there he tried to kiss me and I could avoid it somehow. He pretended nothing has happend. I felt so uncomfortable but didn't know what to do.  \nHe always said things like \"If you would be my girlfriend you wouldn't have to worry about anything because I would take care of everything.\" and stuff like that.  \nAfter one drink I thanked him for the evening and rushed to my car to avoid him trying to say good night \"properly\".  \nHe messaged me and told me how much he enjoyed the date and apologized for his brash behavior. I told him that I felt uncomfortable at our date and don't want to see him again.  \nHe was surprisingly understanding and tried to explain himself and seemed to be a weird mix of being a bit pushy and insecure. Seeing him as an insecure person, such as myself hit a soft spot and I didn't break up the contact but I did make very clear that there wouldn't be a future for us as a couple. Maybe some small talk friends. Nothing close but some contact now and then. He agreed.\n\nAfter that, he started texting me every day telling me about problems at his work and just kind of small talk stuff. I figured he had no one to talk to and to be honest, I felt sorry for him and thus answered his messages and listend to him.  \nBut over time he started to say things like \"if you would be my girlfriend...\" again, which I immediatly stopped. He became jealous and acted passiv/aggressiv if I wouldn't answer his messages quick enough. He even tried to give me expensive gifts, which I always turned down.  \nIt became to much and I ended our \"friendship\".  \nHe was really angry and wrote a lot of messages, which I tried to ignore and hoped he would calm down. But then he wrote that he would sometimes think of me as \"the future mother of his child\" and that he loved me and thought I would come to senses over time by realizing what a great and generous person he is and that he would turn his whole life around me but I'm nothing more than a waste and deserve nothing but hardships and if he could, he would try his best to make my life harder and let me suffer for what I did to him.\n\nI was devastated.

      "description": "Basically I just returned from a holiday with my parents when my sister announced that she is pregnant. I wish I could have been in a more congratulatory mood for her but I can't help feeling that she and her husband have yet to be financially stable for them to afford a newborn so soon after their marriage. My sister is, understandably, incredibly upset with my reaction and thinks I'm trying to be controlling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother has given my sister and her husband tens of thousands of dollars, despite being newly retired. This is from the time during their wedding, to the items in their current flat. For example, the air-conditioners in their flat all broke down due to it being an older flat and the AC units were a bit old. Now, in all the time that my sister and I lived together, she was not the sort who would ever go through a night without turning on the AC due to the humid climate we live in. But she suffered through it until my mother offered to foot the bill to renew all the ACs in their flat. This came up to some thousands. I offered this as an example to her when explaining that if she has trouble replacing the ACs, how could she afford to have a child? She insisted that she could have afforded to pay for the ACs herself, but since our mother offered, she took it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother is the sort of person whose money comes with emotional strings, i.e. when she and my sister have a fight, she would bring up all the times she has bailed my sister out financially. It's not a good thing, but that is who she is. So, we all know that my mother has been consistently giving her money e.g., buying for her stuff for their flat (e.g. a new bed, bathroom fixtures, etc), and also recently giving her a few thousands to settle her credit card debts. To me, these are all red flags that my sister is not in a financially stable place. She earns more than her husband, in fact, her husband can sort of be considered  low-income worker. However, my sister spends a considerable amount of her salary on her daily commute to work. She's been trying to get a transfer to a nearer location where she wouldn't have to spend 2 hours on public transport each direction from her home to her workplace, but it's not been working out so well. She takes a daily hitch ride both ways to save on time, but it all adds up to a major chunk of her salary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all this in mind, I was not optimistic about her financial position. My mother is just recently retired, and she is still receiving some back-pay owed to her from the time she was working, but not for much longer. My dad is set to retire this year. I am not keen on both of them consistently giving her handouts due to their own financial positions, even though I am sure they will. With both of them retired, I will be the one who will be helping support them financially. I am not married but I am also saving up to buy my own home in a few years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs such, I told my sister that it might be wiser for her and her husband to wait a little while longer to get their footing and save a little bit more before having a kid. She found my response very cruel and is very upset with me. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Just to preface, I am in high school and was the co host of a relatively large charity event that will be a part of this story. The way we make our money is we charge 7 dollars for dinner and show. So quite a while ago, I was in a dance group that was interested in auditioning for the event I was also co hosting. Coincidentally, another student group from another school was also interested in doing the same song as we did. Their group also had a co host of the event( let’s call her Lisa), and so almost immediately there was conflict. Looking at the audition videos, most of the other co hosts all agreed our audition was subjectively better.  Lisa began texting me about possibly combining our acts, to which I replied no. She then asked the possibility of having both of us perform, to which I hard vetoed. She began going off, calling me petty and unreasonable, as well as spreading shit about our group and our members (which had nothing to do with the argument). Finally after a long time, i said that I wasn’t willing to charge people 7 dollars, and feared we would lose our reputation. So big question, AITA?",

He went on to asked me about specs and size of the monitor and how he was going to sell it off after I gave it to him. After he made that comment, I felt slightly upset that he would just sell off something I gave him for free. However, I shrugged it off and moved on. Just a few minutes ago, he asked me to get him a box and bags specially to cover the monitor and he demanded that there would be no scratches or damage to screen when he received it. It pissed me off quite a bit as I’m giving away the monitor for free. Would I be the asshole if I told him off that I wasn’t too happy about him being so picky?

Perfectly fine, and I've never had any real problems with anyone.\n\nMaybe six months ago, a gentleman with special needs moved in across the street from me. His services, from what I can gather, include a caretaker and door-to-door assistance from our local public transport. Whenever he is picked up by the public transport, he and his caretaker will sit outside waiting for the bus, and he will shout whatever seems to be going through his head. They will wait outside for up to an hour (I am assuming so that the bus driver will know where to pick him up), with this gentleman just happily shouting along at a volume that I can still hear even with all my windows and doors closed.\n\nI don't want to be rude, but I have been woken up before my early morning alarm, and I've also been kept up late because of this. I work early hours, and I'm not a great sleeper at the best of times, so I would like to gently ask the man's caretaker if they could possibly try to wait inside the man's apartment a little longer.

      "description": "Throwaway because people I know are aware of what my main account's username is.\n\nI (M20) am a college student, and I go to school out of state - my family live a couple states away, about 2 hours by flight and about 12 hours by car. My little sister (F18) has applied to a couple different schools, and her dream school was the one I attend, but she was rejected this week from the school and has to start looking elsewhere. She and my dad (M55) and mom (F53) have been talking about visiting schools sometime this month.\n\nThis afternoon I missed a call from my dad, who left a voicemail just asking him to call him back. I did, and my dad started asking me about when my classes for the week ended and what days off I had next month. I told him but cautioned that I frequently have plans with my friends on the weekend, and I overheard him over the phone telling my little sister to \"look up available dates\". I asked him point blank what was going on, and he told me that my little sister, he, and my mother were going to go to some of the schools that my little sister had been accepted to, and they wanted me to fly home to watch the dog and house sit for possibly multiple weekends next month.\n\nI was a little incredulous at this - my twin brother (M20) is at college at a school much closer than me and regularly visits home for the weekends, something that I rarely have the luxury to do. My family also knows many people with whom our dog is quite friendly, so it's not like they \\*need\\* me around. The dog has some medical issues and will get very stressed if he is separated from his family, however, but we have gone on extended trips without him several times without significant issues.\n\nI told my dad this, and he said that he wanted me to dog-sit, and would pay for me to fly home. I felt really uncomfortable with this (a plane ticket would be something like $300, and the cost of getting a friend to dog-sit would be far less, or even free if my brother was available, though my father is well enough off that finances are not a significant obstacle for him). He asked me when I would be available for the weekend, and I told him point blank that I simply did not want to do it. I often go out and do things with my friends on the weekends, and I thought that it was a waste of my time and his money to send me home just to dog sit. I am not home sick or anything, and the thought of flying home to an empty house for a weekend is not something I enjoy.\n\nHe accepted it, we talked for a little bit more, and then we ended the conversation. A few minutes later, he called me back, and said that he was quite angry at me for saying no.\n\nHe said that he was only asking a favor of me, and that he had spent the past twenty years doing favors for me (including paying for my college, plane tickets home for winter/spring break), and that he felt offended that I had declined to do this favor for him, and that he did not like that I had declined without giving him specifics with regard to availability. I told him that I appreciated all of the favors that he had done for me throughout the years, but I did not feel comfortable doing this for him as I did not think it was a smart move on either his part or my part. I apologized for offending him. He did not ask me again to come home and dog sit, and I did not offer. We ended the conversation again, but I got the impression that he was still angry.\n\nAm I the Asshole? Even if my dad has no issue spending that money for a plane ticket home, I did not want to go home to an empty house and a dog for a weekend, and I thought that it was unreasonable of him to expect that of me.",

      "description": "I normally and by normally I mean in 99.9% of all cases when I shower close the lid on my bodywash and shampoo. This morning when I woke up I went in the bathroom and saw that my bodywash was open, which was a little concerning. There are two other people who live in the house, and only one of them was in at the time so I asked him \n\n&gt;\"Hey my bodywash was open this morning any idea about what's up?\" \n\nto which he replied \n&gt;\"Sorry man I wouldn't know I don't even shower here I shower at work\"\n\nCue \"that's kind of messed up, thanks man\" from me.\n\nI took out the garbage and when I got back my OTHER housemate had just walked in so I asked him the same question\n\n&gt;\"Hey man my bodywash was open this morning and I don't remember not closing it any idea about it?\"\n\nTo which he replied\n\n&gt;\"Nope\"\n\nAnd promptly walked up the stairs to his room. As he was walking up I followed him to go to the bathroom and called out after him \n\n&gt;\"Yo it's kind of fucked up man\"\n\nAfter hearing this he stormed out of his room, threw open my bedroom door (I was in the bathroom with the door open) then turned and walked right up to my face and started screaming that he and the girl he brought home last night had showered together and brought their own soap. I honestly don't remember exactly what was said because I was so focused on holding his screaming face away from me.\n\nI feel very uneasy and unsafe now. This is the first time he's lost his temper like this but he's gotten very angry about things I've done in the past (such as leave dishes in the sink). Thankfully we resolved that peacefully with a group discussion and decided that as a house rule we would not leave dishes in the sink to which I've been doing my best to follow. I'm the only one who actually cooks in the house so this rule is really just a reminder for me to be cleanly. \n\nAITA? I was annoyed that he just brushed off my question to him with no explanation or detail and my very last comment obviously set him off. ",

I have a friend who I've known since summer of last year, and when he comes over to my house he likes to use my computer. I'm OCD about contamination (mostly things being greasy, sticky, slimy, etc.) And his hands are slightly greasy, so every time I use the computer after him I have to clean the keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. Before this week, he had only ever been over on weekends, and Sunday of this week he wanted to use the computer to play games, which I said no to because the next morning I had to important school related things on it, and couldn't waste time cleaning everything. After I told him this, he started arguing non stop for the next 10 minutes, and even after explaining to him for the tenth time that I have OCD he refused to acknowledge it. After about 5 more minutes of arguing I said he could play the game with one of my xbox controllers to minimize the amount of grease that got on the keyboard and mouse, and he said that was fine. Then I go to the bathroom and come back and he is playing on the keyboard and mouse, controller completely untouched. I then confront him about it, and he brushes it off and ignores it, then stays over that night continuing to play the thing.\nFast forward to the next day I wake up and hes still on it playing the same game, and he continues to play for the entire day, not getting me get on to do my work for school. Later that night I eventually told him to fuck off and let me on the thing, and he did, but I dont know if it was the right thing to do.\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for a driving lesson after a car switch?",
      "description": "  \n\nI’m learning to drive in the UK, I’ve had about ten hours, and I’m at a point where I stall maybe once in a two hour lesson, but I still make quite a few mistakes, but I’m not going to act like I’m a great driver, I’m just careful and slow. I had to cancel a week due to other business I had to do, so I had a gap week. He messages me saying if we are still on for Tuesday, I respond yeah. When the time comes he messages me 10 mins before the lesson start that he had to change out cars because a part of it is broken. Not really happy, as changing cars means I’ll have to spend some time getting used to the car (he told me a few weeks ago he is getting a new vehicle as his current one is on the end of it’s life), which will put me back a bit. Especially since I will have to learn this car, just to go back to the other one next week, then to another one in two weeks.\n\nI’ve only driven his old car before, so everything is in a new place. The handbrake doesn’t go down very far, the gearstick is at an angle which makes it look like it’s in gear 3 when it is actually in neutral, and the seat/wheel location is different, so It is harder to adjust to a good position. I know when I start driving for myself, I’ll have to get used to another car, so I wasn’t too annoyed.\n\nThe real problem is when I go to start it. He tells me it’s a diesel so I’ll have to do some things differently, I can’t feel the breaking point on the clutch, I can only just about hear the difference in the engine. I try to get the breaking point, put on some gas, I do my mirror check, release the handbrake and the car starts zooming forward, with him stopping uncomfortably close to another car. He reverses, I try again, same thing happens but I turn so I just continue. Normally in his other car I do the same thing, and the car doesn’t move until I lift the clutch up.\n\nI drive around the block twice, the whole time saying I don’t like this car at all. Driving around in gear 1 feels different, I let go of the accelerator and the car doesn’t seem to slow down in the slightest, I try to do some break, and the car barley cares. It’s like instead of having to do a lot of acceleration, and a little brake, I now have to do a little of acceleration and a lot of brake. It’s like even though the car isn’t much bigger than the other one, it’s feels like I’m driving a much bigger, more powerful one. At one point he shouted for me to take my foot off the accelerator when a car was approaching, when in fact my foot was on the break, applying as much break as I’d do in the other car to slow down.\n\nAfter we stop he says he’ll have to charge for an hour (Originally a two hour session, and we drove for 10-20 minutes, only because he kept insisting that I’d get used to it), I argue that if he knew his car had broken down on Monday and didn’t tell be until 10 minutes before the lesson (it was Tuesday, and I assume it was the previous Monday as otherwise he would have said yesterday), there was no point having to learn how to drive another car when I’d be back in the other one next week, then in a new one in a few more weeks (It felt like I’m back where I started in my first lesson), and that It’s unfair to expect a learner to go from petrol to diesel for two hours then back.\n\nHe caves, says he’s going to file a complaint with the car replacement company as apparently, I’m not the only one, and having this diesel car is costing him his business. I feel bad, because it would be costing him money, but at the same time, driving isn’t cheap, and it felt like he was trying to take advantage of me. He knew I wasn’t happy about having to change from his old petrol car to his new petrol car, and it felt like he didn’t tell me until 10 minutes before the lesson so I wouldn’t have time to say something about it (not even mentioning that it was a diesel car until I got in as well), then tried to convince me that It’s not that bad. It’d probably be easier if I started with it, as it seems like swapping gear changing is easier, but not easier when I have to relearn the car then swap back next lesson. ",

This year we decided to go see Mary Poppins Returns. I decided to be nice and I bought the tickets for everyone who wanted to go. We get to the Theatre and everyone is pretty excited. I’m sitting next to my mom and the aisle because the theatre was packed.\n\nI loved the movie right away and was into it the whole time but every time I would look at my mom she looked so bored. I didn’t really think anything of it till halfway through when I hear this loud crunching noise. I look over and she is chomping her ice extremely loud. I whisper to her if she is really doing that and she says “I need some way to stay awake during this boring movie”. I was never bored so I decided to ignore her but she kept doing it. At this point I was getting annoyed because everyone else around us didn’t deserve this. She then made a snoring noise and I was so embarrassed.\n\nThe movie eventually ended and I thought it was great. Everyone else in my family did as well. We leave the theatre and in the car home my mom decides that she should give me a lecture about my “rude” behavior.\n\nNow I’m an adult so I stood up for myself and said that her behavior was not appropriate for a quiet movie theatre. She didn’t like that and gave me a lecture about how I need to respect her more and how she’s my mom so I need to listen to her.\n\nMy question is AITA? Was her behavior actually okay?",

She has also one by one decided she hates me and my other 2 roommates and now we rarely see him unless she's busy. I remember months ago when he happily told me he took her virginity and they're all of a sudden into a bunch of kinky sex and shit, and he's super in love with her, and she will give him head like twice a day all the time.\n\nToday my friend Jack, who lives in another apartment told me about his roommate, Matt, who is Dan's girlfriend's ex. He said that she alienated him from his friends, and they had sex all the time, and the relationship ended when she cheated on him.\n\nI told him the night I heard this, because my conscience would't let me just sit on that when he didn't know. So I brought him into a side room and let him know everything I heard, and that I wasn't accusing her of anything, but telling him exactly what I heard from her ex and he can make a judgement. He thanked me and seemed really appreciative and said \"Thank you, I don't want to date a liar\". And I reassured him that I would find more out before he goes doing anything.\n\nHe ran downstairs to talk to her, they started arguing, and 30 minutes later I get a text. \"Don't interfere with our relationship. It's none of your business.\" And something along the lines of \"Why are you trying to hurt our relationship\".\n\nAt the top of the stairs he said \"I don't want to date a liar\" and at the bottom of the stairs he said \"Why are you trying to interfere in our relationship\". ???\n\nAm I an asshole for telling him this? Or is my suspicion that she's manipulating him valid? This is just really bothering me. Also, was it in my right to tell him?",

I’m also not interested in contracting herpes, HSV1 nor HSV2. I have been having protected sex since I started being sexually active, and I get tested very often so I know that I don’t carry the virus. Even though some STDs test don’t test for herpes, I still get a herpes test done on top of it. I know lots of people have it, but I don’t want to have it, orally nor genital. Unprotected sex is something I look forward in a long term relationship. \n\nSo, AITA for being straightforward and asking that during a first date? And is there a better way for me to ask those questions?",

      "description": "I recently moved counties and started looking for jobs straight away. I got my first interview about a week after I handed my resume in. It was for a position at a local grocery store in the bakery. It went really well and I started training the next day. Within two days I was pretty much fully trained, fully integrated into the stores system, and getting along really well with my other employees. I received the contract and made sure to read through it thoroughly, because I’ve been caught out before in clauses that I didn’t read and came back to bite me in the ass. What I read was pretty ridiculous to me. \n\nHidden through the usual mumbo-jumbo was a wage that was lower than my countries standard minimum wage,  Saturday and Sunday permanent shifts which started at 6am and finished at 4pm, with no flexibility on changing the shifts, no weekend penalty rates and a ban on requesting any time off during the holiday period (I understand that last one is pretty normal, but still kinda stupid for a big grocery chain with hundreds of employees, to me, anyways) I almost signed away every single one of my Saturdays and Sundays for a below minimum wage job, with no penalties and no flexibility whatsoever in changing the shifts at all. \n\nI asked my boss if there was any way this could be changed. Whether there was a possibility of me working one day during the weekend and one day during the week, (I knew for a fact that they were also hiring two other employees for the bakery so I didn’t see an issue in one of them working the one day and I worked the other) He said there was no flexibility in changing the hours and I alone had to work both shifts, also he stated that there was absolutely no chance of penalty rates or a higher pay and stated that I had accepted these terms in the interview (which I absolutely did not, no sane person would)*\n\nI refused to sign the contract without better incentive to give up my weekends and time with family and friends, and the boss fired me on the spot and called me a liar. \n\nAITA? I’m about 99% sure I’m not, but I’m still feeling guilty about it. \n\n*During the interview he asked if I was available to work weekends, which I said yes. He did not state in any way that I would be working weekends alone, without weekend penalty rates, with no chance of any other shifts at all. ",

      "description": "This is a past incident but I am curious what you all think about it. This is high school.\n\nSo I was very much a quiet follower type raised in an upper middle class family. I had two best friends, queen bees who I will call S and L. L is in the same economic bracket but stingy. She rarely paid for anything. S was lower middle class bordering poor. She didn't have a lot of funds to spend. \n\nNow every week there was a multicultural food event where we had a large variety of desserts, food and etc. I usually pitched in for buying food since I like food and it had cheap multi food deals. \n\nBut this time I wanted to save money. I had no plans to really buy anything. I tell S this and she blows up. Saying I owed her for all the times she shared her lunch box cheese with me when we walked home. \n\nIncidentally she said she didn't like it and she had to finish her lunch boxes or her parents would yell at her. So it wasn't taking food from her but giving me the discards while she ate the crackers and meat part of this premade food.  \n\nI yelled back this and how I didn't owe her anything. I stomped off and she proceeded to not be friends with me anymore. My other friend, L, told me I should just apologize to keep the peace and that I should have paid since it wasn't a big deal. \n\nI felt used though and like S took me for granted at that moment. So I didn't apologize. But because of L's words and the fact I do think S would have forgave me if I apologized. If I simply bought the food for S....\n\nAITA for not buying S that food and yelling back at her? Bonus question. Should I have apologized to her?",

      "description": "Throwaway of course.\n\nSo the Title already makes everyone say run away but there are some weird circumstances.\n\nWe have a long-distance relationship, about a 4 hour drive. Hard or impossible to be  spontaneous with our Jobs. She has mental health problems, she can't even leave her apartment alone to get groceries. If she's feeling lonely she gets depressed.\n\nShe absolutely loves me, she doesn't touch him. He's just in her life to help her getting groceries, driving her around and so she doesn't feel lonely as long as I'm not there. \n\nShe knows he still has feelings for her and she always has to deny him if he wants to make a move. But she still invites him to watch movies together but he never sleeps over. I absolutely trust her but it feels horrible. If I'm around she absolutely ignores him and is out of her life. But as soon as I'm gone she starts getting depressed and calls him. And when he's there she turns off her phone so she \"doesn't hurt him when another guy is calling.\"\n\nNow she has zero friends, Family isn't there for her. He's the only contact she has besides me and she says it's just to not feel lonely. She literally wouldn't leave her apartment for days without him. And I cannot be there for her everyday because of the distance. \n\nThey were together for 8 years. And we're together for one year with him almost always present somehow but there's nothing happening between them. She treats him like a friend, nothing more. It still feels all wrong for me and everyone told me to let go. What makes me stay is she straight up tells him she has no feelings for him and she tells him we're together and are sleeping together, which he doesn't seem to care about. So the situation is very clear here. I also talked with him about it and he confirmed this, which he had no reason to if he wants to get rid of me. But he still thinks they're getting back together and is badmouthing me whenever possible. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to meet him? Which ultimately means she is \"alone\", I'm talking to her on the phone for hours every day, working overtime to meet her as much as possible, I see her 3-4 days a week. but that doesn't seem to be enough. I planned to move in together and leave my family behind but it stings and I'm not convinced she stops seeing him. I can't help her getting groceries or getting to leave her apartment. But I also told her she doesn't need an ex, she needs a caregiver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Depressed long-distance GF meets her Ex because it's her only contact in life and otherwise wouldn't leave her apartment for days. I'm there whenever possible, minimum 3 days/week. I want her to cut contact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n",

      "description": "For context: So at work we have a policy, if something is in the lost and found for longer than a month than the person who found the item can keep it. I'd say a solid 90% of the time the lost and found is client stuff, but there is the odd occasion an employee's item gets in there. I'm the IT guy and I have someone who works under me.\n\nWe have a receptionist who was on mat leave and took 8 weeks off. During this time the guy who works under me found a power bank (Anker PowerCore 2680) which is not a cheap one either ($65). He was giddy about finding it and was all about it. So I said, sure if no one shows up to claim it in a month you can have it.\n\nWell no one does, so I let him have it. Then 3 weeks later the receptionist returns from mat leave. She asks about the power bank and says she was looking for it and couldn't find it. Gave the right model and all that and showed me the Amazon receipt so I knew it was legit. Thing is though, I told the employee he could have it. So I tell her this and the policy is clear. Still, she gets all weepy, and maybe it's pregnancy hormones, maybe it's more. I guess I felt bad so I told her I would see what I could do.\n\nI tell all of this to my employee and he is furious. He tells me he waited the month and followed the rules, and tells me that the power bank is his. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I ultimately decide that since she was the original owner and she couldn't claim it earlier due to being out of the office, I make an exception and take back the power bank and give it to her.\n\nNow he's pouting around. I understand it sucks. He didn't do anything wrong and this has never happened. I'm going to amend the policy with HR to better define that if it's an employee item then it goes back to the original owner. So we won't have a squabble like this. Still, I have caught myself asking myself if I was the asshole here. This was a lose-lose situation in my opinion regardless as someone was going to walk away dissapointed.",

      "description": " Yesterday I  started a new course at university. Another woman in my class, whom I  don't really like, picked the same class. The reason I don't like her is  that I have friends who work at our uni department and I know that  she's treated them very badly, however I don't have a personal issue  with her and we've never had any conflict between us directly.  I've  never said anything rude to her and vice versa.\n\nAnyway,  this woman recognised me and sat next to me during our first class. I  answered her questions but I didn't really do anything to drive the  conversation forward. While the teacher was talking she would also  continously poke me to ask what he said/meant etc., which I found  annoying because I get very distracted by stuff like that. So eventually  I just started saying \"I don't know\" to everything. During the breaks  I'd also leave the classroom without talking to her. Later during class  she asked for my number so she could ask me questions if she didn't  understand something and I kinda just diverted from the subject, since I  didn't want to give her my number. About 30 minutes later she puts her  phone in front of me for me to write my number. I still didn't want to  but I also didn't want to outright refuse, so I gave her my number and  then looked at the front (because the teacher was talking.)\n\nDidn't  think much of it but today before class this woman confronted me for  \"how I was behaving.\" She said she was upset that I hadn't helped her  during class and that she felt like I didn't want to give her my phone  number. She had seen on my computer screen that I had written down  things that I'd told her that I didn't know.. She said that I  have a very \"hard personality\" and that I'm someone who picks and  chooses who I want to help and be friends with. Honestly I got pretty  suprised by all this because I kinda expected her to take the hint  and leave me alone. Now I'm thinking that maybe I'm just a very  insensitive person. I know I can come off as pretty cold and that I  don't smile very often when I'm talking to someone I'm not interested  in. I'm also a very introverted person so sometimes I might  underestimate how important social interaction is for others.\n\nI'm not sure whether I should apologise or not (partly because I don't want there to be an hostile enviroment in our classroom.) When she confronted me I basically just said \"okay\", which I realize can be seen as kinda nonchalant.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "About 6 months ago I 22M) met and started dating my girlfriend (21F). Sadly its a long distance relationship, about 6 hour plane ride away from each other, but we make it work and I even visited her once. I work full time and she's unemployed, she also demands a lot of attention, which im usually okay with but sometimes it can get on my nerves a bit. She will throw tantrums and get mad at me for being with my friends or my family for a few hours during a day off.  I love spending time with her, and when given the option that's always what I would rather do, but sometimes i want to do other things and it makes her so mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has diagnosed depression and social anxiety, a history of being used and betrayed by her friends, and a family who, while not being that terrible, dont really support her in her issues. For all these reasons I always try to be patient and understandable to her, she's just really attached to me it's fine right? But sometimes all this attachment gets to me, because its almost a crime and a proof of \"unlove\" spending time with people that arent her, even if its just a few hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast time this happened was today. It's my two days off, so as usual I planned to spend it with her. My family (who I also dont spend a lot of time with) wanted to watch a movie in theaters, (I work at a movie theater so I have free tickets every week) so they asked me if I could arrange something. I thought \"sure no problem, couple hours with my family is no big deal\", boy was I wrong. As soon as I told her, her first reaction was to go completely silent on me, it was like talking to a wall, which is extremely ironic coming from her, considering she hates being ignored and if i take more than 5 minutes to asnwer a text, or dont answer a question during a voice call (usually because something is loud and i didnt hear it) she will get super mad and assume im ignoring her. After about an hour of me trying to apologize for spending some time with my family, saying that I would rather be with her and all other kinds of excuses, i cracked and said something like \"why is it that no matter how much time I spend with you, its never enough?\", she just hung up on me. I know it was probably a mean thing to say but this argument happens so often, I just get so mad/sad and this time i just blew up. The argument continued on message but not much different. Me asking why is it that spending all my free time before/after work and my lunch break with her isnt enough, and her saying \"Im sorry I want to spend time with my boyfriend\" and complaining that some of the time we spend together is sleeping, or \"Im sorry for feeling sad, ill just feel nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i dont know, maybe im being unreasonable and i should be more understanding of her issues, maybe she's the one being unreasonable.

      "description": "Long story short: I have body insecurities. I am currently working on those by working out. I asked my husband to give me an incentive. \n\nHe told me that he would pay for me to get a tattoo if I worked out long enough. I asked him how long, and he told me as soon as I'm comfortable enough to wear a bikini to the beach, then he would pay for the tattoo. \n\nI agreed, but asked if I could wear a pair of short shorts or a mini skirt to cover the horrendous razor bumps I get when I shave. I am extremely sensitive. I can't wax, I can't use Nair (they burn my skin), so I'm stuck with shaving. I've tried all of the tricks, believe me. Nothing helps. \n\nHe said no. I either go out with nothing but a bikini on, or get nothing for a reward. I don't think this is ok. He is willing to humiliate me in front of thousands of people just so he gets the satisfaction of finally dragging me out in a bikini (a long standing issue that he has wanted resolved) and refuses to compromise. \n\nI am willing to show off my stretch marks, my imperfect skin, and all of my other insecurities, except the razor bumps...which look absolutely terrible. He won't budge. His reason? I shouldn't give a damn about what people think. He doesn't, so why do I? I have changed my personality a lot for my huaband through this marriage, but this is the line I refuse to cross. I am not willing to humiliate myself, make myself so insecure I cry, and force myself back into a depression just because I want my reward. \n\nHe thinks I'm being ridiculous and should just get over it if I want my reward. I think he is trying to put too much on me along with his refusal to my small compromise. \n\nAITA for not wanting to go past the boundary of my comfort zone for a reward he's willing to give me in trade?",

She insisted I took her 45inch TV that he hadnt been using for years and bought 8 years ago. I kindly rejected the offer several times knowing I wouldn't use it as I never watch tv/movies but shes the type that doesn't take no for an answer so eventually I moved it into my house. About 1 month later we broke up and broke off any contact we had with each other. Fast forward 4 months and she randomly texted me one night asking if she could pick up her TV the following day to which I told her I gave away to someone online who would actually use it. She was surprised and proceeded to claim that I owe her $1200 for the TV(the price she bought it for 8 years ago). I told her that the tv was worth no more than $100 and that she shouldn't be surprised I gave it to someone else because I told her I would never use it and she basically forced me to take it from her in the first place. \n\nTLDR; ex gf of 3 months texts me 4 months after break up to get back her TV that she forcibly gifted to me.

I wanted to spam him by calling him a hacker but I got blocked. I told my second friend group about it and everyone was fine with it except for 2 people. They got mad at me saying he's just a boy and it's just a minecraft server and all that. They called me a huge asshole for doing this. However I feel that what he did was wrong, not just that it's a minecraft server but intention of hacking and ruining something. I would've been mad even if it was my email or facebook but I feel like because it is minecraft they take it less seriously. He did something wrong and deserves these consequences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\n(I am not looking for validation but want to know if what I did was wrong)",

We both decided that this isn’t going to happen again and didn’t mean anything for either of us and that we shouldn’t tell people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn comes my girlfriend, a wonderful girl who I met over Bumble in the beginning of last summer, we can call her Sophia. Sophia and Alice met each other a couple of times, mainly at some beach-parties and such. My girlfriend thought something was going on between me and Alice, which I denied since we (me and Alice) had agreed to not talk about it and I didn’t know where it was going with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSophia couldn’t really let go of the feeling that me and Alice “had something” so sometimes she brought it up and I kept denying it. I started to feel that I wanted to be 100% honest with Sophia as our relationship became boyfriend-girlfriend and I felt that I could trust her, so I decided to tell her. This was about 2 months after we met (so the end of the summer -18).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her that me and Alice had sex, it happened once, didn’t mean anything. She got really upset (understandably) and left. I gave her some time but eventually we met up and she told me she got really hurt that I had lied to her. We decided to keep the relationship going but since then it has been unsteady and Sophia still uses “the lie” and says she can’t trust me, demands to know exactly everything if I run into Alice (small town), what we talk about and so on. And reluctantly let me meet up with my friends if Alice is with them. Makes me feel like the AH.\n\n**TL;DR Didn’t disclose to my girlfriend in the beginning of our relation that me and my friend had sex over a year ago.**",

I wouldn't know how to word it well enough, given the context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so basically two weeks ago, this girl (18F)  and I (19M)  broke up after almost a year of being together. She said that there could be a future for us, but for now she needed time to herself. Understandable. I respected it. We talked for a few days checking on each other and then took a break for the next few days until we were ready to talk as friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time frame, she started to act super weird. Sending multiple messages when I wasn't responding, sending hearts on occasion, sending me memes constantly. I usually would say goodnight every night. For 2 days, I went radio silent because I just didn't want to overwhelm either of us. The 2nd day of this radio silence was valentine's day. So she sent me \"Just wanted to say happy valentines day!\" which threw me off completely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these signs were giving me false hope that we were gonna get back together, or at least that she was considering it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I was visiting home from school, so we decide to meet up at our usual spot where I'd pick her up from her school to give each other our things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's why I got mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about a week of fucking with my head, giving me mixed signals, she walks up to my car with her friend, barely gets in, she's got one leg in and one leg out, says, \"how are you doing? because I know I'M doing well.\" And here's where I start to feel guilty for being mad. She told me that the night before, her middle school band director passed away, and she loved they guy. He inspired her to want to be a band director as well. After that she asked me if I had anything else to say,  I told her we'd have to sit down somewhere and talk. She says \"ok\" and then leaves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more the conversation sat with me the more I got angry. But then she texted me that she was sorry she didn't say much because she was just super emotional, which I get. But I still can't help but be upset with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then I texted her saying I might need some more time before her and I can truly be friends. I just realized that I was more upset than I led on.\n\nTL;DR my ex gave me mixed signals only to disappoint me with the worst 5 minute meet up of my life.",

      "title": "AITA for slamming a car door a few times?",
      "description": "This happened three weeks ago, and was almost the final straw in a weakening friendship with a best friend. \n\nHim, another best friend that we made our freshman year, and I went on an adventure to a lake. He offered to drive us. His car is fairly old, and has definitely seen better days when its parts were newer. I am one to try to slam the car door, to ensure it is closed. He asked me to be more gentle with closing his car door and to not slam it. He said that I have apparently been told this before by him on one or two occasions. I honestly do not remember being told this, but I'll take his word for it. I brush it off and don't think too much of it.\n\nWe made a few extra stops before arriving at the lake. The second time we get out is where I mess up. I absent-mindedly slam his car door again, and I get called out. I apologize and tell him that I will try to be better about it. He asks how I would like it if he slammed my car door. I told him that I wouldn't care much as long as it didn't break anything.\n\nThe adventure continues, and it was fun. We get in and out of the car a few more times (~8), and I do make a conscious effort to try to be more gentle with closing his door. Finally, we arrive where I live, so he can drop me off. However, on the last time that we exit his car, I accidentally slam it. The friend doesn't say anything. Wr go up to my room to hang out for a bit. I open the door to my room, and my friend beeline for my desk. He starts opening and closing one of my desk drawers repeatedly with enough force to break it while looking at and smiling at me. I was in shock. It took a few seconds before I told him to stop and put my leg in front of the drawer to prevent him from opening it. My friend is bigger than me, and easily me out of the way, and continued breaking my drawer. He told me to ask him to stop. I did, and he kept going. I asked again, and he finally stopped after be had broke the drawer by ripping the front of it off, and then laughed at what he had done.\n\nI was furious at this point, and he told me that that is what I deserved for slamming his doors and that what I was doing was causing damage to it. I argued about how what I did paled in comparison to what he had just done. I said that what I was doing was causing either normal wear or slightly above normal wear. He told me to look up the how slamming car doors is bad for the car. The results I found leaned towards slamming being either neutral or does cause damage over time (which is about what I thought). He used the argument that intent has no impact on something, only the end result. I feel like what I did was out of instinct (albeit not a great one) and overall good intention (making sure the door was securely closed, rather than potentially open), whereas his intention to teach me a lesson felt out of spite and malice.\n\nIn the end, unless I was not told something, his car door works just as fine as before.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "We've been together for five years and lived together for the majority of the time. Two years ago though, for a year, we lived separately and in different states. Just over a year ago, we moved back in together after our bout of long distance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's never been very affectionate and it doesn't bother me usually. I've gotten used to it and not in a bad way that I'm bitter over it. Different people, different strokes. And he has always stayed up late most nights to play video games. He still always made it a point to come to bed with me at least once or twice a night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, since we've moved back in together, I have to beg for him to come to bed with me. Its been two weeks since he's come to bed with me. The past three nights I've talked to him about it about an hour before I go to bed, and he has agreed all three nights to come to bed with me, and then when midnight rolls around, he has something to do, or he just isn't tired enough to even think about going to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this morning, I tried to talk to him about it a little bit before we went into work, and he basically said I'm not taking into consideration his needs and wants. I feel like I am, by not complaining constantly that he doesn't come to bed with me. I feel like he's not taking into consideration what I want and need. So, Reddit, do I need to check myself and not be such an asshole about him coming to bed with me?",

      "description": "A few days ago, my girlfriend hosted a brunch day for her and her friends at our house. My girlfriend bought some food and wine so they could make a whole event out of it. \n\nI don't have a lot of spare money and so what I spend on food is usually all I have. Usually  what I buy, I have to make last until the next payday. Each meal is calculated and planned for my work lunches. \n\nAfter work I was at the gym and I receive a text from my girlfriend asking if she could cook some of my chicken breasts that I set aside for my lunches because her friends were hungry and specifically wanted the chicken. I replied with, \"I'd prefer if you didn't. Can you use the pork instead?\" She didn't like this response and proceeded to say \"No its fine, I told them you said no...thanks.\" Knowing my girlfriend and how she can be sometimes, I tried to call her and work through the issue. She was still mad and I was at the gym so I gave up. She kept calling me back and I did eventually realize that I had some extra chicken (a decent amount) in the freezer which I told her I forgot about and I would be more than happy to let her use it. This particular chicken was what she had wanted to use in the first place but I confused it with the chicken I set out for my lunches. \n\nThis still didn't make her happy and by the time I got home, our other roommate defrosted some of her own chicken so my girlfriend could use it. My girlfriends argument was that I should have not said no to begin with and should have just let her take it; she stated she would have given me money to buy more or gone out and bought more herself. This last statement was hard to believe as the next two proceeding days she works nights and wouldn't have time. She stated that if my friends came over she would give them whatever they wanted and tried to be a good host and person. \n\nRegardless I didn't feel as if I acted out of line asking if she could use the pork instead and once I realized my mistake I thought I corrected myself and gave her what she wanted. It all culminated with her saying I am inconsiderate, mean, and so forth. \n\nThanks for the read and help. ",

      "description": "So, my dad and my step mother broke up, after 8-9 years of dating and being together. I consider her my mother and will call her that going forward in this post. My father has had three major relationships (bio mom, step mom 1 (yuck), and mom. They all overlapped. \n\nWell my dad moved out of her house into his own house after they broke up. They mostly broke up because they were always fighting and her kids, my siblings, hated my dad. My dad was heartbroken and was using Tinder to get over her, which is fine because \"the fastest way to get over someone is to get under someone\". \n\nHowever, my dad and mom started hanging out again. He doesn't have his own car, so she drove him to get furniture and to grab groceries. She was trying to make his house into his own home, despite being broken up. \n\nEventually, they started comforting each other again. Which is fine, people get back together, whatever. **BUT** My dad was still sleeping with other people while sleeping with her. I tried to get him to tell her, but he told me it was none of my business and they had a rule that \"if they started to see other people, they wouldn't want to tell the other person\" \n\nI backed off a bit because he didn't want me involved and when he started introducing me to these women he would bring home, I just moved out. I cannot be around that. I told him he was the reason I moved out and I don't want to know anymore about his relationships. \n\nSo on Sunday, my dad calls me. He said that my mom showed up at his house with some of his photo albums from his childhood. He didn't answer the door, so she knocked on his window (one-story). He had the woman in his bedroom. \n\nBefore I continue this story, I need to tell you about this woman. She is literally crazy. She is a loud mewing chick in the bedroom and a fidgety person who forgets everything you tell her within 2 minutes. I moved out mostly due to this woman. Well a few days before I moved, my dad told me that he was never going to see her again and that she was threatening him and all that good, crazy stuff. Riiight. \n\n\nSo, when my dad called me, he left out who was in the bedroom. He said that he talked to mom and said that it was inappropriate for her to show up at his house. Granted, they had broken up. But they go everywhere together and kiss and tell each other they love each other. Basically a relationship. \n\nSo I have been helping my brother with his homework after school because I'm good at school stuff, and he tells me that it was the woman who was in the room. Immediately I was irritated. So my dad lied about how he was never going to see her again. MHM.\n\nSo before I had started helping my brother with homework he had taken a shower. I was doing some cleaning while I was waiting when my mom called me. She was calling to ask me to come to Thanksgiving, of course I said yes. I could tell she was crying so I told her I would be coming over after I helped my brother with an outline. \n\nI go over to my mom's house, and she is broken. Like my heart aches for her. I told her, that my dad had been doing this the entire time even though my father told her it was only the one time. That Saturday was the first time it had happened. I was done. My mom told me that, the one day my dad and I got into it (about him not telling my mother), that my dad told her that I had an issue with them being friends because I thought my mother was a bad person. My mom told me that their deal was, that if they ever wanted to go on a date they would tell each other, as to not string each other along. \n\nMy father has been lying. He has been manipulating what he would tell us individually.\n\nI had to give my mother a bath and hold her hair while she puked because she couldn't keep down food. I was there, crying with her about how this happened. Trying to convince her that she isn't nothing and how being sad isn't being weak. \n\nMy dad knows I told her and I've been screening his calls and texts. ",

      "description": "So here's the situation. A kid who I'm fairly familiar with at my old high school is autistic. I was always nice to him and we even joked around every now and then. \n\nI'm in study hall and he walks up and the first thing he says is \"move your hand\". I told him I wasn't gonna do that.\n\nHe slams his book as hard as he could onto my hand. I told him to stop that or I was gonna have to tell his teacher who usually walks around with him. I have a decent pain tolerance but it did have a bit of sting behind it.\n\nHe does it again but harder. I grab the book he was using to hit me with and lightly push it away and tell him I was going to get his teacher. He tries it again. I grab push it away a second time mid swing and as I'm going to get up to find his teacher some 7 foot tall football starts yelling at me across the room.\n\n\"Yo stop bullying him he has special needs!\"\n\n\"He was hitting me with his bo-\"\n\n\"I know what I saw stop messing with him or I'm gonna beat your ass!\"\n\nA teacher eventually defused the Guy, got both sides of our story, and made sure that the special needs kid was separated and that the football player and I would drop it.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't of pushed it away, but in no way was I forceful and I honestly didn't want to have to get the kid in trouble. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hey, I’ve been a long time reader on this sub and thought it’d be time to share my AITA story from last weekend. So, my sister is pregnant and due in a few weeks with a son. He and my brother in law are super happy for them. We live about two-three hours south of them (and my parents), so we don’t see them that often. They were supposed to all come down and see us last weekend, but it ended up just being my parents. I’ll get more into that later. \n\nMy wife’s sister watches a little boy named Dylan. He’s about 6 years old. She’s watched him for about 5 years, his mother is pretty trash and has no problem leaving him with my SIL for more than a weekend. My sister in law was called “Aunt Robin” by him and me and my wife were “Uncle Steve” and “Aunt Rebecca”, But within the past year, he’s started calling my Sister in Law “Momma” Which apparently everyone is cool with (except me). \n\nCut to three years ago, my wife’s brother and his wife are expecting a girl. My wife is over the moon about how we’re gonna be an aunt and uncle and she’s so excited and so on. She’ll be 3 in September and she is adorable. \n\nCut to almost two weeks ago, my parents come down to visit, my mom and dad are super excited to be grandparents. We’re talking over dinner about how the baby will be here soon and we can’t wait to see him. I say “I know he won’t make us an aunt and uncle because of Daisy(her brother’s daughter) but are you excited about our first nephew?” I said “we don’t have a nephew” she looks at me shocked “Dylan?” I said “he’s not really our nephew” she says (looking like she’s about to cry) “he calls us aunt and uncle, a child doesn’t have to be related to you to be your nephew, inconsiderate jerk.” In front of my parents. My mom is also hurt by this.  My sister in law watched him for 5 years and we weren’t an aunt and uncle according to her until 2.5 years ago when her brother and sister in law were expecting. Am I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR: Wife’s sister watches boy who calls us aunt and uncle. Wife doesn’t consider us aunt and uncle until her brother and wife have daughter. Wife doesn’t consider my sister’s soon to be son our first nephew. Calls me jerk when I don’t consider boy who Her sister watches our first nephew. ",

      "description": "This happened at a party last weekend and people are STILL dragging me all over my social media. I've even seen it posted to a few local comedy pages on instagram and everyone I know has been tagging me in them. I'm getting shit on and found out that one of my best friends is the one who sent them in. This was some party that most people who went to my high-school (graduated last year) was at.\n\nMy biggest enemy in high-school was there. We fought all the time and we hated each other. It was so bad that we weren't allowed to be in the same classes together (our schedules had to be rearranged every semester). I was already tipsy when we got there, so I didn't feel any real anger when I saw him, just mild disgust. At some point during the night, drunk me was a sick bitch who thought it'd be funny to dance on my him. I thought seeing a black girl bust a wine on a basic hockey white boy for the first time, would be very funny.\n\nSo I approach him while I'm dancing and he's kind of confused. Then I start dancing on him and when I look at him, it's like he can't believe what's happening. He caught a bubble (probably the first one ever) from the girl he beefed with all of high-school and it was crazy. It was really funny to me\n\nHe's enjoying it, I'm having fun and his friends are losing their shit. Literally everyone had their phone out. It was really fun for the first few minutes. But the more I dance, the harder this guy gets. It quickly became less \"fun\" and a lot more sexual/intimate. I wasn't feeling it anymore. It became this sexual, not fun, act that everyone was recording\n\nI tried to stand up straight and walk away but he grabbed me by my hips and bent me over again. I tried to get up but he was holding me even tighter. I told him to let go of me, and he said \"when the song's over\". I told him to let go of me right then, but every-time i tried to get up, he kept me bent over. I kept telling him to let me the fuck go. When I did get out of his grip, I slapped him. Hard. Across the face. He obviously was instantly pissed and was calling me a \"dumb bitch\" and a \"hoe\". His friends were holding him back and everything. The girl who threw the party kicked out me and the friends I came in.\n\n**Reasons I might be the asshole**\n\nI approached him first\n\nI didn't have explicit consent to dance with him\n\nSending mixed signals\n\nEmbarrassed him\n\n**Reasons I might not be the asshole**\n\nI approached him very slowly and he happily went along with it\n\nI'm allowed to change my mind\n\nI tried to get away and he kept bending me over and holding me tighter when I told him to \"stop\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting mixed reviews from people on the internet and in my life",

Naturally we said yes.  Our rule of thumb is that we never ask questions we just go with the flow.  My daughter does not like questions and has a quick temper.  We surmised from a few comments dropped by the kids that the oldest son does not enjoy being around his father nor does he like his father's one bedroom apartment.  We reside two houses away from my daughter and the children.  (kids ages 16,14,11).\n\nYesterday afternoon my SIL called me to thank me for mailing him his birthday card and Christmas card (both had $$). My daughter's grandmother always remembered me on every holiday with a card, sweet note and a check.  She was very good to me and was a wonderful example of the perfect MIL. My goal has always been to emulate her in every aspect that I can. Due to the volatility of my daughter's pending divorce I have been kind to my SIL but have kept my distance. After thanking me for the cards and money he explained that the oldest son was sick with a cold. He further advised that he felt it would be best if said child did not have to be cramped into the 1 bedroom with the two siblings and father for the weekend.  He asked if the boy could spend the weekend with us again.  I assured him we would be fine with it.  He asked if it should be kept a \"secret\" from daughter I advised she should absolutely be advised of the situation. Phone call ended with plans for him to drop off boy and pick up dinner I had made for all of them.\n\n5:00 rolled around the front door slammed open and I heard screaming \"where the Hell is she?\"  I ran from the back of the house. My daughter was there; as I came to a halt she was yelling about me inserting myself into the middle of her family. My husband tried to stop her and explain what had happened but she kept yelling and swearing. Finally my husband said \"that's it, you get the eff out of my house!\". I stood there with my jaw hanging. Not usually a guppy this time I was completely dumbfounded, flat footed gob smacked. She whirled and slammed out the house.\n\nWithin ten minutes SIL called. Come to find out that moron had only told daughter that son was \"going to a clean safe place\" and then proceeded to drive from daughter's house two driveways down to our house.  Daughter became enraged and they had a verbal altercation in the street.  Oldest son who is a great kid was livid and cussing his father out (completely out of character I swear) standing on the porch of his father's apartment in the rain and refusing to come inside.  I spoke to him on the phone and calmed him down.  SIL wanted to move forward with previous plans I said I could not get in the middle of it.  Son would have to stay with dad.  SIL brought all three kids over to pick up the food I had made for them. Oldest son sat in car. I went out and hugged him, kissed his cheek told him everything would be okay sorry this was happening. This sweet straight A Honor Roll boy had tears in his eyes. My heart is breaking for him. \n\nMy husband and daughter are normally close. He walked over to talk with her. She was home doors locked music blaring (I am sure wine was flowing poor child) she looked out the window and refused to open the door. It is a $ht show.\n\nAITA  for saying that grandson could stay with us again this weekend?  AITA for trusting SIL to call daughter to make visitation arrangements? AITA?\n\n​\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok so basically me (16M) and this girl (18F) (we'll call her S), had been friends for a decent amount of time, like a two years, and we really hit it off. We liked the same kind of music, watched the same movies, wrote music together, etc. S is gay, not that I have a problem with that, but it's important for later on. I also have severe depression.\n\nMy depression makes me very insecure, and I did rely on her a lot as she previously said I could. A lot of the time, we would spend the nights at each others house, and sometimes sleep together (not sex), but cuddling and stuff. We'd also say I love you on a lot of occasions. So about two months back, I started to have \"more then friend\" feelings for her. I told her so, because we had always had a completely open relationship, and I thought she deserved to know because it concerned her, even though I obviously would never act on those feelings. \n\nS did not respond well. She told me that I was needy and had taken advantage of her. S has completely cut me our of her life, has not talked to me, and made no attempt to work anything out. At this point I know I've lost my best friend, and S has even turned some of my other friends against me.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: I told my best friend how I felt, she has since cut me out of her life and proceeded to ruin my remaining social life.",

      "description": "There's a lot of context to this one, so I'll do my best to summarize. At home, I live on the border of France. I have been to France \"just for lunch\" once, which was great. At university, I live about 300 miles from home, making it more difficult to get to France. However, I was invited along to a trip with my uni friends (let's call them X, Y &amp; Z) to France next month and my dad kindly offered to drive us back home and let us stay a night, and then go to France in the morning since we're so close.\n\nThis is where it gets confusing. I got a call from my mum saying my dad's car was in the shop last week with some trouble and she said \"you might have to get the train home! Or we'll have to get your car out instead\", and I was said \"oh yeah or just get dad a new car!\" And didn't think anything of it. I was having a conversation later that day with X and he asked what I'd been up to, and I said 'oh yeah just having a chat with my mum, she's annoyed my dad's cars in the shop', and jokingly added 'so we might have to get a train back home!', and kept chugging along with my day.\n\nWe had a party that night and people were everywhere drinking and there were drugs floating around; essentially everyone was pretty fucked up. It got late, people were leaving, so I invited some people back into my room to keep it going. We were chatting and chilling out when X, Y &amp; Z burst into my room and start screaming at me. They said (screamed) that everything is ruined because I didn't tell them my dad's car was broken, and that I'm a bad person for letting them invest money into the trip which might not happen. I tried to explain that although, yes, it's broken right now, next month when we're actually going, it'll be fixed and if anything does crop up which is a problem then of course I'd let all of them know. X then kicked everyone out of my room in order to keep shouting at me (but without an audience, I guess?) and I had to sit there with 3 people screaming in my face trying to calmly explain my side of the story. \n\nAfter a while I'd had enough of it, and I said to them I was going to go with my friends they'd kicked out and that we'd talk about it in the morning when they weren't fucked up and I had some time to think. I crashed at my friend's place that night and went back the following day. I talked them and said that it was a miscommunication and I accepted I should have made everyone in the know with the car situation. I thought it was sorted, but yesterday I heard them bitching about me and saying how awful I was for not telling them about it, even though I had already accepted I should have told them. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not wanting to take these people to France with me? \n\nTL;DR: Dad's car broke down and I didn't tell everyone I should've about it, but despite my apologies and attempts to reconcile they're all still angry and bitching about it, so I no longer want to take them on this trip with me.\n\n",

      "description": "This happened this morning. My boyfriend of 5 years and I are house/dog sitting while his parents are out of town. We wake up and good to work at different times. Roughly 2 hours apart. He told me he would give me a key so I didn't have to get up earlier. I still have yet to recieve one. So he gets up and starts his routine. Since we live together he normally very respectful about staying quiet while I sleep. This morning however, he turn on all the light and starts playing music on his phone while I'm trying to sleep. Whatever I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep without success. So I finally get out of bed about 45 minutes later and head to the bathroom. Literally 30 seconds later he come in and asks if he can prestart my car. I'm butt naked and trying to take a shit. So I said something along the lines of \"does it look like I'm any where near being ready?\" and asked him why he was rushing me. He said he's not and I thought that was the end of it. Fucking 5 minutes later he comes back into the bedroom where I had just put my contacts in and was still mostly naked,\" you want me to preheat your car for you? \". So yeah I'm not a morning person and I did get some attitude with him. \"stop fucking rushing me, you said you'd give me a key\" and he said he's not rushing me. So I come down stairs probably about 7 minutes later and he's sitting on the couch waiting for me. There is no reason why he couldn't have left for work at this point and left a key. So we head out the front door together and he says \"I can't leave yet I have a bunch of stuff I still need to do\". So yeah I'm pissed and asked why the hell he was rushing me out the door and trying to get rid of me all morning? He starts to blow up on me and I walked away and didn't hear most of the bullshit he was saying. Kinda made me feel like I was 19 again and getting kicked out of my one night stand. He still had yet to text me back this morning and I'm just wondering how the hell am I the asshole in this situation?! ",

We were friends before dating but had grown closer as ever during the 6 months. She had become my closest friend who I shared everything. After she dumped me, I was in a very bad state. She told me she still wanted to be the same but as friends. Even I couldn't envision losing her, since she had become a part of my life now. So we agreed to stay friends. I was okay but I didn't realize what would happen once she had someone new in her life. So, now she has been dating this person. I know I'd never want to be with her again, but somehow deep inside it affects me and my mood changes instantly when I hear her talking about him. It's weird, but it hurts me bad. We are in the same college. But I can't take it anymore, so I just avoid her. I feel like a coward but I just avoid talking to her now. Honestly, it feels much better somehow. I feel guilty and sad for making her feel that way, but I just can't do it anymore. I tried to be friends, but unfortunately didn't work out for me. Am I the asshole for straight up ignoring her for my inner peace?",

My first instinct was: \"Uh-oh, they went into the wrong changeroom\" (the gender neutral door was somewhat close) so I wait to see if they come quickly running out as their becomes painfully obvious.  But they never come out.  I gingerly go into the changeroom and sure enough he is showering in with his daughter in the same area that naked men are wandering around without a care in the world.  I am extraordinarily uncomfortable so I go into the private stall to shower.\n\nIs this normal?

Takes advantage of his availability, puts the kids in the middle, etc. \n\nLast month,  BF leaves on a weekend boys’ trip.  I have the house to myself.  No kids. No noise.  We both work full time. I’m exhausted and ready for a break. \n\nBut...BF’s ex wife needs to drop the kids (10 and 11) off because she has plans. I say no. She does it anyways.   Kids use lock code to get in while She drives away.  I cancel my plans.  Stuck with the two.  (They don’t want to go to their moms anyways, but that isn’t relevant IMO) I freak out, call BF. Chaos, cluster fuck.  \n\nThis month, same situation. BF is gone.  I send mine to their dads so I can do me. Ex wife says she’s dropping the kids off.  I make it clear that the answer is NO.  I leave. I change the lock code on the way out.  \n\nHere’s the tricky part: she drops them off anyways and drives off.  The kids are now stuck outside without the code to get in.  I’m at yoga and don’t have my phone on me.   When I finally get to the text messages, I have a list of people all telling me to go and open the door.  I rush home and begin making Mac and cheese because they haven’t eaten and had been sitting outside for an hour. \n\nHeart to heart with BF.  He doesn’t get it.  BF says that his ex is difficult, but  I can’t just change the code since we all live there and he’s  kids are entitled to be home (plus, again, they don’t like it at their moms) But, I’ll be damned if I’m the free babysitter.  Plus I’m not in the business of indulging children’s every want and wish.  She won’t answer my calls. \n\nAm I the asshole for changing the code knowing that (potentially) the BF’s kids could be dropped off and left on the sidewalk? \n\n\n\nTLDR- BF’s ex-wife keeps dropping off their kids for me to watch, so I changed the lock code so the kids can’t get in. \n\nAITA",

      "description": "On mobile. Yadda yadda.  \n\nBackstory - I worked in ER/ICU at a specialty vet hospital overnights prior to getting married and moving. Whenever someone has an issue with a pet they ask me, and also people tend to complain to me when others mistreat animals and ask what they can do to stop it.  \n\nEnter my family. My cousin and his wife adopted a pit bull puppy a year ago. My aunt contacted me concerned because she was trying to sell it - after having the dog for a year she didn’t have time to train it and wanted the dog out ASAP *side note - this is the second dog she’s returned to a rescue because it’s too much work*. \n\nAgain, I worked overnights in ER in a city, dogs (especially pits) would routinely come in for being bait dogs.  The area my cousin was looking to sell the dog is outside the city in an area that also notoriously fights these dogs. I’ve honestly seen enough animal abuse and neglect that I got burnt out last year. \n\nI talked to my aunt and she agreed and privately reached out to the rescue where my cousin obtained the dog for a few reasons. \n\n1. They signed a contract stating they would return the dog to the rescue if anything didn’t work out. \n2. Rescues will reach out if given anonymous tips - and try to work with the owners and sometimes provide help or advice. \n3. I didn’t trust they’d actually care who took the dog, they wanted it out, so I was worried about who would get the dog. \n\nI did NOT talk to them in person for one main reason - they’re legit bat shit crazy. They’re the people talking about fighting other 40 yr olds on Facebook. I sincerely thought submitting an anonymous tip would be better. \n\nCue the aggressive Facebook message from said family (who I haven’t seen in 2 years now because they refuse to come to anything) calling me a child, how I have growing up to do, how I’m a snake, how I showed my true colors, how she won’t say what she really wants to say about me (and also blocked me from messaging her back)\n\nNeedless to say I guess the rescue didn’t keep it confidential. \n\nAITA for sending the rescue an anonymous tip on my cousins who were trying to give away their dog? \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my girlfriend her car got broken into?",
      "description": "I've been thinking about this for the last few weeks, figured I'd post to hear other people's thoughts.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I went out to my girlfriend's car to drive somewhere, and as I got close to it I saw a bunch of junk on the driver and passenger floors. Didn't compute for a second, and then I realized that the glovebox was open, and the stuff on the floor was the hastily rifled contents of the door pockets, center console, and glovebox.\n\nI went in for a closer look and realized that no windows were broken and the doors were unlocked, meaning most likely I forgot to lock the car door last time I used it, so it was 100% my fault (she doesn't use it much, so no chance it was her).\n\nAfter going through everything, I realized that about $7 in small bills and change was missing from the sunglasses holder thing, but otherwise everything was there. They didn't touch my GPS or my dashcam, thankfully. Also no damage to the car, and tbh it was kind of nice to get rid of some assorted junk that had been in the pockets, so the car was cleaner than before. Silver linings, kind of?\n\nSo, in light of all this, I decided to not tell my girlfriend about it. She is a very nervous person, and will absolutely spiral into pretty deep anxiety over this kind of thing, and it will last for a while. For example, our landlord yelled at her for some little thing 3 years ago when we moved in, and to this day she is genuinely afraid of a tiny 70 year old woman who has otherwise been completely unthreatening. My worry is that her knowing will cause her to be scared of our entire neighborhood, not want to sit on the porch, not want to talk to our neighbors, etc, when obviously the break in was just a random desperate person, and not indicative of the whole area. We do live in a place that wasn't great somewhat recently, but has heavily gentrified in the last 10 years.\n\nSo AITA? I feel bad for withholding information from her, but at the same time I think it might be better for her own mental health.",

      "description": "I was helping my dad with a few things at home, he wanted to fix some issues with the walls and, while we were working, I brought up the fact that an actor I like was going on a tour in theaters with a monologue I wanted to see, so I invited him.\n\nHis reaction was basically \"youngsters today can't stay focused for that long\".\n\nI told him I thought he was exaggerating saying it's a problem of \"youngsters\" but that due to my mental disorder I do have troubles staying focused and I tend to daydream a lot, sometimes making me re-read what I was reading and other similar situations.\n\nHe said it's not my disorder and that everyone can get distracted.\n\nI tried to explain that yes, they do, but not to my extent.\n\nAt that he said that by the way I talk it sounds like I enjoy being miserable and that I like having the disorder I have.\n\nI found that very offensive, I HATE the disorder I have to live with, it makes my life a potential emotional hell. It does have some very minor upsides, but mostly is huge downsides that make relationships very difficult.\n\nI think saying what he did can be compared to tell a cripple who can't walk \"I mean yeah you have no legs but dude, come on, sometimes I get tired and can't go on a hike too, you're not that different from normal people.\"\n\nWe did get in a short lived, but very heated argument and I was just wondering if he was very rude as I feel he was, or if I'm the asshole here.",

      "description": "I just heard of this place and I wanted to know if I am in the wrong. So recently I purchased a new phone for $749 and I showed it to a family member who also loved how it looked. She was currently using my old iphone 6s (perfect condition) that I let her borrow because her phone broke. She decided to upgrade to the same phone so we went to the store together. When I got to the store I saw that the bigger model was much nicer. I suggested that she buy the bigger model and I would pay her $150 and swap phones with her. She agreed. However when she was going to pay for the phone she actually heard there was a trade in promo. The promo would give her a $250 discount if she traded in the iPhone 6s. At the time I wasn't really thinking much about it, but she traded it in and ended up paying 649 for the phone instead of 899. When we got home and switched, she asked for the $150 dollars. I told her I would go get the money, when I realized she actually sold MY phone that I let her borrow. So I went over and told her that because she got a discount on the phone using my iPhone 6s I dont think I have to pay her. She got very mad and said that I'm a dirty scammer. However in the end she still paid $649 for a $749 phone. Am I the asshole for not paying her even though she saved money by trading in my own property?",

I told her he might have an issue with his laptop, thinking that would be a reasonable answer to put it to bed. She said then he should fix it and print all his emails. I ultimately told her, \"I'm going to give you my honest answer and you're not going to like it - he's the CFO and as the receptionist that's part of their job.\" We went back and forth about it. Her argument: it's not right, it's bad culture and it's unfortunate. \n\nIn my eyes, I've always worked with 2 thoughts 1) assume positive intent from people, I have worked under this man for a little over 2 years, there's a rhyme or reason why he's doing what he's doing and 2) that unless it's illegal, dangerous, or unethical - your boss asks, do it. I posed the question to 2 of my friends, one didn't see an issue...the other said \"once a dick, always a dick\". \n\nI'm trying to see if from subordinates eyes...I'm huge on culture, I've been trying to drive culture change at my work and it's been going good - so that struck a cord.",

I still contribute money towards the household (as rent, more or less)b as well as help with many chores and errands. Don't know if this is important to share, but who knows?\n\nAnyways. College is stressful - no duh! So, though it may not be my best desicion, I've taken up casually smoking cigarettes. (I mean, one every couple of days.) However, I do not smoke in my house or in my car - usually I go outside, to a nearby park, or out in my apartment's parking lot. I'm always by myself so I don't bother anyone with the smell, and I use perfume and gum afterwards.\n\nNo one in my immediate family smokes, and all my life I've heard the typical warnings and what-not against it, but I feel that I'm willing to take the risks right now because of where I'm at in life. I dont intend to become a chainsmoker or even a very serious one, really.\n\nBut. My mom just found out this evening, and she has literally been giving me the silent treatment over it. (A little unusual of her) Not before she told me I could move out if I'm \"going to do whatever the fuck I want, anyways.\"\n\nA big part of me can see why she's upset because she raised me to be a healthy person, but I also feel that she's being a little unfair.

I don't do drugs, I don't party, and I'm a good student. But there's a huge part of me that still feels really guilty and really bad that I've pissed her off so much.

      "description": "So at a party one of my friends asked my GF about a small scar she has, asking \"What happened?\". My GF explained and the night went on. Later, in private, she ended up crying to me about it saying it really upset her that he would ask about it. I tried to explain that he meant no harm and that he didn't know it was such a sensitive subject and asked if she wanted me to say something to him just to say like don't mention it or let him know its a sensitive subject so he wont make the same mistake again which she didn't want me to. He genuinely didn't mean to upset her and he doesn't even know that she was upset by it.\n\nA month or so has passed and I mentioned that the same friend was having a party and that my GF and I should go to it and she refused saying she doesn't want to be near him because he makes her really uncomfortable. I was a bit taken aback and asked why because I thought it must have been something serious to upset her that much that she removed him from all social media and now wants to avoid seeing him at all. She said I know why and I asked was it because of what he said at the first party, she said yes and asked why I don't understand why shes so upset about what he said. I explained my view of the situation and explained that he really meant no harm by it as he didnt know it was a sensitive subject to her and that I don't understand why shes reacting the way she has. She is now even more upset with me and asking why I am defending him and not defending her. \n\nI understand she is upset but I don't think that my friend has done anything wrong, he didn't mean any harm and he would apologise if he knew he had hurt her. I have never said shes overreacting or that shes wrong to be upset but I don't think its very nice that shes completely avoiding him even though he doesn't know hes done anything wrong so hasn't had the chance to apologise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not understanding and sticking up for my friend instead of her.",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my best friend happy birthday?",
      "description": "It was recently one of my best friend's 21st birthday. Us and our other best friend were supposed to go out to dinner for her. However, I got my hair bleached and dyed that day and got chemical burns from the bleach (I used to have psoriases on my scalp and I still have bleeding sometimes) and was in a lot of pain and bleeding all the rest of the day (our other friend claims this happened at 10 AM but my appointment wasn't until noon and anded at 3pm). I had been looking forward to seeing my friends since we made the plans a couple weeks ago, but I had to bail because of how bad the chemical burns hurt (probably partially my fault because I still colored my hair after the bleaching and that probably made it worse). I was really upset that I had to cancel because we rarely see each other now because we go to different colleges. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I didn't go, much to my displeasure. But our other friend said it was \"suspicious\" and that they were upset I never said sorry for not being able to come. But both of them are upset with me for how I reacted to their texts. I didn't want to stay home. I was even supposed to bring my boyfriend to meet them since we've been together over 6 months and we're very serious. He also wanted to come after I told him how important it was to me and to them, but it feels like they think I didn't want him to come. Bday friend feels like I cancelled last-minute and that I didn't even try to come. And I'm sad I couldn't, but I spend the rest of the day and the day after dealing with a stinging scabbed up head, and from my perspective, not coming was the more considerate thing than to go and be a negative presence, which I genuinely thought I would be, and besides, I needed to immediately go home and try to calm the chemical burns in some way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was very frustrated because I really couldn't understand why they were both so upset. I got pretty upset and I admit, I was really unkind and inconsiderate in my replies to both of them (I've been inconsistent in taking my bipolar medications, and I do not consider this an \"excuse\" for my behavior but it has made me very irrationally irritable). I feel bad about it but I still don't understand why this is a big deal. I didn't forget about her on her birthday, but they feel because I didn't text her happy birthday that I didn't really care, which is completely untrue. I love my friend with all my heart and I wouldn't ever try to hurt her. Both of them are saying I was extremely rude in my replies, and I acknowledge I responded while I was too heated and didn't think through what I was saying much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo bday friend is hurt that I didn't say anything on her birthday. It isn't like I forgot about her. She's my best friend and I could never do that. I truly didn't think it was a big deal to not say it, she knows how much I love her and that I am excited for her turning 21. I guess I was riding on the assumption she knew I wished her a good birthday. I truthfully don't understand why it became a big deal. I admit it was probably me projecting onto her, because I don't care if someone wishes me a happy birthday or not, and I think I was wrong in making that assumption, because everyone feels differently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I don't know how to \"make it up\" to her. I was already a bitch in my responses to our group texts because I failed to control my anger at the situation. I was pretty offended at what they said and failed to hold myself back. I decided to back off the conversation until I cooled down, which I am still trying to do now. I never want to hurt my friends and I am genuinely sorry if I did, but I don't know what she wants me to do now after our argument. I feel like there isn't anything I can say that she would feel makes up for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I didn't tell one of my best friends happy birthday and couldn't go to her birthday dinner because I had chemical burns on my head and was in lots of pain. She and our other best friend are upset with me for not saying anything and for not being able to come to dinner and consider it suspicious. I admit I got too heated and responded in a negative way while upset. But now I don't know what to do to fix this. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hello, I am back again. This isn't a shitpost or a validation post. I am having trouble figuring out if I will be the asshole if I did this or not. Sp. Let's get to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my aunt is a member of the  small town I live in. I will be turning my sweet sixteenth next month, and my mother and I are trying to figure out who I will be inviting. Of course my mom is wanting to invite her family, which I don't have a problem with, however I specifically asked her not to invite my aunt, the woman who married her brother. My aunt can be sweet, and nice, but is very critical of my mom. I have seen first hand what that has done to her, but my mom says that she \"forgives\" my aunt. And that I should be forgiving her, but don't associate myself with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile it isn't my place to tell her that she should forgive my aunt, it angers me. Mostly because of what my aunt said and done to both of us that is unforgivable in my book. There are two incidents and it happened years ago when I was still in elementary school. But I can't forget the words she said about my mother when my uncle passed away, and when she left me alone at night in a car when my mom was late in picking me up. I am mad that my mother didn't protect me from her when she should've, but my mom also works late in trying to keep my family afloat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not want to ruin the relationship between my mom and her brother (who seems like he is turning his head at this) as she has been trying to rebuild it. And I feel like this is what will happen if I didn't invite her, but I feel as if she will just show up for a few minutes and leave without a goodbye like she did last year. I tried to talk to my mom about her, but again \"It is the Christian thing to forgive and forget. You don't have to associate with her, but you still will have to see her.\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA if I didn't invite my aunt even though it is a chance of ruining my moms relationship with her brother? AM I wrong to still be angry?",

      "description": "This happened yesterday and I'm kind of conflicted over it. For some context, I am currently in the process of transferring to a different college. I've been in the process since the beginning of the semester but only just left my roomates know this past Thursday. We're pretty friendly but we aren't that close so I didnt really want to discuss it until I was sure I was leaving, hence why I waited so long. \n\nSeparately I had been annoyed with this particular roomate, we'll call her M, since she has a habit of leaving piles of unwashed dishes in the sink for days at a time and expected me to wash them for her, so I had been avoiding her a bit to begin with. \n\nThis past weekend I went out of state and on my way back yesterday afternoon I received a series panicked texts/messages from a family member, N, saying she was \"worried about me and wanted to know if I was okay\" emotionally. I was confused by this since it seemed to come pretty out of nowhere, I have struggled with depression in the past but I've been pretty open about that as well as about the fact that I'd been doing very well recently. \n\nApparently N received a series of messages from M on facebook, that I have screenshots of, telling her that I was a suicide risk and was isolating myself and not talking to anyone and asking her to keep watch over me since switching schools seemed like \"another way\" for me to isolate myself. She also said that I had been \"displaying a lot of red flags\" and \"got angry whenever she tried to bring it up\" (which in my memory she never has?), as well as not talking to B, our other roomate. N has a panic disorder and so when she received these messages and then couldn't immediately get ahold of me (as I was out of town), she had a panic attack.\n\nWhen I got home I had all of the roomates, theres only 4 of us including myself and B and we were all already aware of the situation, come to the common room and sit down to talk about it. I asked her why she said those things about me, and her reasoning came down to \"you weren't talking to me\". I told her that she crossed a major line by going to my family first and telling lies about me, and that she had no right to assume things about my personal life and act like they were true. She started to say that she would do differently in the future but I cut her off and asked her to please in the future keep it to herself because she clearly doesn't have a very good grasp on my state of mind. I thanked her for her concern but told her that, I feel like I'm unable to trust her with details about my personal life and apologized in advance if I was more distant going forward. When I said this she started crying, and I left the room.\n\nI understand that M likely had good intentions with this but I was furious that she didn't talk to me, or even to B, who I actually am friends with, about it first. The fact that she \"tattled\" on me to a family member who she doesnt know crossed a major personal boundary in my eyes. Especially since I had a really bad experiance with this type of thing when an ex-friend of mine in high school tried to get me committed by making false reports about me. M knew about this, and so I feel like she should have known the degree of paranoia that it would give me for this to have been handled like this. \n\nI feel like I handled things as politely as I could have but I feel really bad about making her cry, AITA?",

      "description": "This is sort of an update/continuation of the post below. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aqqc3r/aita_for_telling_people_why_i_cut_off_my_friend/\n\nThis is a guy I used to be friends with, but he told me he liked me even though I have a boyfriend and he started venting to me aboout how his feelings for me was affecting him negatively. To be fair, I encouraged him to vent at first because I wanted to be there for him, but realized this wasn't healthy for either of us. I stopped talking to him about three months ago and refused to talk whenever he reached out. He sent me a long text that I didn't reply to one weekend and the next day I found a gift bag without a name. It was of my favorite color with my favorite flowers in it, sitting in front of where I park my car in front of my house. I'm pretty sure it was him, but my friends have said I can't assume that. I feel like I'd be acting naive to not assume it's him and it's taken my peace of mind and I've been more paranoid of guy friends after that whole ordeal. I plan to tell to him that I don't want anything to do with him and tell him to stop trying to talk to me. That and how everything has affected me so that he doesn't do this to another girl. Some friends say he's harmless and is just lost, but I'm tired of having my boundaries crossed and leaving unwanted presents at the house of someone who doesn't want to contact them is not okay. This is the second time a guy has done this and I'm done putting up with it. I don't like how it's being downplayed and I don't think I'm overreacting, but my friends' comments are making me doubt myself. ",

When I went back on my seat I noticed my friend was dozing off.

(He also added this were the only sunglasses that prevented him for getting headaches and all the other brands had been useless.)\n\nI didn’t have money to repay for his sunglasses (I didn’t have money to buy myself a pair of the cheapest sunglasses). \nSo AITA?",

      "description": "My GF [22F] and I [24M] have been dating for about 6 months now. I’ve known that she has trust and abandonment issues from her past relationships. She dislikes one of my best friends [25F], whom I’ve known for about a year longer than GF. Let’s call her “Jane.” There has never been anything (sexual or romantic) between her and I. I tend to befriend more girls than guys, so it’s normal for me.\n\nGF cites a couple reasons for not liking Jane. \n1. They met was at my Halloween party. Jane came with a larger group of friends and they were all drunk already. From the moment Jane got there, all she talked about was how excited she was to meet GF. When GF got there, they briefly introduced each other and GF went to hang out with her friends that she invited. Jane kept asking me when she’d be able to really meet GF. In her drunken state, Jane tried to discreetly whisper this to me. Aware that it could cause a misunderstanding, I make sure to keep a reasonable distance and never make any physical contact; I even tried to bring Jane to where GF was but GF didn’t seem interested in talking to Jane. Afterwards, GF was mad and didn’t allow me to explain anything because that would be “defending” Jane.\n2. GF said she would give Jane “a second chance” when I invited GF to come to a bday party at Jane’s apartment. I was already in a bad mood bc of my then-roommate who is an asshole (we were still “best friends” then but that’s a different story). At one point, I got very hungry, ordered delivery, and ate it in the lobby away from people to not be rude. GF came out eventually and said she’d go to the bathroom and be right back. After a few minutes, Jane comes out and asks why I’m eating outside. Jane says to just go eat in her room and that there’s a lot of people hanging out there. Knowing how bad this was going to look, I insist on staying and that I’m waiting for GF to come back. Jane tells me that GF is in the balcony smoking weed with my roommate, then grabs my food, and tells me to just text GF that I’ll be eating upstairs. I’m even more anxious at this point and quickly text GF to come back and shows up before we went upstairs. Jane takes us to her room, where there were indeed other people. We had an argument, couldn’t explain; same thing.\n\nBecause of personal reasons, GF moved back home indefinitely and we’ve been in a LDR for 3 months. GF says that because we are doing distance and Jane makes her uncomfortable, I should avoid anything related to Jane, such as: liking pics on facebook and instagram, talking to her, and being anywhere Jane might also be at. GF says she’d even expect me to leave a place or party if Jane is also there, at least for as long as we’re in a LDR. Because I transferred schools, I rarely see my friends anyway and this just makes it even harder because Jane may be where they are.\n\nSo, am I being “disrespectful” to our relationship by refusing to avoid my friend?",

      "description": "     There’s a girl that’s a mutual on one of my social media’s, and I just found her. She has in her bio that she’s a nursing assistant now, and a future doctor. I scrolled through her profile, and saw some pretty revealing pictures, and also some talking about her using cocaine. I messaged her asking if she was aware that some people who hire doctors and nurses check their social media. \n     \n     She told me they didn’t. They definitely do. I told her that if she posts pictures that have her breasts completely out, and talking about the use of drugs, she could have problems finding a job. I asked some of my friends, and they told me I was the asshole for not letting her be body positive and post what she wants. \n      \n     Take a look at my Reddit. I’m not one to *ever* tell a woman not to post her body, because I post mine all the time. She obviously just hadn’t been told that posting nude pictures can bite her in the butt. I’m now being lectured by my followers on not letting her be body positive. I just thought I was looking out for her. I don’t 100% agree with the fact you shouldn’t be allowed to post your body and not be hired, but everyone seems to think I’m an asshole for telling her to be careful, though I had no malicious intent here. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nMy message said this exactly: More and more places hiring professional people are checking their social media and I wouldn’t want years of your med school to go to waste!

      "description": "Throwaway account as a lot of our friends use reddit and know our usernames. Mobile user, apologies for bad formatting etc etc.\n\nSo me and my SO are having an argument and decided to write this post together (for fairness so we are both repesented equally) to see who's in the wrong. We know it's a small issue but it's causing quite a debate between us.\n\nHe was unpacking his Christmas presents, a few of which are heavy books. He decided to place them on top of a painting I've done recently which I'm extremely proud of and which I've put over 30+ hours of work into. This painting means a lot to me. I then picked the books up an hour or so later and noticed that the painting had been lying at an angle between the wall and table slightly, such that it had been bent when the books had been placed onto it.\n\nI told my SO I believed it showed a lack of respect toward my belongings that he hadn't checked to make sure my painting wouldn't be damaged when placing heavy books on top of it. And yes, i did shout it a little, as the painting means a lot to me and it upset me that he bent it. He argues that he assumed it was flat and therefore didn't check, and although is at fault for not checking he believes this doesn't show a lack of respect towards personal belongings and takes offense at being accused of this.\n\nI've been really upset about my painting being bent, and he's really upset that I shouted at him for bending it. He specifically takes issue with my use of the phrase \"lack of respect\" as he says I'm not using the phrase the way he understands it and it upsets him to be accused so flippantly of not taking care of my things. I believe that not checking if he was going to damage my painting IS a lack of respect toward it and he should accept responsibility for it.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong?",

      "description": "We got an aussie shepherd mixed mutt puppy a few months ago, and she is the sweetest thing in the world.  Never met another human or dog she didn't get along with.\n\nNow, she is noisey and likes to boss all the other dogs around.  Herding breed through and through.\n\nWe have two neighbors with dogs on each side of us, and they both have pitbulls.\n\nOne neighbor has let our dog play with theirs, and they are such good friends.  Always looking for the other when they go outside.\n\nThe other neighbor has kept them leashed when going outside.  In their fenced-in backyard.  We got a fenced in back yard so our dog could run free, and now the neighbor is demanding we take her out on a leash like they do.\n\nThis was brought up to us after an alleged event I did not see where my dog stuck her nose through the fence, and snapped at their dog.  Not sure which dog \"started it\" or whether or not this snap was just her being mouthy (she mouths other dogs her size or bigger constantly, as this is how puppies play.  She is very careful with smaller dogs.  Never has another dog taken issue to this), but I don't doubt it could have appeared aggressive.  Like I said, she is bossy and loud.\n\nNow the neighbor is worried if his dog bites back we will call for him to put down the pitbull because of his breed. \n\nWe wouldn't call for such a thing, but I understand that my word isn't enough.  That said, he refuses to let our dogs meet because he has determined my dog \"doesn't like\" theirs.\n\nNow I have to take my dog out on a leash in my own backyard instead of letting her use the doggy door like we have been all along.\n\nI think this is ridiculous.  They mentioned putting up a mesh to cover the spaces in the fence, but doubt they will follow through.  AITA for requiring they put up this mesh so we don't have to limit my dog's use of our own yard?",

One of them is naughty and will sometimes approach a passerby to smell them but it's never aggressive.

That and the other things in the past (some physical, some not) hurt for me in multiple dimensions at once and I'm not sure I could ever be at peace with it. I'm strongly considering breaking up but I know it was the past and not against me and even before I was in the picture. I know she's a victim for the particular episode too, and I don't think badly of her. It's just hard for me to deal with and I don't know what to do. We're a few months in and deeply happy. If the past was better I would be so much more confident.\n\nAlso, she drinks and smokes and I never have and never will, she's into that sort of social lifestyle too and even though I trust her deeply I just am so uncomfortable with it all. Not sure if that's reasonable of me but I'm just giving as much context as I can. She's also much less concerned with all of this past than I am. It's not like it's easy for her, but she's just suited to better deal with or at worst compartmentalize that stuff than I. Sucks that I can't follow that example. \n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like it but I don't know what to do. I really don't know if I can do this, yet outside of what I outlined we're an extremely above average relationship deeply happy with each other.

      "description": "This one is really playing on my mind, idk if I'd be pulling an asshole move if I do it and I'm interesting in what y'all think. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo a couple years ago I dated this guy for about a year. We'd been good friends beforehand and had amazing chemistry, and overall a really good, fulfilling relationship for both of us. \n\nWe ended up breaking up because of a situation I was going through at home. I was basically in an abusive-parent situation and they stopped me from having any kind of social life, so ex and I weren't able to see each other. He dumped me because it got too much for him to be in a relationship that had so many restrictions, we only really communicated online when we weren't in college together. Imagine being in a long distance relationship with someone who lived 10 minutes away, that's what it was like.\n\nIn retrospect, it was totally fair for him to dump me cos it really wasn't a fulfilling relationship, but at the time I was devastated, and admittedly I took the breakup pretty badly. I was young (18) and dumb, and I'm totally an asshole for the way I handled getting dumped. Crying and begging and the works. It didn't help that he still cared for me, so the breakup hurt him too. All in all it was suuuuuper messy and I regret that. We ended up losing contact, we tried to be friends but it was too messy and we were both caught up on each other. Our contact just kinda naturally died off until we stopped texting each other, and we haven't spoken since. We haven't spoken in probably about 3 years now, but still have each other on social media.\n\nSo here's the thing. I'm now out of the abusive situation that caused us to break up in the first place, and there's a small part of me that wants to reach out and see what he's up to. I feel like we were a right-person, wrong-time situation, but it's not the wrong time anymore. I'm not expecting us to instantly reunite or anything, I'm not even saying we'd still have feelings for each other. I just feel like we had great compatibility back then, he doesn't seem like he's changed much, and we could probably still be good friends, and perhaps something more than friends now that my life is in a healthier place. I genuinely don't know where it would go, but I really wanna drop him a message and see if he'd like to hang, or get coffee or something and catch up. If he isn't interested I'd be fine with that too, but I'd just like to know. Also, idk if this is relevant necessarily but I know that he's single so it's not like I'd be moving in on someone with a girlfriend or anything like that. \n\nAt the same time though, I feel like I'd maybe be an asshole for just returning myself into his life after so much time has passed. I don't want to pull up old baggage or make him uncomfortable or come off as being creepy. \n\nWIBTA if I dropped him a line?\n\n\nTL;DR - dated a boy for a year, both of us were very much in love but he dumped me because my home life was in a bad situation that affected our relationship too much. 3 years later, I'm no longer in an abusive situation at home, and think there could be a chance for us to at least be friends again, as we were really close friends before we dated. I do still have some feelings and would be open to seeing where it could go, but I'm also accepting that he might not be interested and would still value his friendship. WIBTA for reaching out to this guy and seeing if he'd like to catch up? ",

      "description": "To preface this post I would like to give some information on the house set up. I live with two other roommates in a 3 bedroom house. Two of the bedrooms are upstairs with one being connected via a small hallway to the living room downstairs. \n\nSo last night all three of us where in the living room watching tv together around 11 pm. Eventually around 12 my downstairs roommate chooses to retire to his room while myself and the other roommate stay up chatting and shooting the shit. It gets to be pretty late, around 1:40, and we’re still in the living room making noise. However, for one reason or another both of us got pretty boisterous at one point over a topic. This incited my downstairs roommate to yell at us to shut up from his room and SLAM his door shut. \nNormally I would feel bad and embarrassed if I kept one of my roommates up for being loud and would be incredibly inclined to apologize, but this was not the case this time around. I felt like his extreme lack of tact and ability to treat us with some decency sucked up all the possible empathy I had for the situation. Not once did he come out of his room to ask us to please quiet down because he was going to sleep, instead he instantly resorted to aggression and violence to deliver his message. AITA for making too much noise and “instigating the reaction”?\n\nP.S. This was a first time incident, it’s not like he has had issues with us keeping him up before, and if he has he’s never mentioned it to either of us.\n",

      "description": "I'm finishing up my freshman year of college and this guy has been very straight forward about liking me and possibly wanting to date me. At first, I thought I liked him too, he was funny, into the same things as me, and attractive. He is a really sweet guy, he talks with everyone and is very outgoing. \n\n What really threw me off though were a few things, one being the amount he drank. I'd say 8/10 times we hung out during our \"thing\" he was drunk or tipsy. It really bothered me because when he was like that he'd only talk about himself, and he could talk for hours. He would also stick around for hours in my room, even when I was trying to get work done or on the phone with friends... I really enjoy my alone time, and told him this, but he never really stopped. He also slept on my bed all the time, and this is a big guy in a small one-person college bed. I could hardly get sleep, my roommate felt so bad she let me sleep in her bed while she went to sleep in someone else's room one night. \n\nIn the end, I let him know I thought we were better as friends... there was definitely a connection and he said he wanted to take me out on a date before I \"ended\" it, I agreed. That never happened though, I don't know if he forgot or just decided not to. There was one other time before where we went to Mcdonalds and he called it a date, but I wouldn't really count it.\n\nWe're still friends, but sometimes I feel like I was the ahole for asking him to leave my room or getting mad at him for sleeping on my bed. All my friends thought we would be good together and don't really understand why I ended it. I just got so annoyed and bothered by him hanging around for hours on end. \n\nI've never dated before, and so I really can't tell if I am an ahole for ending it over those things or if I was in the right and that wasn't normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " \n\nI don't know how to start this but if I'm wrong don't hate me.\n\nSo this week we got an assignment at school to find a pair to make a comic about our city's history and at the time I thought we had to make it the same week so I was quite desperate. I wanted to be with my best friend but this time she said she already chose a pair so (because all of my other friends weren't at school that day) I accepted my quite \"interesting\" friend's request which I'll call M from now on. I think M couldn't find any one else either so that's why she asked me.\n\nAfter few days our teacher writes that we need just to prepare for doing the comic and bring a A3 size paper for friday.\n\n(The next day after the assignment my one friend which I really like and almost never got problems with (I'll call him R) comes back so I naturally thought about switching pairs)\n\nI brought a piece of paper that day when we needed to say our teams, so the the teacher could write it down. I told R that we could be a pair and he liked the idea. After I spoke to R I came up to M and said that I really wanted to be with R and even one of her best friends was at school then too so I just just sed that M could be with her.\n\nShe got really mad at me and called me a bitch and said that I could at least told her to bring her own piece of paper and that we already set teams. I felt really bad and chose to be with R and the teacher already wrote it down. (We did not use the paper that lesson)\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I was then called a 5 year old and other insults. So in return I said he was trying to show how manly he was since his ego was hurt. He then said I should be willing to try new things, but I told him I already said no. I then said he could take other friends in the group who wanted to go, or make some new ones. Another friend said I was being too defensive. While the first friend said why am I getting mad. I then said that friend kept trying to call me out, when I already said no to the trip, because everytime the friend replied, he specifically was tagging me and asking why I don't want to go or why I should try new things.\n\nOur chat consists of 10+ people, only one has said he would try it, and I said I wasn't going to. Insults are pretty normal in our group, but the constant questioning was getting annoying.\n\nAm I the asshole for saying I won't go or try it?\n\n",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend (15) and I (17) were approached by a guy in his early 20s. Let's call him J. He thought we were college students and from a very good art college in our state (RISD). We told him we were just high schoolers. We basically begin to talk to him every morning at the bus station waiting for our bus while he waited for his to go to work. One day, he had this idea of collaborating with us making up a design for a sweater, because he told us his younger brother had a clothing line and would hook us up with his younger brother to get a contract and money from him. The thing is, J had no way for us to contact, no phone,  no social media or anything. It's pretty weird because he always talks about wanting to get into RISD when he doesn't have anything out there to promote himself. My friend and I worked on an idea, and I drew it on a canvas he brought us. J drew his part and wanted us to paint over it. We're both sucky at painting btw, and his part was...kind of bad. One thing we had caught on before our painting assignment from him was how he said he was going to put it on his portfolio for RISD and credit us. He stated before that he'd always wanted to go to RISD and pursue a career in graphics design.  Okay, we only agreed to do the sweater designs to hopefully get some cash, not this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that we had a feeling he might have been using us for his portfolio and found it a little uncomfortable. We decided to ignore him for 3 weeks (we had a 2 week break and another one before break). We're still trying to decide if we should just give him the canvas and never talk to him again, or not. I mean it's been 3 weeks. We don't know what to say to him, and we feel pretty bad that he won't make it into his dream school but uncomfortable for using our idea for that. Are we the assholes in this situation?   \n\n\nTL;DR: Older guy offers to help my friend and I with setting us up with his younger brother for a sweater design and possible contract, uses our design idea and combines his to just declare at the end that he wants it for his portfolio. Ignores him for 3 weeks. ",

      "description": "Two years ago, my boyfriend and I lived separately. At the time, I had my dog, she was 12 years old and my best friend of life. Shortly before we were to move in together, she passed away. It was at this time that my boyfriend adopted a puppy. When his puppy was six months old I told him I wanted a puppy of my own because I’ve been depressed since my dog passed away. He refused. We broke up for a month due to other issues, and while we were apart, I got a puppy. When we got back together, my boyfriend was so upset. He said it’s too hard with two untrained puppies, so he made my give my puppy to my parents for over a year (he said my puppy could move back in when it was older and better behaved). My puppy is a male chihuahua and is pretty territorial and aggressive, so I got him fixed. After a year and a half of my puppy living with my parents, I just got him fixed two days ago and brought him to my house. My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to bring my dog back to my parents for them to keep. My dog did growl pretty badly at his dog yesterday, but has been calm ever since (before he got fixed he would growl and bark constantly so I’d say that this is a major improvement). My boyfriend says I have to give my dog back to my parents. I don’t want to. He says I should give me dog up to the pound if my parents can’t take him. I said this is not fair, he’s going back on his promise of me getting to keep my puppy. What do I do? Am I the asshole for getting the pup while we were broken up? I gave the puppy to my parents for well over a year and held up my side of the bargain. Now that it’s time for my dog to live here, my boyfriend refuses. Please help AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** when my dog was 12 years old she sadly passed away, so I got a puppy a few months later to heal my sadness. My boyfriend made me give the puppy to my parents for a year because he says it’s too hard and that we can take him back once he’s older. The time has come, I got him fixed, and besides him being a little growly sometimes, he’s a pretty good dog. My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to give him back to my parents. I don’t want to do that and don’t think it’s fair. How do I convince my boyfriend to let my dog stay? AITA?",

      "description": "\nBackstory: My brother lives with his fiance and their 2 kids, both aged below 5. I'm the godfather to these kids. They live around a 4 hour drive away from me. My brother doesn't live near anyone else in my family who are also around a 4 hour drive away. He does live near quite a lot of his fiance's family. My family live closer to me but none of them drive. My brother is 35, I'm 25. \n\nWhat's happened: So my brother and his fiance find it very difficult to get time alone to go out for drinks, time alone etc. His fiance's family refuse to babysit the 2 kids so that they can go out. This has led to him asking me to do it. I've done it 5/6 times in the past. This involves a 4 hour drive each way and all the petrol costs etc, plus all the time i completely lose out of my weekend. He asks me to do it a lot and altough he doesn't always explicitly say it, it's clear he just wants me to come and visit so that i can baby sit and they can go out. He'll sometimes give me a portion of the fuel cost, but i still always end up short changed. \n\nAfter like the 8th time of doing this in a just under 2 year period, i really started to get frustrated at it. I feel like it's not fair that i'm even asked to drive 8 hours (there and back), sit alone bored while the kids sleep, pay out of my own pocket for this experience, and lose my whole weekend as a consequence. Out of frustration i simply started telling him i couldn't make it for one reason or another each time he asked. He asked at least twice a month. I've told him i'm not a fan of it. \n\nSo recently, me and my girlfriend planned to go visit Him during a week off me and her had. We would visit on the Sunday. He’d been nagging me to come Saturday and when I said I can’t but we’ll come down Sunday, he says no don’t bother there’s no room to stay. I snapped at him saying I’ve got a life I’m not a baby sitter etc. \n\nAll goes quiet, we don’t go in the end. Until I get a message today saying how I should make more effort to see the boys etc and how I’m\nBeing a terrible godfather, all that stuff. I kinda snapped at him here.\n\nAITA for snapping at him here? I said that he’s not angry about that, he’s angry because I won’t be on demand baby sitter? \n\nI want to see the boys but not if it’s on the terms of me being baby sitter every time\nAt my detriment. Is this bad? I’ve said if\nIt’s for a day out etc, I’ll always come down. ",

      "description": "I secretly have access to the music at many of my work’s locations.  They have control as well, but I can add songs to the queue or change the station completely.  \n\nSo it started innocently enough.  \n\nPrince, Lets Go Crazy\n\nEurope, The Final Countdown\n\nEtc.  \n\nSome songs were allowed to play through.  others were clearly axed mid-song and music changed. Never played any explicit lyrics. \n\nA small group of us are “in” on it and think it’s hilarious.  We expected the password to be changed or that location would have said something in passing to someone else.  And the gig would be up.  \n\nBut we even tried to play songs that would clearly indicate someone was trolling them. \n\nRick Astley, Never Gonna Give You Up?\n\nNothing. \n\nThen....things changed.  \n\nEnter: Baby Shark\n\nBaby Shark almost NEVER gets all the way through the song.  (And it’s only 96 seconds long)\n\nIt became a challenge.  “Can we get it through today?”  “I can’t believe I’ve never heard anyone say anything about it.”\n\nSo now, once or twice a week I put on Baby Shark. \n\nFor months.  \n\nI’ve never heard a single word of it. \n\nUntil.   This.   Week.  \n\n\nIn a non-work event, one employee from that location was around one from ours, and Baby Shark came on.  And this prompted the story to be told, unknowingly to one of us.  Apparently that location manager is livid when it happens.  He will stop whatever he is doing to go change it.  \n\nI’m told that one time he happened to be in the bathroom when it happened and he was swearing up a storm because he couldn’t turn it off.\n\nHe still doesn’t know it’s me.  Our company has a good natured reaction to simple joking around as long as work gets done and nobody has ever gone too far. But his reaction has our small group who are “in the know” divided. \n\nSo, AITA if we continue?   I truly believe that one day something will be said in passing and the gig will be up and we will laugh about it for a couple days.  But I am starting to question if the juice is worth the squeeze.

      "description": "She did not invite me yet since they just started planning but when her sister got engaged she was like “im gonna invite you to my sister weddings she just got engaged!!!!” \n\n\nYou guys might say “it’s her sister’s wedding! Not hers! Not a big deal”.\n\n\nIn my culture it is a big deal honestly. They usually throw huge weddings here and if one of your siblings gets married you get a certain amount of cards to invite your own friends.  If people decide not to attend a wedding they HAVE TO tell the family that they are not attend so they can give the card to someone else since only a certain amount of people are invited because of the number of chairs chairs and the space. \n\nThis girl is my only best friend so we’re really close i just personally dont feel like attending her sister’s wedding. I don’t know anyone there and my friend will be busy with her relatives, friends and making sure everything goes well so she’ll be running the whole time.\n\nI hate wedding honestly and i feel miserable there. \n\nI usually go out of politeness when relatives invite me. But this time i just dont want to. Thinking about it gives me anxiety and im not exaggerating.\n\nIm thinking of making up a lie and telling her that I’m traveling. It would be very very odd and rude if i told her that i dont want to. She’ll tell her family and they’ll all go “wtf?”  ",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I got engaged last month and we are so happy. However I am ready to cancel the wedding and instead elope because my family (primarily mom and grandma) will not stop bringing up my weight. Full disclosure, I’m not in the best shape I’d like to be (I weigh around 170 pounds and am 5’5 ) so I could definitely stand to lose 10-20 pounds which I plan on doing anyways over the next two years before the wedding\n\nThe first thing my mom asked me after getting engaged is if I had an idea for dresses yet and if I was going to lose weight for the wedding. I said I was planning to drop about 10-20 lbs but instead they insisted I should lose at least 50-60 or else I would regret my wedding day forever. I’ve only been engaged for about a month but I’ve heard these comments enough times that if I had a dollar for each time, I’d have enough to pay for my wedding and then some\n\nNow background story. My mom had me at 22 and decided she was not ready to raise a child so she left me at my grandparents when I was less than 1 and let them raise me. Throughout my upbringing she was not there and constantly missed parts of my life. The biggest one being that she used to promise to come to my birthdays, school/sports events but then never showed. She claimed me every year on her taxes but never gave the money to either myself or my grandparents. My mom also has never apologized for not being there and instead thinks I owe her so much and that she’s the reason I’m so successful (I’m not that successful, I just have a normal middle class job  working for a start up and save carefully as much as I can). \n\nToday after another slew of comments I decided to text my mom since I was simply at my breaking point. I sent “this is the last time I am saying this but if one more person in this family comments on my weight or that I’m too fat to get married then I will cancel the wedding and elope and that’s that. You are free to tell grandma if you like as well.”\n\nMy mom has now turned the whole situation on me and stated that she never said anything like that to me and that if my grandma was saying things like that then I should tell her instead. I was like ok well, maybe I’m being harsh so I then tried to explain to her how hurtful stuff like that is and that she absolutely does bring up my weight every time we speak and not to deny it.  I asked her to put herself in my shoes and imagine if she was engaged and her mom was bringing up her weight constantly. My mom is now saying that I’m just using her as a punching bag and that I’ve treated her like this my whole life which I don’t understand since we’ve barely had a relationship for a majority of my life.I’m so frustrated and been bawling me eyes out all night since I really am considering just eloping and cutting my family off completely.\n\nSorry for the wall of text... am I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I live in the same small-ish town as my in laws. We get along fine, they mostly keep their distance, we have dinner or hang out probably once every 2 weeks. \n\nAbout 15 years ago my mother in law was in a very serious car accident and ever since has been strictly catholic, my father in law and wife are catholic but not very seriously. I’m not really religious. We all respect each others belief/lack there of. On the rare occasion my wife and I go to church (Christmas, Easter, and weddings basically) I go through the right motions, and I won’t eat before grace any time we eat together. And she doesn’t guilt us too much outside of Christmas/Easter. \n\nAnyway, my wife and I moved into a new house after renting for a couple years. MIL helps us move and helps organizing the rooms, kitchen, etc. We were very grateful. But the next day I notice a brand new crucifix smack dab in the middle of the living room wall, which is obviously not my choice of decor, and not my wife’s either. So I take it down and put it in a drawer.\n\nA couple days later I am putting groceries away and what do I see inside the pantry? Good old J-Man silently judging my choice of non-perishables. I took him down and placed him on the front step in the garage, so next time she came she could take him home. No words were exchanged, but I was kind of pissed and I’m sure MIL was too.\n\nAITA for taking down Jesus? On the one hand, I know she genuinely thinks it’s good for our home. But on the other, I respect her choice of religion, I think she should respect our lack of one. (I should be clear, wife was not on board with Crucifix either, she would have tolerated him in the pantry but I took it down mostly because I was mad she rooted through our drawers to find him and put him up.)",

      "description": "Backstory: I rented a very small room in this dude's apt last summer and all has been going quite well other than my dog *really* not liking him for some reason. \n\nThis past month and a half my roomie's friend-now-girlfriend I'm assuming by the smell of ass and humidity that occasionally wafts from his room in the morning, has been over *at least* 6 days a week. I have to wake up at 4 every morning sometimes 6 days a week to go to a very physical job. Either he and her or just her will go out at night returning around 1-2:30 in the morning and it wakes me up every time. My days including travel are 11-13 hrs long and sometimes it would be nice to not have people cramped up in here every day. I haven't said anything.\n\nA week ago she comes in and is repeatedly coughing. All the time. I'm thinking great, now I'm gonna get sick and sure enough I do. Because of this I missed a day of work $ (all I could afford to) and had to buy extra asthma meds to prevent me from having to go to the hospital for days on end. I don't have insurance yet so this was out of pocket.\n\nI'd gotten better, she stayed away for a day, returning with a cough again. I am now back to being sick, this time losing my voice.\n\nThis has been irritating me because her presence costing me money, peace of mind and sleep. It's not like I'm asking to split the rent 3 ways, just $50 off to what I think is fair given the size of the room, my dog and the living conditions.\n\nI proposed the rebate and he got upset and defensive saying that she works nights and only comes here to sleep. Not entirely true but I digress. My response was that he could have let me know that ahead of time as a courtesy, since that's what I would have had to do if the situation were reversed. He nodded on that point. As it stands I actually pay more than half the rent. With the adjustment this doesn't change.\n\nHe said sure this time but that in January it goes back to regular rent. I don't see this as fair and will be looking for alternate accommodation but am just wondering if I'm really out of line here. ",

Pretty much since the break up we have been working on ourselves and our relationship in hopes to be back together one day. We lived together, but both moved back with parents after we split.\n\nWe see each other either out and about or he will drive 1hr to my place when my mom is gone for the day. I’m not ready for him to see my mom yet. He has been asking me to come over pretty much every day for like a month, but I keep saying no because I am not ready to see his parents either (and both his parents work from home so I would definitely see them). I was very close to his family, and losing them in the break up was very devastating. \n\nI don’t want to just go over to his house after he tells his parents “oh btw, khlodashian is coming over”. Because I know that’s what he will do. When I told him I would feel more comfortable with him asking if I could come for dinner because it feels more respectful of his parents/their home, and of me, his response was just “they don’t care” and “they will be more respecting when they see how happy I am, and they won’t see that unless they see us together”. \n\nI was also in a deep depression and was dealing with health issues the last time his parents saw me, and I don’t want to see them until I feel confident with where I am in my life and I have tangible things to show for my recovery (weight loss, confidence, my drivers license -an inside joke with his family-, a job in my field, etc). I simply just wanted to be more on my feet before I saw them. I hadn’t told him this part because it was something I only realized with my therapist on Wednesday. This is what I wanted to talk to him about. \n\nLast night I told him that I know I can’t avoid it forever, and that I just want to share with him my anxieties before I go to his house, just to feel like I have support. He lost his shit, told me he’s fed up with asking me to come over and me rejecting him. Now he isn’t speaking to me. \n\nAITA for just wanting to share with him why I felt anxious before going? Or should I have just agreed to go since telling him wasn’t going to change how his parents felt about me ",

      "description": "Throwaway because reasons and sorry for the poorly phrased title. And sorry for long backstory, tldr at end. \n\nI started dating a guy (L) a couple months ago but it’s casual. We’re extremely different when it comes to our views of the world, politics, all that stuff and have little in common. For those reasons I could never seriously date him. I’m just there for the physical stuff and I thought he was too. \n\nHe had me meet some of his friends last weekend. One of them had a friend in town (C) who L doesn’t know very well. C and I hit it off but in a friendly manner. We shared music playlists and made plans to do yoga via Skype (he lives in another state). All of this was out in the open so I wasn’t trying to be shady or something. To be honest, I think he’s great and it might be something I’d pursue if he wasn’t so far away. But that being said, there was nothing in my body language, tone of voice, etc that indicated anything more than being friendly. I treated L’s female friends the same way, I just didn’t connect with them as well. \n\nWe exchanged numbers and I left with L. L was nearly blackout drunk and asked me if I was having fun with my “boy” at the bar. When I asked him to explain he sarcastically said I looked like I was having a great time with C and should have just gone home with him. I told L he’s not my boyfriend and there’s no ring on my finger so I can talk to anyone I want. He dropped it but was then being aggressive about things like trying to find our Uber, how cold it was, just being a brat about everything. I realized drunk L is a very different person than sober L and it was super unattractive. \n\nI don’t like L all that much anymore and don’t want to continue seeing him. That said, I’m not sure if my comment back to him was mean, or if I shouldn’t have even been talking to C in the first place. My friends are a little divided- some say it’s none of L’s business who I talk to and others say it was shitty for me to get his number/make plans when L was sitting a foot away. \n\nAITA? \n\nTldr; became friends and made plans with a guy while out with the person I’m casually dating. Guy I’m dating didn’t appreciate it, so AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My ex and I were together for a little over a year and when we got together I was 17 and they were 19. Based on the age thing alone my family was iffy about it but I didn’t listen because we met when we were both in high school and it was only 2 years. However I think the age thing was a cover for what they really wanted to tell me. I wore rose colored glasses and missed every red flag that was thrown my way, and there were a lot. A few include he would get in and out of relationships really quickly, he was diagnosed schizophrenic, had a violent past and gave a girl a hickey when she was dating his friend. He lied a lot too so he could very possibly have lied about any of that stuff but as far as I know all of that was true, except for the last one, I know that happened.\n\nA couple months in he started getting manipulative and aggressive. He would gaslight me, roughly grab me when we would argue if I tried to step away and even choked me a couple of times. I tried breaking up with him a couple of times but he would always imply suicide so I stayed with him because I felt guilty. Finally a little over a year ago he didn’t listen to me when I told him no so I couldn’t take it anymore, that happening to me was always one of my biggest fears and it broke me. I broke up with him and he finally said “I’m going to kill my self. I called the police so they could deal with him and in summary they told me he’s sleazy and he wouldn’t actually do it, he was just trying to manipulate me. He tried to contact, and threaten, me a couple of times after but eventually he blocked me.\n\nThe break up took place October 2017, It turns out a few days ago he commuted suicide and all I feel is relief. I sort of feel bad that I don’t feel bad since my mom seemed upset but my mom also won’t eat meat because of how animals are treated so of course she cares about a human person getting hurt. I on the other had just feel so damn relieved. I’ll cry buckets if I see an animal or kid getting hurt. I’m not heartless I think, but maybe I am the asshole, I mean this is a human that was in such a shitty place that they killed themselves. I’m genuinely confused about this whole situation.\n\nAm I the asshole for not caring and frankly do you think this is my fault?",

      "description": "So, I am 13 and in Middle School. I am pretty arrogant and a bit of a hot head when it comes to subjects that are sensitive to me. A lot of things that people say at my school about mental health issues and such definitely don’t sit well with me considering my Mom has Bi-polar disorder, and Schizophrenia. I, on the other hand, have anxiety and depression. Most people in my family have been diagnosed with mental disorders so my siblings and I all have our own issues. Anyways... a few weeks ago (before Winter Break) I saw on Instagram, a girl in my class posted a video of her friend cutting herself, and she was just watching. I was so infuriated about this, so I called her, and asked if her friend was okay. Like I mentioned, I am extremely arrogant and I find it hard to let these things slide. I asked the girl how in the hell could she watch and let alone record her friend harming herself, and she took the video down. Her excuse was her friend was “pretending” or as I saw it,mocking, someone who has depression. I got really angry with her and told her that these issues are not jokes, and that she has no idea what it’s like to have these problems and be ridiculed for them. So, am I the asshole for reprimanding these girls on the behalf of mental health patients including myself? Or was it not my place? ",

      "description": "Hello AITA...I loved reading this sub but always thought the times when I was an asshole was pretty cut and dry...yet here I am. \n\nDating an amazing new guy for about 2 months, definitely developed feelings for him and I find myself trying ways to squeeze in \"I love you\" to see how he responds, but so far haven't. He is the guy I can see marrying, having kids with and growing old together. He's amazingly handsome, great job, athletic, charming and funny and amazing in bed. \n\nAfter we got done having sex last night he said he had something very awkward to ask me, I was a little worried that he was going to say something to ruin his seemingly perfect interior and exterior. But he said he wanted to talk about how many partners we've had in the past. I told him flat out I didn't think it was very relevant and that I really like him now and that was all that mattered. He blurted out that I was only the second girl he's ever been with (He's 27, I'm 22). I was like blown away because as good as he is, I would figure he has broken hearts all across the country. \n\n\nI told him I was not comfortable with this which he correctly took to mean I'd been with more than 2 people. He kept pressing and pressing and I kept trying to deflect but the problem was that each deflection made it seem like I'd had sex with more and more people. So finally I was just like \"ok, i'll tell you but you have to be honest about that's what you really want\" he said he promised he wanted to know. \n\n\nSo the thing is I don't know the exact number but I started having sex at 14 and went through a really long phase of sleeping with lots and lots of older guys. My best guess is that I averaged about 12 guys a year from 14 to 20...so in those terms it doesn't seem that bad, but when you blurt out \"around 80\" in front of a guy who you are really falling for it sounds awful. \n\nHe was like shocked...he asked again if I really meant 80. I said it could be a little more or a little less but 80 was a good guess. He freaked out, put his clothes on and left pretty much without saying a word. I tried to text him to please talk to me and the only thing he's said since last night is \"I have a lot of thinking to do.\"\n\nI'm devastated and don't know what to do, I really liked, even was falling in love with this guy and feel like I screwed up for doing what he asked me to do. Should I have lied to him?\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Throwaway post for obvious reasons. \n\nJust like every other couple, my fiance and I were going through a rough time. It all started with him wanting to talk. He claimed he was not happy and that I am not motivating him in other areas of his life. Initially, I thought  that one of his friends hacked his account as I thought it was just a joke. Afterwards, I got angry and my reaction was not appropriate. After a few weeks, we both realized that instead of dealing with issues in our relationship, we were simply trying to hide them away; we were also taking each other for granted as we were putting our careers and interests instead of each other first. Eventually, I did not blame him for his reaction as I felt we were both guilty of letting something wonderful slide away. \n\nWe tried to talk but nothing seemed to get us to anywhere. During the arguments we both mentioned words and hurtful statements which were not really appropriate. At one point, I have asked him whether he previously had any future plans for us. His response was that he didn't as he was unsure whether I was worth it. \n\nI felt as if my heart was breaking, I have never had anyone hurt me so much with just a few words let alone someone who I taught loved me. I cried for weeks.\n\nWe managed to list down what we really want in our relationship and give it a last shot. I tried to please him in whatever he asked for and his character suddenly changed. We're currently doing amazing. He did apologize more than once for claiming that I wasn't worth it. The thing is that now we are both working on our relationship and I feel as if I shouldn't take him for granted ever again. I also want to make it clear to remind him that he also should never take me for granted again. At times I would ask him a random question and he would answer with a 'No' and I would tease him and ask him 'Why? Is it because I'm not worth it?'. He never actually said anything about it but sometimes seems a bit upset. Yesterday we were having sex and I have put on some sexy lingerie and a high heeled shoes which he really likes. He was in front of me and out of nowhere I asked him again if he still taught I was worth it. He completely agreed. I only occasionally mention it to tease him or to joke about it. To be brutally honest, it makes me feel really good but at times I also couldn't help but feel like I am being an asshole as he did apologize and we are now doing really well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an Asshole?

      "description": "My mom has a less fortunate friend to whom she donates my brother and I’s clothes to. She accidentally donated some stuff I still wanted and still wore. I told her I was going to go over and ask for my stuff back. She told me I don’t need the clothes back and that I have plenty of other things to wear. It’s true that I probably wear one piece of clothing like once or twice a month but I paid for  and still wear them.  She told me there are times when her friend’s kid wears the same thing for several days. I took a trash bag over to their house and told him how my mom donated some stuff on accident and asked him if I could my stuff back. He said sure but looked really sad as I was filling the bag up and his mom kept giving me the same dirty look. ",

      "description": "I have this very high quality travel mug that I bought a while back and is very expensive. I like to drink certain kind of teas and coffees that we don’t have at work so I literally bring it to work everyday.\n\nI was talking with my coworkers about how I wanted a new one because the paint started peeling of the one I have.\n\nSo Christmas comes along and we hold a secret santa kinda thing at work. And my gift turns out to be a brand new travel mug. Only problem is it was of a lower quality than the one I have.\n\nI try to be nice and pretend to like it a lot (even though I didn’t).\n\nI use it once outside work and find it to not hold the temperature well and leaked a few drops. So of course I decided to leave it home and go back to using my older one.\n\nFor some reason this woman at work start treating me weirdly and giving me weird looks. I didn’t really give it much thought and blamed it on my social awkwardness.\n\nBut less than a week go by and my boss calls me to her office and says that (x) is upset because I humiliated her by not using the gift she’s got me. \n\nUp until this point I had no idea who my secret santa was. I tell my boss the reason and she gives me a somewhat decent idea, which is to bring both travel mugs with me to work and put my favorite drink in my favorite one.\n\nI do that and tbh I just put water in (x)’s travel mug. But apparently the scheme was so obvious that she came up to me once and had this weird chat about the teas that I drink and asked to have a sip of the tea that I have in the mug she brought me.\n\nI had to tell her that there was nothing in there, because that day I didn’t even bother to fill it with water. \n\nShe storms off.\n\nMy boss calls me to her office the same day. Laugh it off with me and tells me that (x) asked for her mug back.\n\nI happily hand it to my boss and the next day I bring the gift box and give it to her as well.\n\nX has tried avoiding talking to me ever since and I really do feel bad for making her feel bad.\n\nSo id ITA what could I do to make it to her?",

      "description": "Backstory: I am one of two administrators in my office. I've become very close to the older woman I work with over the last two years. A lot of stuff has been happening in her personal life (Her mother died 2 years ago, her husband died a year ago, and now her brother has been diagnosed with the same cancer that killed her husband, and he just moved in with her.), so I'm very sympathetic and understanding of her mental state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, a lot of stuff has been going wrong at work that are beyond her control, but they have to do with the staff that she is in charge of managing. My boss sees this as her not being good at her job any more, shes been with the company for 20 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow on to the problem: Over the weekend there was a huge blow up about people calling in and not being able to get a hold of the staff in the office. My boss told my coworker that she needs to get into the office now and fix things. Apparently things got nasty and she called me crying about how he was treating her. I'm not elaborating too much on this point because I don't think it's too relevant, but this is how close the two of us are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today while she was on her lunch break, my boss came down into my office and wanted to talk about what happened on the weekend since I work so closely with my coworker and I've helped created some policies and guides to help the staff work more efficiently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we are talking he is asking me what I think about all of this and even acknowledges that he knows that I'll \"never throw (coworker) under the buss\". But then he hit me with a shocking statement, he's bringing in someone to take over. I thought he just meant for the management of the staff, but he clarified to completely replace her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know if I tell her, and then she then tells my boss that I told her that's the end of my job here, and I know that my boss was way out of line telling me something like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like such a shitty person not telling her and I know I'm not going to be able to act like I didn't know about this when it happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this make me an asshole for sitting here and waiting for it to happen (if it happens) and acting like I didn't know?",

      "description": "Okay, here we go,\n\nSo, this happened a long time ago, but I still question it from time to time\n\nDuring the summer, I was running low on cash, and I never liked getting an allowance, since I didn't like taking cash from anyone without feeling like I earned it. Thankfully, my dad offered me an opportunity to help out at his company, earning 9 dollars an hour, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for one week. With the cash I had saved up, working here would mean I would be able to buy a PS4 pro, and I happily accepted.\n\nNow, I knew my dad didn't like me playing video games, but it was offset by the fact that I myself was working for them and not just asking him for money. Nevertheless, I told him what I intended to do with the money, and he seemed like he didn't have a problem with it. I kept reminding him what I was planning to do with the money during the week, and again, he never seemed to really care.\n\nFast forward to the end of the week, and I ask my dad to take me to GameStop after my shift. Conversation went like this\n\nMe: hey Dad,could you drive me to GameStop at 5? I want to buy that PS4 pro as soon as possible.\n\nDad: how much does it cost?\n\nMe: 400$. (I was starting to get worried, as him asking for a price tag is never a good sign)\n\nDad: yeah, no way. I'm not paying for that.\n\nMe: but you're not paying for it, I am.\n\nDad: okay, you're not paying for it then. You're not going to blow off all your money on one thing. You need to learn how to be responsible with your money.\n\nMe: I am responsible with my money. I'm 14, I have no bills, don't have to worry about food, rarely go clothes shopping, rarely eat out anymore(my mom is teaching me the basics of how to cook, so I just whip something up if I'm ever hungry; my parents don't cook breakfast or lunch for me, as they believe I can do that myself). Because of this, I mostly spend my money on hobbies, which is why I did this in the first place.\n\nDad: I don't care. You have too many electronics(game devices) in the house and that's final.( I literally only have a Nintendo switch).\n\nMe: okay.... How about I buy a PS4 for 300$ dollars instead?\n\nDad: how about you spend it on a book and learn something instead of sitting there, wasting your time. I'm done with this conversation, I am not buying another console, period.\n\n\nOf course I'm furious, but my mom took my dad's side. So idk, AITA\n\n\nQuick note, I do have a nasty habit of arguing with the people in the comments section, but I have recently found out that this is against the rules. if I forget, and try to start an argument, please call me out.

      "description": "I’m a “small” chested woman. Not even that small, I like my boobs. There is this “friend” of mine who has like F cup breasts. \n\nFor some reason, she likes picking on my breasts. She is always saying passive aggressive stuff like “well, it’s not like you’ll ever feel real back pain, considering how small your tits are”, one time she picked up my bra when we were in the changing room after gym and said “Do you really fit in this? God your tits are tinier than I thought!”; “Can you really not pick up stuff with your underboob? That’s insane how small they are!”; “How will you nourish kids if you ever have them lmao”; “If I were your boyfriend, I’d be soooo unsatisfied with them”. \n\nI’m not really confrontational, I just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they’re not funny. Yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. I was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:\n\nHer: Hey OP, would you use shoes if you had no legs?\nMe: Well, depends if I had prosthetics or not. \nHer: But would you if you had no prosthetics? \nMe: I don’t think so, why? \nHer: Then why do you wear a bra? Hahaha they are so small. \n\nI was tired at the moment. I admit I snapped, I told her “at least my breasts aren’t saggy like a pair of rotten melons.” \n\nShe got angry. Like I just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. She started crying and saying I’m an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? \n\nMy boyfriend thinks I was not an asshole and technically I wasn’t talking about her tits so that’s shit she took upon herself. Some of our mutual female friends told me I should apologize, her boyfriend told me that’s a sensitive subject for her and I should apologize. She sent me a text that she will be mad at me until I properly apologize to her. \n\nI don’t want to apologize as I think I was not the asshole here. Play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we’d say in my language, this woman “se lleva y no se aguanta”. \n\nBut why would I be here if it not were to ask beautiful Reddit... AITA?",

      "description": "My husband is coming up on his one year anniversary with his company. From the very start he’s been obsessed with it, and generally very excited to be working where he is. I wasn’t that keen on it from the start because it was a pay cut, a 1.5 hour commute, and they were very unorganized when it came to plans. (The 1.5 commute was supposed to change to a 15 minutes commute after his training, but after training they told him they were keeping him at the farther location). \n\nHe was so excited that it usually dominated our conversations, he’d google the company at least every other day just to read up on it’s news (even though he works directly for the CEO/owner?), and was constantly checking emails/work phone calls/texts. \n\nI thought it was just novelty excitement and it’d wear off after a couple months. Once it got around 6 months, after many arguments mostly started by me because he was always working late and obsessing over it, I told him I just don’t have the mental capacity for all our conversations to involve his company. I told him the first half hour/hour after work he could tell me about his day, etc, but that I needed space from hearing about it. I said that I understood he was very work driven, but there needs to be a balance, and that there were some pressing issues we were working on that felt like it was taking the backseat to his work...again. \n\nA year later, and he’s been better about over-talking about it (probably because I snapped at him one too many times) but he stills googles, emails/texts on time off/vacations, and goes in to work on most of his days off. Just to say hi and have a beer and chat with everyone. \n\nAITA for not understanding this and getting frustrated with him? I’m just an under-driven person and this is how normal work relationships are? ",

At first I didnt feel bad. But its now the first christmas I wont have to see her, and despite no one telling her to come visit us, she has come to visit us. None of my siblings are going to.\n\n\nI feel like an asshole because I grew up very money conscious, and I hate wasting money. Especially other people's. And I feel like if no one sees her, she wasted money. And I dont want to be the reason she wastes money. Plus, all of us stuck with our dad after it was over, so mom has like, no one. Just her sister, her mom, and her bf she cheated on my dad with. So Im sure shes lonely.\n\nBut at the same time, she destroyed me. I had 0 self confidence growing up, she never supported what I wanted to do, and she told me horrible, awful things. Ive finally been doing good. Im going to college, Im working, Ive lost significant weight and am still losing it. I even graduated therapy after she left. Im afraid she'll bring me back down, even if I just see her once. And if I see her this time, then what about next time, or the time after that? How could I escape what SHE wants to do if I let her push me into it this time?\n\nI dont want to feel this guilt anymore. But it just. wont. go away. None of my siblings have it, its just me that struggles and I dont know why.",

Fast forward to a few hours later, my GF has packed my suitcase and thrown it down the stairs screaming at me to \"get the fuck out.\" She admits that while I was downstairs she unlocked my phone and read through my entire conversation with my father. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAITA here for expressing I felt uncomfortable in a private conversation? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nthrowaway. because, yeah",

      "description": "Last Christmas I started my Christmas shopping the day before Christmas, and was put under severe stress.\n\nI decided to turn things around and started extremely early. At the midst of October (say around 16th of October), I stumbled across the perfect item in Etsy for a family member. I immediately ordered it.\n\nAnd so one month passes by, and I am starting to become significantly worried. The app is rumoured as safe. So I relax. (money has been pulled off my bank account) Sunday marked the day that I had been patiently waiting for two months. I had received no parcel number, nor formal shipping disclaimer, yet my order was scheduled to ship almost two months ago (circa ten days after ordering). I decided to message the person, and got an automatic message saying that they '*did not take orders*' I fanatically messaged my friend (who has experience on this app) and she strongly advised me to report as soon as possible as they might want to take my money. \n\nSo I reported them. I stated clearly that ''**I'd prefer a refund, but if this company still has the item I am still open for receiving it**'' I further on also explained what happened when I tried messaging this company. \n\nToday I receive a response from a pissed shop owner telling me I did not have the patience to wait for 24h before reporting and that she could not work due to a recently broken arm. After reading this I apologized for my behaviour, but they kept on going on a rampage that I was the worst costumer ever ''*and I have experienced a lot of bad ones*''. I Feel really bad for reporting this company to the app a couple of hours later. \n\nSo am I the ignorant asshole here?",

      "description": "So there’s a webcomic that’s pretty popular that’s a loose adaption of an old public domain story. My friend draws a more to the text adaption and has made it very well known he does not like the other comic for reasons ranging to its too happy in tone to the fans flood the tags for the original work with ship art. \n\nToday he gets an anon message on his tumblr from someone complaining about popular comic and he agrees and goes on to say “Most of the fandom is pretty toxic.” \n\nNow, the fandom for popular comic does get a little out of hand at times, there have been incidents where other adaptations get accused of copying the popular comic (I don’t know if they know about the orginal book), there’s a couple of kids pretending to have multiple personalities to get away with being assholes, the usual shipping wars, but the fandom’s pretty small and that side even smaller. I would not call it toxic at all, but whatever maybe something I avoid gets brought to him.\n\nI message him because of something the anon said that might have been racist (calling a poc character black licorice as an insult) and I notice some people on a discord sever for the fandom are getting a little peeved over it, so I decide to tell my friend, “Maybe you shouldn’t have called the entire fandom toxic? People seem to be getting real mad and I’m kind of worried some shit might start.” \n\nMy friend responds kind of upset? \n\n“I stand by what I said, and I want to believe you don’t mean to belittle me like this, but I don’t need a babysitter to hold my hand and I can deal with whatever happens.” \n\nWhen did I belittle him? Like I genuinely do not know if I fucked up sonewhere here and it’s been bugging me all day, is this one of those “there’s no body language on the internet” deals? ",

      "description": "My whole life I’ve been obedient to my parents. During college breaks, I would return and help out at my parents’ labor intensive dry clean factory. (60-70 hr/week) I was verbally abused on a daily basis by my father who was a potty mouth and blamed everything on everyone else. I tried to implement ideas to their old school business but my voice was never heard. After working there for a couple of years, I decided to do something for myself but my parents would always guilt-trip me saying that I don’t care about our family and that I’m betraying them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was able to leave my parents’ factory and tried to do my own venture but was not successful so I decided to help my brother in law with his newly acquired liquor store. During my time there he thought my ideas were great and started implementing them immediately and saw great results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week, my parents’ delivery driver got into a major car accident and nearly totalled the delivery van. They decided to have the van fixed and hire a new driver. I did not want to be stuck in that never-ending cycle again so I told my mother to post an ad on newspaper the day I start working for them or else it’ll be my last day. She said that she wants to contact one of our previous drivers but he’s not available for another 4wks. I told her there will be a chance that the previous driver will not accept her job offer and she needs to cover her bases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter finishing my routes, I go back and I asked my mom if she called the newspaper company and she said yes. I decided to buy a paper 2 days later on Sunday to see if the ad was posted. There was no ad for us. I asked my mother why isn’t the ad on the newspaper and she told me that the company scheduled it for Monday’s paper. I told her I will be buying the Monday paper to check. My mom approached me on Monday and tells me that she called the newspaper company to double check on the listing and she was helped by a new employee at the newspaper company who lost all of her information so they were not able to post her ad. After hearing that, I was suspicious so I asked her “are you sure you called them?” and she assured me she did. I went home and checked her call logs. There was no calls at all between her and the newspaper co. That night, I asked her to tell me the truth and she smirked and laughed and told me she never called. I felt like I was a fool and felt used. I told her I am not delivering for them because she lied to my face multiple times and she refuses to help herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day she tried to get me to go and I said no. She said I was acting like a child and said I am not willing to help my parents and that I am making a mistake. She tells a family friend and my mother in law that I refused to help them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR I stopped helping my parents at their factory because they are not willing to help themselves and take me for a fool.**",

      "description": "I was in the store on the phone with a friend, we were practicing Spanish ( language is a requirement it our major and we refuse to take another year of Spanish since we took it in middle and high). \n\nI got into one lane and noticed a lady climbing on the shelf to get something and immediately went up to her. I pointed to the thing she wanted and said quiere (want in spanish), she took some time but agreed. It is very obvious that I don't normally speak Spanish because my pronunciation sucks so I wasn't surprised she just spoke in English. She asked if I could help with a bit more things. She was  pretty and I wasnt completely in a rush but I didn't have the patience considering I was still on the phone and just wanted to get home so I refused.\n\nThe lady was unhappy and asked questions/ gave reasoning why I should agree. At first she wasnt rude just pleading to my niceness? (I dont what you would call it) but I said no and explained in very simple Dora/Diego type Spanish that I need to go. The lady got annoyed at my unnecessary Spanish and asked if I can just speak English. My friend is pretty anal about Spanish only during these calls and I didn't want to deal with the backlash so I refused. I repeated the I got to go thing in Spanish, apologized and walked away. \n\nThe interaction only lasted max 5 mins but based on how she was reaching for things, I am a bit worried. I wasn't completely busy and she could hurt herself/ products. On the other hand stools exists for a reason.\n\nExtra AITA: Part of me thinks I care more about this because of her appearance. Would I be TA if that was the case? ",

      "description": "tldr; my older cousin was hurt when I told her I didn’t want anyone to know that im graduating, and told her mom (my aunt) that I didn’t want her to attend the ceremony. \n\nthe long-ish version:\na month back, I had submitted an application to graduate from college and in the moment, posted to snapchat that my application was processing. my older cousin saw this and texted me immediately, congratulating me and saying she will be coming up to celebrate (i live in northern california and she’s in southern california). \n\nI was a bit hesitant about this only because I had failed classes in the past and I wanted to wait until grades were solidified and I was set to pass them. I forgot I had her on my snapchat, but I only have her and 2 other extended family members who can see my snapchat stories. \n\nI told her it would be great if she came, and I thought that was the end of it. \n\nshe contacted me again a couple days later, telling me that our uncle had asked why I didn’t tell anyone I’m graduating. I told her I wanted to keep it lowkey for now, seeing that I’m still in school and have a few more months of it to go. What i didn’t tell her (and in retrospect should’ve) is that I’m given a limited number of tickets for the ceremony itself, and it would be an incredible hassle to get extra from students who don’t need it. \n\nlater on, my parents tell me the extended family in southern california all know and wanted to know why I didn’t tell them. I know for sure my parents didn’t mention anything to them, and im pretty much in disbelief at this point but I don’t let it bother me too badly, and reasoned that people knowing can’t be a terrible thing. \n\nLast weekend, i saw said extended family members and the aunt I mentioned earlier said “[older cousin] tells me you don’t want her to come to your graduation!” I was stunned and said I never said such a thing, only that I wanted to keep it a secret. it then snowballed into my parents inviting EVERYONE to come up to come see me, and they later tell me I need to at least secure 5 more tickets for the graduation ceremony (I’m given 7 by default).\n\nI personally only wanted my immediate family to come to the ceremony (this includes my maternal grandparents, my parents, and my brother and sister), and have everyone come for a sort of graduation party. my mom asked me if i told my older cousin i didnt want her to come, and when i said no and told her i just wanted to keep it a secret, she said I couldve said it differently. But because i didnt, I hurt her feelings. \n\nI don’t know, I mean I guess it doesn’t seem like a huge deal, but the way she felt made me confused. I wonder if I couldve worded things better. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: He and his gf moved recently and I helped them a couple days to renovate their new place and get their stuff into their new home. He was also unhappy with his current job (truck driver) and since he was always interested in computers I started teaching him programming and got him an apprenticeship at the company I work at.\n\nAfter above mentioned things were dealt with, everyday life began to settle in again and I'd frequently visit him as usual. The difference now is that we don't have a dedicated room to chill in and play video games together and talk about private matters. Everything is now in the living room, with his gf visibly annoyed and more people visiting now since a good friend lives in the same apartment complex, so things get a lot easier heated nowadays.\n\nI'll be moving into a new place in 2 months and asked my friend if he wanted to help me with planning the apartment and such since he is experienced with that. He said yes and we waited until the floor plans arrived. \nI asked him multiple times when we wanted to go to some furniture places together to get some ideas (I wanted him to come with me since I want to make one of the rooms I'll have our dedicated place again, but this time I wanted it to be like a thing we designed and made together). He postponed the date when we would go multiple times because he either forgot it or wanted to stay home because he \"doesn't like to go to furniture places and just wants to chills at home\", which got me a little mad yesterday because he's on sick leave since two weeks (he isn't sick) and has been playing games since then (which imo is perfectly fine, but weakens his argument of wanting to chill imo).\n\nAs soon as another friend came in and got wind about that we want to go to a furniture place, he immediately said that we should totally go now, but then realised it's late so we should go the next day then.\n\nI later called him out because that's not the first time this happened (like I asked him for something to do outside, he says no, but as soon as someone else would join, he says yes) and told him that I sort of feel disrespected as if I wasn't good enough of a reason to do something outside of his comfort zone.\n\nHe just replied \"dude, seriously?\" and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was wrong and the asshole for getting mad and / or overreacting or he is.\n\nI hope someone takes their time to read and reply to this. Constructive feedback welcome, especially if I did something wrong. I'm not very good at socialising and would love to improve.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn.",

      "description": "I'm 23, my girlfriend is 21. She is moderately active on social media, primarily Instagram and posts once in a while. I, on the other hand, am a bit of a recluse and prefer not to share my life on social media, whereas she enjoys doing so. I have no problem with this at all, and I support her completely. However, throughout our relationship (almost two years) she has been unhappy with how little I post on Instagram, and just how small of a presence I have on social networking websites. \n\nI have expressed to her that it is just something that I am uncomfortable doing, and that I am a private person and that my (lack of) social media activity has no effect on our relationship. Most recently, we had this conversation again. She brought up the fact that I posted a lot more when I was with my ex, and that she sees no effort on my end. The fact that I posted a lot more when I was with my ex is true, although that was when I was a teenager, and it is only normal to be caught up in the \"wave\". In the years after my ex and I separated, I formed new views on social media, and the toxicity that it can introduce into someone's life. So naturally, I reduced my activity and I have not regretted the decision at all. I thought it was a bit unfair for her to say this, because it was pointless to attempt to draw comparisons, where there are none to be made. \n\nWith regards to no effort being seen on my end, I have still posted a handful of pictures on Instagram whilst we have been dating (some have been on my own accord, and some were in genuine effort to understand the joys she gets from it). However, despite this, my views did not change and I respectfully told her this. \n\nA lot of our fights recently have revolved around social media and the insecurities that come with it, and I can't help but feel like I'm being forced to like something that I don't.

As the party progressed a bit,  I started dancing and making out with some girl that was obviously trying to get with me, and we were about ready to leave.

Apparently the other girl was in the sister sorority to the frat and apparently told the frat brothers I'm \"a cheating bastard\" and other vulgar comments along those lines...she wasn't too happy that I left and is now perpetually defaming me on social media for no reason at all besides the fact that she's salty, and out of context it sounds really bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean I don't think I did anything wrong, it's not like I committed myself to anything and despite me 'leading her on' or whatever you wan't to call it, its a damn frat party so its not like I'm going on a blind date or anything serious.",

      "description": "So TL;DR, this all deals with him and how he envisions his future, but I don't know how to word the title correctly.\n\nAnyways, a background of myself is I'm in college rn with 6 classes and no free time to work. He is working a technically full-time job at a country club, doesn't want to go to college, and doesn't think about the way future. Both of us are the same age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently with my decision to switch colleges next year and possibly place myself in the Army after college, he hasn't been very supportive of this decision. He doesn't want me to go too far from him, and wants to at least hang out on the weekends (which I may not have any time to travel back). I've told him this whole plan and mentioned that maybe he should consider joining the military since they have many benefits and could possibly pay for college. His family is poor, his mom and dad are more of financial burdens than helpful towards him. He doesn't want to go into the military because he'd rather stay at his job rn and \"move up the ladder\". Plot twist is my mother works there too, for about 15 years now, and she's never been promoted to even a manager role. At the very least, I told him he should try to go to college in the future if he can, even if it was just a technical degree and work a stable, well-paying job for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIssue is, he believes college is a scam and doesn't believe in the government being helpful, so he wouldn't want to support the military by joining. I have high aspirations, I want to be a pilot, work in the military for 20-30 years, and retire smoothly. But I almost feel like he is holding me back, since he would only be making $1000 a month max for the next 10 years. I don't know what else to do except try to look for someone who is on the same level as myself. I don't want to have a financial burden on myself, and plan on having kids within 10 years. \n\nSo the big question here is, WIBTA for leaving my boyfriend (by the time I move to the new college) to find someone with higher aspirations?

      "description": "For context, my mom is 63, single and works full time, typically late nights, with children in foster care. I am 20 and have four older siblings. They all live hours away while I live about five miles from my mom. I work full time, Monday through Friday. My mom also has an ex boyfriend, John, who lives in a travel trailer behind her house. \n\nIn 2016, my mom starting working one of the worst cases she’s ever seen. The children were extremely abused and traumatized. After a few months, my mom spontaneously decides she is going to adopt the youngest three, 4 year old twin boys and a 7 year old girl. Most people my mom shared this idea with told her they did not think it was a good idea, including my siblings and I, due to her age and their behavioral issues. \n\nSince then, I’ve had to watch them a couple nights every week, sometimes not getting home until close to midnight. I really didn’t mind at first, other than their uncontrollable and sometimes very rude and violent behavior.\n\nLast summer my mom switched to a new company and promised me she would not work as late as she had been (she is able to choose her own hours). My mom tends to not keep her word, so I wasn’t surprised when she fell back into the same routine. She found a part time babysitter but she will only do the days my mom is home early and still flakes out half the time. She also got them into an after school day care which made things a little easier, but it’s only open until 5:30. I get off work at 5 and have a 25 minute drive home. John agreed to pick them up from daycare and bring them home so I could meet them there without having to rush too badly. This lasted for a month or so until he decided he’d had enough of their behavior and said he was done. \n\nNow I am back in square one and I’m getting very tired of it. I feel taken advantage of and every time I try to talk to my mom about it, the blame gets turned on me. My mom tells me I am trying to control her life and that I have no reason to have any issues with it. I only ask if there’s any way she can get home a couple hours earlier or maybe work mornings instead. She gets defensive and immediately turns the conversation to an argument. She makes me feel as though I have no other choice. I always used to feel like I could talk to her, but now I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. Anyone else I talk to tells me I just need to tell her I’m not doing it anymore, but she would be furious with me. I want to tell her I’m done, at least with staying so late. WIBTA?",

      "description": "So, yes right off the bat this sounds bad. There is some context. They go to the same college, 5.5 hours away from my college. They dated for a year and a half (before my boyfriend ever knew me) and they agreed to live together (school housing, apartment style dorm) in the spring before a pretty rough break up. \nI met my boyfriend through someone at work in our hometown that summer. We started dating and we planned for me to go visit him at school about three weeks into our relationship (he goes to school near a famous US structure that I hadn't seen). He told me while intoxicated that he lived with his ex-girlfriend and two other roommates. He said that he was stuck living with her for the year and if I was disinterested that was fine. I was still interested, so I went. It was fine, the other two roommates seemed great and she generally ignored us. After this I visited multiple times.\nWe dated for the rest of that year and up until spring, when you sign up for new school housing. Now, I knew he needed a new roommate to replace her so I suggested multiple of his friends and made it very clear I did not want him living with her. He had a lack of communication with the two other roommates and because of this they waited until very late to fill out their housing applications. I bugged him a bit about it at this point and mostly got blown off. Finally he tells me the roommates and him agreed that they would live together along with the ex-girlfriend. I made it clear this was not great for me. Boyfriend played it off as if he were the victim, still is. \nAs of current I try not to get irritated, but I have requested that he not tell me about her. Trust me, I know she's there when I go visit and it really frustrates me. It makes me mad to hear about her, especially when he complains about her. He does it constantly and I feel like he doesn't have the right because he chose to live with her again. He is frustrated with me for not wanting to hear it and telling him it annoys me to be reminded he lives with her.\nWe've been dating for a year and a half now. He only has one semester left so there's nothing I can do but be irritated and have him visit my apartment more than the other way around. Am I the asshole for not wanting to listen to him complain about a situation he put himself in and making it clear I don't want to be reminded she exists?",

Then we give them a few presents. I haven’t thrown them a “big” party since they were 4 or 5. \n\nI do the exact same thing for my step children. They get a bday party from their moms’ grandparents (their mom is a drug addict deadbeat). Then I cook them what they want, bake a cake and we give them presents. \n\nFor my youngest two, I throw them parties bc they are younger. My 3 yr old’s bday is exactly a week after my 6 yr old step daughter. My husband thinks we should have combined the parties. I don’t. My step daughter got a party from her grandparents.

      "description": "20M in an Asian country. I have always dreamt of studying in the University of Cambridge, and this year I got a place to study social and political sciences there. Problem is that my family's finances has taken a hit after my mother lost her job, so paying the &gt;150k USD (over 3 years) of international student fees would be a massive strain on them. It might even mean emptying their retirement fund and taking away resources from my 15F sister. \n\nI've promised my parents that I won't go to Cambridge if I can't get a full ride government scholarship - then I'd be stuck in a law school in my country at heavily subsidised rates. But the way scholarship interviews are going, the chances of me getting one seems really slim. As far as possible I don't want to put that burden on my family, but at the same time it'd be really fucking stupid for me to give up my dream school and future career prospects just for them. Am I above wrecking my family's finances for my own future? Should I be? I don't know. And I have no idea how I should handle things if the government really refuses to give me a scholarship (which is very competitive and prestigious). I think I would lose faith in the system completely and who knows what might happen from there.",

      "description": "Apparently I’m the last person to notice that the Words With Friends game is also a way to hook up (women take note)! I recently downloaded the app out of boredom and got talking to what seemed like a lovely guy. We got on well and swapped numbers, this soon turned into a LOT of flirting, him suggesting we meet, he sent me photos, and we talked every day for about a week. \nHe told me was single, he’d been divorced for a year and had no children.\nHaving recently watched a lot of catfish, I thought I’d just check he was a real person. I put his phone number into Facebook and found his business profile with his photos and full name on it. I wasn’t too bothered and what he’d said so far matched up to this business page, so once I’d seen that I didn’t look any further. \nI noticed one day that he’d blocked my number and sent me a message on words with friends saying that his phone was broken but he could still talk on the game as he has an iPad - red flag!\nSo I decided to put his full name into Facebook having discovered it on his business page, and found his personal profile, his wife’s and plenty of photos of his new baby! Needless to say I blocked him straight away.\nNow this all happened about a month ago, but it’s been playing on my mind because I would hate to be her and not know. \nHe clearly does this a lot, so my question to you, would I be the asshole if I told her?",

      "description": "Long time reader, first time poster (so sorry if the format is off)! English isn't my first language either, so grammar/spelling/phrasing might be off. Anyways, this question have been bothering me for a bit, so i thought I would seek some opinions here.  \n\n\nA bit of backstory: Me and two other childhood friends moved to the same city to attend university, two of us have driver license and our own cars, but the third have neither. All three of are from the same small town which is a few hours away from the city were we currently goes to university. Between the two of us that have cars there is no problem, we have an agreement that we each pay half of the trip, or changes the car we use every other time (for shorter trips)  \n\n\nThe problem is that this third friend, who never/rarely pays anything or offers to pay during or after a trip, usually these trips where the third friend is involved is to/from the city where we studies, and our hometown! On the trip we need to take ferries, and the other expenses is fuel and the normal wear and tear. So a one way trip would be an estimated 130$, and since we are all students that means that none of us have that much money.  \nTherefor I feel that we should share the expenses, and that it is unfair that I or the other friend (sometimes both of us) should pay everything so that the third friend can get to our hometown for free.  \nWhen neither the other friend or I are going to our hometown the third friend usually takes bus and train, and complains a bit about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA if I told the third friend that they will need to start paying or share the expenses if they want a ride?",

      "description": "I have a group of pals who I’m not exactly close with, but we hang out together from time to time. Among them is a man who I don’t particularly like because he’s a massive misogynist. He often spouts sexist bullshit like “women are dumber than men, all they care about is shopping, they’re too irrational and full of drama” etc. Because our circle is mainly men, most of the time it just gets laughed off and nobody calls him out except me.\n\nA year ago, he told his wife he didn’t love her anymore. (Unsurprisingly, she didn’t react well.) A few months after he disappeared and we haven’t heard from him in a while. Turns out his wife filed for divorce, kicked him out of their house, and called the police on him and claimed he was trying to rob and assault her when he and a friend went to pick up his things, so he’s now living with a friend and feeling pretty depressed. Someone suggested taking him out for drinks to cheer him up and when I was asked if I would go, I said no thanks. A couple of people called me callous and said that I should have more compassion for him, but I really don’t feel bad? The police call sucked, yeah, but as for the rest... Wouldn’t say it’s exactly karma, more like things happened exactly as he’d expect them to, so he should feel vindicated. I haven’t met his wife but he has always had this toxic view of women, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew she was manipulative from the start but thought it was just “her being a woman” and married her anyway. Don’t know if I can blame her much either, living with someone who hates your gender must be taking a serious toll on your mental health, not to mention being told they don’t love you anymore. I’m not saying what she did was right, but I still can’t feel much compassion for someone who willingly put himself into a bad situation, and who’s a sexist jerk to boot. AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry, I’m on mobile do formatting may be weird. English is not my first language either, so forgive me for any mistakes.\n\nAnyways. About 3 weeks ago, the day before my birthday, I was quite distressed from working a stressful job and not really being able to rest at all for the whole weekend. I started panicking and withdrew so I wouldn’t have a panic attack and what/not. I struggle with schizophrenia, and meds aren’t always 100% effective. Or even usually to be honest. (yay 3rd world country) I began stressing out and having hallucinations of different versions of myself, and each one was criticising me for failing at my job, relying on drugs to live, etc etc. One of my friends girlfriends noticed how badly I was feeling and she offered to walk with me a bit outside to cool down without seeming rude. I obviously accepted, and soon we were chatting about stuff when I suddenly broke down. I started talking about an insecurity I was struggling with. Since I have an extremely low self-esteem tied to my dad leaving my family, I find it difficult to believe that anyone truly cares for me and will stay around for me.\n\nI expressed this to her (I’ll call her J) and talking to her really helped. I was able to sort out some of those feelings, and she was able to help me realise just how deep the damage was, which I am forever grateful for.\n\nThe next day I was walking home with her boyfriend (M). We stopped because of an owl, and he revealed that she had told him about my insecurity. M apologised for not showing that he cared about me enough. See, M had once been my best friend about 6 years ago, and he was honestly my only friend. If it wasn’t for M, my depression and schizophrenia probably would have driven me off the rails and ended me by the time I was 16.\n\nI immediately felt betrayed. I felt like I had shared something super personal with J and she told M without even asking me first. As soon as I got home, I sent her a text saying “I know you told M, and that really hurt. I thought I could trust you. Please don’t try to contact me for a while.”  \n\nSome of my other friends who learned a bit of the story told me that J was just trying to do her best to help any way she could. I haven’t spoken to her about it since.\n\nAITA for wanting to cut her off because of this situation? Should I try to see it from her point of view or am I justified in feeling betrayed?",

      "description": "(Tldr at the bottom) \n\nSo, quick backstory. I(17F) have been friends with my current girlfriend(16F) for about half a year, and have recently started dating a month ago. The \"honeymoon\" stage of our relationship passed fairly quickly, and we began to have disagreements. \n\nMy girlfriend in general, is very hard on herself. She believes she's unattractive, bitchy, and seldom talks about wanting to die, which I nearly trip over myself trying to talk her out of it. \n\nShe made me promise a while ago to not be self-deprecating about myself because it hurts her, but she does the exact thing. I've mentioned more than once that it hurts me too, and that I wish she wouldn't insult herself either. She says that she would, but then seems to forget about it in a day or so. \n\nOur most recent argument (which wasn't even really big), started with her mentioning that she forgot to wash her makeup off the night before. She says that she looks disgusting once she washes her face, and I disagree. We go back and forth a few times, and then I turn the tables, saying something like \"Well, if you're that insistent, I guess. I look weird without makeup too.\" She vehemently denies it, and after a bit, I just say \"Fine, you win.\" I'm not sure if that struck a nerve or anything, but she said that I couldn't just let her win like that, that she knows that there's something I want her to say. Frankly, I'm over the conversation, and I just want to drop the subject. She keeps pressing me for it, and eventually starts saying \"I know, I'm sorry, I'm a bitch.\" \n\nI then say that \"If I want you to say anything, I genuinely want you to stop insulting yourself. If I thought that about you, I wouldn't be defending you, would I?\" She apologizes, and I say that it's fine. But she keeps going on, telling me that it's not fine and that she's making a big deal out of something stupid. I try to reassure her, and we sit in silence for a few minutes. After a while, she mutters something like \"I really don't know if it's going to work.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm near tears. We get into a fight, but neither of us get loud or aggressive. I accuse her of having no faith in me, which she says nevermind to. It eventually deescalates and comes to a stop, ending with us promising again that we'll be less harsh on ourselves. \n\nThe situation's done and over with, but I still feel guilty. Should I be more understanding to her? I just wish she would see herself in a better light more often, and I'm also tired of constantly having to fight her about herself being anything else but human dirt. \n\nSorry if this doesn't make clear sense, my head feels scrambled. \n\nTLDR; Girlfriend has very low self-esteem, calls herself disgusting after taking her makeup off which eventually turns into a fight, because she begins to say that she doesn't know if we'll work out. I get upset at her constantly insulting herself, while getting angry at me when I once or twice do the same. ",

      "description": "So I went to a bar earlier because I wanted to talk to a girl that I have a crush on, April. I wanted to ask her out at an album release party that was at a dive bar probably three miles from where I live. Long story short I saw her there but I got scared (yet again) and I didnt talk to her. Plus she was busy talking to a guy all night (not a guy she is dating just so we are clear). I remember seeing her from across the bar and about to walk up to her but I looked away for like a minute and she was gone. So I randomly asked a cute girl at the bar if she saw her, walk away. The girl was said yes and she and her friend helped me locate her on the dance floor. So I striked up a conversation with the girls. Emily and Makayla. I introduced myself and told them about April. Granted I was a little drunk (I still am as I am writing this). SO Makayla brought her buddy/cousin over, Steve. I chatted with all three of them at the patio for a good fifteen minutes. I thought i was making some new friends. I told Steve about my dillemma and he said \"just tell her how you feel\" and literally a minute later I saw April leaving the bar and I shouted at her through the fence and told her \"bye April\", she waved at me lol. so I told everyone that I had to go and take a piss and I left for literally five minutes. When I returned to the Patio everyone was gone. Now as we were talking I chatted with Emily for a few minutes and I told her I didn't mean to harass her, as I was just looking for my friend. She said \"its all good\". Now everyone as gone and I started riding home on my bike. I remember hearing someone say \"lets go to Denny's\" lol. I live a mile away from a Denny's, its on my ride home. SO I am riding home thinking I had lost them all forever. I pass by Denny;s and I look in the window and I see all four of them sitting at a table lol. I am so happy, I park my bike and walk in. I talk to all four of them and tell then that i was sorry if I creeped them out, and that i meant them no harm at all. Steve talks to me so does Makayla. LOL the look on all their faces, was priceless. They were shocked to see me, Steve asked me \"did you follow us?\" I said \" No I live up the street and I saw you through the window.\" That is the honest truth. Anyways I told them all I was sorry and I left, I told Emily \"thank you for helping me with my friend\" and I walked out and rode home. I mean I was lonely (I am always lonely) and I just wanted to talk with some new people, that is the second main reason i went to that bar. Oh man am I gonna remember this night for a long time lol. Yes I wish they had let me in, and at the same time I understand why they did what they did. UGH I need new friends I am such a loser lol. So the question \"Am i the asshole??\" ",

      "description": "Some background. We have a small female, un neutered (or however you say it) cockapoo who is great. Shes calm, good with people, and obedient for the most part. We've had her for about six years now. When we originally got her, it was my mother's idea. The dog, let's call her Megatron, was extremely disobedient the first year. Constant shitting in the house, ate our food, harassed our cat of 10 years. My mother talked all the time about how pointless and hopeless this dog was, how she would give it away the next month if things didnt change. It was just a puppy doing puppy things. She didn't seem to understand that training dogs takes a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur other, much more well behaved dog, beloved by my mother as almost another child, died about three years ago. She was understandably heartbroken as we all were. A great dog. He was about medium sized, so she not soon after started looking for another medium sized dog. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to two years ago and she went to the local pet store for some dog food for Megatron. She comes back with this large puppy, about the size of a medium sized dog. Completely rash decision. I am not aware of the hurricane that is to come so am initially excited and supportive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMegatron is not spayed/neutered, keep in mind, so she is extremely territorial of this new dog. She immediately does not jive with it and it sucks. He wants to play, Megatron wants to fight. The house is constantly a canine battlefield. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe puppy is extremely difficult, added challenge of him already being the size of a medium sized dog. He breaks out of his cart, tears up carpet, eats food from the kitchen, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and stepdad are leaving for somewhere, so they ask me to watch the house while they're gone and make sure that the puppy and Megatron get along. Two problems: \n\n1. I have a historic phobia of dogs, and dog conflict makes me very anxious. She was around to witness this development in my early years \n\n2. I am an extremely anxious person. I have at this point already made clear to her that I was going through a period of immense mental difficulty, as I developed a severe panic disorder out of no where. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo absolutely no ones surprise, shit hit the fan. The puppy immediately began causing problems. Chewing things up, getting aggressive with Megatron, scaring the cat. I called my girlfriend over to help calm me down. I was playing computer games in the living room to distract me. Dog ate my only mouse. My girlfriend leaves to get me a new mouse because shes amazing and I was worried about not having one that night as using my laptop is part of my relaxation routine. When she comes back, dog eats her new vans she just bought. When she tries to get them back, dog bites her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire time I'm having an extreme panic attack, Megatron is very uncomfortable, cat is hiding, my girlfriends pissed. My mom never took responsibility for anything that the puppy destroyed. She never got me a new mouse, my sister new shoes. When I told her about it, her response was \"That's what happens when you get a puppy\". I firmly believe that it isnt what happens because it's not my puppy, it was hers. She knew the difficulty of this dog, she knew my anxiety would skyrocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is, the puppy was too much for her too. She put it up for adoption in a shelter, again. Poor dog now has to wait twice for it's owner, because my mom didn't have the responsibility for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow shes telling me, tonight, she has her eyes on this new female puppy, three weeks old. I start off like I don't believe shes serious, but my younger sister of course feeds into this mess, because she of course never had to take care of the previous dog, or will this new one likely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell her \"I'm not babysitting this one\" which she responds \"I never asked you to\". I said \"You did the last puppy and that went horribly\" and she says \"Well you live here, you might have to.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of bunked if you ask me. I am a college student with a job that only gets me 16 hours a week avg. I like the hours because I'm still very much contending with my anxiety problem. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't been easy to work around. I'm making some progress in some areas, but I'm also experiencing new psychotic symptoms lately such as slight hallucinations and paranoia. Shes never been good at supporting my anxiety, so I've gone this journey alone save my father and girlfriend. Therapy has been expensive and hard to find. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's necessary to mention that because I'd be much more willing to help with the dog if I hadn't already so much reason to worry. It's her house which I am lucky enough to live in rent free, so long as I stay in school. It's her life, she can get a puppy if she wants. I won't even try to stop her, that's just not right of me. But I feel like I have the right to refuse to help take care of it, and express my general concern as to why its a horrible idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom historically bad with puppies. First puppy we barely kept and is now a great, small dog. Mom expected me to participate for this second, large puppy which went to shit, destroyed me and my girlfriends things, set off my anxiety disorder to all hell, and she refused to take responsibility for it. Got put up for adoption. Now she wants another new puppy which we all know will not jive with our first dog, and she also expects me to take responsibility for it. ",

Let her know your thoughts! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so I recently became licensed in my field and began my job search in December 2018. At the end of December I found out that I was pregnant (I don't currently have any kids). Right away I thought maybe it wasn't the best timing since I am just starting out in my career. I was hoping to get some experience under my belt before having to go on maternity leave etc.  Nevertheless, I am very excited! \n\nI have gone on a few interviews and now have accepted a job and started working. I didn't disclose to any of the possible employers that I was pregnant because I feared they would find a reason not to hire me (since by law they can't actually not hire me for being pregnant) but there are ways of getting around that. I feel kind of bad not telling my boss from the get go because in just like 7 months I'm going to have to go on leave. I am going to tell her eventually obviously but AITA?",

      "description": "So some time last year I met this guy (I’ll call dan) we got on brilliantly and spent nearly all our time together. At this same time I was with my boyfriend (now ex, I’ll call him Alex) and the relationship was abusive and I really felt like I couldn’t leave, I struggled to think I could be happy with anyone else and felt obliged to stay with Alex because he’d guilt me with his mental health issues and gaslight me. \nI met dan after a friend of mine was secretly trying to set us up because she didn’t like Alex. I ended up cheating on Alex with Dan a lot, no sex just like making out and he’d eat me out a lot because he said he enjoyed it which is something I didn’t get in my relationship with Alex (our sex life was literally dead).\nIt went on for a month or two and I was seriously considering leaving Alex for Dan but I was struggling because I was so nervous, I thought Dan was so much better than me. Dan was starting to gently push me to leave Alex and I was going to, however Alex started to get suspicious of Dan and starting playing on my guilt strings and playing the mental health thing (which he wouldn’t get help for like I wanted him too so I felt obliged to look after him because we had been together for around 3 years at this point) \n\nI just want to add at the time I didn’t realise mine and Alex’s relationship was abusive and I painted the relationship in love and couldn’t see past it, I thought it was normal because it’s all I had known from other relationships. \n\nAnyway I dont want this post to get crazy long but in the end I didnt break up with Alex and I messed Dan about a lot and I was a major dickhead to him because my insecurities.\nMe and Dan barely spoke after I turned into a massive asshole and I later met up with him for his closure and for him to basically telling me why I was a dick which is fine because I deserved it. \n\nOk fast forward to now I’m in a very happy very loving relationship with one of my best friends I literally wouldn’t swap him for anyone, I’m getting help for my own mental health and everything’s going great but I can’t help but think about him sometimes and I keep having dreams about him, I’ve still got some of his stuff like a birthday present I bought his mum and clothes. He’s doing great too I assume the last time I saw he was in a very happy relationship and I’m glad he found someone to be with. \nSo I don’t know why I think of him, I wouldn’t leave my SO now to be with him.\n\nWhat I’m asking is WIBAA if I sent his stuff back to him in a box with a letter, I was planning to write all my insecurities and all the things I’d wish I had said before so I feel clear headed, I don’t want anything from it I just don’t want him to dislike me, which I know he has every right too. I don’t know how to explain it or if it makes me really selfish even thinking about it. A note that I’m not writing this for sympathy I just need to know that if I were to do that would I be in the wrong. \n",

      "description": "I’m currently a graduate student in an engineering program in America. I share an office with another grad student whose from a different country. She recently received a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter for a rather large computer/tech company advertising a few openings in there manufacture sector for chemical engineers. Due to being from another country and English as her third language, she had me help her draft all her emails to this recruiter and fill out the prescreening questionnaire and actual application. After she submitted all this info she showed me the job listing because she was worried she didn’t meet one of the qualifications.\n\nHere’s where the WIBTA comes in. I scribbled down the listing number and looked it up later. Not only do I meet all the requirements, most of them I meet to a T. It’s basically my dream job, they’re literally hiring people to work on the process I’m writing my thesis on. Would I be the asshole if I applied for this job? \n\nI’m almost sure I’d get it over her. I’m defending 5 months before she is, and it’s a time priority hire. My skill set is also more aligned, she doesn’t meet one of the 5 listed qualifications, a programming background. She’s also international and has not begun applying for any form of permanent work visa or anything, where as being a citizen I can work with no restrictions. The real kicker is, the one thing she didn’t take my advice on is the expected salary range. She wrote 95k with a 10% bonus and relocation costs, for a job that pays on average 72k with 6% bonus. If I apply I’d use a much more reasonable salary range, most likely boosting my chances.\n\nSo WIBTA if I apply for the same job as my lab mate, a job I only found out about by helping her fill out her application?",

      "description": "So my SO has been super excited and hinting about getting me something in the mail for a few weeks and it finally comes in... it's a promise ring. It's something I mentioned wanting to get (not for chastity but like, a symbol of our love for each other and I just like the idea). However, after a bit I felt something a bit off about it and it was digging into my skin and it just, didn't feel right.\n\n She told me early on that if I didn't like it we could return it, and I said I liked it and it was fine automatically, not really processing what I had said yet. We go home and I look at it a bit more, mentioning it's pointy and she says maybe she could sand off the pointy bit or something, and agree to maybe doing that, and I find a number engraved on the inside, S925, which is common of Chinese Silver (meaning it's actually nickel and/or copper) and it generally feels thin and painted. I told my SO this and she got kind of sad because she was told it was sterling silver, and it wasn't. \n\nShe paid 50+ bucks for this. After a good 10-20 minutes of consideration, I tell her maybe we it would be better to return it and we could instead use the money to go to an event both of us wanted to go to in the next few weeks. (Though I didn't say this, though I feel like it was implied, it is an event you could definitely find a nice, handmade ring at and she could choose it herself). Upon suggesting returning it though, my SO left the room. I followed after a moment and she's mad and upset, saying that I don't even care. She's now left the room entirely, maybe to sleep or something. \n\nShe's been excited about this for weeks, and I know she really wanted me to like this gift. I was excited too, because she built up to it a lot. She has reason to be upset, and maybe I'm being an asshole but I don't want her to have spent like 60 on something that she could have bought for much less. \n\nEspecially since I don't like the ring that much, but I wasn't upfront about that fact... it's not really my style, though she said I didn't need to wear it I could just keep it somewhere, which I feel like defeats the purpose of the ring. \n\nShe feels like I'm being unappreciative of her effort into finding me a ring to represent our love, and with a whole lot of other things stressing her out, this is just another way she feels like she has failed me. I felt like I should have been upfront as soon as I got my thoughts together, but it ended up hurting her.",

      "description": "Growing up with my parents, I never had any privacy. My mom would say that me wanting privacy was just me being up to no good. She would frequently kick open my door when she knew I would be getting dressed for something, and she would stand there stare at me, and call me fat, ugly, repulsive, etc. And I wasn't allowed to get her out of my room, I just had to get dressed as quick as I could at that point. This went on from puberty until I moved out of the house this past August for college, a university 3 hours away that I got a full ride to attend.\n\nLast week I came back home from my first semester in college. As you can probably already tell, my relationship with my parents is very damaged and could very well be categorized as abusive, most of this stemming from the cultural difference as they were born and raised in a Muslim country while I was born and raised in the US (this applies). I already did not want to spend the break at my parent's house but was pretty much obligated to.\n\nI left all of my bags in my room and went out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. I was only gone for about an hour and when I came back, my dad sits with me in my room and says my mom went through my bag and found my pipe. I smoke weed occasionally, about once a week, even less sometimes. I told him that it's not a big deal, I finished this semester with good grades, and that everyone gets out of line in college- most of my friends get shitfaced every weekend while I choose to smoke a little with friends and hang out on the weekends. This did not process well with my dad. \n\nHe started to tell me that him and my mom were going to check me into rehab to try and \"reverse the addiction\" that I have with marijuana. As he was saying this, I looked around my room and realized that every single one of my bags had everything taken out and thrown back in. This sight infuriated me, so I zipped up my bags and I left. \n\nIt's not about the pipe or anything. It's about the fact that I feel completely violated as a guest. I am a financially independent adult living in a new city, on the road to a science degree, but my bags still get searched by my parents. One person I brought this up with said my parents should have the right to know whats in their house, but in that case, they should be able to search through all of their friend's belongings too when they come over. But my mom started texting me that I was a shameful daughter and a disgusting person for leaving, and that she has every right, as my parent, to go through my things no matter how old I am because \"that's what other parents advise online.\" \n\nSo, AITA for leaving my parent's house for winter break after they looked through all of my shit?",

      "description": "So some backstory:\n\nI met this girl, well call her julia, through a mutual friend. At this point i should mention we are both 19 and dorm at our college, both of us are hours from home. We really hit it off and quickly became close friends. Since i play guitar and she has a great voice we would really often get together and play some music, mean while i think shes super hot but i know she has a BF so i never made any moves.\n\nFrom the start she would complain about how much she hates her BF, and how shes only with him because she needs a place to live when she goes back to her home town during breaks and he supports her financially. She had a rough childhood and her mom kicked her out of the house. Anyway, shed always come to me for advice and what she should do, because she says her bf is a dick and shes tired of him. then one night we drank a bit with some friends and she didnt want to go back to her dorm, so i offered to let her take my bed and id take the couch. She then said she wanted to be close to me so we ended up in my bed together. We didnt have sex, but rather just talked for hours and hours before sleeping. After that however, sexual tension started becoming an issue, and we both werent shy to make it clear that it was there.\n\nNow we are heavily contemplating sex. AITA if i end up having sex with her?",

She says she’s been thinking about it a lot lately though and she might want to get married some day after all and wanted to know why was I REALLY so against it.   So I told her.  She thinks it’s a horrible reason to not even consider it.  \n\nI don’t agree.  I don’t know the exact statistics, but I’ve heard it’s close to 50% of all marriages end in divorce.   That’s not something to ignore.  I’ve lived it personally with my parents, our lives were not nearly as comfortable as they were before the divorce.   \n\nIgnoring the divorce aspect of it, my gf also has a lot of debt.  Student loans and a ton of credit card debt.   I would be taking that on as my own.  I just don’t see how getting married would make our lives all that different then they are now besides adding a ton of risk and debt for myself.  ",

I guess we’ll see!\n\nMy husband (m, 48) and I (f, 49) have been married for 25 years. I’m legally disabled with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. We have two kids; son, 15 and daughter, 13. Son is also battling a long-term illness - he was recently diagnosed with Lyme disease and Alpha-gal. Husband works about 45-50 hours a week at a white-collar job, maybe less, and has to drive various distances to get to the different places he works. His average commute is ~1hour each way, mostly interstate. \n\nHusband gets off work at different times, maybe 6pm, maybe 10pm, and will call me for “company” on his drive home.  I do not enjoy this. Last night I was sitting on the phone with him for 40 minutes, listening to his car make road noise, him occasionally whistling, reception going in and out. The only topics of conversation he had involved what chores we got done in his absence. As soon as I put my phone on speaker and started playing solitaire, he brought up sexy time just as our son walked by. \n\nYes, I have told him, many times, that I prefer not to be kept on the phone doing nothing while he’s driving. I don’t like to talk on the phone, period. I have aphasia, difficulty finding words, because of multiple sclerosis. He’s of the opinion that it’s no real effort on my part to keep him company in case he gets sleepy. I’m of the opinion that he can do something else:  listen to podcasts, listen to books, call his mom, brother, or sister, heck he can even call my mom!  She loves to talk on the phone!\n\nSo whaddya think?  Am I the asshole?  Should I just suck it up and listen to his car noises for an hour so a grown man doesn’t feel lonely?

      "description": "I'm a student from a middle-income family in a selective public high school which charged a freaking high tuition and fees. Because of that the students here are crazily rich. But my family managed to merely pay those fees for my education, and we're not talking about that.\n\nThe thing is, after multiple selection rounds, I luckily got into the National Mathematics Competition (USAMO equivalent) team in my school. As a requirement, I took extra advanced Math classes to improve my skills and prepare for the competition. This is where things get crazy: the school's officials invite some professors to lecture us about more sophisticated subjects on Math. \n\nAt first, I thought these lectures would be free of charge, as they were settled on the school's behalf and there weren't a notice on fees or whatever. But until recently, the school's principal called my dad to inform the tuition, stating that the school required the family to partially pay and support the limited budget of the school, and he insisted on not telling me about this. He also called the rest of the team too, telling exactly what he wanted their families to do. My family, however, discussed with me on this subject, and decided that we wouldn't pay because of our financial circumstances. Thus, we did not respond to the call.\n\nYesterday, my principal wanted to have a word with me. He told me that he had called our family about the issue, which I already knew, and said that he wanted me to force my family to pay the tuition. One thing he said that really bothered me: \"All of them paid their parts, except your family. Each of the families pay at least 1000$ for this. I understand you conditions, but your family have to pay, at least 500$, for it because you took part in it. If the team finds out that you didn't pay. They will see this matter as unjust\". \n\nI was at a loss for words. I wasn't noticed for the tuition before I enrolled in these lectures. And now I'm facing discrimination because I didn't pay for this. My family and I are stuck in the limbo; we are undecided about paying it. Maybe we will not pay it, but I'm not sure what I will come at.\n\nSo... AITA for not paying the fees in this case?",

      "description": "I had some medical testing done about two weeks ago about Problem A, with the understanding that if something showed up the doctor’s office would call. I hadn’t heard anything so I figured everything was okay.\n\nToday one of their admin staff called me to book a follow up - I’m not sure if I sounded a little surprised or something, but she told me, “oh, don’t worry, there wasn’t anything wrong with [problem A] but [problem B] popped up and I have notes to call you to book in.”  \n\nProblem B sounds way more scary than problem A if I’m being perfectly honest, so I started to panic a bit, ask more questions. It sounds like problem B could lead to surgery and that scares me. The receptionist answers some of my questions, then tells me she wasn’t supposed to say anything to me, problem B it isn’t even a big deal, the doctor may not even mention it when I come in and he might just check up on problem A, please don’t tell him that she (the receptionist) said anything because she wasn’t supposed to. \n\nWIBTA to tell the doctor his receptionist told me about the test already? I’m trying not to freak out, but it’s kind of out of left field and the first appointment I could get isn’t for 6 days; that’s 6 days of potential freak out time I shouldn’t have had to deal with. On the other hand she said she told me so I wouldn’t freak out about problem A, so she thought she was being kind? ",

Hung up and I called her back I had to call her about 4 times and she picked up we would go back and fourth me telling her I loved her and that I would never cheat on her and her telling me that I shouldn’t call other girls hit because I have a girlfriend, and that she’s hurt because as soon as she started dating me she never felt attracted to anyone, I’m not sure what to do, I’m not cheating on her I’m just agreeing with my friends about a girls appearance, but at the same time it’s really hurting her.",

I understand that I can’t go out with the adults because I’m not 21, that’s fine but I also don’f want to just talk to kids 13 and under either. Whenever the adults come home, usually from a bar they are all intoxicated and pretty much are in their own little world and I’m sure you know it’s incredibly hard to deal / talk to incredibly intoxicated adults. A simple solution would be to join-the adults in drinking when they get home, which I’m not allowed to do because my uncle and aunts state their kids look up to me so I have to stay sober or else they won’t have a positive role model is what they usually tell me (side note my family does know I drink and party and such, responsibly of course) I usually end up in my uncles room all day doing nothing because well, I can’t.

There is no reason for him to go into the bathroom I'm using to pee. When I asked why he did that he said \"I didn't think it was a big deal\".

We live by ourselves in a city, and the rest of our family lives somewhere else. My wife has a brother who is much younger than her (he's 14 years old).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time, my wife and I have dedicated significant financial resources to her parents and brother. We don't pay their bills or anything like that, but:\n\n* We've provided free food, housing, and transportation plenty of times when they've visited us (like 6 times total). ***I*** have spent money on this, far more than I've received from them. This includes feeding and housing her brother.\n* I used ***my*** personal frequent flyer miles to fly them over the last time they came.\n* My money has gone towards giving them relatively expensive gifts (usually like $80) over they years - usually more expensive than those they've given me.\n\nThey have done \"assholish\" things to us several times, such as not giving us a housewarming gift when we bought our house. Also, her brother frequently fails to help out when they visit us, sleeping in and having his face buried in his phone. I'm somewhat resentful over this, and mainly results in my wife and MIL cleaning up after him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo two nights ago I had some wine and left my dirty wine glass in the sink. Last night my wife asked me to clean it, and I said \"well your mom's coming over tomorrow, let her do it (since she's done our dishes before)\". My wife got really mad and said that her mom was not my servant and that I should clean up after myself. I usually do not clean my wine glasses, though I do other things like handling our finances and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my viewpoint is that her mom would merely be helping out in a way that she has before, and that it's not unreasonable of me to leave this for her to do, especially since I've dedicated much more resources to her parents and brother over the years than they have to me. Does this make me an entitled asshole?",

      "description": "i searched her instagram account because i knew the username, i liked a few pics on her account and dm’d a meme. i didn’t think nothing of it, but then she wanted to know me more so i told her things about me, but i knew a few thungs about her but i didn’t want her to get weirded out so i acted like i didn’t know. i just stated different things i liked and so did she, we became friends in the following 3 days we would text a lot. so i told her i had feelings for her 6 days later (which was really stupid i regret that alot) but thats what i felt.) she recently broke up with her ex that was the reason she didn’t want a relationship with me and didn’t see me as a desire for herself. i wasn’t hurt by it and it actually made a lot of sense. but after that i took her as a good friend and so did she. my sister went to a makeup event called beautycon and she happened to go there, so i asked her how that was and she said it was fun, me not remembering my sister went there, said my sister went there and she asked her name and i told her the name, and she knew immediately who she was. so i had no choice but to tell her she was my sister, she didn’t care and i told her not to tell my sister because she would flip out, she kept her promise. 3 weeks later i left my phone on the charger and a text from her was on my home screen, my sister walks in and sees the notification, she immediately yells the name of her and mocks me for liking someone really ugly. then she plays the card that i want to go out with her friends, as she was mocking her apperence and said she was only friends with her to make her ex friends jealous. as of right now, me and her friend don’t talk anymore i tried contacting her but i get ghosted. now my sister always mentions how i wanted to date her friend any chance she gets. i told her it bothers me and makes me upset, she continues to do so. and its been messing with me mentally and emotionally.

      "description": "So based on my name, I can’t drink. I don’t have anything against it, I have a super low tolerance and get really emotional (anger issues, start crying) if I drink alot and vomit. To me drinking is a sensitive topic.\n\nDuring parties and outings my friends who are all heavy to medium weight drink like mad. They don’t force me to drink, but they do this thing where they keep pushing me to reach a goal. “You gotta take one more shot” or “reach that point in the glass”. I already feel terrible on the inside, so I just say no, i’m not pushing my limit risking vomiting all over the place. They call me names and place sips of shots at me. At this point, smelling alcohol makes me wanna vomit, so I decline again. They stop, but they still call me out. This has been happening for awhile now, where I decline and names are called.\n\nRecently it has been irking me the wrong way, because I hear it every time I go out, and not just with close friends, acquaintances as well. I came clean and told them to stop calling me out on it every single time I’’m tired of hearing it. One of them basically said, stop being a pussy about it when you get called out. This is just guy talk, no one here actually forces you to drink, if you’re not drinking a lot, you will get called out, Don’t shift the blame on us if you can’t handle it. \n\nAt that point I got furious, I started yelling “how its is my fault when I can’t drink you can get to call me pussy. Im tired of it”. Again, got called sensitive, and its just how guys talk. I kept yelling and screaming because I can’t control the situation. To them, it is not their fault and those little remarks/call outs is not pressure/forcing me to do anything. I can walk away from drinking altogether, but I have to endure the name calling each time because it’s what guys do and I’m being a pussy about it. I feel like they don’t have my back, and now I’m just a bigger pussy to them.\n\nAITA for being to sensitive, and it is just how guys talk? Also, AITA for yelling at my friends in this situation?",

      "description": "Backstory: \n\nI've known this friend since sophomore year of highschool and we both just graduated from college this past May. Her and I were both good friends and I used to date her best friend in highschool. After everyone went off to college, her and I kept in contact often and would skype or so a few times a week until she transferred back to the college where we eventually graduated from. Her and I have been close and we have consolidated in each other when our relationships were whack and we've hung out numerous times. I'd say she is a close friend. However though, lately we've been busy with work and all and everytime I ask to hang out, sometimes days in advance, she would blow me off or forget and never try to get back to me. The most recent interaction has been me asking to go to the fair a week in advance and her saying she might be busy but we'll see. I then asked her the day of and she sent an annoyed text saying that she told me that she wasn't going to make it when she obviously never did. I started getting annoyed with how often she would not make an effort into hanging out and recently I have just not contacted her anymore and really don't care tbh. She's a good person but she never makes time or reaches out. Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I do not deny that i can be an asshole sometimes, but AITA for this specific stuff?\n\nI left for the Army in early January, and while I was gone my older  brother's GF \"Jane\" moved into my room due to the abusive and drama of her living with her step-father and mother.\nShit happens while I'm in the Army and get entry seperation, and I returned home June 1st. I come home and find out that Jane moved into my room AND I find out my brother has a girlfriend, cause nobody told me.\nShe sleeps and lives in my brother room while my brother sleeps with me at night because our mother doesn't allow it. I have a queen size bed, so enough room.\n\nOver the course of a couple months I learn this; Jane doesn't know how to use our washer and dryer after living there for EIGHT months  and my brother has been doing both their laundry the whole time I was gone ( I always did laundry for the whole house and put it away, brother never did it) She doesn't know we lock our front and back door at night.\nEvery morning before she asked I asked if she had everything; phone, wallet, keys, lunch, etc.\nShe gets pissed at my always asking this  so I stop. Four days later she asked me to get her contact lenses and glasses cause whatever happened to her contacts. Who the hell doesn't keep backup  in the purse or car?\n\nThis specific moment:\nMy father works long days and I shop for the house and I make dinner for the whole house, main food and couple side dishes all the time.\nThat night I just got a Stouffer meal and made a salad and whatever else. So I see her take food out the fridge, microwave it, and eat in the kitchen right next to me.\n\nI go to Jane in her room with my brother \"John\" in there. I asked why she heat up and ate food when I was making dinner. She said \"I never made enough.\" I go back and grab the casing from the food, I go up to her and say \"Then I guess your not FAMILY\" while pointing at the stuffer meal package size and I walk away.\n\n\nJohn confronts me and says If I ever said anything like that to her again, he will hit me.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the \"not enough food\" thing,  she says she never said that, while I'm thinking inside \"THE WHOLE FUCKING REASON MY BROTHER GOT PISSED AT ME IS BECAUSE YOU SAID THOSE FUCKING WORDS\"\n\nShe makes food in the oven for her and John to snack on. She doesn't clean it up or put trash away.  I ask why she doesnt clean it, she says \"since i made the food to eat, someone should clean it\" her and my brother are the only ones who ate. I have to clean the dishes and clean up, because she wouldnt so them,because that's how you get ants, DO YOU WANT ANTS JANE, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET ANTS?!\n\nHer and my brother find a house, buy it and move in. She quits her job and is ordering custom made shit from Amazon. Whenever I go over and she does  something that upsets me she says \"you can't get out of MY house then\"\nYeah, it's your house on paper, but it's my brother who's paying for it.\n\nI'll come over to talk with my brother, and she's playing Sims 4 with a giant sink full of dishes and an overgrown law. (I'm not saying she should do dishes because she's a woman. Its because my brother does heating and air and lots of time he won't get home till 7 or 8pm. While she gets off at 4.\n\nMy father was upset both of them hadn't invited us over for dinner after living there for a year, using a washer and dryer my father bought them. So for thanksgiving I call my brother and say what are they bringing for Thanksgiving to the house, he tells me Jane was supposed to invite me, mom, and dad to their house ( well fuck, that was never going to happen)",

      "title": "AITA for distancing myself from a friend who was once really good to me?",
      "description": "Throwaway account just in case friends see this. \n\nTLDR at the end. \n\nBackstory: I've been friends with my college roommate for about 8 years. We had some problems living together, but now that we're not, we've gotten really close and for a while, we were inseparable. When I got divorced two years ago, she was my rock. She let me move in with her immediately, I stayed with her for a month while I looked for my own place. She was always there for me and was a great friend throughout it all. \n\nBut since all of that, I feel like she's been...changing a lot? Or maybe I have? I don't really know how to explain it. She's very judgemental of others (including me) when she doesn't necessarily have her life together either. She has a lot of health problems and despite me trying to help her (encouraging her to eat better, exercise, etc.) she just continues to be really lazy and then complain about how awful she feels all the time. She got a dog who is the WORST (and I love dogs, all of them). But this dog is awful, and she refuses to do anything about training it, just complains all the time. The house smells like urine 24/7 and she lets her dog do whatever it wants, including climbing all over me while I eat. She thinks it's cute and treats this dog like it's the most amazing thing in the world, despite the issues it's causing. She used to dogsit my dogs whenever I would travel, so I feel even more awful that I can't stand her dog. I don't want to take care of it because my dogs are well behaved and my house is clean - every time her dog comes over it pees on everything. But can I really say no when she's taken care of my dogs so many times in the past?  \n\nShe makes really awful financial decisions that I can't support, and does not take any sort of feedback or constructive criticism well. She will get extremely upset and go straight to crying or she'll just shut down. She's the definition of a \"know-it-all\" and even when I've pointed out to her that she might be being a bit rude by making me feel stupid, she will apologize but continues to do it. \n\nSince my divorce I've found myself in a new place of bettering myself, my life and basically just getting my shit together, and she just keeps doing the same old same old while complaining about it. I hate to distance myself from her because she was so great to me in my time of need, but what can I do if she won't accept any feedback or make any effort? So, am I the asshole for pulling away from this friendship? It feels like it's at a standstill, and I want to be there for her like she was for me, but it feels like the type of situation where you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. \n\nTLDR: my friend was there for me during a really rough time, but lately she's been really shitty and I'm debating if we should stay friends, but I feel bad because she was so good to me.

We mostly spend Sundays together doing family stuff.\n\nThis is about Wednesdays. This is about the only day of the week she has time for her to just be by herself. I respect that. I believe it's important to have such time for yourself, and I do my best to stay out of her way as much as possible during such hours -- I'd be in my own work room behind the computer almost exclusively (save for a few minutes here and there in kitchen and toilet).\n\nRecently though, she told me it doesn't really feel like alone time to her when I'm in the house too, even if rarely in the same room; and so she asked me if I could take the notebook PC and work outdoors (e.g., at Starbucks or the library) on Wednesdays between 9 and 5. I'm doing as asked for the time being, but told her I think it's an irrational and excessive thing to ask. I doubt that makes me an asshole, but am I wrong?\n\nBTW: some of you might suspect she has something to hide, such as she cheating on me with someone else while I'm gone. However, I have good reasons to believe that's not the case, so I kinda hope we can skip discussing that hypothetical.",

Meaning say if everyone in the class got 100% and one person got 10% everyone would get 60% (basically communism). So you can't actually do well in a class unless everyone in that class does well. It's not every man for himself anymore. We have a major work for our sociology course (a project we have to work on for ten months, with progress check ups along the way.) We are five months in. While most people are you know, 50% done with their project, a few girls have not started, they haven't even settled on a  TITLE for their project. In the Facebook discussion group for everyone in the state doing the HSC, I made a comment on a thread about the course being too hard where I said something like. \"Vegetables pick it because they think it's easy and don't realize until they're stuck with it that its hard.\" And one of these girls writes back something like \"may as well tag us if you're going to start shit.\" All these girls are also upvoting her comment, agreeing with her. So I thought, am I the asshole? I kind of feel like an asshole. Somebody tell me. \n\nLet me say also, I had the BEST comeback but I didn't say it. It's shitty that I have to slave away all day everyday to finish high school with the best results I am capable of and some people couldn't give less of a shit and have to drag us all down with them. I just need you guys to be honest so I can embrace the reality of the situation I have put myself in. ",

      "description": "My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. \n\nShe recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.\n\nWe talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me, it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.\n\nBefore this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.\n\nThey (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the \"this is probably why she cheated!\" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?",

      "description": "I’ll try to be clear but English is not my first language so please be patient.\n\nI (32F) had a 6 year relationship with my ex (28M), let’s call him Joe.\n\nWhen we broke up we keep on being friends, I know that’s kind of stupid but we used to work together so it was important to keep things peaceful.\n\nFew years of friendship later we (stupidly again) decided to live together because it was cheaper to share a rent. All was good for a few months until he started getting romantic with me again. A couple of drinks later we had sex. And that’s how we fell in this super unhealthy “relationship” of casual sex. I had to stop him because I knew it was going to cause troubles in some way eventually. He got mad.\n\nHe continued living with me but he was rude all the time and started talking to me in a really shitty way, until one day I confronted him and even though he denied all his toxic behavior he told me he decided to leave and that I no longer had a roommate, so I ended up having to pay rent all by myself and of course he didn’t care if I could afford it or not. \n\nI struggled a lot for a couple of months until I got back on my feet. And of course I stopped all contact with him.\n\nEvery now and then I go to my dad’s house to visit and do my laundry. A week after Joe left the house we shared, my dad told me he had visited him and my brother and his wife (who  live with my dad). I was puzzled and angry but didn’t said anything.\n\nBut as this “reunions” keep on happening I called Joe and told him I was still mad at him and to please stop visiting MY FAMILY. And he said he appreciate my brother and they are friends and he sees no wrong in visiting every weekend to have a couple of beers. I told him it was uncomfortable for me because we were no longer friends and what he did to me was shitty.\nHe said I was being dramatic.\n\nSo my next step was to talk to my brother and my sister in law and after telling them all the situation they surprisingly (to me) agreed with Joe, telling me what a great friend he was to them and how they think it’s cool he visits and that I should relax and stop being such a bitch.\n\nSo here I am, thinking if I am the asshole and I am really overreacting when suddenly I see a Facebook post of Joe with his new girlfriend sitting on my dad’s house porch. What? Why? How am I supposed to react? I mean, I think I am handling the situation peacefully but it’s been weeks since the last time I went to my dad’s house because every weekend there they are, Joe and his girl, having a blast with my brother and his wife.",

One day, a troll, and I mean, the most obvious troll I've ever seen kicks in and starts shitposting. Then a person  with whom I chatted with tried to cool him down but the troll insulted them. And from the way they reacted, I could tell that they were pretty affected. I firmly believed that they are overreacting and instead of consoling them, I told them that it really is not that big of a deal, and that the other person was obviously a troll and they should not get so affected by what a random guy says on the internet. Then they got very angry at me and tried to explain me how much words can affect someone and stuff like that.\nOn top of that, the troll only gave them 2 short messages, just calling them names.

Now ive (16) voiced my opinion very strongly to her on why im against underage drinking and smoking and i told her if she ever did anything like that i would get upset. A week from today we'll have been dating for a year. She decided to take the drink and after i while i asked her she could stop drinking it. She asked my why. I told her that i dont like it and its upsetting to me. After a while, this argument got to the point where she told me to just leave. I was shocked and a little hurt so i asked her why. She said i was ruining her party (close family) and if i was going to stay, i couldnt be upset with her. I told her that she knew it would upset me but she did it anyways. Thats when she told me that she doesnt care if she upsets me and that she really wants me to leave. I didnt really know what to say so i told her im sorry for ruining her party but she told me to leave anyways. So thats where this is now. Not really sure what to do so, am i the asshole?

      "description": "Hi, I'd like to first give a disclaimer because I am on mobile.\n\nAbout a year ago when I graduated highschool I moved in with my sister who is 6 years older than me and has a daughter who is 10 years younger than me. It was great because she had an apartment with an extra bedroom, and I had no idea where I wanted my life to go after I graduated. Not to mention I had already been staying with her over weekends and breaks because my niece has a (currently undiagnosed) developmental delay, she barely talks or signs and can be a little agressive and clumsy, and my family does not trust her with people we don't know well.\n\nAfter less than a month of living with them my sister had helped me get a job in the pharmacy where she worked and everything was good. Then the next spring we decided it was a good idea to move across town to be closer to my niece's school because the apartment complex was horribly managed.\n\nWe were beyond lucky to get approved to rent half of a duplex 2 blocks away from the school and around 1.5 miles from our workplace for near the same price as our apartment. However that's when things took a slight downward turn.\n\nMy sister in general has always taken care of the bigger bills like rent, where as I take care of more of the smaller ones since I hadn't had as long as her to save up (babysitting all through high school ment it was pointless for me to get a part time job since i was never in town). This ment that while I was buying new household items we would need she was paying a month of rent on each place while we moved.\n\nAround this time my niece also needed to get dental surgery, which wouldn't have been bad if they hadn't had to put her under to do it (she gets aggressive around strangers especially ones that touch her) this came out to a much larger bill than my sister was quoted which lead to her being really stressed.\n\nGiven how stressed she was I was drawn to do anything I could to try and make her feel less stressed, as I tend to be a very empathetic person and her stress was physically effecting my neice and me. So I would buy her her favorite coffee, I started making more \"adult\" meals, and I also took to doing the dishes every night.\n\nIt's been nearly 9 months now and my sister is no longer a walking ball of stress, but I still clean the kitchen and do the dishes every night. And I know it shouldn't be a big deal. But I just find it exhausting after working all day while she's been home to just see a stack of dishes in the sink that I know I will end up cleaning.\n\nThe only times she's done the dishes are when I was sick or not home, and it's almost like she's come to a point of \"it's not my problem\" with them where she'll use an excessive amount of dishes over the day and not even bother rinsing them off. She never puts the clean dishes away, and only sweeps or mops if my niece makes a particularly large mess on the floor.\n\nI've reached a point where 90% of the time it's an emotional and physical chore to deal with and I'll procrastinate until late night to do it even though I'd rather go to sleep right away. I just get stupidly depressed every day when I look at our kitchen and see all the mess she's left for me.\n\nWe work roughly the same amount of hours doing the same type of work, and we both take charge of cleaning the rest of the house. However I just feel like it would be a dick move to make a big deal over a dirty kitchen. Especially given how much my sister does for me all the time and has been doing since I was born.\n\ntl;dr My sister basically set me up with a dream life for a 19 year old where I have a job (with benefits) a house and anything I could need. However after 9 months of cleaning our kitchen every night I'm annoyed and exhausted that she doesn't help.\n\nAm I the asshole? Would I be the asshole for complaining to her about something this small?",

      "description": "My husband and I just bought a house in a neighborhood and we have 2 young kids (toddler and infant). The other day I was loading my kids into the car when a very large dog appeared in our driveway. I don’t know much about dogs and it scared me. I jumped in the car and finished buckling my kids from the inside. The dog proceeded to walk around our yard like he knew the place. No collar. I’ve seen him a few times since and honestly it makes me nervous to even be outside with my kids not knowing when he’ll appear or if he’ll try to hurt us. Today I had a similar experience with a different dog (this one with a collar) which ran into my garage as I was working on a project in there, and sent me running back into the house. You can probably tell I didn’t grow up with dogs and have a bit of a fear.\n\nI grew up in a different part of the country and I never saw dogs just running around, they’d either be fenced in or on leashes. We just moved across the country and are adjusting to a lot of cultural differences.  I’ve asked some of the people we’ve met here and they’ve said this is more normal here to just let your dogs run around. Basically the advice has been if the dog seems friendly, no problem. \n\nMy gut is to call animal control (not on the dog with the collar, but on the other one which I’ve never seen with a person, just roaming). I’d like to be able to play outside with my children in my own yard without feeling like my head needs to be on a swivel. What makes me unsure about calling is that it doesn’t seem “wild”. It had a nice coat and looks decently well behaved and hasn’t actually bothered us. If I had to guess, I’d say a neighbor owns it. But I have no idea who. We moved in two weeks ago so I don’t know any of our neighbors yet. \n\nWIBTA to call animal control on what could potentially be a neighbor’s pet?",

I replied that I forgot to charge my car yesterday and was only at 10%, so if he wanted free lunch, he’d have to drive us. He has a fairly recent car and the restaurant is about 2 miles away.\n\nCo-worker gets mad and sent this over chat:\n\n“On a scale of 1 to 10\nHow much of a tool are you\nTo suggest lunch off site\nKnowing full well that 100% of the time, up until now, you have provided transportation\nOnly to say that it can now only happen\nBecause your car, which uses ‘renewable energy’\n...which you can obtain either for free, or for much less than gas only at 10%\nIf the other person drives”\n\nA charging spot opened up early with someone heading off-site. I plugged,  charged up, and moved my car already but am not telling co-worker so I don’t have to drive every single time.\n\nAITA for not driving my co-worker to lunch?",

      "description": "I live with my mom while going to college. She has said multiple times she does not mind me staying there while going to school, especially since I receive little to no financial aid.\n\nMy mom got divorced literally 3 weeks ago and has already basically moved him into our home.\n\nTo give the situation, this guy still has his house despite basically living here all the time.\n\nNow let me paint a picture of how small our house is. It is a log cabin with a living room and kitchen in the same space. There is a bathroom connected to my room from the kitchen. In the living room there is a staircase that leads to a loft that is directly above my room on the ground floor. The loft is my mom's room. So she has no door, no sealed off room or anything. Just a staircase that leads to the living room. Now when they are having sex, even from my room I can hear damn near everything. Moans, the bed, even skin slapping. You can hear as if you are right next to them if you are in the kitchen/living room because there is no front wall to the loft.\n\nThe first night this happened, I put headphones on and texted my mom \"Really, you guys decide to do that here instead of his house where you have privacy? This is just weird\"\n\nShe never responded or talked to me about it. I know she got the message because I heard her phone notification when I sent it. Now lets skip to today. I just got off work at 2pm. While I am in the shower I hear them come home, nothing out of the ordinary. Immediately upon me turning the loud ass water off and getting out, I hear them going at it right above me. At this point I am kind of angry. I attempted to communicate with my mom about it but she just decided to ignore me the first time so the fact that she just ignored my message and did this made me livid. I went out there under the loft and just blew up about how disrespectful they were being, especially when they have another place to go to.\n\nIt was literally broad daylight, they had to have known I was home by seeing my car and hearing me in the shower as it is right next to the front door, but they decided to just go and do it anyway. To me that is really disrespectful since I tried communicating previously. To top it off the guy literally has his own house they can do whatever they want in. I was just completely baffled they came home, knew I was home, and despite my previous attempt to get the issue solved, did it anyway.\n\nI know it is her house and she can do whatever she wants, but the fact that she assures me I can stay there while studying and ignores my attempts to solve living issues irks me. Even more so every time I remember the other guy has a house to go to for their needs.\n\nTL;DR Mom has obnoxiously loud sex with her bf in a very small house, ignores my attempts to communicate the issue, I got mad and blew up on them because they came home and did it at 2pm fulling knowing I am home and uncomfortable with hearing them.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "TL;DR: Circumstances have changed w/ the other party's love life and living plans, yet I'm still expected to follow through with moving across the country.\n\nMy best friend (of almost 30 years) and I had started making plans on becoming roommates, last summer. This would involve me moving to them, which is over 2,500 miles from my location and to a climate/area I have absolutely no desire to live in (I'm in the NYC area, and they're in Las Vegas). The only reason I thought it'd be a good idea was because I would be paying a LOT less rent than I am now, and I'd get to be close to my best friend, again.\n\nCut to this week: she starts throwing the idea of \"maybe, possibly, toying with\" the idea of moving in with her new'ish boyfriend of 7 months, instead.\n\nOkay- I get it, circumstances change, and I'm not going to come between someone and love's happy cohabitation. There were no set-in-stone arrangements, no money was spent yet, no living situations were given up, etc. So, I just won't move (which was supposed to be this August, when her lease runs out). Simple, yes? NOPE!\n\nShe was upset, to put it mildly. According to her, I am in the wrong because I'm \"reneging on our plans\" and she was looking forward me being (physically) in her life, again. She said she was thinking that I could take over her current apartment (one she doesn't want to give up, but can't afford to hold on to if she moves in w/ the BF) so if things didn't work out with him, she could just come back and we could pick up on our initial plan.\n\nI told her that the situation was no longer advantageous, for me, as it once would have been if she's not going to be splitting the bills with me. She countered w/, \"Well, I don't even know if I want to move in with him, but it's a strong possibility.\" So... MAYBE I'll have a roommate once I move across the country? I can't bank on \"maybes\" in such along distance move. I'm not going to upheave my life to change locales (and drive w/ an elderly pet, to boot) to a place I don't even want to live, just so she can have a commitment safety net.\n\nHer and I are almost 40 years old and I'm just not into flying by the seat of my pants, as I once was. If I was a little less set in my comfort zone, and didn't have to travel with an elderly pet, I might still consider it, just to be near her, but...",

      "description": "So, I never thought of using this sub, but apparently my time has come. I will try to keep myself as short as possible.\n\nMy brother „X“ and I were at a concert. we met there the girls which later became my girlfriend and his girlfriend. Our gf‘s are friends and usually spend a lot time together and because we all get along together well the four of us also spent a lot of time doing city trips etc.\nTime goes by and we also get to know the family of each of my gf and X gf (mum, dad, relatives, friends)\n\nSo everything was going great, but my brother and his gf started to get in trouble with time. After a year they finally broke up.\n\nWhat happend next is what fucked up the whole thing. the cousin of my gf which was befriended with my brother started to meet up with the ex-gf of my brother (this was after the breakup). they did this without letting anyone know, and then somehow it got to someone and details got up. apparently they were partying together, kissed each other and almost slept together.\n\nSo my brother is mad at the cousin and the ex-gf because they were messing with each other after their breakup.\n\nAnd now the main deal, my gf has her birthday coming up and she wants to organize a little party for her family and friends. She wants to invite everyone (my brother, his ex and the cousin). The problem is my brother won’t come if he sees the cousin or the ex-gf. The ex probably won’t come if the other two come and the cousin is okay with the situation and would accept if one or both of them would be at the party. \nMy girfriend is mad at me know, that I‘m not able to solve this situation and that one or two of them won‘t be there for her at the party. according to her I should force my brother to come to the party because its her birthday.\nshe thinks that in the future she‘ll have to split every activity and event into different „phases“ (with my brother, without him / with the cousin, without him / with the ex-gf, without her ...)\n\nhope you understand my situation.\nSo reddit, tell me your opinion.\n\n\n",

She was discussing this guy she had a crush on and mentioned that he had been hitting her up a lot lately, texting her and commenting on her stuff basically letting her know he was interested. The problem was he had done and said the SAME stuff to me. So I thought I would be a good idea to let her know that this guy might be shady because he was saying the same stuff to me. \nI ask if this is rude because I had another friend come up and tell me I had upset Friend A by telling her this and that I should have just \"let her have her happy moment\"... but if I was interested in a guy I know isn't respecting me and just trying to play the field, I would want to know. \n\nShould I have just let her talk about this guy and not mentioned it?

      "description": "TLDR at bottom\n\nI’m on mobile and I’m also angry typing\n\nSo I live in a big city in a very lively neighborhood. I live across from bars, strip clubs, live music...it’s great. That being said, I know that there will be noise from neighbors, and I’m totally fine with that to a certain extent. \n\nThe building next door has 4 units. I live in a building that has 6 units and both buildings share a common area courtyard and ran by the same management company. The old owner was just 1 dude that just didn’t give a shit what anyone did but now these 2 buildings are owned by a huge company. \n\nMy view is absolutely gorgeous, its of the entire financial district, bridge, beautiful buildings it’s just amazing. There are stairs leading up to my apartment and then there is a locked gate that accesses the roof which is not open for general use. There is a sign saying to not access the roof and there are notices sent out every now and then stating to not go up there. We’ve all gone up there though because the views are stunning. \n\nI have a neighbor next door in the other building, let’s call her Princess. Well princess likes the throw parties and let whoever up my stairs and hop the gate and they party on my roof. They run around, throw garbage, break shit like the handrails, scream and just are total obnoxious entitled twats. She also likes to climb my roof in the middle of the night during the week when I have to wake up at 5 am. It’s so loud it sounds like someone is breaking into my apartment and I get super scared so I had to put a stop to it. I confront her and tell her to stop, she says sorry but not a week later she’s up there again in the middle of the night. \n\nThis goes on for months and I let management know. There have also been complaints about princess from people in my building also, I’m not the only one but am the only one really being vocal about it. Management is scared that someone will get hurt up there and sue so they want it to stop. They also say they can’t do anything because she denies it’s her. They tell me to get it on video. I’ve gotten numerous videos of her going up there all hours of the night partying and acting like a teenager that just tried alcohol for the first time and now she is on her 2nd formal notice and after this she will have legal action taken against her. \n\nA week ago on a Friday night around 9pm I hear loud stomping above my head and I’m like, are you fucking kidding me, again? So I go outside and see it’s another neighbor from the building next door hopping over the gate. I’m like wtf dude? He gets mad at me saying it’s early and he should be able to go on my roof. I don’t even report it because I’m just so done with this bullshit.\n\nToday while getting my mail he confronts me and says that he has lived in this building for 10 years and he’s always gone up on my roof and it’s unfair that I’m not letting people on the roof over my fucking head. I told him that princess ruined it for everyone and now I can’t even enjoy MY own roof because you fucks from next door can’t behave. He goes off on a tangent saying he doesn’t go up there during the night and I shouldn’t get mad at people climbing my roof during the day blah blah blah. \n\nTLDR So am I the asshole because I don’t let my neighbors from the building next fucking door have access to the roof over my head that isn’t even designed for general use?",

      "description": "Me and my friend are traveling in Spain, enjoying the sun in Barcelona , I had already eaten but my friend  is hungry so he decides to get a bite to eat at this burger place and I tag along, when we enter I notice that there is a rather long queue. An old lady with a walking stick gently taps me on the shoulder and asks if I'd be kind enough to grab her a cheeseburger meal as she can't stand for long I oblige having nothing better to do and join the queue with my friend she also gave me 10 euros for the food (For the record I regard myself as an honest person and if someone places their trust in me I don't like breaking it, especially when it comes to money) . We reach the counter and I get  the lady's food and the cashier gives me her change, my friend is next up in line he orders but is like 10 cents short or something like that , he looks at me with like a shit load of change in my hand and asks for 10 cents (I can see the cashier also looking at us), I say sorry buddy ain't mine. After we got out of the restaurant he flips saying I embarrassed him in front of the whole restaurant on purpose over a couple of cents, his point is that it was a tiny amount of money and that he would have understood if it was more. But I told him I wouldn't have given him anything even if he was one cent short. Not my fucking money. I kinda feel bad and am thinking maybe I was just being an asshole😣.",

      "description": "Hi there! I'm fairly new to this subreddit, so please forgive me if I'm not the best at explaining the situation. Also, English *is* my mother language, but I live in a Spanish speaking country, so my spelling might be off. Sorry in advance!\n\nSo, here's my dilemma. I (16m) have two very close friends who we can refer to as '**A**' and '**S**' (17f,16f respectively) who recently got into an argument over a video-game. I am very close friends with both of them, to the point where I have talked to them about very personal stuff, and trusted them with very personal information, and vice-versa.\n\nThe argument began two days ago, after we exited the match and waited in lobby (I will explain which video-game and what happened in it at the end of the post.) and they both started arguing via text messages through their phones. We were all in our own homes, there was no direct conflict. Since I am close with both of them, they both started texting me (via the game client) and giving me each side of the story from the perspective they had about it. I will share below.\n\n**A perspective:** Recently, S has been very toxic and mean towards her, abandoning her to play with higher level friends and ignoring most of her invites. In real life, A claims that S plays victim very easily, always saying that she's in a really bad mood/going through very tough situations so she can avoid talking about the issues A may be going through. Also, S has been repetitively offending her and treating her as less with the tiniest of mistakes she may have, and has been accusing A of abandoning the friendship ever since she got a boyfriend. A is really tired of S being so toxic and wishes she would just go back to being the good friend she was in the past. A is willing to fix things with S, but she wants to take time and heal before confronting her again.\n\n**S perspective:** A stopped playing altogether since she had to study for her high-school finals, so she went a long time without connecting. S missed her, but she found higher level friends to whom she managed to adapt, (NOTE: S is a very good gamer) so she continuously played with them ever since. When A finally came back, she started rejecting S to go play with her boyfriend, which angered S for two reasons: 1) She was expecting A to come back and play with her, 2) S has had a crush on A for a long time. In the past, both of them have discussed the fact she has a crush on A, but it seems as if A does not care and continuously comments about her boyfriend and her relationship, much to the bothering of S. In real life, S claims that A most of the time doesn't listen to her problems, o makes less of them when she comments (by mocking or being condescending) about her family struggles, etc. S is really wanting to talk to A and fix things, but A doesn't answer her texts.\n\nSo, now that that's out of the way, I have but one thing to say. **Both perspectives are completely true, since I have witnessed them.** I have not taken sides, nor have I disclosed what either of them has said about one another to anyone, but, I confronted them both in person.\n\nWhat I planned to say to them was both sides of the story from a completely neutral viewpoint, but I failed to do so since I did comment about my perspectives of the situation, calling them out on what both of them have done wrong and trying to solve the problem as if I was a moderator. This, of course, angered them.\n\nI confirmed the victim role that S normally likes to play, I confirmed how A normally belittles others problems, and I commented on the whole thing being provoked by a video-game, (For the record, I find it extremely stupid to fight over a video-game, and I said that to them) I confirmed S being very toxic lately, I confirmed how A seemed to not care for the feelings S had for her, etc. In the end, I just called them out for their bullshit.\n\nThey were not aware that the other one had talked to me about the situation, which angered them more. Both of them had the impression that I was taking their side at the beginning, but I wasn't, therefore \"I broke their trust\". I explicitly told them both I wasn't going to take a side when they first started texting me about the situation, but apparently they didn't understand that. (I also clarify, in no moment did I talk badly about one of them to the other, I only read their side of the story, so I didn't talk trash at all.)\n\nSo in the end, neither of them want to fix things with each-other still and I am currently trying to communicate with both of them, to which I get little response. Am I the asshole for getting in to the argument?\n\n**About the video-game:** League of legends. S and A were going duo botlane, S was the ADC and A was the support. A was Brand, S was Twitch. A was stealing farm from S, so she got tilted early game. Me (Gnar toplane) and the jungler (Elise) ended up carrying the game while they both argued in the middle of the match. Fun fact, the whole team knows each other, our midlane (Lux) and the jungler know both of them, but they didn't get dragged in to the argument.\n\n**tl;dr:** Two friends got in an argument because of a video-game, I ended up being in the middle of it and called both of them out for their bullshit and tried to solve the problem as the moderator, both of them got mad at me in the end and now no one is talking. Both friends have valid reasons to be mad, but both are also in the wrong (Said that to both of them with evidence). Didn't talk trash, didn't take sides, clarified that at the begging to both of them. Still ended up being the asshole. Am I really?",

I’ve been planning on going on the trip even through physical therapy and my friends know about my knee issues. I now have to bail on the group (of about 10 people) and not go on the trip as I could make the tendon tear even worse by doing any physical activity.

There are bumps, but we are best friends and respect and love each other, which is why I feel bad for being upset right now. \n\nWe were planning to go on a short weekend long vacation to a big city nearby. We are both long distance in college, so this was a special trip. He came a couple days early as planned which was fine. But, I worried because a nasty stomach bug went around my school. I had it two weeks before he came and I disinfected my whole room, cleaned my sheets and blankets and clothes, and everything once I was better. I warned him heavily about this and we thought we'd be okay. \nFast forward to the night before, a friend offered us to take a hit out of a dab pen and we said okay. But, I remembered about the bug and that the person whos dab pen we were using was actually sick a lot more recently. I warned my bf not to and I said how contagious it could be and how he'd get sick. He said he'd be fine and did it anyways. Now, we are in our hotel and he's got the bug. Luckily, it is not as bad as it was two weeks ago for me and other people and I know he's tough and will be okay.  I got him water and went out into the city to find other drinks and bland food for when he gets better. I am not letting him know that I am a bit upset about the situation and that it could most likely have been avoided. I know he didn't fully realize that its that easy to get sick and I want him to get better.\nThe feeling of being an asshole comes from me getting upset with this and how I wish this could've been a fun trip. But Im trying not to show him I am crying that we are stuck here with him sick and me cleaning up the bathroom and taking care of him. I think he knows I am upset and I feel like an ass for making him feel guilty about this.",

      "description": "So HS was a weird time, my friend and I were really nerdy and didn't start doing any of the normal HS things (sex/drugs/drinking wise) until our senior year. Basically she randomly decided in the winter that she wanted a boyfriend and she picked this guy who had quietly liked her for two years. She constantly told me the relationship was awkward/not serious but that they were both trying it out and having fun because we had been so sheltered for so long. Thing is, he was madly in love with her. That's not saying he \"deserved\" more or any of that r/niceguy shit because if she doesn't have feelings for him she doesn't, and she shouldn't be expected to manufacture any for his sake! But I think she actively denied *his* feelings so she could use him to gain experience basically. They broke up a bit after prom, stayed in touch for a bit over the summer, would sometimes say hi if they ran into each other at the same party over summer/winter breaks, but really don't speak anymore as far as I know.\n\nI ran into him recently because we both happened to be in our hometown visiting our parents around the same time. Turns out we're both looking to head back to school within a year or two and actually have very similar research interests despite coming from kind of tangential majors/industries. We also have remarkably similar political views, like a lot of the same books and movies and music, both like camping...it's like a REALLY good fit. So we've been hanging out a bit (turns out we live in the same city as well, he just moved here and I've been here for almost 2 years), nothing explicitly romantic, but I really like how it feels and was thinking of asking him on a real date. Idk if he would even say yes, partly because it's been really platonic so far so maybe I'm misreading things and partly because of course he knows about my friendship with his ex, and of COURSE I would talk to her about it before doing anything. I'm only even considering it because their relationship was so, casual almost? But WIBTA?",

      "description": "I just started college last fall and the first person I met was a guy we will call Bark. We became friends the first day even though I really thought he was incredibly annoying. He told me and fellow hall mates all these stories about great things he has done in his life, but us not knowing who the hell he was, had no option but to believe it. Here are his lies:\n\nPhase One:\n\nWhen Bark and I first met our big friend group we had a night of some deep convo with each other. Bark confessed that he had an issue with body dysmorphia and he hated how \"fat\" he was. He isn't a big guy, just a little husky. Before I get backlash on that, I am bigger than he is. That isn't the lie. He claimed that when he had his big soccer injury(thats the next lie) that he had gained all this weight and became \"fat.\" Well a little investigation into his instagram shows that he was never skinny and always a little chubby, and is currently not the biggest he's ever been. Not saying that maybe he does hate his weight, but it is a lie that he gained a bunch of weight all the sudden.\n\nNext lie is his soccer career. Bark claimed that he was ranked top in the state and that he was going to get a soccer scholarship. He played goalie and one game he had a rough injury that blew out his knee and that he was in the hospital for months. And this is when he gained all his weight. Well...a friend of ours went back home with Bark one weekend and he got some alone time with Bark's hometown friends. Come to find out what I just told you happened to Bark's best friend, not Bark.\n\nTheres more and more lies, but these will suffice.\n\nPhase Two will focus on lies he told between the start of college and the present.\n\nBark falls in love Tracy(fake name) when she has not really done anything for him to do so. She hung out with him for a weekend and even made out with him. That was all though. No clothes taken off or anything. This leads to a tremendous amount of drama that all caused a mass of stress on Tracy. She tried being a friend and this stretched out for weeks and weeks, but every time they were alone he would try to kiss and even more, he would try to seduce her. Saying things like, \"Were young\" and \"Were perfect for each other.\" I could keep going but I think the picture is easy to see.\n\nPhase Three is going to show the fallout. It is kind of short but important.\n\nBark goes to his new friends that he shared the sex lie to for solace after Tracy shuts him out of her life. Proceeds to tell all of them that I have been bullying him, not giving him that space he needs, and pressuring him into doing things that he doesn't want to do. All of this as a lie, as almost every meet up since we first met has been orchestrated by him. I have never stuck out my arm and tried to talk to him.\n\nEither way he claims he is now super depressed and having bad thoughts but wants to be friends again. Am I the asshole for not giving him another chance and being friends with him again?",

      "description": "To do more to hp themselves. \n\nTo give some context to this story. My best friend lives a few hours away from me whom I'll refer to as K, she has lost her job and has been unemployed for a few months with a shitty paying, inconsistent babysitting gig, married with a young kid and is young mother. With only her husband income which just barely covers rent and bills, things are tight with them which I know about. \n\nTo the relavant story. We text a lot and we are talking and she is telling me that she has nothing to eat and hadn't eaten for a while. I decided I'll buy her some groceries to help her out, but since I live far away and cant drive to her, I just order some stuff she asked for on walmart and set it for pick up. She was against this at first because she hates asking for help but I got her to relent. Originally she said morning the next day would be good for pick up, so that is what I set it up as. So I set it up for pickup of 8-9, next morning i get up at 10, she has not said a word to me since the night before, turns out I forgot to actually pay for the groceries, so I pay for it and ask when is a good time for her to pick it up. No response so i set it for 6. \n\nShe finally gets back to me and said she wasnt really happy with the time since the kinds she baby sits get picked up around that time but I checked and it's fine if the pickup is pate so it wasnt a big deal. We chat about other stuff for a while, I asked if she picked it up to no response. Next day I check the order status and asked if it was picked up to which she said no. She was fired and was drinking that night, to which the story changed to she quit to she is going to do it one more time and quit after that (I honestly have no clue what's going on with her babysitting thing) so I check and it can still be picked up. To pick up the food it seems you have to check in you have to call or use the app, she refuses the call (because she doesnt like calling people, but who does like talking on the phone) and is mad at me for not wanting to give her my password to that account, and a big fight happened over that and I'm saying if she isnt willing to do small stuff like that I wont help her out anymore if she isnt willing to help herself.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking and telling K that? K does not give a reason for refusing to calm but besides simply just hating to talk on the phone but in my opinion, I would do a short phone call for free groceries, regardless of whatever financial situation I'm in. \n\nSorry in advance for any spelling error, mobile sucks.",

      "description": "No, not on the regular. I'll explain the situation.\n\nMy BF has a family friend that is practically his Grandfather. \"Granpa\" describes my SO as an \"adopted son/grandson.\" Granpa has invited me to stay the night on the couch tonight since the heat at our place will be wonky until the 28th and it's supposed to be especially cold tonight. I didn't ask or hint, he offered as we were getting ready to leave. I accepted, it was admittedly a relief. BF normally stays when I stay but he works third shift and had to work tonight.\n\nThe only toilet is in Granpa's en suite. His tub/shower is in the other end of the house with access from the kitchen. About an hour after BF left for work,\n I had to pee, so I went to the toilet (like normal) in the en suite bathroom. When I got out of the bathroom, Granpa had followed be back there and was naked, laying on his bed, stroking his dick and asked if I wanted to \"lend a hand\" as I *very briskly* left the room.\n\nI had to pee again. I'm not peeing outside, there are neighbors here. I am **not** going back in that room, even though I know logically he's probably done by now. *shudder* I know all the \"harm\" that can be done has already happened...\n\nYeah, I peed in the tub/shower. Just sat on the edge and peed there. I rinsed and bleachy wiped it after, though. Obviously, I think this is an occasion where an exception to the rule can be made, but I can also understand my way of handling this may be the outrageous choice to an outsider. Especially since I would never ever want to have to tell anyone I know that I did that. I try to live by \"if you don't do shit you're ashamed of, you won't have to lie\" and this feels like a violation of that, so I'm having a small moral crisis on this.",

An ok guy but lazy and moody (the moods are fine it's the unfiltered attitude I hate).\n\nSo here's the issue: he goes into the employee bathroom (the only bathroom in store, we're in a mall) and takes and hour long \"crap\". Then does like 20 minutes of work and then another hour long \"crap\". Basically unless his organs are failing on a daily basis he's getting out of work. Now I know that some people take long in the bathroom heck I take like 15 minutes to do my business but this is insanity.\n\nSo would I be the ass if I limited to 20 minutes at most? Keep in mind other people need to use that toilet too and we can't leave him here because he's technically not hired by our company so sometimes people have to hold it for like an hour.",

He was very sweet, and I liked spending time with him. He lived an hour and a half a way and would drive up all the time and stay at my house. My pet had a vet appointment near him (long story but no exotic vet in my area) and he came up for a day, we drove down the next, and drove back the day after so my pet could heal from surgery. My nana died the day we drove down and I wasn’t in the best mood. The day after this was my birthday. So at this point we had spent the last four days together. For my birthday we got lunch and went to dinner with my family. Then i wanted to go to a bar with my best friend. He got very upset that I didn’t want to spend my birthday with him (even though I did, and several days prior) and stormed out of my house. I angrily texted him at like 3am a little drunk that I was mad at him for making my birthday about him. He ignored me for four days until he called me last night and broke up with me (the day before Valentine’s day.) I understand that he drove a lot for me, and I thanked him a ton and offered gas money, but I feel like this is a weird thing to be dumped over? \n\nAm I the Asshole? should i have just not celebrated my birthday with my friend?

      "description": "So my wife and I have been married for roughly 15 years. She and I really haven't been \"traditionally\" religious , her being a non-practicing Pagan and me being agnostic/atheist. She recently realized that her spirituality has been lacking in her life and started to delve heavily into the Pagan side of things. I promised her my full support of this. \n\nFast forward about 6 months and her parents, who are staying with us over the holidays and are very \"traditionally\" religious, got invited by our neighbors to attend their Church. They started going regularly, and my wife begrudgingly went once. Since then, she hasn't stopped talking about how much she loves this church. \n\nSo, being the supporting husband that I am, I go with her on Sundays. I sing along, close my eyes during prayer, and mostly keep my opinions to myself. Now, the church has started Bible studies at people's homes. She just came back saying how she would want me to come. I politely declined, and she understood. \n\nHowever, now she tells me that one of the groups is in the same town as us but she doesn't feel comfortable walking at night (she doesn't have her license). I repeated my stance of not wanting to attend, and she told me that how I said I didn't want to go made her feel like she's dragging me to the \"seventh circle of hell .\" \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go and drawing lines on how much churchiness I have in my life?

      "description": "So like 10 years ago I worked at a place and became friends with a coworker, Charity.\n\nAfter I stopped working there, Charity and I stayed friends and would see each other for lunch or to watch movies or something every couple months. We weren't like \\*best\\* friends, but we were decent friends.\n\nSo then Charity asked me to move in with her at her parents house. Her parents were living at another one of their properties and weren't home much, and they didn't like her being home alone (we were both like 20-21). Me being a dumbass and thinking it would be cool to not live with my own parents anymore said yea sure.\n\nWe got along decent at first but it pretty quickly began to fracture. She was needy and insecure. She hated when my boyfriend would come over, so I stopped bringing him over except maybe once a week and would start going over his house, but she hated that too and would passive aggressively text me about how I was never home. I did most of the cooking and a good portion of the dishes (including dishes of hers) but any time she had to wash a dish of mine she'd get pissy about it. If I had to leave a dish in the sink before heading to school or work I would have texts by the time school or work was done asking if I'd be home that night to wash it and how \"we need a better system\". I told her I will gladly wash all my own dishes and to leave them there for me to do when I get home. She washed them before I got home anyway and then complained that I wasn't holding up my end of the deal. The whole time I lived with her I was literally the only one who ever cleaned our shared bathroom (even when she had drunk friends over who puked on the floor), and I also vacuumed the floors and swiffered the downstairs once a week minimum, but she was always saying that everything was so dirty (while not doing anything to clean). \n\nOne night her and her sister went and picked up her parents from the airport. They had just gone on vacation or something. I was in the house with my boyfriend and we were in the living room watching a movie. We had just made a pizza or something and some of the ingredients were still on the counter. They came inside and it was like the air turned to ice. I was like \"Hey! Welcome back! Sorry about the mess, we literally just ate dinner, I'll clean it up here in a minute unless you're hungry and want me to make you something?\" And they just kind of were like \"Oh... no.\" I asked how the trip was, they said \"Oh... fine.\" and then Charity's sister was like \"We really need some PRIVATE time. As a FAMILY.\" \n\nSo we gathered up the slices of pizza and went upstairs. I wasn't going to bother cleaning the counter when they needed PRIVACY. I texted Charity to let me know when they were done so I could clean up. I never got a text back. A few hours later I heard everyone go to bed and me and my bf went downstairs and everything had been cleaned so we left and went to his house. I stayed away for a couple days and made an exit plan.\n\nWhen I came back to the house nobody was home and I immediately started packing. I heard Charity come home but she immediately went to her room and shut the door. I kept packing and each finished box went straight in my car. I took the first load of stuff to my mom's and came back and the next day did some more. The whole time my own door was open, I didn't care if she saw me leaving. But she stayed hidden. She left for work a few hours earlier than normal and wouldn't come home until very late when she knew I'd be in bed. Finally we bumped into each other on the third day. All I had left were two boxes, my bed, my nightstand, and my clothes. I was doing laundry so I didn't have to take anything back dirty and she caught me in the hallway and said \"Listen... I don't think things are working out...\" I said \"Save it. I'm already moving my stuff. I'll be gone tomorrow.\" All of a sudden she got super sad \"OH I'm so sorry!\" I just said \"I'm not.\" and went back to what I was doing. \n\nMy mom came the next day to take the bed because it wouldn't fit in my car. I saw Charity exactly once - she came in and said hi to my mom (and only my mom) and asked her to move the car so she could leave. Mom moved the car and Charity left. \n\nWhen I got back to my mom's I unfriended her on all social media and just went on with my life like she never existed, and she did the same.\n\nSo here we are 6 years later and suddenly I have a message. She saw me comment on a mutual friend's post and was going to friend request me but I don't have that option enabled so she decided to message and see how everything is going for me and \"check in\". \n\nI know the adult thing is to just ignore and maybe block and hope she gets the message, but I am still super bitter about the whole thing. Even if I don't do it in a \\*mean\\* way, I want her to know that her reaching out is being actively rejected. I want to tell her something like \"I'm really not interested in talking to you.\" But if I did that.... WIBTA?\n\nTL;DR: Roomed with a \"friend\" who was a shitty roommate and avoidant and passive aggressive. She waited until I was moving out to tell me living together \"wasn't working\" and then got upset when I pointed out I was already moving and was happy to be leaving. She messaged me wanting to reconnect. I want to tell her to fuck herself (even if it's in a nice way, like \"I'm not interested.\") because I want her to know I'm rejecting her offer. WIBTA?",

      "description": "Hey all,\n\nA buddy of mine is getting married this upcoming spring and we’ve been dealing with some drama regarding his groomsmen. \n\nThe 4 of us have been in a group chat for about 8 years now and although we don’t live near each other anymore we still communicate regularly through text and like to play Xbox when we can get on. \n\nLast summer when my friend Pat told us he proposed to his girlfriend he immediately asked us all to be groomsmen which we all excitedly accepted. \n\nNow cue to 2 weeks ago. Pat texted me separate from the group that he was kicking the other two friends out of the wedding party. His reasons were that the one friend was unreliable and the other “probably couldn’t afford the expenses” because he’s a musician. \n\nI didn’t think those were valid reasons and he shouldn’t have asked them and then backtracked on his offer, but it is his wedding and he can do what he wants. The only thing I said he should do was just make up an excuse as to why they wouldn’t be in the wedding party. My suggestion was to say that his brother needed to be involved and the brides brother wanted to be in the party or something along those lines. That way he could save face and it wouldn’t be awkward for the group. \n\nThen he unexpectedly left the group chat. Everyone was reasonably confused because nobody has left the chat for almost 8 years. He refused to respond to any texts for the past 2 weeks from any of us. \n\nAfter 3 unanswered texts I finally texted him asking if he was alright and he called me. He said he was just busy but then restated his reasons for not inviting them and told me he didn’t think they would care if they weren’t involved anymore and wasn’t even going to invite them to the wedding!\n\nIt’s putting serious strain on all of our friendships because the other two friends don’t know what’s going on and I feel guilty keeping it from them because I’m closer with one of the other friends than I am with Pat. \n\nI told him over the phone that if he didn’t at least tell them that they weren’t in the wedding party anymore that I didn’t want to be involved either because I felt it was extremely disrespectful to just ghost our lifelong friends without good reason.\n\nThis did not go over well obviously and I was told literally that I’m an asshole.\n\nIf I’m the asshole I can accept that maybe I should just shut up because it’s not my wedding. But on the other hand I feel like I owe some loyalty to my other friends as well. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "(So there's alot to unpack but I'll be clear, what I'm trying to get here is perspective and resolve to make a life decision here. Unbiased perspectives are appreciated and why I'm here.)\n\nThis is a bit of a follow up from my previous post where I got upset at my mother for spending my money on a \"gift\" for me. In similar fashion a fight broke out over the same thing: a check came in on my name for an overpayment of escrow on my old house I sold (about 400$). \n\nTurns out my mother had plans for the check, and demanded i sign it and give it to her as she needed the money. When I said no, its a check in my name, she proceeded to go into a tirade of how ungrateful i am, how much she sacrificed etc etc. This isn't where I'm looking for justification, its the next part. \n\nI said enough, I'm tired of the garbage and that I wanted out of this family unit and that I could support myself and do my own thing. The implication is I would sell the house I'm in, give my mother the equity she left in the house, take the value above her equity (as its still my house in my name, my loan and I've made the payments). Now this is something I said in the heat of the moment and I haven't talked to her since, but truth be told I do want out. \n\nSo i need to weigh the karmic balance, my relationship with my mother has been so up and down I cannot tell what's right anymore but she really has generally been a positive influence and I don't know how to feel about kicking her, her boyfriend (and his mom), and my little sister out of the house. \n\nIn order:\n\n- she helped to pay for part of my tuition\n\n- she helped me move out of my father's place who wanted me to take over his business\n\n- after college she let me stay at her place for a year\n\n- she worked as realtor/flipee for my first house (recently sold) and left some (20k) equity in it so i could get a house at a young age\n\n- 2 years after that, as she was breaking up w her s/o she threatened to sell my house to get her equity out unless i let her and lil sis move in. I realize she didnt legally have a right to the equity then but I felt I owed her and agreed\n\n- about 6 months into the stay at my place she found another flip opportunity and got a beautiful house for under market\n\n- she left about 60k in equity at the time and i purchased the second house\n\n- the agreement was i pay the mortgage (2k) she pay utilities (about 600), and its my house\n\n- 6 months into the new house, without my consent her new boyfriend started staying over consistently \n\n- about 1 month after they started dating he moves in\n\n- 6 months after that his mother moves in (its a big house and can certainly accommodate everyone, but they only contribute the utilities)\n\nSo here we are, all I ever wanted was my own place, peace of mind, solitude and my own life. On one hand I have benefited financially because of my mother, and I don't think she's an absolutely awful person. At the same time I wonder how much I have to repay her for all she did in raising me, putting me through school, and helping me purchase homes. \n\nAITA for saying enough is enough and that I just want to live my own life, and selling the home that 4 other people live in? Or do I need to wait it out until my little sister finishes high school in 5 years (which was my original timeline). I truly don't think my lot in life would have been as good without my mother, so I do truly feel lost in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, i was walking towards the subway and this really poor lady with her kid was selling ballpoint pens near the stairs to the entrance of the subway. The lady was sitting down with her stocks of pens and her daughter (probably 5-6 years old) was wandering around trying to sell the pens. They were there trying to earn an honest living, and not begging for shit.\nShe tried to sell me the pens(really cheap, 2 for 10 rupees or 14 cents) but i didn't wanted to, so i firmly said no and tried to get past her. She grabbed me and really tried to force me to buy those pens from her. It was all like an act of desperation at this point. And that really threw me off and i stood firm on the decision of not buying those pens from her at any cost.\n\nNow, there are couple of reasons i did that.\n\n1. She started with the phrase \" Buy this, so i can have food\". And i live in a 3rd world country, i know that that is the go to dialogue of these people to sell shit. Sometimes what they do is build a community and sell different stuff in crowded places and send these children to sell stuff using this go to dialogue, and if you fall for one, then the one that sold you their stuff will tell the other children with different products to go up to you and try to sell their stuff to you. And they will really get on to your tail and become very persistent.\n\n2. After 2 or 3 firm rejections she became desperate and grabbed my legs and tried to force me for the purchase. \nAnd i was like, if she gets away with this trick this time she will know that this works and will do this to everyone she can. If even 2 or 3 people after me fall for this, she will make it her go to act. And that is not the level of low self worth any human should hit.\n\nI thought that by doing this i would give her a lesson, and make her reconsider what she was doing, that grabbing onto someones feet in desperation to get money will not always work.\n\nBut deep down i still feel bad and like an asshole for doing that to her. Although not much that 10 rupees would have helped her in one way or another.\n\nAnd P.S a girl, specially a really young one grabbing onto/ touching your feet/legs are a big no no in my religion so even that's kind of weighing down on me.",

      "title": "AITA for insisting that my best friends needs medical help even if it ruins our friendship and makes her feel terrible?",
      "description": "My best friend has not seen a doctor in 10 years.  She is 22 years old and has never seen a gynecologist. She is not a virgin and had multiple sex partners. Those sex partners both slept with women in the past who have had HPV type 18 and 16. These types are the most cancerous ones and also usually completely asymptomatic. \n\nShe had suffered severe trauma last year and has PTSD. Refuses to go to therapy, and thinks her mental issues are not that big of a deal. \n\nShe is usually strong and controls herself, until she bursts out and all the mental issues explode in her at once. When she bursts, we are talking massive breakdowns that make her fall ill and bedridden. Only when she is in that state she is able to express her true feelings regarding the trauma. But after she recovers, she usually reverts back to denial and pretending to act normal.\n\nShe also has stomach problems, probably gastritis. Does not get any medicine for it, but “handles” her flares with camomile tea. \n\nHer family is very “natural remedy” oriented and very put off by modern medicine as well. They do not consider that having not had a blood test in 10 years is abnormal, nor that their fully adult daughter has never been tested for uterus cancer or breast cancer. \n\nWe argue about this every day. She begged me to just stop asking her to see a doctor. She told me that if I don’t stop, she will simply not be able to be friends with me anymore. Every time I bring it up she straight up goes into panic mode and turns into a complete rage fueled beast. She tells me I am hurting her and I am the cause of her distress.  \n\nHowever, my stubbornness is getting the best of me and it got to the point where I would rather destroy our friendship for the small chance she gets a reality check and realizes just how wrong her mentality is and at what cost her negligence and ignorance came with. The worst part is, every time she has a breakdown, it is me who has to clean up the mess, take care of her and nurse her. I have to hear her cry and scream for hours in pain just because she refuses to take any painkiller. \n\nSometimes she has insomnia for days due to the PTSD, refuses to take any sleeping aid apart from valerian root tea. I have literally an entire stock of various sleeping pills and no matter who much I try to teach her, explain to her about the substance and how it acts on the brain etc etc she still won’t take anything. It severely impacts her academic life. \n\nWe argue every day about it. I begged her to at least get a full blood test, and a gynecologist visit for a full range of tests, most importantly a pap smear. I even offered her to pay for a couple of therapy sessions with a very highly ranked therapist just to try it out. She flat out refused and told me she feels healthy and nothing is wrong with her.\n\nI am making her feel miserable but truth be told, I’d rather lose my best friend than accept her ignorant behavior and mentality. \n\n",

I started chatting with this woman - she was great: funny, snarky, a bit sarcastic, and just overall a blast to talk to. We agreed to meet at this local Italian place about halfway between us.

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons; tl;dr on the bottom. Apologies for the wall of text, however the issue has been bugging me for weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit of background: I am epileptic and take medication to control my seizures. I used to be in a commited relationship 2-3 years ago, and at this time I was taking contraceptive pills. I had some issues with that, and it turned out that I *cannot* take any sort of hormonal contraception (that includes plasters, injections, and the pills) and coils are not advised for women who haven't had a child yet. My epilepsy medication drives my metabolism nuts, so any hormones that I take are \"burnt\" so if I wanted to take hormonal contraception, I'd need an extreme amount of hormones or decrease the dose of my epilepsy medication, and I don't want to do either. *Condoms are the only available form of contraception for me* (I don't want to risk getting pregnant by weak pull out game).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain story: Me (22F) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for about 7 months now. Whenever we wanted to have sex, at some point after the foreplay I'd take out the condom and let him put it on. He'd struggle and that was causing him to lose his erection. It kept happening over the couple of times we were staying at mine, and got to the point that after it happened again I bursted into tears and asked what was wrong with me. I've had sexual partners before and it would never happen to me; no man has lost erection while being with me, so I began to wonder if I was the problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought a pack of larger condoms, they were fitting better, however after a couple of minutes my BF would lose erection once inside me. The situation started to be killing me, and after some point I suggested that my bf could get some viagra. He didn't seem to consider the idea completely stupid, and I was hoping that he'd buy the blue pills and we could have sex normally. That, however, didn't happen, and the next time he was staying at mine, the \"it's hard, *aaaaaaand it's gone*\" situation happened again. I was very upset and angry, but didn't want to aggravate the situation by having a hissy fit over it or be a b\\*tch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we were recently planning on seeing each other (which would result in staying at mine), I asked him again to get the blue pills. He ingored my request until the following day, when we actually saw each other. I asked him about the pills, and he said that he hadn't bought them. We had a pretty serious conversation about why he doesn't want to take viagra. He said that it had been a couple of years when his last regular sexual partner had to use condoms, and the partners he had before me were on some sort of hormonal contraception, so he wasn't used to using condoms anymore. Apparently the condoms I had in the first place weren't comfortable for him and he was getting so stressed while putting them on, that it would cause him to lose erection. Now, even though the new condoms are better fit, he is constantly worried that he'd lose erection, and this stress does make him lose erection, creating a vicious cycle. Apart from that, he is generally stressed/anxious in his life, and the day-to-day worries overwhelm him anyway. He claims that he needs to sort things out outside of our relationship to regain some stability in his life and that this would be the fix for his erection struggles; I said I'd help him if he needs any help with his mental health and offered support. Lastly, me asking him to buy viagra made him feel like half of a man and *he doesn't want to take medication for someone*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim losing the erection make me feel like half of a woman, too. I have a strong sex drive and lack of sex when I am clearly willing and ready and can't get it, makes me feel terrible and undesirable. I cannot do anything about my epilepsy and my inability to take hormonal contraception, and, for my own safety, I will not take the pills again. On one hand, I understand where he is coming from with the unwillingness to take medication for someone, I respect this decision (because I am in many aspects the same), however imho, viagra seems like the best option for now. I did some reading about it, and viagra is the best thing to use when a man is under 40 and is struggling to keep the erection, and is especially advised while experiencing stressful events in life in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I be the asshole if I tell him again to take viagra? I do have feelings for the guy, the couple of times we had sex (less than 5 times over the period of however long we're dating...), I loved it. I enjoy having sex, I enjoy having sex with him, I want the both of us to be happy and not feel any less of a man/woman. Is there anything I can do apart from worrying that I am the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**: I'm epileptic and can't take hormonal contraception; condoms are the safest option for me. Condoms, however, make my boyfriend lose his erection and we don't have sex even though both of us are in the mood. I asked him twice to get viagra to help him keep the erection while having the condom on, but he refuses claiming that a) it makes him feel less of a man and b) he doesn't want to take medication for someone instead for himself.

      "title": "AITA for being annoyed that my boyfriend doesn’t wear the expensive coats I’ve bought him?",
      "description": "To give some context, my boyfriend and I both like investing in nice items for our wardrobe. Two years ago, he tried on a very nice down jacket at Patagonia. It’s one of their nicer, more technical jackets - extremely light and perfect for cold weather. At the time, this jacket was out of his budget ($450), but he kept trying it on and saying how great it was, so I offered to buy it for him as a Christmas present.  \n\nHe didn’t wear it out much the remainder of the winter, and while I was sort of disappointed that I spent all this money on something he didn’t even wear, I figured he would wear it more the next year. \n\nThis past year, he’s talked consistently about wanting to invest in a specific wool topcoat, which retails for $550. He even went into the store in London when we were there in the Spring to try it on, and planned on purchasing it on Black Friday as it would be 30% off. Seeing as I didn’t have anything else in mind to gift him for Christmas this year, I offered again to purchase the topcoat for him on Black Friday for Christmas. \n\nHe was super excited about it and extremely thankful. I told him “you didn’t really wear the Patagonia jacket I got you much, and I wish you did. If I were to buy this jacket for you ,how often would you wear it?” and he said “probably 2 or 3 times a week in the colder months.” It sounded like he would get his cost per wear out of the jacket, so I was more than happy to buy it for him as a gift. \n\nWell, it’s been 3 months since he’s had the wool jacket and he’s probably worn it twice. He’s worn the Patagonia one maybe twice as well this winter, and chooses to wear this other jacket he bought for himself (a lighter down jacket) every day instead. Even when it was very snowy and below freezing in our city last week, he chose to just layer flannel instead of wearing either of the coats I’ve gifted him. \n\nToday, we were driving to the grocery store and I asked him why he didn’t wear the coats, to which he couldn’t come up with an answer other than “I just don’t feel like it” I then told him I was hurt that he would ask for expensive gifts and then not get any use out of it, as it feels like he doesn’t value my money. He told me that I was out of line, that the items aren’t mine and that I have no say over what he does with the things I give him. He even said that he doesn’t annoy me about the gifts he buys me (he bought me a very nice leather handbag that I had asked for for Christmas), except I reminded him that I wear that handbag almost every day that I’m not at work. He then turned the car back to our house, stormed inside, and came back wearing one of the jackets, but not without telling me that I was insane and he was “so over me.” \n\nAm I being the asshole here for being disappointed and annoyed that he doesn’t use the expensive items that I bought him, especially since they’re things he asked for?

      "description": "So i don't know how else to word the title where I don't immediately sound like an asshole but here's the run down. \n\nI was recently in a terrible relationship for 4 months or so with a guy I met off Tinder (already a red flag, I know). We didn't click emotionally, even from the start, he was extremely immature with his own and my own feelings and for a lot of the relationship I felt myself putting in more than I was getting back. The entire fiasco was toxic for the both of us and I can recognize my own faults but through argument and conversation I can definitely say that he doesn't understand how his own bs also helped crumble the relationship from the start, rather pinning the blame entirely on me. \n\nBut last November for an early Christmas, I bought him this rather expensive sweater and a childhood book of mine (A Hat Full of Sky by Terry Pratchett for those who are interested) neither of which were well received. I wasn't hurt that he didn't have the same taste as me in fashion or book choices but I was deeply hurt that whenever he stayed at my place he would attempt to leave the gifts behind. It's hard to explain the nuances of this but somehow no matter how hard I tried to make the gifts stick with him it would always end up back at mine, unworn and unread. This went on for a month. I knew he didn't like them but he could at least do me the decency of keeping it somewhere in the back of his closet in his own home. \n\nSo now that we've been broken up for about 2 weeks and I've been left with many emotional scars, he's been texting me every now and then demanding for his stuff back. The only things of his that I have at mine are the sweater and book. And when I explained to him that he didn't even want them in the first place, which we both definitely knew, he said that \"It's not any of my business to know why he wants them\" along with berating me about what a terrible person I was etcetc. Basic angry ex stuff. I told him that I will give him his stuff when I am ready and have free time (which I mostly don't) he can't seem to accept that I'm not ready to see him again or even talk to him for that matter. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why suddenly, as soon as it's over he wants the gifts that I bought him back. When even if he walked away without them he would've lost nothing (I used my money after all). On one hand I can see how it's a dick move to hold onto items that are technically his but according to the receipt and his previous attitude towards them they're really not. \n\nAny insights would be appreciated, it's hard to admit if you're being an asshole when you're in the midst of the entire shitshow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

After high school i rationally chose to study something that matched my \"capabilities\". Now i am paralyzed by lack of motivation.  Had many ups and downs. When i lose hope i find a way to pick myself up. Talk extenisvely with close friends and family. Reading multiple self help books and tried to put in practise. Seek out professional help. Been seeing a psychologist for 2 years. Nonetheless i keep falling back and the lows get lower. Suicidal thoughts a year ago. Recover and push on. Now i am back down and i dont want to improve anymore. I dont want to seek solutions. I want everything to go to shit.. my parents tell me to get it together. I try to explain them that i cant because of how i feel, but it doesnt resonate with them. They support me if i want to stop studying, but tell me i should do something else. Am i the asshole for wanting to tell them that i dont want to make my life better now. Should/Can I expect them to understand my feelings, which seem to be contradictory to their core beliefs?",

      "description": "So I have been paying for my Netflix and Hulu for a long time. Netflix I watch a lot, but Hulu I barely look at.\n\nNow the other day I did the math just for the cost of Netflix every month for 6 years and ...it came out to a lot. Like it really added up. That’s not even including the Hulu account. \n\nThe thing is... I don’t even use Hulu, I literally only keep it because my parents and brother watch my account. But that leaves me paying $12 a month, for other people to enjoy television. I only haven’t gotten rid of it because I was scared they’d be mad if I did, but at the same time they’ve been enjoying it for free for so long, how is that fair?\n\nAlso Netflix is about to bump up to something like  $15 a month to have more than 2 people watch it at a time. I currently have like 4 people not including myself watching on my account (my parents, my brother and his girlfriend). My boyfriend though currently has nobody on his account and has kindly said I could use his for free, which would give me a nice break from having other people mooch off of my account that I’ve been paying the total cost for since I was literally a teenager.\n\nSo please, if I delete either or both of these accounts to save some money, will I be the asshole? I don’t want to disappoint people or make them mad at me but rounding the Netflix costs to just $13 a month I calculated that over the past 6 years I’ve payed $936+ for Netflix that everyone uses but nobody helps pay for, and as for Hulu I don’t even use it and would not miss it. Please give me your honest opinions, they’re all older than me with their own jobs/money, is this really a fair deal?\n\nTLDR: been paying for Netflix for 6 years, Hulu for about a year or two, want to get rid of them since I don’t need them but scared my family will be mad since they use my accounts, but nobody has helped with the money at all.",

      "description": "tl;dr: Group of 3 girls enters a lecture late and tries to get me to move to the very edge of a lecture hall, then don't even stay for the full lecture.\n\nI entered the lecture hall and grabbed a seat 10 minutes before the lecture started (my uni starts classes 10 minutes after the hour), and my friend (who I usually sit with) told me that he would be a little bit late, and so I set my stuff on a chair beside me to save it. Because I knew my friend would be late, I chose a seat in the middle of the side section of the lecture hall. This row had 7 seats, and I sat in the 4th seat in from the aisle. Five minutes after this, a girl entered and sat at the end of the row (aisle seat), and another student sat at the very end of the row (ie right beside the wall).\n\nFive minutes after the lecture began (ie 15 minutes after I sat down), a group of three girls enters and tries to sit with the girl in the aisle seat. Since there were only two seats between me and the aisle seat, they asked if I would mind moving over. I responded (in a soft tone) that I actually would mind, and didn't want to move over. The girl that asked me looks visibly surprised, and they decide to split up. Immediately after, one of the other girls in this group asks if they can sit beside me on the other side. The first girl had already sat down on my right side, and I was still saving a seat for my friend, so I replied that I was saving the seat.\n\n5-10 minutes after this, my friend gets to the lecture, and takes his seat beside me. For an entire 45 minutes during the lecture, I could tell that these girls were messaging each other about me, undoubtedly saying what an asshole I am.\n\nDuring the lecture, I notice that the girl sitting on my right isn't even listening to the lecture, and is busy either checking facebook or working on some assignment.\n\nAfter the first 50 minutes had passed in the lecture, we had our mid-lecture break (as the lecture was 2 hours), and all 4 of these girls get up and leave, and do not return.\n\nso, all in all, AITA for not moving to accommodate a group of latecomers (when some of them aren't even in the class)?",

I have gotten to know them fairly well and we hang out often. \n\nRecently my bf’s friend confided in him that he cheated on his gf while he was on a trip home visiting his family. Rather than tell his gf this, he has decided it is too late to save the relationship and has decided to break up with her. For the past two weeks they have been fighting and it is heartbreaking to hear about. The gf doesn’t understand what is going on. They have been together for a couple years at this point and all of a sudden her bf is insisting the relationship is over. She asked him if he cheated and he told her he wouldn’t answer the question. \n\nMy bf has been staying over at my place to give them room, but his friend even asked him to stay over there the other night to “ease the tension”, which I think really means “help him avoid his gf confronting him.” \n\nI think at this point the gf deserves the truth. She clearly wants a legitimate explanation for why all of a sudden her long term relationship is ending. It is just a really sad situation. On top of that, the bf is now planning to pursue a long distance relationship with the girl he cheated with because he thinks she’s “the one”. I think this is ridiculous. He just MAJORLY fucked up.. i don’t think it’s the time to start another relationship. Especially another relationship that began with cheating! \n\nBasically this guy is being really shitty and hurtful to his gf. Would I or my bf be the asshole for telling the gf what’s up? I don’t know that it’s my place to say anything and my bf feels loyalty to his friend who confided in him, but I just feel bad for her. If she asks me or him directly, would we be the asshole for telling her the truth? ",

      "description": "Long story short, I have been diagnosed bipolar with severe PTSD from a shit childhood. \n\nAbout a year into our marriage, shortly after we had our son, I started cruising personal adds on Craigslist (not a thing anymore), signing up for hookup sites for men and women under hidden emails. \n\nMy wife should be a private detective because she found everything. \n\nShe is hysterical and unreasonable about all of this. I never met up with anyone. I did flirt and tell some people I was leaving her and didn’t love my wife. I did it for that rush of excitement that I don’t get from her.\n\nSince our baby, she is all about him. Don’t get me wrong, I get it. But I get bored and curious. Sometimes I will meet people online, leave the house while the family is sleeping and have great conversations with great people over the phone. \n\nShe thinks it’s inappropriate because of the things I say, but it’s all bullshit because it is online. \n\nI think she needs to understand that in my eyes it’s not cheating. Luckily, she isn’t that kind of person and is faithful to a fault. I wish she would get over it and let me be me while she handles shit at home. Why is that so bad?",

      "description": "Ok so this is not one of those posts where i really dont expect anyone to actually think i'm an asshole, but just want validation. I'm 80% sure i'm not the asshole, but i can kind of see that some people might think i am the asshole. So please let me know what you think. \n\nSo i've been in hospital recently for a medical issue, and i've had to check in with the GP (general doctor at local medical centre) for monitoring and whatnot. With full time work getting to a GP can be a pain, but luckily my local medical centre opens at 7am, and that leaves me JUST enough time if i can get out of there by 7.30am, so i can get to work on time. \n\nSo this morning i decide that is what i will do, i arrive and park at 6.45am, to find already about 6-7 people standing around the entrance at in the street. We're all sort of grouped around the door in a circle, some close to the door, some near the path, but all within about 4-5 metres of the door. A couple people arrive after me as well. \n\nSo i come along and stand around like everyone else, and at 7am an employee opens up and everyone of course congregates to walk in. Now since this is a single door way, and people are standing kind of in a circle, obviously there's not particular order people are going to walk in. I was obviously keen to get in the door and start lining up, i was by no means the first through the door, i did not run up to the door or get aggressive, i just walked in and filed in with the rest of the people. There was no semblance of a line, no one was lining up, they were just standing in a group. \n\nAs soon as i walk in this old guy actually grabs my shoulder and says 'This other gentleman got here before you' and points to the younger guy walking in behind me. The younger guy actually says 'don't worry about it'. I just look at the old guy like wtf, because i've never been grabbed by a stranger like that before. I just keep walking in, and two steps later he actually RUNS up to me and grabs me quite aggressively by the arms and actually tries to pull me back. I said firmly to him 'EXCUSE ME, do not touch me'. At this the old guy says (quite petulantly, like a little child i thought) 'well YOU dont push' and walks off in front of me. \n\ni'm pretty gobsmacked and actually fucking furious now. If someone had said politely hey sorry i got here first, do you mind if i go in front of you i'm in a rush, of course i would have let them. ALSO there was no way of knowing who got there first, second, third, etc. I wasn't being a bitch trying to run in in front of anyone, i was just walking in like everyone else, and i am sure once we formed the line in front of the receptionist it couldnt have been exactly in the order people arrived, because by that time there were at least a dozen people lined up. \n\nI was really burning by the time we were standing in line for the receptionist, i was actually standing behind the old guy, and the other younger guy was behind me. I turned around to the younger guy after a while and said 'you should go in front of me' and he refused and said no it's really fine, don't worry about it, i really don't care.. he said that several times. But i insisted, i told him i do not want the old guy turning around and touching me again.\n\nSo.. what do you think? Should i have made sure i let everyone who arrived before me walk in the door before i got in behind them? Or if people are standing around in a circle /group like that it's basically however the people end up lining up? \n\ntldr: standing at the entrance of a medical centre at opening time with a group of people waiting to be let in. Group walks in, old guys grabs me and tries to say i'm pushing in.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for Letting Things go too far with my Close Friend who's in a Long Term Relationship?",
      "description": "I started working with this girl around 3 years ago. We quickly became close and would go to events that were slightly left-of-field together (indie theatre shows, 80s dance nights etc). For the first year it was mainly platonic between us but with time we grew more and more intimate. It got to the point where I thought lines were being crossed and I was honest about my feelings to her. She agreed we probably took it too far and while she cared for me deeply, she was committed to her relationship. I understood and we agreed there needed to be some space between us for a while and after that it was almost as if it was back to when we were purely platonic.\n\nLast night though we met up at an event and while we didn't do anything that would explicitly count as cheating, I did feel as though we were at the very least blurring the lines between friendship and something more. In the interest of determining the exact extent of my assholishness it was mainly things like her taking my hands in hers, putting an arm around her while she rested her head against my chest and other, similar small gestures of physical affection. At the end of the night we were on a balcony and sitting really close to one another and we just stopped speaking and stared into each other's eyes for a really long time. I know if it was my SO if I heard about things like that, it probably wouldn't sit too well with me. AITA for continuing to allow, and contributing to this stuff happening? She definitely has feelings for me too on some level, but seems to be conflicted about it. If I am the asshole in this scenario, how can I not be one, and how can I be the friend she deserves?",

      "title": "AITA for texting an ex on our birthday in front of my current girlfriend?",
      "description": "Background: 5 years ago, I dated a girl while abroad in Europe. She was south American and very conventionally attractive. We have birthdays on seperate days, but due to the time  zones when it is her birthday in my country, it is my birthday in hers so we wish one another on the same day and we have for years. Last year, in our post wish small talk, I excitedly told her about my current girlfriend and how amazing she is and how in love I am. The ex responded by sending me a nude picture. It was awkward, being unsolicited. I showed it to my current gf as a kind of \"wow this girl thinks she can steal me lol\".\n\nFast forward to a year later, gf and I are in bed. She reminded me of the other girl and I quickly message her \"happy birthday\" and then scroll my insta feed for a bit. Gf then starts to act weird. Saying she just wants to sleep. She was a bit sick earlier in the evening so I assume that is showing up again. \n\nDuring the night I can tell she's not sleeping and I ask what's wrong, \"nothing\" being her only reply. I wake up at 6am, and she's fully dressed and packing her things. She tells me the fact I texted an old flame in front of her hurt her feelings and she's leaving for good. That was pretty much the last I saw of her, and she blocked me on all social media. Sucks cause we had plans to spend the whole day together (to celebrate my birthday) and I was going to surprise her with concert tickets at dinner. Relationship over I guess.\n\nTL;DR: texted an ex \"happy birthday,\" girlfriend of over a year leaves with little fanfare. I think it's a massive overreaction, am I an asshole?",

Anyway, we were hagnin out at my place just talking about life, sort of cuddled up when she mentioned a guy she thought was kinda cute.

I just stort of looked at my phone, checking for memes and shit, when she sort of poked me, asking why I wasnt listening to her. \n\nI got real and told her that she wasnt gonna talk about other guys if this shit was gonna happen, and that she's free to get the fuck out if she think that shit will fly with me. She tried arguing and kind of did let it slip that she does like me, but i just said that if she still comments that other guys are cute, she should probably just fuck off, she tried to defend herself, but just ended up kinda giving me a nasty look and leaving after a while\n\naNyway, a mutual friend called me up saying shes really upset that i kicked her out, and that I overreacted and that i'm jealous, since it wasnt even a guy she knows or some shit. I basically told him that her shit wont fly and that I dont care if she likes me, shes not gonna do that bullshit with me. he sorta hung up and ive gotten 1-2 salty messages from her since. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a few months back. My mom's co-workers (the dog's owners) went on their honeymoon and my mom offered to take of their dog. My mom brings this up to me and I agree to help take care of the dog (being 16 years old). By the second day we had the dog, he did not leave his cage for a split second. This dog was extremely young and scared of people. Despite this, I kept the door open in case the dog wanted to wonder; also in hopes he would warm up to me and the environment he was in. To my surprise, the dog began to wonder when I wasn't around, so I went upstairs to shower while the dog walked around downstairs. I come back downstairs and I can't find this little fella anywhere. The only thing that's open to the outside is the window, yet I don't know how the dog could've got up onto the ledge 3-4 ft off the ground. Meanwhile, my mom is out on a business trip for the next two days. Once I realize the dog is outside, I call all of my friends and we are driving around looking for this dog everywhere. 4 days go by and the dog is being spotted, but nobody is able to catch him. My mom handles the situation surprisingly well and claims that it was not my fault (which I personally disagree with). Anyway, my mom notifies her co-workers on their honeymoon as to what happened and the fiance ends up coming back early from their honeymoon (in Hawaii) to help look for the dog. A week goes by and we find out the dog was hit by a car, 7 miles from our house and had to be put down. AITA for leaving the dog unsupervised downstairs? Or am I just an idiot?",

      "description": "Unconventional post, but this happened when I was in third grade, and it's something that has stayed with me for the last 16 years. \n\n\nWe were doing our daily multiplication quizzes, and the teacher had us grade the quizzes ourselves. It was towards the end of the year, and I hadn't missed a question all term. These quizzes also took painfully long to grade, so I would just finish them as fast as possible, and put checkmarks next to all the questions, indicating that I got 100%. One day, the teacher walked around and saw that I had given myself 100% even though we hadn't finished grading the quizzes.

For the last few quizzes of the year, she made me turn the quiz in to her so she could grade it herself. I'm OK with being the asshole - just wanted to get a definitive answer. Thanks!",

This was about 6 months ago anyway the other day he tells me he is coming with me from when I arrive for a couple of weeks.\nI was so happy he had decided to come along and wanted to ask him his plan and whether he wanted to stay together with me as it would help on bills plus we are sleeping together so it makes sense.\n\nNext he says after me asking him if he would like to get accommodation with me that I should just sort my own accommodation and he will sort out his. That's okay I get you need your own space but why are you coming with me when I have my first attempt of complete independence and to set up a new life elsewhere that you want to come the first 3 weeks of it to do what? Clearly not staying with me, but then finally has a comfortable excuse to go elsewhere?\nI get commitment issues and I wasn't asking him to marry me but he was acting like I was some sort of abomination to even think like that.\n\nNot sure on what to do now as we are not talking and it feels very much broken. \n",

      "description": "(Background: our school has a rule that undreclassmen can go to prom, but only if a senior takes them)\nSo this story starts back in January of this year. My gf and I had been together for a few months and prom was coming up. She had never properly been asked to a dance before so I wanted it to be special. I spent about three hours making a poster with the word \"prom?\" On it in several different color patterns. She happily agrees to go with me. Everything is fine until a few days ago, when my gf and I were walking together. A mutual friend of ours stops us and tells my gf that she got the go ahead from our VP and all they'd have to do is get their prom tickets. When I inquired wtf she was talking about, gf chimes in saying she was taking other girl to prom so she could go (at least a month after she already agreed to go with me). When I asked her when she was planning on telling me, she responded that she had been meaning to, but hadn't since she figured I wouldn't mind. After that I walked away and didn't hear any more of it. \n(Not worried about her cheating on me or anything, just upset that she agreed to this without telling me and assumed I wouldn't mind)\nIs this no big deal? Am I overreacting? I just need some unbiased opinions on this situation. Also this is my first post so I'm sorry if I do something wrong. ",

      "description": "I am part of a runner’s group. Over the past two years, I made some friendly acquaintances with some of the members of the group. I wouldn’t call them good friends since none of us talked outside of the group. We would sometimes stay and chat after running, or chat before if some of us were early. \n\nTwo of the members in the group really hit it off around the time I joined and they became a couple. Let’s call them Jane and Bob. About a year in, a new girl joined the group. Her name is Lexi. She seemed nice and everyone got along. Bob and Lexi became good friends. \n\nA couple months ago, I planned a Vegas trip for my birthday and in order to keep costs down, I booked a suite for everyone going to share. Long story short, I had some of my close friends bail on the trip each for valid reasons. I decided to invite Jane, Bob, Lexi, and two others from the group to see if they were interested. Jane couldn’t go, but Bob, Lexi, and the two others said they would go. \n\nDuring the trip I thought I saw some potentially questionable behavior from Bob and Lexi. Lexi is a flirty girl and loves attention. There was a lot of arm touching and horsing around (for example she made him give her piggy back rides). She also put her head on his shoulder like she was tired when we were all chilling in the room after the day club. Also, due to the limited bed situation Lexi and Bob said that they could share the pull out bed together. I felt that they were sleeping a little too close to each other in the morning where it could have been considered spooning. \n\nI brushed it off to them being close friends, it was Vegas and they were drunk, and I didn’t want to meddle, so I didn’t tell Jane how I felt after that weekend passed. I’m not close with any of them, and I didn’t want to ruin our weekly meetup vibe by stirring up drama. \n\nTL;DR: AITA for not telling an acquaintance about potentially flirty activity between her boyfriend and another girl?

      "description": "This is just a throwaway and I'm not sure if my post title is really enough to understand so I'll just explain the situation in better detail.  \n\n  \n\nBasically for some background info, I've been friends with a guy now since grade 10 and recently finished school and graduated. We always got along well and we'd message each other every day just to chat and all that kind of stuff. At the back end of the year his grandma passed away and she was someone that he had been close to all his life, he basically hasn't really been the same since. However that was never an issue for me, I would always let him know that I was there to support him and always be able to give him someone to talk to when he had any issues. We would still always message and hang out after school, played on the same sports team and just overall had a good strong friendship.  \n\n  \n\nEverything seemed to be turning around again until he had a big crush on a girl. To cut a long story short he was always interested in her and they would hang out as friends but he always saw her as more than friends while she didn't feel the same way. When he asked her out and she declined he started to really struggle mentally again and couldn't get over it. Around this time he started to cut a lot of people out of his life and completely removed all forms of social media he had and stopped talking to a lot of his other friends. He would talk about how he trusted nobody and that everyone was just fake and hated him.  \n\n\n\nEven currently after almost 6 months he still can't seem to get over her. I've always been there to help him with his troubles and I've always been there to support and help him but recently things have just gotten worse. Last Tuesday the cops arrived at his house and after he told me that he had attempted to kill himself. I continued to be there to listen to him and make sure he understood that I was on his side all the way and that I would help him in any way I could.  \n\n  \n\nHowever over time and especially lately It's just become increasingly draining to me mentally. For starters he has mentioned in the past that he \"feels that he should be a priority and not an after thought\" and seems to always be needing to rant to me. Additionally he seems to be rather insensitive to my needs and while i'm always willing to help him I don't feel he returns that favour to me and things are always about him. The final thing that is maybe the straw that breaks the camels back is the fact that he doesn't seem to hold back in insulting me and making fun of me at times, often being condescending with the way he handles any help I try to offer him.   \n\n  \n\nI don't feel like it would be right to just cut off with him especially during such a tough time for him but personally it is really taxing on me and I just don't feel like this is a true friendship anymore. In a way it seems like its all about him and I just have to be there to take of his issues. Maybe I just need to toughen up and stick through but I'm really not too sure.  \n\n  \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So hear me out. I (21M) work at 2 vet clinics, both are owned by the same doctor and have the same set of rules and way of doing things. Lets call them Red and Blue. \n\nI’m a veterinary technician/ assistant, basically the equivalent of a nurse. My main duty involves medicating, helping run appointments, and assisting the veterinarian in any way. After I finish my morning duties, mainly medicating and checking charts, I settle down and wake up with a cup of coffee (work starts at 7am). Then we all typically wait until the doctor gets there. Personally its a great job, it’s not too demanding and I get paid very well. If we’re not booked full of appointments/ surgeries, everyone’s day is pretty lax- including the doctor’s. \n\nI used to work at Red as the kennel staff about 3 years ago before my current position. Their main duty is to walk dogs and care for the animals boarding, while also assisting the technicians. Currently, Red’s kennel staff full of teenagers, specifically girls. They do their work in the morning and have no issues, however if they do, they come and ask me. Being a people pleaser and due to my prior experience in their position, I have no issues whatsoever. \n\nBlue is completely different. Their kennel staff is also mostly women, aged 30-40. They’ve been working their several years and I totally respect that. \nThis is where I gets tricky.\nMy morning duty is the same at Blue as it is at Red. Medicate, charts, and coffee. Sometimes I finish before the staff or vise versa. But let’s say I finish before them while they’re still finishing their duties. They hate that, they always want help, but not necessarily in need of it. Several times because of this, I overhear them gossiping and talking shit about me. Typically it’s someone telling me. Usually it’s just “He’s lazy”, but like I said- if it’s slow, nobody is doing a damn thing. \n\nSo why should I help them? 9/10 times we’re slow and don’t have anyone boarding, and they’re extremely capable of doing the job. If they’ve been there for several years, why do they need help? The teenagers at Red have no problems. Which brings me to my next point, they’re grown adults. Communication between 2 adults should be a no brainer, if they ask I’ll have no issues helping, but since they don’t- I feel like I’m not in the wrong. \n\ntl;dr my coworkers talk shit about me and complain instead of asking for my help\n\nSo Reddit AITA?",

      "description": " So I had a job interview today that was  more of an informational interview/ them trying to sell me on the job,  because they knew I was unsure about accepting the job, and they wanted  someone to convince me to want the job. They have implied that I am  their first choice, and the job is mine if I want it (but I have not  gotten an offer letter yet). I am graduating college soon, so this will  be my first job out of college.\n\n15  minutes in to the interview I bring up salary. FYI, this job has a base  salary with the opportunity for commission. I was not happy with the  starting base salary that I had been told by someone else earlier in the  interview process, so I gave my reasons for wanting a higher starting  salary: I had an internship last summer and have been working part time  ever since so I have experience in an applicable field, the salary is  below the average of graduates of my college (the salary I asked for was  still lower than the average of graduates of my college, so nothing  excessive), my prospective teammates think I would be a great addition  to the team.\n\nHe is not happy that I  brought up wanting more money. He says that it doesn't matter what  college I went to, calls me entitled, says all associates start at the  same salary and you earn commission based on what you deserve, and I  haven't done my research for the job. He says he was put off by me  asking for a higher salary. The rest of the conversation went well, but I  was torn up about this incident.",

      "description": "First time poster, long time reader. \nJust looking for some advice on a soon to be M-I-L. \n\nSo I’m (31f) getting married in 2 months to my SO (35m). His family (2 older brothers, mum and dad) run a business together, we all live in very close proximity. They are EXTREMELY close - the opposite of how I grew up so it’s taken some time to get used to everyone being in each other’s business. \n\nAnyway, the issue: His mother (70f) has decided that we should have a family bbq the night before the wedding at their house, so both our families can “break the ice”. They’ve done this for 3 weddings in the past (all pre-kids, my SO was married before and now has a 7year old, both brothers married) so I guess it’s like a tradition thing for her, even though circumstances have changed since then. \n\nThis is inconvenient for all of us. It’s really not going to work for my side of the family being that 1 of my brothers + wife + 5yo flys in from New York at 6am that day, and the other brother has a new born + 3yo. \nWe have to set up the venue the day before, all my bridesmaids will be here and we’re staying in a rental out of town. I’ve organised for my parents to take the kids for the night. \n\nThere are 9x kids under 7 years old between both families, so for them to have a huge night the day before the wedding seems like a bad idea. Our kids are involved in the ceremony and we would like them to get a good rest the night before because (as all parents will know) it’s just so much easier when they’re not tired. \n\nWhen I voiced to my SO’s mother this wouldn’t work for us and could we do it another day or even do a lunch thing, she recoiled and has barely spoken to me for 3 weeks. \nMy SO has tried talking to her and she won’t budge, she “just wants to put on a dinner for everyone”. \n\nShe’s a bit traditional, whereas we are not. SO agrees with me, but being a mummas boy wants her to be happy too. \n\nAm I the ahole for not caving into her wishes? \nAm I making a rod for my own back with this incredibly close family? \nAITA for thinking the kids need to be rested for the wedding? \nHow TF do I handle this situation?

      "description": "So my boyfriend of almost 2yrs tends to be immature and a bit of a control freak. He tends to hijack every free moment I have to do him favors and drive him around and loves to find ways to get me and other people to pay for what he wants, and I'm getting really tired of it.\n\nMy birthday is coming up (Im going to be 38 and feel like I'm in my prime honestly) and I've never been able to do what I want or really enjoy my own birthday. When I told my boyfriend I wanted to plan myself a birthday weekend getaway,he told me how stupid and \"retarded\" that was and that if I lived him I would let him plan it for me. Then he told me he had a huge amazing surprise planned but needed me to save about $400 for the weekend (he's the most financially irresponsible man I've ever met, hence why he gets everyone to pay for everything he does because he blows every dollar he earns on dumb stuff, he's 39 btw).\n\nAfter a few weeks of him dropping bits of information here and there about the weekend he was \"planning\", which I know now means he's only thinking about it but not actually planning anything because of how irresponsible he is, I have figured out he's trying to use my birthday weekend as a way to treat his 18yr old daughter who will be visiting that weekend to a nice hotel and getaway. He let it drop that he would be bringing her along to our hotel and getaway weekend. \n\nI've dropped hundreds of dollars on him and his teen daughters to treat them and have fun already and he's never bothered to show appreciation or do the same for my kids, and has never had the money in the 2yrs I've been with him to treat his kids to anything and always puts the bill off on someone else in a manipulative fashion. And I'm sick of it. Mind you, she is visiting for an entire month and he will have plenty of time to spend with her before my birthday\n\nSo yesterday I told him I want to go dancing for my birthday (obviously an adult activity) and I want our friends to come along. I dont want to drink or anything, just dance. Salsa or something. I haven't danced in years and it sounds alot more fun for my birthday than spending it being manipulated by him so he can pretend to be treating his daughter to a good time. I told him I wanted him to come dancing with me and enjoy the birthday weekend with me. Fireworks from him of course because now I'm screwing up HIS plans. Now he's giving me the silent treatment.  Usually his silent treatments last about a week.\n\nAITA here? \n\nTldr; bf giving silent treatment because I want to go dancing for my birthday but he wants me to get a hotel so he can bring his 18yr old daughter .",

I sent her another screenshot about what he said to me to show her that I thought he was being serious, and she said she was laughing her ass off, so I got angry at her again because I don't think she understood how I felt about the situation.\n\nThen she said that we usually joke about suicide (We do actually joke about it between ourselves or in the group chat, and that I shouldn't have taken what my male friend told me seriously because that, but in my opinion the fact that he sen't me a DM telling me he was worried about her doesn't seem even a bit as a joke.\n\nTL;DR a friend sent me a private message telling me that he was worried about my friend commiting suicide, and then my friend told me to relax and laughed at the situation saying it was obviously a joke and that I should have taken it more like one\n\n\nAITA for not taking what he said as a joke?, AITA for getting mad that she told me I should've know that it was a joke and to relax?",

It’s something I’ve been trying to rectify, attempting to save up for a lawn mower and whippersnipper since before Christmas, and almost coincidently I was going to purchase both a mower and whippersnipper tomorrow and mow the lawn. \n\nWhere my question comes into play is this: today I came home to a note in my mailbox which read, “Maybe it’s time to mow your lawn as all surrounding neighbours are tired of the grass growing through fences and your dog is clearly distressed. \nUnless you want RSPCA &amp; realestate involves mow your grass.\nPay someone to do it if your too lazy.”\nSigned with a smiley face.\n\nRSPCA for anyone outside of Australia is like an animal protection service, so in this case they were threatening me with having my dog taken off of me because I’m endangering him. \n\nNow obviously weeds and grass creeping into my neighbour’s yards is my bad and I’ll hold my hand up and say my bad, but off the bat threatening me and my dog (who is not miserable I’ve no idea where that assumption came from) is a little rude. I would’ve been very appreciative if I’d received a “hey sorry to bother you but your yard is a little out of control, could you please take care of it soon” first before pulling out the “we’ll get you kicked out of your house and your dog taken off of you”.\n\nTL;DR: my grass is a little unkempt, one disgruntled neighbour has threatened me in a first notice that they’ll have my realtor investigate me and have my animal taken off of me",

      "description": "WIBTA for changing my name?\n\nMy dad was raised by his grandmother, who was apparently a saint. She helped him through the death of his dad and being abandoned by his birth mother, she taught him everything he knows from cooking to fixing a car to (legend has it) playing baseball which he got a scholarship to a great school for, she introduced him to my mom, etc. To say that he worships her is an understatement. We still celebrate her birthday even though she died before my siblings and I were born (nothing creepy, we just go out to a nice dinner or if it's on a weekend we all volunteer together). My mom knew and loved my grandmother too, obviously, and it was actually her idea to name me after her.\n\nThis is all really sweet, but my grandmother was named Delilah. And I was born 3 years before the song 'Hey There Delilah' came out. So every day of my life people sing that song to me, or if they're older they ask me where Samson is, or sometimes sing the jingle of a radio show called 'Delilah' that I only know about because so many people sang it to me. I've tried to go by Lilah in the past but it's hard because my parents won't call me that/introduce me that way, and because I'm in school with kids who have always known me and know my name.\n\nI turn 18 this summer and I'm going to college this fall and I really, really want to change my name to a completely unrelated name before I go, just so I can have a fresh start. I have a name picked out that's very plain and doesn't have any songs related to it that I like. I just think it will be nice to pick a new name now when I'm starting adulthood and making connections and stuff, for future career stuff.\n\nI know my dad will be absolutely devastated. He really hated me even trying to go by Lilah. My mom is also really attached to my name too. I brought up changing my name and they said they couldn't tell me 'no' because I'll be legally an adult, but they'd be really hurt and disappointed and it would hurt our relationship.\n\nAnyway, after all that rambling, WIBTA if I change my name anyway? I just really, really hate my name and the constant comments and singing, and I don't want this to follow me around forever.\n\nP.S. There's no compromise, like changing it to her middle name or something. Her middle name was 'Warden' and her last name is our last name. Oh, and her confirmation name was \"Dymphna\"",

      "description": "sorry this is long, it requires a little bit of back story...my best friend/roommate has never cared for my boyfriend. Before he got into trouble, she didn’t care for his personality but she has literally spent 5 minutes total with him a single time 3 years ago (when him and i were just friends and i was living somewhere else) and has refused to spend any more time with him or get to know him. She was rude about him coming to our house last year, which he knew so he never wanted to come over and that made it really hard for us. We’d literally sit in my car outside for hours. I basically chose to not make my living situation shitty by doing things that made her mad so we tried to stay out of the house. My bf was going through court for a DUI (no one got hurt, I know it’s an awful thing, he’s in recovery and sober and getting better) and was suicidal and depressed the entire 6 months leading up to him going to jail. He and his family have both told me that they don’t think he would be here if I wasn’t there for him and trying to keep him out of the hole. What this translated to was me spending a lot of time with him over the 6 months he was going through this case. My roommate worked 6 days a week 8-7:30, we spent every Sunday together and she usually had plans weeks in advance for weeknights, but she gave me a huge lecture the week before he was going in about how awful of a person I was for only spending time with him(not entirely true, i did spend a majority of my time with him though), what was I doing, why was I doing it, she said I “flew too close to the sun” and should have left him when the court case started. I can see where she’s coming from but if there was one thing I always tried to do it was make sure I spent time with her at least twice a week. We’re both busy and it was like she wanted me to wait 3 hours for her to be off work and not make plans myself so i could see her. That conversation was really hard, it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit ever. But fast forward now, my boyfriend has been serving his 6 month jail sentence and he’s about 2 months in. I see him once a week and he hasn’t been able to call me up until this week, so he’s been calling me every day. The problem is, he’s been calling me during dinner time because that’s when the phones are open, plus I work 8-5:30 Mon-Saturday so there aren’t a lot of windows and he knows that. So a couple times this week (3 times) I’ve been eating dinner with my roommate and I’ve excused myself when he calls for the 20 minutes I’m allowed to talk to him and then I come back and hang, but last night he called when i was out to eat with her so i tried to keep the conversation under 10 minutes (which is was), and i had to give him a couple messages from his family, so I came back to the table and she was SO MAD at me. Like barely spoke to me and typed out huge texts to her other friends and boyfriend across the table and said that it’s really annoying that we talk every day now and why can’t I just tell him I need to go because I’m at dinner, and that I see him once a week and we really don’t need to talk every day. I definitely did tell him i was at dinner but he waits from 2pm for his phone slot at 7 to open up so i wanted to make it worth it for him too. I felt like shit because I’m just happy I can talk to him again. My roommate stays in constant contact with her boyfriend via text and he calls her sometimes, plus she sees him at least 2x a week. I’m just frustrated because I don’t want to ignore his calls, which she said “I know that would LITERALLY kill you so don’t ignore his calls, I’m just annoyed because he calls during dinner always, I have a right to be annoyed. Like when he called on Saturday you should have just told him you would see him tomorrow and talk to him then.” I do get what she’s saying. But am I the asshole here? Because she makes me feel like it. I miss him more than anything and this week has been the first time in months that I’ve been able to talk to him every day and I’m grateful. Ugh. I need outside perspective! Thank you in advance for reading this. \n\nTLDR; roommate never liked my boyfriend, now gets annoyed that I answer his calls from jail and I feel like shit ",

Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage midway through her 2nd trimester. That time was really hard for her, and I gave her time to grieve and did not pressure her into trying again.About 2 or so months after the miscarriage, she told me that she doesn't want kids anymore. I thought she was still grieving her loss, and didn't push it. \n\nIt's been almost 2 and a half year since the miscarriage and she still maintains that she doesn't want kids. I have suggested surrogacy and adoption, thinking she is just afraid of having another miscarriage as she said that's the worst pain she's ever gone through.

      "description": "Hey all, long time reader first time poster etc. etc. so sorry if my formatting is an issue.\n\nSo to get the proper context for this I'll need to start from august last year, when I was preparing to head off for my first year of university. I was interested in buying myself a laptop for note taking and coursework since at the time all I had was a desktop which would be useless if I needed to get work done out and about. So me and my mum went looking for a new laptop at a popular tech/appliance store. Since I was buying it for myself and didn't have much money at the time my budget was £200-£300 maximum, so all the laptops we were shown were, well sub-par at best...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway after searching around, a worker at the store said if we had a low budget but wanted decent performance we should look at an ipad. Long story short we got talked into buying one as we were promised it would be able to do everything I needed just like a windows PC or Mac (that was a lie but we will come back to that shortly). We went to check out and my mum surprised me by offering to buy the ipad for me as a gift for getting into Uni and I accepted greatfully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to a couple of weeks ago and I'm struggling with my coursework, since as soon as I got to Uni I realised my ipad couldn't install some very important software for my course, which meant every time I needed to do an assignment I would need to leave bits and do them on a PC at the Uni library which added extra time, work and stress. I was holding off from buying a new device because I didn't want to make the gift my mum bought me seem pointless and I knew she would take it very badly even if I explained the reasoning. Finally though I gave in and fork out the money for a new Windows laptop that can actually do what I need. Now I have to face the fact that when I bring it back over the holidays to work on my assignments, my mum is going to be annoyed that I went and replaced her gift (which I was initially going to buy myself anyway) with a new laptop in just over a year.... so I was hoping to know, am I the asshole and do I deserve the inevitable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Am I the Asshole for replacing a gift ipad from my mum a year later when it turned out it wasn't able to do the work I needed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for reporting my former manager leading to her being fired?",
      "description": "Starting this with an explanation of the situation.\n\nI was previously employed as a desk jockey in a company where the department was roughly twenty people of particular demographics and I was the sole member of a polar opposite demographic. I had worked there for about two years with half of my duties being transferred from another person who worked there with one foot out the door and a job title one significant step ahead of my own. I also had taken an extraordinarily nasty account which required at least intermediate familiarity in an uncommon dialect of a foreign language to cover correctly. I had basic familiarity which was more than the rest of the department combined.\n\nMy performance was considered somewhere between \"good\" and \"great\" through the first year, somewhat notable as I was being judged on a scale used for 5-10 year veterans. I wasn't some infallible rock star at the job, but I was definitely good enough to keep around and the only person to handle the bilingual account properly in years.\n\nOne person who had previously been employed at this company had come by to visit with a few people as she had recently left work at another company in town. She was interested in getting her previous position back, or at least something close to it. Her previous position was on par with the person whose duties I had taken over. My direct manager told her that nothing was available at the moment and she had already trimmed a few positions in the past few years.\n\nAs you can imagine, this led to a \"That's a nice job you have there, I think my friend will take it\" situation. I was assigned a new account, the previous owner refused to assist, I inevitably make an error treating the account similarly to my others, and I was let go on thin pretenses. While nothing was actually said, it seemed rather clear to me that I was the one to go as I did not fit the department demographic while the previous employee did. I had an easy time claiming unemployment, but I didn't have the documentation for any sort of legal action. In the end I just wanted to be done with it.\n\nThe AITA part is that I proceeded to anonymously report my former manager to corporate HQ for drug abuse. The company was excessively harsh on any potential drug use. I happened to overhear the day before my termination that my manager had obtained a few prescription pain pills from a friend after spraining her ankle rather than take half a day off for a doctor's visit, thanks to the fact that said manager had two voices, loud and super loud. I don't particularly care about that kind of thing and saw the company drug policy as being absolutely Draconian, but I also wanted revenge. She thought she was safe as we had been through our \"random\" drug testing only a few weeks prior. Due to violating drug policy, she was terminated immediately with cause.\n\nThere are also a few complicating factors.\n\nAccording to her social media, previous manager had swiftly risen in the ranks in another company before a sudden \"departure\" and taken a new job at the previously mentioned corporation at a much lower position at what was likely a quarter of previous pay, although she had risen to something not far from her first position by the time I worked for her. After she had joined the second company, she had a child who happened to be special needs and very expensive to care for, pushing her to become a bit of a workaholic.\n\nPrevious manager also made a few vague, plausibly deniable comments to me regarding some physical attributes of mine being desirable. I acted oblivious and nothing came of it, although she did continue the comments on occasion.\n\nTL;DR version- Former manager terminated my job to give it to a former co-worker/friend of hers, I got her fired for her minor transgressions, this may have seriously screwed up her life and family life, but she also was a creep. Was I in the wrong?",

His fiancée however is a complete nightmare, she’s passive aggressive and plays the victim on issues where there shouldn’t even be a victim. \nI’ve been very patient with her because I really enjoy my roommates company regardless.\n\nAn example of this behaviour is one day  a few of us were talking in the kitchen (keep in mind it’s around lunchtime) then she comes in from the living room\n\nFiancée: maybe I should just do yoga in my room since it’s quiet but could you guys keep it down?\n\nMe: yeah for sure, but I agree if you want complete silence the bedroom is always the best option.\n\nF: (while walking away, in a sad ‘whoa is me’ voice) well I guess I just won’t do yoga in the living room ever again\n\nShe began to say how I wasn’t letting her do the yoga she needs and that I need to respect her use of the common area (keep in mind the kitchen is widely considered a common area as well) I backed off this time and let it slide.\n\nWell a couple nights ago it all went to shit when my roommate and I were going to the movies. We were getting in the car and low and behold she comes out the door and gets in the car to join us, to my surprise. We drive to the movie theatre and we all get out and start walking together to the movie. After a minute I look behind me to see that the fiancée has vanished. I ask my roommate what the deal is.\n\nRoommate: oh she thinks we’re walking to fast so she’s walking extra slow to make us feel bad\n\nI was shocked he said this so calmly, as if it happens all the time. We get to the movie lineup and start waiting, after a minute or two I see her walking towards us and I can’t describe how dramatically slow she was walking. She finally shows up and says she wants the car keys and that’s she’s going. When asked why she said in front of all these people\n\nF: Well you guys ditched me and left me behind and I feel sad now\n\nMy roommate and I both agree that she purposely walked slower so she could be mad at us, to which she said how we don’t care about her. She then turns and almost yells at me \n\nF: What are you embarrassed by me?!?!\n\nI replied that yes, I was highly embarrassed and that this wasn’t the time nor place to cause such a scene over nothing. I then tell her that her guilt trip tactics and manipulation don’t work on me and not to talk to me until I say. She eventually left and joined later. I walked home instead of getting in the car and we haven’t talked since.\n\nAITA?",

She is a cosmetologist gets 7.25hr 25 hours a week plus tips and commission. This is in Pennsylvania btw. From what I've gathered she makes about half of my pay in a week give or take. I walk to work literally 2 blocks she drives my car. She just sold hers. Inspection repairs were insane and I knew this car wouldn't last long from the start. She generally works between 11pm to 6pm shifts and I dont really know what kind of part time job can work around that. She isnt trying to leave this job btw. 3rd shift or uber in her free time seemed like the only available options. We arnt strapped for cash but we have lots of debt. I also was a cosmetologist for 3 years way before we met so I understand her situation but I delivered pizza and worked 50 hours a week between the two. Idk if I'm just used to working alot or being an asshole. Me asking for a raise also isn't really in my inventory I got a raise twice already in less than a year and I never went to culinary school just do prep salad sandwich fry. I know there are better paying factory jobs for me but I'd have to find something where I can lift repetitively one handed or basically light lifting. I have an inguinal hydrocele that isnt bad enough to be surgically removed and already was drained previously that's another long story. I'm also in the process of going to school in the fall so this isn't really long term hopefully. Opinions about uber are also appreciated. \n\nTldr my girlfriend makes half as much as me aita for insisting she works a second job\n\n",

Posting from phone so sorry if the format is a little weird.\n\nTL;DR bottom\n\nNow, to elaborate this, I(20F) got my boyfriend (21M) ,who we will call A, for Christmas a Nintendo white hoodie cause I knew how much he liked it and wanted one and he was really really happy with it. \n\n*Side note : he is still friends with his ex, who we will call B. They have the same friend group and sometimes hang out all of them, never just the two of them. At some point in their relationship B wanted to get 2 Nintendo hoodies, you know, to have couple matching clothes and stuff but they never got to. This was quite some time ago , not close to the period when they broke up.\nAlso, not many people know we are dating (including his ex), just our close friends. We're not hiding from anything but we don't feel that is neccesary to announce everyone that we're dating, or so to say.*\n\nSo last time they met he went with his hoodie and she asked him \"When did you get the hoodie?\" And he said that he GOT it , as in he bought it some time ago. He didn't tell her it was a present because he didn't want her to question him who got him the hoodie. \nNow I know all this because he told me he was going out with friends and that she was gonna be there too and he told me he is gonna wear the hoodie I got him. \n\nI told him how upset that made me and he said that he just didn't want any trouble with her or get questioned by her. \n\nI don't know, maybe I am in the wrong, I just got upset cause he said he bought it, he didn't have to say that it's from his new girlfriend, could've just said he got it from a friend or something. I made quite a fuss about it because I searched for it a long time and found it really hard and was so happy when I did cause I knew it would make him happy and he just dismissed it like that, that's what upset me really. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for getting upset? \n\nTL;DR Got boyfriend a hoodie, ex asked him where he got that from, he said he bought it and I got upset because it was my gift to him.

      "description": "So earlier today, I was talking to my friend, who recently dumped his girlfriend after only a couple days because he found he just wasn't interested in her. This ex is not very relevant to the story. The relevant ex's are ex's 1 and 2.\nMy friend here seems to have been recently having some sorts of mood swings, where he's now for some reason super horny, especially after now dumping this girl. Today, he told me a plan to try to get back with ex 1 for sex, but not because he likes her again, just to have sex. He SPECIFICALLY SAID he wanted to \"manipulate her for sex.\" I told him that that goes against his own morals, he's told me before to not be in a relationship just for sex. On top of that, manipulation just sounds very bad. He just responds with song lyrics and whatever, like \"you only live once.\"\nFast forward to now, ex 2 messages me telling me that my friend tried to add her again, and asked if she should accept it. Since I assumed it was because he wanted the same out of ex 1 out of ex 2, I told her not to accept it. I then went back to my friend and told him he shouldn't be doing these kinds of things if he's against it himself and is doing all this irrationally.\nMy friend calls me an asshole and backstabber because he said all he was trying to do was get back in touch and to stay on good terms with ex 2. He said he only saw her profile in his recommended people to follow, so just followed her. However, he's already made it clear before that he hates her. AITA?",

It never happened due to a stupidly massive argument with my parents. I really want to get this tattoo done as it represents my childhood and is very meaningful. It wasn’t going to be a large tattoo, and I clarified this when I tried vehemently to explain to my parents. They were having none of that. \n\nThey accused me of being a failure just because I never went to university and I don’t currently own a car driving license. They keep telling me tattoos are vulgar and hideous, and I feel like they are emotionally blackmailing me. When I tried to explain to them why and where I want it, I was given an ultimatum. Get the tattoo and be homeless with parents who ignore me (so petty) or don’t get the tattoo and make them proud (ugh). \n\nThey believe what I do reflects on how the public views them and they are so scared of being viewed as “bad parents”. It’s honestly getting ridiculous at this point. \n\nMy question to you redditors, is AITA for wanting to take the plunge and just get the tattoo? ",

So I went to my parents and asked them to buy them. I chose a 160$ pair. They refused.\n\nDad started talking about how when he was my age he already had a part-time job. So I did it the hard way - I went to the local supermarket and what do I see - hiring now. I applied and the next week started working every Saturday and Sunday. \n\nThe plan was originally to work only one month but when I saw the Halloween sale on Steam I said to myself: 'Okay imma buy some games and the NEXT month I'm getting them'. And I did. In the middle of December I received my paycheck and later that day I was rocking with a new pair of headphones. Hell yeah. After that I stopped working because school.\n\nSkip forward to last week when my I got fed up with my bro asking me to use the headphones because his ones were shit. I said to him: 'Dude you need to stop asking me and get yourself a new pair as well'. He said he understood and went to do his business.\n\nYesterday I saw him wearing some Razor headphones and when I asked him how did he get them so quickly he said: 'Dad gave me money for them, why?' And I thought to myself 'Okay maybe they aren't as expensive as mine' then I asked him 'How much were they exactly?'....\n\n200$. Forty dollars more expensive than mine. What the fuck - I thought, for what reason??\n\nNo reason. No birthday or big achievement or holiday. Nothing. Here comes the part that gives me anxiety.\n\nHe got a C in fucking maths. My parents are the type that REALLY care about grades. When I got a C in chemistry two weeks ago they grounded me for the weekend. \n\nI mean yeah, he is 2 years smaller than me, but still. They bought him new expensive headphones with his grades gone to shit, while to me that said no, get a job.\n\nTl;dr I asked my parents for headphones, refused told me to get a job.

      "title": "AITA for being upset about my boyfriend’s continued relationship with a girl he almost dated?",
      "description": "Backstory: \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been good friends since we first met in middle school. The summer after graduating high school, we both admitted we kind of had feelings for each other and started kind of hooking up (ie. we watched Futurama and made out in his basement). Then we left for different colleges, leaving things at “we’ll see what happens over winter break.” That first semester, we continued talking, texting every day and sending each other letters in the mail. I, hopeful that the universe would align in a way where we ended up dating, basically ignored every guy that flirted with me on my campus. \n\nHowever, he had met another girl at his school - I’ll call her April - who was into him, and he was into her. They became friends, and flirted, and hung out all the time (basically the exact same as my relationship with him), but nothing really happened between them that first semester. \n\nWinter break came, and he and I ended up hanging out again a couple times, picking up where we’d left off. We both decided we wanted to have sex, so we did, and then both left town again. \n\nSo now he’s back at school and has to decide between me (the girl who lives across the country) and April (the girl who lives down the hall from him). He basically tells April that he doesn’t want a relationship, and after she gets over being hurt, they start talking again. \n\nFlash forward to the present, two years later:\n\nHe’s my boyfriend now (obviously), we did long distance for a year and then both transferred colleges so that we could go to school together. Things are going well. He’s still friends with April; they chat a couple of times a month and I’m uncomfortable with it but suck it up because I don’t want to be controlling. He’ll talk about how cool she is, how I’d like her because she’s “just like you,” etc. Yesterday, she texts him and says that she’s in town and wants to hang out. I proceed to have a breakdown over the idea of having to meet this girl, because I know I’m going to spend the entire time scrutinizing and comparing, trying to figure out what made my boyfriend like her, coming up with a laundry list of reasons why she’s better than me, so on and so forth. I tell my boyfriend that I’d rather not meet her because I know it’s going to make me feel anxious and insecure, and he’s understanding, but also disappointed. \n\nWe ended up having a big fight about his relationship to her: from my perspective, it seems like he was keeping both of us at arms length while he decided what he wanted (which is fine by me, it happens), but then never made a full decision - he “picked” me, so to speak, but left the April door open a tiny bit, just in case. And I don’t like that. When I told him this, he told me that I didn’t understand how difficult the decision was, which hurt me even more. Nobody wants to hear what essentially translates to “it wasn’t easy to choose to start dating you.” He further explained it as being a hard choice because it hurt April’s feelings, and she was his only friend, so it made him lonely. It seems to me like there’s something unresolved on her side, judging from the tone of the texts I’ve seen (not snooping!), and it’s keeping him from moving on completely? I don’t know. \n\nBut yeah, all in all, I’m not really comfortable with him continuing to be friends with this girl. I trust him, but it’s still hurtful that he wants to have a relationship with the person that, from my perspective, was my replacement for a semester (and almost forever). Am I an asshole for not wanting him to be friends with her?",

      "description": "I called a \"friend\" in the morning to plan a small gathering with our own daughters. She would pick us up at my daughter's school and buy something to go to eat it at my place.\n\nThis friend knows where I live and she even knows one of my neighbors, an old lady who dislikes me profoundly and with whom I've had several problems about parking distribution and littering the street with her lawn cuts. Fortunately, this neighbor recently put her house for rent and we have new neighbors with whom I'm respectful and try to avoid any problem similar to those that I had with the house owner.\n\nAnd here's the problem: we got to my house after buying food and I asked my friend to park her car in a different place than where she intended. I asked her twice, very politely and mentioning the problems I had in the past with the bitch neighbor I mentioned earlier, to park her car in front of my house so I could avoid any possible situation with the tenants. Well, she said she would ask another neighbor (one that had nothing to do with the parking space). I asked her for a third time to not do it and park in front of my house. She minimized my request and parked not only in the tenants' parking space, but also invading the space of a third neighbor.\n\nI kept silent while she walked to my house and before entering my home I asked her politely to move her car. She said she had asked the third neighbor about using that parking space and the neighbor said that he'd call me if they were using the space or needed her to move the car. I asked her if she was not moving her car and she said: NO. That was my fifth attempt and I was about to explode, so I decided to do the opposite, I kept completely silent.\n\nWe sat down and ate but I kept the conversation to an absolute minimum. Only thanked and asked for food and that was it. She noticed my glacial silence and tried to speak only with the kids but when she tried to share an anecdote and she asked me something, I said nothing. Apparently she understood and hurried up their meal, put their plates in the sink and left saying a brief goodbye.\n\nAfter they left, I apologized to my daughter because she wanted to play with this friend's daughter, but I explained her that this is not the first time she has dissed me and my house rules. She answered that she also dislikes some of her attitudes toward her friend and her. I asked her to try to keep things separate and don't let my own struggles contaminate her relations and friendships.\n\nNow, I'm at my home, wondering if this issue of someone disrespecting my house rules is too much and I was the asshole in this situation. What's your opinion?",

      "description": "My bicycle was locked to a public cycle rack for a couple of hours, but when I went to retrieve it I found someone else's bike on top of mine with their cable lock passing through my frame. I'm pretty sure the person didn't do it maliciously, but since I had easy access to some tools I decided to be selfish and cut their cable so that I could cycle home (seriously don't rely on braided cable to secure anything; it takes seconds to cut through one with a hacksaw).\n\nI've never had to do this before, and I can't help thinking about the poor person whose bike I left unlocked who is going to come back to at best find their cable in two pieces, and at worst find their bike has been stolen because I left it unsecured in a public place.\n\nOn the one hand they were clearly in the wrong for double-parking in the first place (seriously; it makes it so much harder for the person whose bike is underneath to get out) and locking my bike. It was dark and cold, and I couldn't think of another option that wouldn't cost me lots of time and money on public transport. On the other hand they probably didn't mean to lock my bike, and there's a chance that if I had waited around for only a few more minutes they would have come back and unlocked it.

      "description": "I feel guilty this has already happened to me.\nBackstory: Last summer my husband and I were renting a house with a pool. The laws inQuebec state that a landlord can only repossess a dwelling if they intend to live there themselves or a direct family member. In this case our landlord was very rude and I once had to kick him out of our home for yelling at my husband. So that time, I wasn’t afraid to go after what we were legally entitled to. I checked with the housing board and they said it would be reasonable to ask for three months rent compensation.\nThe landlords sold the house and they negotiated a settlement of 5 months rent. This was not amicable. \nThen we found a beautiful home. we were very honest with the new landlord about our situation. He even called our old landlords to verify the story. He understood and he specifically said we wouldn’t have to worry about that here. We said we wanted to stay at least two years. \nWhen we moved in the house was in AWFUL shape. There were mice, holes in the walls in every room, The floors are scratched to death, There was even a hole in the bathroom sink. \n\nWe have put hours of work in to this house. We fixed the heating ourselves, repaired a hole in the pool, rebuilt the railings on the back deck, we filled the holes and painted the whole upper floor. We got rid of the mice. We  did so much to make this our home. \nTwo weeks ago he called me in tears. He and his gf had split and he was going to have to take back the house at the end of our lease in June. I was truly heartbroken for him. However,we were only given four months notice. He offered to pay our moving expenses &amp;sent me a notice of repossession which I did not sign. My husband spoke to him and he said that he’s sleeping on the couch at his friend’s house until he can move back in.\nI feel bad but my husband keeps insisting that hes not our friend, We had a contract and he has breached it.\nToday he called for an update about how soon we can move because his ex wants to throw out his stuff. He’s really putting on the pressure.\nas much as I feel for him, I’m currently on on sick leave for stress. I’m not healthy enough to work and I’m certainly not in the right place to pack up an house that we only unpacked last summer.\nWe’re heartbroken &amp;We can’t afford this at all. My husband wants to offer him the same proposition. three months rent and moving expenses.\nLegally speaking, we can stay living in this house until June of 2020. \nBut I feel like a grade A jerk. He’s got nowhere to live, he’s losing out on his income from us and he’s heartbroken. On the other hand, he promised us we could live here with a legally binding contract. He promised specifically that he wouldn’t kick us out without proper notice. \nPlease tell me reddit, if I refuse to move without a settlement, AITA?\n",

      "description": "Should say, not intentionally. My family talks shit a lot but I’m on the gentler side of shit talking. None of my nephews or nieces really have a mother figure, and I just grew up being that for them. It doesn’t feel right to talk shit back, ya feel?\n\nBut anyway, one of my nephews is going through a rebellious phase where he hates his dad, and me. But it’s a bit difficult for me to handle because as much as I try to fill the female role in his life, I’m not his bio mom. I’ve got no obligation to deal with him lashing out, and as a laid back (if grumpy) woman in my early 20s I don’t feel inclined to. Normally if he starts talking shit, I leave it up to his dad to deal with him, and just mentally check out. But he gets real cocky sometimes and I’ll tickle him or something equally childish until he apologizes. (I.e poking, wet willies, just kid shit that annoys tf out of him cause he’s “too mature”)\n\nNow, tonight he happened to be playing fortnite my little brother (18), my other nephew (12), and my little brothers school friend (17). My brother and other nephew were teasing this nephew, while I was zoning out and scrolling though Reddit, when all of a sudden my nephew starts talking shit to me for no damn reason. He compared me to an overweight character who has a romantic relationship with a cat in the abridged version of a certain 90s anime. I got irritated and knew he was just showing off for my brothers friend, so I dragged him onto their mattress in the living room and tickled tf out of him and said “ya coulda just left me out of it!!!”\n\nThis is where my little brother and other nephew start teasing and saying “that’s what you get for always talking shit!!!” And all of a sudden my nephews laughing starts turning to crying and he just curls up and cries, presumably out of embarrassment. I didn’t know what to do to handle the situation, so I just got up and told the other two to leave him alone now, but I still feel like a douche.\n\nAITA? I really feel like the asshole.",

      "description": "Me and Jessie lived in different countries, and we were back in our home state on the same weekend so we decided to arrange a meetup. I always admired how confident Jessie is towards life, and thought of her as a good friend.\n\n So as we were discussing about our lives, I brought up that I felt suffocated and miserable in my current city, and my overall living life has caused me a lot of anxiety and depression.\n\n(Keep in mind that I have talked about this to her before when I was feeling overwhelmed, but it was mostly through text messages. But I understand if she may feel fed up by it.)\n\nI told her that since I am unsure what I really want to do for my life, I've decided to move at the end of the year and figure everything out. Jessie then proceeded to tell me that honestly she thinks I'm too \"weak\", and I should continue to stay in the city because it has better opportunities. She also said that I'm depressed because I'm not confident in my life choices, and I should look at how happy she is now. Well no shit, that's the exact reason I told you why I'm unhappy.\n\nShe then said that it was my fault at the first place for not following my passion like she did. She's in geology, and I'm in finance. I chose finance over arts due to better job security, and she chose hers because it's her passion. \n\nNow, I got really agitated because I feel like she's only seeing things from her perspective. I don't cope with stress too well, and the city I'm currently in is a incredibly stressful city. Her city is known for being a chill and friendly place. When I said I wanted to move to a friendlier place, she said that I'm too emotional about stress (wtf does that even mean???) and again, I should stay in my city to \"train myself\". She used herself as an example again.\n\nI blew up a little in her face. My environment has caused me severe depression in the past (and I've texted her crying in the past, so she's aware about it) and I feel angry that she would just reduce me to \"being weak\" just because I wanted a change in scenery and I haven't had the financial privilege to follow my passion in the first place. She was annoyed too, but we agreed to disagreed. Still, AITA here?\n",

      "description": "\nHey all,\n\nTo get right into the issue at hand: my husband and I gutted the house we purchased and he and his dad are laying the tile. Before they started we laid out quite a few to see how they would look. We discussed which way they would run and the design. They have a sort of cloudy pattern that i asked him to pay mind to when hes laying and to not put two identical patterned tiles next to one another. \n\nAfter the first day of laying I came to the house to find out they laid them the opposite way of how we discussed. They're 12x24\", we originally planned for North-South and they changed them to East-West because it saves 30% waste. Frankly, I don't give a fuck about the waste. He and his dad think they look better and less waste was a benefit. Whatever I thought, they're down and there's nothing to be done about it. This was just a few rows into the entryway.\n\nI went over to check out the progress last night and the whole floor is laid. The clouds are non-existent. The darker ends of the tile butt up to the lighter ends and there are two idential tiles next to one another all over the place. I asked him what happened to what we talked about, he told me his dad said there are no clouds in the tile and it won't matter once its laid. What the fuck? \n\nThis is the third time during our remodel hes taken his dads word over mine. I told him we should caulk gaps in the cabinets before painting and that we should put headers above the doors instead of plain trim, he said no they're fine. Until his dad came along and said the exact same shit and now its being done.\n\nBeside the fact that he disregarded what I asked, the floors quality-wise are great. The lines are clean, the angle are beautiful. They really did excellent work. But I can't help but see red, and I can't tell if I'm blowing this out of proportion or not. Guests in our home probably won't see the identical tiles next to each other, but I do. \n\nReddit, am I being an asshole about this?\n\nTL;DR: husband and I discussed how the tile will be laid. Dad-in-law got in his ear and all of it changed.",

      "description": "      I am in the market for a used car, and I prefer to buy from a private seller rather than a dealership. I contacted a seller from Craigslist and we chatted a bit about the car. We set a meeting time for the following day. I confirm with him 30 minutes before the meeting that we are still meeting at 1:30, and he says yes. So I show up at 1:30, and he tells me that his cousin has the car, but he is on his way. 40 minutes later his cousin shows up in the car, which is filthy and has his stuff everywhere (pics were of a clean car). \n      I look around the car, and notice a few dents and scratches that were not mentioned in the ad. Not a deal breaker to me, but it raises some flags. So I get in the car, and the whole thing smells like burnt rubber, and the sellers excuse is that his cousin drove so fast over here that he must have heated up the break pads?! We go for a short test drive, and I tell him I will be in touch. \n      The next day I texted him and said I would like to move forward with the car under some conditions. The main one being that he will agree to take the car for a pre-purchase inspection at a local shop, and if it comes back with no major issues and I buy the car, I will add the price of the inspection into the price of the car. He agrees and we schedule the appointment. \n       He then texts me several times about how no one else would ever do that for someone buying a car, and how he was so nice to do it, but don’t expect it next time I buy a car, etc. The mechanic said the inspection would take 2 hours, but it ended up taking 3.5, which sucks but is not in my control. As soon as the inspection is done, I got a copy of the report, and so did the seller. Although he didn’t know I got one. Here’s where the dilemma comes. \n      I saw an oil leak and supercharger problem that made me decide not to buy the car, but I decided that if he was honest and told me about them, I would pay for the inspection regardless. I asked him to send me the report, and he left out the page with the major problems and told me the shop said the car was almost perfect. I called him out on it and he said he missed those pages by accident, but the mechanic said they were fine. I informed him that I would not be buying the car, and he asked me to pay for the inspection. I declined on the basis that he tried to trick me with the results. Am I the asshole? \n      ",

      "description": "Heres the story and its a bit long (or at least it looks that way on my computer): \n\nI was a non-believer in god for many years. I stood very firm in my beliefs and would state it clearly when asked. \n\nMy mom believes in god and once sat me down and told me flat out she was afraid i was going to stab her because of my \"lack of morality\". It was only the once, but it never got better. She would ask me why I wouldn't go to church with them on Sunday or Wednesday and when I told her it wan't my thing (trying to be nice) she told me \"you've never been to this church, how is it 'not your thing'\"? She constantly belittled with my beliefs and implied I was crazy and again lacked morality. \n\nI started dating a wonderful guy who I see spending my life with. He's christian like my mom, and when I opened up to him I was surprised when he took my side and told me that the version of christian I have been exposed to definitely could have been better. It honestly shook me as everyone at my moms church was also like her. \n\nHe never tried to push it on me like she did, but when he asked me to go to church with him, I said yes. To be honest, when I first went it was just more time to spend with him and it made him happy to know that my soul was saved and I wasn't going to hell. \n\nMe and him started doing small things together, we would pray at night and before we ate and I would go with him and his family every Sunday to church (we don't go Wednesday because their church is a bit out of town). However, even though I was happy with where I was going I often struggled with it in my head. I had little arguments to myself about what was right and what was true. Even when I decided to myself that god was real, I still didn't want to say what I was as the way I was treated (not by just my mom, shes just the most prominent person in my life) and the way I thought, it's hard to let go. \n\nFinally, after 6 months of mental struggles, I told my boyfriend I was a christian. He was even more happy then when I said I would go to church with him, I thought I heard him cry over the video call. I was on call with him in my kitchen when my mom started talking about the lesson she was teaching at church Wednesday. He messaged me (so she wouldn't know) and told me that I should tell her because she would be so happy. \n\nI don't want to tell her and if she asks me I'm going to respond how I usually did (\"I know somethings out there, I just don't know what\"). I don't know how to put all the year of mistreatment behind me. \n\ntl;dr my mom ued to bully me about being atheist and now that im christian I don't know if I want to tell her \n\nAm I the asshole for want to lie to her?

      "description": "I work at a law firm as a law clerk. The career of lawyer is very competitive, and as any recent law grad knows, your first job is not only the hardest to get, but what could make for break your career. Luckily I found a job and I've been here for two months. I hate it here, honestly, the boss is disorganized and awful to his staff, very hard to work with, but I'm getting invaluable experience and working on building up my callousness so I've stayed. \n\nYesterday I was surprised to see 'Harry' in the conference room. Harry and I graduated form the same law school, in the same class. So, of course, I stopped to say hello. First thing he did upon seeing me was leap up out of his chair for a hug. He pulled me in tight for a solid 3 seconds, aaaawwwwkward. The interviewer, 'Donna,' asked how we knew each other. I said \"we went to law school together,\" at the same time he said \"we were friends.\" I wished him luck and scurried out the door for lunch.\n\nWe weren't friends. He was creepy. I am generally nice, as I was to Harry upon our first meeting, but he's the kind of person who latches onto that and thinks it means more than I'm just being polite. \n\nFor example, our second semester together he asked what classes I was taking. I told him, thinking it was casual conversation. Then, he proceeded to sign up for all the same classes, sit next to me in every class, and assumed I'd be his partner on projects. That semester was weird. I had to be upfront with him and set boundaries, told him \"you have to ask to be my partner\" and \"I don't want to talk to you during class, just because you're sitting next to me, I want to focus.\" Harry seemed to get it, and backed off after a few months of me stonewalling him. I never told him my anticipated class schedule again.\n\nBack to yesterday; when I return form lunch Donna intercepts me and asks my personal opinion of Harry. I described him as \"annoying.\" I explained our past. However, I made is VERY clear that I never felt threatened by him, that I just think he's eccentric and socially inept. \n\nDonna's face contorted upon receiving this information, and she told me \"Harry didn't apply in response to a job listing, his application came out of the blue, does he know you work here?\" I explained that I had just updated my LinkedIn profile last week and made it public information, but hadn't talked to Harry since graduation. \n\nDonna told me that the circumstances seemed suspicious. She said she had offered him a position (the firm is understaffed at the moment) and that he was due to start the next day, but that she would call and rescind if I was uncomfortable.\n\nIt's not that I was uncomfortable, it's just I would be super irritated by being in close proximity to this dude on a daily basis. I told her I didn't want to work with Harry. Donna understood and immediately called to cancel Harry. \n\nAITA for ruining Harry's chances at a job in a very competitive field? I'm going to quit as soon as I find something better, anyway. Idk, I don't want to work with Harry but I feel guilty for ruining the first step in his legal career.",

I did the same thing on Facebook. \n\nOne girl in particular messaged me quite upset about this.

      "description": "TL;DR: Long-time friend sexts me inappropriate messages after misunderstanding a text, despite believing I was still with my bf (his close friend), so I tell him I won't be moving in with him anymore. AITA?\n\nHey guys! Need some genuine guidance for this. I am a female in first year of university, Just finished the first term. A long-time friend from high school (7 years at-least of friendship) happened to move to the same university as me and did something I personally saw as shitty, but rethinking, I might've interpreted things badly.\n\n**Me:**: female, recently broke up from boyfriend (important)\n**Him:**: I'll call him Jonathan (fake name) Male, friends for 7 yrs, a nice personality, but focused on sex a lot as he is a virgin.\n**Michael**: My ex, recently broke up only weeks ago, friends with Jonathan and Jonathan’s friends.\n\n**So, background info:** \nMe and Jonathan had decided after the first term that we'd find a house share together, after some drama with fall outs and miscommunications with our own flatmates. Live in different uni halls but both are about 5 minutes from each other, so we visited each other at our halls a lot. No contracts had been signed yet and I am yet to find another place until the drama is sorted or buried.\n\nSome important information about Jonathan. He's a sweet, kind-natured guy who's the same age as me. Not too bad looking either, slightly overweight. Would do anything you asked of him if you needed it. He has struggled in terms of relationships, so tends to like and ask out almost any girl he has a friendship with (including myself). He’d asked me out a few times in the past and I have politely declined him, telling him I was happy with my friendship with him and my relationship with my boyfriend. He didn’t complain or retort, we simply remained good friends and became closer in university. I had been with my boyfriend for almost 4 1/2 years up until a few weeks ago, and only told a few people. I decided not to tell him this because a.) I’ve been wanting to get back with my bf and wasn’t ready to move on b.) He would most likely try and make a move, as he’s mentioned this before c.) He is good friends with my boyfriend and plays a large part in my ex’s friendship group.\nJonathan had also previously sent nudes and messages to a girl who had a boyfriend, whom Jonathan knew about. She was a bitch, but he refused to give that up and we ended up falling out for a few months because of it.\n\n\n**The Issue**:We like to use snapchat a lot and honestly, we messaged frequently. He was always quick to reply and we talked placidly about usual things. At one point during the night, whilst I was laid in bed messaging him, he told me a joke (I don’t actually remember what the joke was). I forgot to reply, and so he messaged back, and the conversation went as follows:\nHim: “Haha, sorry. I was just trying to make a lighthearted cheeky joke 😊”\nMe: “No problem, you can make lighthearted and cheeky jokes don’t be sorry :p”\nHim: “Woah woah woah, You’re gonan keep me up all night”\nMe: “It’s okay! I’m heading to bed now anyway, night!”\nHim: “Heh don’t you dare, I want you in my bed right now 😉 :p”\nMe: “Jonathan, wtf?”\nHim: “What? (cry-laugh emoji)”\nMe: “I’m really sorry if you misinterpreted my message but I do not want those kinds of messages from you”\n**He then proceeds** to tell me how he wanted our friendship to progress further and that he thought I was amazing and beautiful and perfect and sexy. I tell him this is so inappropriate because I have told him how much I love my boyfriend (I still do) and how disrespectful it is that he’d do this to his friend Michael and treat me as though I’m just a girl to get with rather than his good friend.\nHE THEN BACKTRACKS WITH ALL THE GRACE OF A GARBAGE TRUCK RAMMING INTO THE SIDE OF A HOUSE BY SAYING “Haha (cry-laugh emoji) I wasn’t ACTUALLY doing anything I know you’re with Michael and I wouldn’t do anything like that lol”.\nI tell him he’s already done it and he refuses to apologise. I tell him I don’t want to move in with someone who looks at me like meat or an opportunity and blocked him. We haven’t talked since.\n\nOverall, I feel like I had justification to be upset, but I don’t know if I overreacted and looked into what he did with a foggy lens. I’d really appreciate your guy’s thoughts on if I am the asshole in this situation, and what I should do about it, if anything??\n",

      "description": "Sorry for making this too long but I feel it's important for you to judge this with the full story\n\nFor a little backstory, I don't have the best relationship with my family. I grew up living with my mom, my grandparents, my aunts and my uncle, my dad abandoned the family when I was 3 so I only had my mother's side. I got abused by my mom since I was young and my other family members weren't the best of people, because of all this I decided to move out as soon as I turned 18 \n\nNow, because of complicated circumstances with my roommate, who was also my girlfriend, I decided to come back to my mom's house for the time being, even though I feel resentment for everyone, specially my mom, my grandparents are generally Nice people to me. I got set up in my old room and I have been living here for the last two months\n\nMy aunts moved out while I was gone and one of them now has a nephew who recently turned 2 years old, he has a mild case of autism, it isn't very severe at all but it does make him hard to discipline so for now, they give him whatever he wants (with restrictions) whenever he wants\n\nI keep old toys in my room behind my TV, partially because I haven't gotten around to correctly storing them and because they feel too important to me for just throw them in a box\n\nI was out to watch a movie while my aunt visited with my nephew, my grandmother thought it was a good idea to lend him MY Spiderman toys to play with\n\nI like this toys a lot, when I came home and found my nephew playing with them and bashing them on the floor, I was generally upset. I didn't take them away from him because that would just be rude, so I said my hello's and then waited until he was done playing with them and took them, although visibly irritated back in my room\n\nAfter my aunt left my grandmother asked me why I took them so angrily, I explained calmly that they were mine and I didn't understand why she took them without my permission, she got clearly irritated by this and said in a condescending tone that I don't even use them, why waste them? At this point I was somewhat angry and I wanted to go to sleep so I just said in a slightly (but maybe too) aggressive tone that she had no right to take them, even if I didn't use them, and I demanded she didn't take anything from me ever again without my permission, and she shouldn't even have entered my room in the first place\n\nAITA for lashing out at my grandmother for taking my toys? I understand it was for my nephew who has development problems, he likes Spiderman and she's right I don't even use them so I know WHY they took them but I just feel it was disrespectful at me. Is my anger justified? \n\n",

      "description": "All names have been changed.\n\nBackground: I’m 32F, my bf is 32M (Harry). We’ve been together for 4 years. He has a son (Ben, 10yo) with an ex wife (Amy, 29). They’ve been separated for about 6 years, but because of lack of money and other situational issues, they’ve only very recently started the divorce process. They don’t get along at ALL, but they obviously try to be civil for Bens sake. However she frequently tells Ben lies about my bf, and about me, and how we don’t want him around and so on. She also has another son (3yo) from another (now ex) boyfriend. \n\nHarry recently came into a bit of money over Christmas and decided to use it to pay for the divorce. He also discovered in the process that because they’ve been separated for over 5 years, he doesn’t need Amy to co-sign the divorce. Tbh I don’t know all the details about divorce because it confuses me but the way I understand it is she just gets a letter to say the divorce is being processed and if she wants to object to it she has X amount of days to do so (I’m in the UK). Their original agreement when they split up was that they’d split the cost of the divorce, but trying to get her to put any money towards it has been a nightmare, she frequently says she has no money but also spends a lot on holidays with her new bf.\n\n When Harry told her he’d started processing the divorce, he said if she could pay her half back that would be great but we didn’t expect her to and it’s fine anyway because we could afford it and he just wants to be divorced (we’re planning on getting engaged later this year as well). Her response to this was to tell Ben that Harry has spent £500 on a divorce and told him all the things Harry could have spent using that money, including things for Ben like video games and stuff like that. We’re not the richest of people, the only reason we could afford to pay the full divorce amount was because my bfs Grandmother passed away and had left him a small amount of money- the rest of it went on debts. When we next saw Ben (we have him on weekends) he was pretty upset that Harry had spent a lot of money on the divorce when he thought it wasn’t necessary. Like I don’t blame him for thinking that, honestly, he’s a kid and he’s probably more interested in the idea that his parents are gonna get back together eventually. A divorce in that context seems unnecessary. \n\nAnyway, IMO telling Ben about the divorce in this way seems pretty cruel? He knew his parents were separated and I feel like it was unnecessary to bring it up to upset him even more.\n\nThis was a month ago, and this now brings us onto the reason for my post. \n\nBen has been staying with us all week because his mum is on holiday in America with her bf. I said to Harry when we found out about this trip that I bet they’d get engaged because they were going over Valentine’s Day, and I think it’s also her bfs birthday this week as well.\n\nI was right, they’re now engaged, and ya know it’s no biggie because she can do whatever, but I’m annoyed because of how big a hard time she gave us over the divorce. So it seems a bit hypocritical of her to get engaged literally a month later.\n\nBut the real shitty thing, IMO, is how we found out they’re engaged. Her partner sent Ben a text last night at 4am UK time to tell him. It woke Ben up (I don’t condone him having his phone by his bed at night but that’s another topic). Now, to me, this seems super insensitive. Like this is a pretty big bombshell to drop on a 10 year old who is still sad about his parents splitting up. IMO, Amy should’ve been the one to tell him, it should’ve been in person, and it DEFINITELY shouldn’t have been at 4am. Now he’s awake and feeling pretty shit and Harry is comforting him because he’s really sad. Understandably so, in my opinion.\n\nAm I being too judgemental? I’m obviously not the parent here so don’t want to judge her parenting. We're definitely not perfect either. He probably would be pretty upset about this regardless of how he found out, but this definitely feels like an extra kick in the teeth for him. Like me and Harry have had conversations about how to tell people about getting engaged, and we’ve always agreed that we'd be super sensitive to Bens emotional well-being if we do. It doesn’t feel like Amy and her new bf have really considered his feelings at all, really.\n\nAm I being an asshole?",

      "description": "Because of the 3k words limit, I can't post everything I'd like to so just believe me that my father is genuinely not a good person.  \n\n\nHere's the story that happened last summer. In the middle of August, during a weekend, we got into yet another fight. This one ended up with me trying to escape and him pulling on my hair and bringing me to the ground. The only reason he didn't hit me was because my mom got between us. Right then and there I knew I didn't want anything to do with him anymore.\n\nI was to move out of the house to another town for school two weeks later. My father works in another town during the week so he isn't home until the weekend. When my mom and I were alone that week, I told her I wasn't coming home that weekend. I literally feared for my life at this point. I went to my boyfriend's house for the weekend. (I was now to move out in a week).\n\nBy Monday, I decided to stay another day, just to be sure. I got a call from my mom saying that my dad was MAD and that I needed to come home. She came to get me and in the car ride back home told me everything he told her during my little escape. He called her stupid, a whore and all types of other names for allowing this. He talked about her dad, who died when she was four, and said he was lucky to have never met her because she's so stupid.\n\nWhen we got home, my father scremed at me and insulted my mother in front of me. He wouldn't stop insulting my relationship with my boyfriend. We'd been togheter for only a month. I learned that his entire tantrum was basically because he didn't approve my relationship. (I'm still a minor and he's 6 years older than me. The age of consent is 16 where I live and I was at least that, so nothing illegal). After I argued with him for quite a while, everything settled down and he started crying that he lost his last weekend with his babygirl. I thought it was the end of it.\n\nBoy was I wrong! That night, while I was in my room with my sister, we heard my parents screaming at each other in the kitchen. My father ended up kicking my mom out of the house, followed by my sister who always hated him. I called my boyfriend to get me, wrote my phone number on a board downstairs in case my father would want to talk. \n\nThe only time I went back that week was on Saturday, so that my mom could finish moving me and my stuff to my apartment.\n\nThe next weekend, when I went back, my mom was back with my father and everyone acted like nothing happened.\nI no longer stay in their house and everytime I'm in my hometown, I stay with my boyfriend. When I'm to their house, I act like everything is fine because I don't want to cause a scene. I don't want to have anything to do with him and he is no longer the boss of me.\n\nAm I the asshole for not forgiving my father when everyone else did?",

      "description": "I know this sounds bad, but this has bugged me for a while now. I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 3 years and we've had little sexual intercourse, but after every time we do, she wants to get a morning-after pill (I don't know if plan B and morning after are the same). We've probably had sex 4 times and we had a 2 year abstinence period where she wanted to do pretty much nothing (handjobs and oral only). I never pressured her into it and I like to respect her decisions. We recently had sex for the first time in a long time and I thought it went well, the condom didn't break and I didn't touch myself before touching her, but she still thinks something went wrong. She's in Walgreens right now, buying a morning-after pill, but I can't but feel like it isn't needed as we were safe about it. So Reddit, I want to know, AITA for getting frustrated that every time we have sex she wants to buy one of these? They run for about $40 each and I feel it isn't too necessary.

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for 11 months, we haven't had any real problems in our relationship, ups and downs like most, but the downs rarely happen, and when they do we usually get over them pretty quick. Not sure if it matters much but here's a little backstory: We both kind of had trust issues in the past, as we've both been cheated on, used in the past. and we reassure eachother when we need it. She also says that if I just randomly left her one day she'd be fine, I don't really understand her need for saying that, I understand she's been hurt in the past, so I don't take it personally when she says stuff like that, since I occasionally wonder about her leaving me for someone, so I totally get it, and don't bring it up when she says it, I just try to reassure her I'm not going anywhere. For a little more backstory, we've kind of not been on the best of terms with the last day, she's been a little stressed as of late (lots of work, and going on new meds) but last night she went out for like 40 mins and when she got back I had asked her where she went to, and she said \"It doesn't matter\" So I said I was just curious, and asked why she got a little defensive about it, I dropped it pretty quickly after she said she didn't get defensive. So moving onto today, we're sending eachother some snapchats and she sends one that wasn't meant for me, it said \"I was all up in his guts last night\" so initially I was startled and questioned it, I asked her what was that about, and she said \"Nothing\" Then I said context is kind of important here, since you know the nature of what she said, then she said \"It was for a friend\" to which I replied, I wasn't asking about who it was for, I was asking about what it meant, and again she said \"Nothing\" so red flags obviously started going off in my head, so I start asking again, I say how I feel it's pretty important for her to give a little context to it because of what she actually said, this is where she starts getting a bit annoyed with me, or more annoyed even, since she's already annoyed at me since last night. She starts saying how it doesn't matter again, so I say how would you feel if I sent you a snapchat that wasn't meant for you saying that, she said she wouldn't care, which I feel like she would definitely question it too. then she say's that it was a joke meant for one of her friends, and how she told me she'd never hurt me or anything so why would she fuck around with someone? and how it doesnt matter anyway since she thinks I thought she was fucking around with someone. I'm aware of the joke,(there's an old guy who we all know, and they always joke about getting super sexual with him, I've joked about it before too) but since I don't hang around her and her friends much, I'm only aware of the joke and only joked about it once or twice, how was I to know about this though, I feel like the bad guy here for asking for a little context, behind it. She's not talking to me right now, and won't really let me explain my side of things, I feel like I didn't do anything wrong for asking for the backstory, I get her side of things and how she feels like I wouldn't trust her, but given both our past? I feel like I was definitely not in the wrong asking for an explanation.\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I (21M) come from a South Asian family (Indian) and my older cousin (28F) just turned 28 recently. Her sister is 21F. \n\nNow, given that I come from a South Asian family, its really taboo to talk about sexual things that openly. I think it's normal for most families/sibling type relationships to not talk that openly about sex, but even if it isn't, **it's DEFINITELY taboo in South Asian ones.**\n\nWe all know that we're doing that shit at uni/away from home, so yeah. \n\nAnyway my cousin wanted me and my brother (19M) to come to a nightclub with her for her birthday with all of her friends (27/28F) and her sister (21F). \n\nNow I've NEVER been in a situation like this before, to see my cousins at a nightclub. It's something I've always separated from my family, for obvious reasons. When I'm away at uni, I go clubbing and do my thing with my friends, but at my hometown, I don't do that shit. \n\nI'm tall (6''3) and quite muscular as well so when I go to clubs, I do get approached a fair bit sometimes. This is nice, **BUT IN THIS SITUATION** it worked AGAINST me, because I would likely have girls approaching me and trying to dance with me while my two cousins were there. \n\nI thought the reverse would be true. I'd see guys try to approach my cousins as well.\n\nWell, I made sure to drink very little because I didn't want to do anything stupid, and when I got to the club, I didn't see many guys approach my cousins. However, I got approached by one girl at the start of the night who tried talking to me on the dancefloor, and I motioned her with my hands to go away (hand gestured her to fuck off basically).\n\nMy cousins saw that. Then later on in the night, another girl approached me and tried to grind up on me, this was awkward as fuck, and I whispered in her ear ''Fuck off'. \n\nI got death stares from that girl and her friend group, and my cousins were weirded out at seeing girls approach me.\n\nI felt like I was on high alert really, with my cousins there. So one more girl approached me later on and tried to talk, and again, I just left and went to the toilet to ditch her. \n\nI was on high alert the whole night, and any time a girl tried to approach me, I shot them down. But I feel it was warranted given the circumstances. Had my cousins not been there, I likely would have pursued it further with these girls because I thought they looked okay. AITA?",

I’m usually a sold B- to B+ student in that class and haven’t gotten a test above a 90 all year.  While she always got 90s and above. \n\nI was sick of being more or less behind the 8 ball so i got a tutor once a week and it really helped! We had this big test yesterday and i finished it with time left while the rest of the class didn’t and was not confident at all. \n\nNow my anxiety kicked in and i thought “Well you finished so fast cause you messed up x, y, and z.” etc etc. I’m always\n\nSo this morning i went up to her (she missed the test due to something else, so she hasn’t taken it yet) and say something along the lines like this “I’m kinda worried about this... i either did well or did really shit” i say jokingly. I might’ve just been fishing for compliments but i needed the morale support. she responded with “Yeah you probably did do shit.” i got pretty offended and was annoyed at her but shook it off, thinking it was just a joke. \n\nCut to the class before math. I was talking to her again and she mentioned it again, how i am dumb and suck. Now that really pissed me off. I’m not going to hit a woman, obviously. so i just ignored her for the entire class and math. i refused to sit next to her because of that and she had to sit alone. i felt bad b/c i felt like i was being too mean. \n\nI decided to go up to my teacher after class to ask if he graded my test. he said no but he decided to grade it and explain what i did wrong. \n\nSurprisingly i got a 98% on that and felt so happy!! i’ve been happy ever since and still am just because of that. \n\nI decided to call my friend a few hours ago. I didn’t say i was sorry but decided to brag and say i got a 98% on the test. I was thinking she would’ve said good job or sorry or something but just say “Okay” and i hung up, annoyed.\n\nAITA for still being mad and ignoring her still? i honestly plan to ignore her for a while hoping that she says something. \n\nTL;DR my friend called me dumb which got me annoyed. I gloated to her about how i got a good grade on a test and she didn’t say anything back. am i the asshole for still being mad and ignoring her?",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this short. \n\nSince we've been together, I have always been the one to do laundry, do the dishes, clean the house and keep things tidy. Also, I find myself cleaning up after him *a lot*; i.e he will leave dishes, clothes and everything in general where he feels like it and leave them there\n\n That's where I feel irritated because there are obviously places where those things belong, but he's just too lazy(?) to do it. I've tested it before, and it will be like 4 days until he does it himself. \n\nWhen I ask him to start helping out, he of course is all for it, but he doesn't follow through. He only does it when i ask him to on the spot. I feel like it should be unnecessary to ask to simply help out with household chores. \n\nLately it has been driving me nuts. Since he had said he would help out and try to be more tidy with HIS belongings, I felt I put faith in him carrying through. But nothing has changed. I stopped doing the dishes to see if he would take it upon himself to do them, he doesn't. He still leaves his things around everywhere that I pick up after him after he leaves for work. I feel spiteful because I think 'how fekkin hard is it to pick up after yourself, I do it all the time'. \n\nI like my space tidy and it seems it doesn't matter to him if dishes sit around for a couple days in our bedroom, dishes are piling up in the sink for over 4 days or the pile of clothes on the floor for a week.\n\nNow he works 10 hour days and i don't currently work due to car issues that will soon be resolved, so i am and have been home most of the time.\nI know he going to pull the card that I'm home all day all the time so there should be no reason why I shouldn't do it. But I have been doing this, like I said, since we've been together, when we both had full time jobs and very little down time. He acts like I haven't been doing his laundry and mine, been cleaning the house and doing dishes all myself with little to no help from him. I feel like I shouldn't be asking him to contribute to OUR household. He should take it upon himself. \n\n Normally I would do dishes, laundry, cleaning, but I have resorted to cleaning up after myself only to see what happens. One of the things is like hanging up his jackets and putting away his shoes. TODAY he told me he just didn't see the big deal *when I told him many of times* to please hang up your jackets cuz it doesn't belong on the floor or in the chair. \n\nI feel like a maid, not like a partner in a relationship. I don't know what to do because I don't know to tell him nicely that I think he is lazy and inconsiderate, and I don't want it to end it a screaming match. \n\nAm I overreacting? Am I justified? I feel like an a hole for just wanting help around the house and him to have respect and decency for me and the house. ",

      "description": "I lurk, but this is my first post. I apologize if I’ve inadvertently broken any rules. Some background: I (24F) am the only one in my age group in my whole family (immediate and extended). There’s the grownups, and then the preteen/teen kids. So I’m the loner in family settings. I’m also the black sheep of the family, academics and career wise. Also, for context on my family, see post history if you’d like.\n\nNow, my family are South Indian, and we live in the U.S. We don’t really do holidays. Last holiday season/winter break, a couple of relatives along with their families came to stay with us. This was mostly fun, save for me being the only one in my age group. But a little overwhelming in that a couple of the kids (preteen) were a little bit loud and obnoxious (“I wanna do thiiiissss”).\n\nThis year, same thing but in my uncles’ state. My family figured why not, let’s road trip it. When asked if I’d go, I said I wasn’t sure, because my parents have this tendency to get stressed when packing, and take it out on me, the morning of road trips. And I’m typically their punching bag. So I alluded to not wanting to put myself in that situation, following at both of them doing exactly what I said they tend to do and blow up at me. So I said I would go, just to keep the peace.\n\nA few days ago, I told my mom how I felt about being the only person my own age out of all these people. Her response: “I’ll hang out with you and we can do whatever you want!” Most of you would find this sweet, but knowing my mom, she has a Jekyll and Hyde personality. She’ll say these things and then call me needy, and belittle me for liking to shop and go to bars. Which is what twenty somethings like to do.\n\nPart of not wanting to go is FOMO. I know most of my friends would have family commitments around christmastime anyway. But for New Years, I’m the type that likes to dress up and go out. AITA if I say, “hey can I come on this trip for this long but be home for New Years because I’d like to do something with friends?” ",

      "description": "Today, we had a test during Calculus and I along with this classmate, Mason, were some of the last ones to finish. I turned mine in and started talking to my friend who sat a bit close to Mason but no where directly near, around 5 feet away from him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important to know that I used to have a part time job at an ice cream place and we used to collect cash tips during our bi weekly pay which I'd hoard in my backpack whenever I'd have to buy lunch off campus. So my backpack is basically filled with a bunch of loose change. I'm zipping up my backpack and this random guy approaches me and gives me $20 and tells me it was on the ground next to me and I had probably dropped it. I didn't think too much of it and thanked him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMason sees this altercation but it doesn't occur to him until 2 minutes later. He says, \"That's my 10 dollars, can I have it back I have to pay dues.\" I tell him it's 20 dollars and he doesn't say much except ask for it back because he thinks it is his. It was next to me on the ground, and he didn't even say the correct amount. I left the class with my friend and he continued to text me multiple times, switching his story that his mom gave him the money asking him for change back, to his dad giving him cash and he forgetting it wasn't $10. He also sent me a screenshot of him asking him how much dues were, which doesn't prove anything. I don't really buy his excuse and I'm pretty certain the money fell from my bag.  \n\n\nIt sucks that he lost his money, but AITA for not giving him $20 that he claimed was his? ",

      "description": "This didn’t happen recently but I still don’t know who’s the asshole here.. It was sophomore year, my roommate (RM) from freshman year and I decided to room for the second year. (Side note, everyone we knew were surprised, were polar opposite people but were respectful of each other’s differences, and having each other around seemed to be beneficial for both of us, new experiences, varying viewpoints etc). Anyway we’re buying our books for our second semester and I realized my RM and I had the same class, but on opposite days. He already bought the book used for $40. I asked him if I could borrow it for the semester, and if we both ever needed it to study or do homework he would have priority, and I’d use it when he’s done. He said that’s fine, but asked if I’d pay him half for the book. Personally I wouldn’t charge, and he knew I take good care of all my possessions. But it being his book, I wasn’t going to refuse.\n\nNow there was a second class that we both shared but on opposite days. RM was having trouble finding a used copy (he always tries to be frugal) and I decided to just buy a new copy for $100. He asked if he could borrow it for the semester, like how I’d borrow one of his. I said “oh sure, but that’ll be $50. Or since I owe you $20, it’ll be $30. Or you know, we could just not charge each other for borrowing something if it doesn’t really cause any inconvenience”. \n\nHe of course agreed to no longer charge me $20, and I wouldn’t charge him $50. Now obviously this was beneficial to him but I still want to know who’s the asshole. Am I an asshole for wanting to borrow his book without paying him, or is he an asshole for wanting me to split the cost, even though he already bought the book and I’d always let him have the book whenever he needed it?",

      "description": "Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile.\n\nFormer lurker (had to make a new account) first time poster.\n\nApologies for the length, it's a lot on my chest.\n\nMy father passed away last year suddenly/borderline expectedly, he had many many many health issues over the years and was declining finally his body had enough. The \"problem\" is mostly my grandmother, my grandfather is incredibly passive and strongly avoids confrontation unless he deems it absolutely necessary. However my grandmother who I love very very much and am very close to is a bit of a nutter (paranoid, super hypochondriac, very overbearing because she cares) and losing my dad she's taken things super hard to the point of obsessing over his passing and basically ignoring the fact she has a dozen grandkids and 3 living children. She borderline creeps me out as of recent with how she treats me and gives me \"this look\"  like she's searching out my dad  in me due to looking very similar, similar quirks,  and hobbies/interests. Due to this I've distanced myself and being the golden grandchild that she practically assisted in raising and \"her boy's girl\", it's bothered her \n\nThey've taken the loss hard, as have I, they lost a child and I lost my dad.\n\nMy dad and I were/are avid hunters and outdoorsy people, it's one of the areas we massively bonded over. In his passing the only things I received that he was adamant I get were all of his guns, hunting and heirloom. So I received all his guns including the few heirloom ones that have now passed down the generations four fold. These guns were promised to me, being the eldest, before Dad's health with southbound. It has been brought up multiple times that my grandfather wants the heirloom guns back to the point where I've been cornered about it by my grandma and my grandpa has low-key inquired on if I have them. We had dinner together one night and I just knew the guns would be brought up and they did. Grandpa said that if I realllllly wanted them and if my dad wanted/told me to have them I can keep them, grandma didn't like that saying they weren't dad's to give away (????) and I need to give them to Grandpa.\n\n Now in my eyes they're mine I cherish them and take extremely good care of them and recently dropped a lot of money on cleaning them up a bit and fixing a few broken parts. Grandma went as far to guilt trip me saying they need to go to grandpa because they're his (even though he passed them on to my dad with the intent that they're to be passed along). Another part of my issue with giving in is that they won't agree to putting it in grandpa's will that I would get them back after he passes. \n\nIt's been stated that the first male grandson would get first dibs on grandpa's guns he still has (old school southern rules) but my cousin has zero interest in guns, outdoors, or even wanting them. He'd just pawn them like everything else he's gotten, he's directly stated such, I asked if he would just give me them and he said no they're worth cash and he'd want the cash. My mom, my sister, my dad's siblings (except my bitch aunt- male cousins mom), and my mom's family say I shouldn't feel bad about not giving them \"back\", that dad wanted me to have them, grandpa already gave them to dad way back, and it's unfair of them to put me in this position and it's honestly just tearing me up that they're trying to call take backsies. Especially since they've pressured us a lot about getting SO MUCH of my dad's stuff that we ended up giving them, it seems like they just want more and more. Even pushing my mom about Dad's ashes, they want more for other elaborate reasons other than dad's wishes almost leaving my mom, sis, and I with not many at all for what we decide to do. Am I the asshole not giving these heirloom guns my dad willed to me up the ladder to my grandpa leaving me with the likely hood of never having them again especially since they've taken so many other special things that I gave up to keep the peace?\n\nTl;Dr: Grandma is guilt trip/ pressure me citing my grandpa and to give him heirlooms he passed onto dad who passed them to me, and I don't want to/think I should and have defended my stance as such, AITA?

It's in an actual job capacity where i get paid and everything. \n\nThere was an absolutely bad start I will admit where I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't take the job seriously enough. So they had a nanny cam installed. \n\nI suffer from clinical paranoia and mild psychosis ( i know thats a heavy word but it just means i get easily paranoid  ) so i begged them to always tell me once it was put up ( they would periodically take it down or choose to put it up ) because seeing it or finding out i was being watched without my knowledge can trigger a huge paranoia attack and ill feel like there are cameras all over the house. \n\nWell it's been months without it and I thought we were doing good but i recently found it plugged in though it was never turned on and it was hidden away which set me off even more. It's since been moved and even has things blocking its lense but its still plugged in. I haven't brought it up because our living situation is kinda volatile especially with the babys father so.\n\nIt's not even a case of me over performing when the camera is on and presenting a false image. I still make mistakes when it's on tbh though small ones here and there. I don't mind it being on too much its just, as i said the lack of honesty. \n\nTo clarify non audio nanny cams without the nannys consent are perfectly legal in my state.\n\nAm i the asshole for being upset?

      "description": "Background: I work as a lead bartender at a small restaurant. I have a good rapport with the owner after I took over a bunch of responsibilities when the bar manager left. We currently haven't found a replacement bar manager so the bartender on shift and the chef are the ones in charge. \n\nThe owner has been asking me about a server (since I work with this person directly). Usually I stay out of these things, but this server really grinds my gears. I didn't go into detail but I did mention my main frustrations. \n\nWe'll refer to him as Jay. I should put that he's been spoken to about the problems and will fix it for like a week and then go back to before. \n\nJay is disrespectful to anyone with authority. If he disagrees with a decision he will argue and give us attitude. These are small procedural requests we're asking, nothing outside of his responsibilities. There are even instances where he has gone from one lead person to another to try to have a decision overridden because he wasn't happy with it. \n\nHe is repeatedly coming in to his shift with food and spending the first 30 or so minutes of his shift eating or picking at it. This irks me especially when the rest of us are working away. And the smoke breaks, my God the smoke breaks. And no one else is a smoker here. \n\nHe's rude and snapped at our weekend support person. This one person hosts, takes the delivery/takeout orders, and helps with running food, and bussing. They are also new to the industry, so all in all trying hard, and doing a good job so far.\n\nWe've spoken to him about these problems multiple times, but he always has an excuse, always has to be dramatic. \n\nI just try to never get involved in these things. I also hear Jay talk about how money is so tight for him and all this financial stress he is going through. So there is definitely that guilt. And I can't help but feel like a gossip, even though the owner asked me directly. \n\n",

      "description": "So this happened last semester, but I only just found out about the results and I'm sorta feeling like what I did might not have been as good as I thought it was.\n\nIn Spring of 2018 I took Pre-calc with a Professor, we'll call him Dr. Smith. Dr. Smith was a very nice person, very friendly and very humorous, but as a professor... he sucked. He let us out early, and all of our homework and exams (including half the final!) were online, which sounds great, except that we didn't cover anything we needed in class, and there would be things on our exams that we had no idea how to solve, The homework was just trial-and-error, do it until you get it right, no matter how many tries it takes or if it makes sense, and after the first exam students would meet up and do them together, and that was the only way to get them right. On top of almost never teaching until the end of class, Dr. Smith often cancelled. By the end of the semester, we were so unprepared for the department final he gave us cheat sheets and spent the last class \"reviewing\" (he taught us how to do the exact problems but with slightly different numbers.)\n\nMost of us passed with very good grades because we figured out how to get the answers, but we didn't really learn. It became very obvious in Calculus when we were very lost in the review. My new professor, Dr. \"Jones\" asked me who my old professor was, and didn't we cover trig? I answered honestly, that is was Dr. Smith, and no, we got a reference sheet in the last week, but that was about it. Some other girls from Dr. Smith's class told her the same thing. Well, Dr. Jones was really upset with this I guess and she had me and some other students come to her office before class and write statements about what our class was like. She told us it was totally optional and if we didn't want to we didn't have  to, but I did, and I went all out in mine, basically talking about what I detailed here.\n\nWell, it turns out there was a full investigation into Dr. Smith, and he's not allowed to let students out early, or give online assignments anymore. He's also very grumpy now. Apparently lots of students were disappointed too, because they specifically took Dr. Smith because of how he taught (or well, didn't,) and now he can't work like that anymore.\n\nIf I didn't say anything to Dr. Jones, or write a huge statement about the class for the department investigation, then he may not have gotten in trouble. And even though I was totally lost and unprepared when Calculus started, I was able to get back on track, so I think I overreacted.''\n\nTL;DR: Didn't like the way a professor taught (or really, didn't), mentioned it to another professor when she asked, he got investigated and got him in trouble.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

It was a casual dining type of cafe that had smashing sandwiches (really just out of this world), so the crowd would get pretty intense. \n\nThere’s usually an equal number of people dining in and packing to go, but as I was having lunch with a friend to catch up we needed a table. \n\nObviously, they’re all taken so we stand about waiting (it’s socially acceptable where I’m from, idk about the US). A table of two guys is done with their food (empty plates, no drink) and they’re chatting pretty intensely. \n\nI think they’re about to be done as there’s no more food so I wait 5 minutes. Then 10. It doesn’t look like they’re about to leave despite the obvious crowd forming waiting for tables. \n\nSo I approach them and ask ‘So sorry, excuse me, are you going to be leaving soon?’\n\nOne of the guys apologises profusely and gets up to leave, but the other gives the dirtiest disgusted look, glowers and huffs off with his friend. Ok now I feel bad. I guess he was a paying customer and had a right to use the table as he wished. There were no restaurant rules governing this. \n\nAITA? You can be honest :(\n",

      "description": "My Grandfather was by all means an incredible man. He served in WW2 in the Army Air Corps and throughout all of his stories and mottos he always seemed to be a spectacular person that I never got the opportunity to meet. That said...\n\nMy only memories of him were as a young child since before he got sent to an old folks home and later died of some pretty criminal neglect (that's for a different story some other time.) He had really severe Alzheimer's when I was a kid. Me and my cousins would always avoid his seat at the dinner table because he was groggy and incoherent as if the poor old man didn't have a soul left in him. It haunted my nightmares, his empty eyes as my mom would push whichever unlucky kid forwards and ask him if he could name us. He never could, so it was always an uncomfortable situation for everyone. \n\nMy grandmother wanted my grandfather and her to be buried togeather after she died, but my grandfather expressed an intent that he had to be creamated. (As a mortician himself, I assume he had his reasons). After he was cremated my mom has kept his ashes in a urn ever since and has proudly professed that she will only see them with herself for as long as she should live.\n\nTo soothe my grandmother, I expressed to her that when my mom died I would be burying my grandfather alongside of her. My mother took issue to this, saying that she wanted me to keep the urn after her death so that it could always be in my house with my family (and he could still be alive, in this sense). She's very insistent on it.\n\nI'm sure that my grandfather was a great man, but it would feel so weird to me to keep a urn that belonged to someone who I genuinely never knew. The only evidence that I have of me and him in a picture was him smiling at me after my birth. I don't know if me or him would ever have gotten along or if he would've supported my interests. \n\nHell, I don't even know if \"being left with a bisexual grandson and his boyfriend\" would've been an afterlife that he would've wanted. \n\nMy mom suggests to me that family is more important, but I don't know. It's an unfortunate scenario that my grandfather could never have met us grandkids like he would've wanted, but it feels weird to be responsible for his urn when he's essentially a stranger to me. \n\nAm I The Asshole? Should I hold onto my grandfather's urn?",

His real dad is a complete dumpster, never wanted to have anything to do with her or her son.\nI love them both, and I marry her a year later. Then we have another son, B, who is healthy and amazing. For three years, we're all happy. We were saving for a house, both working, and taking care of our two boys.\nThen we hit a rough patch. Money is tight, with daycare and neither of us had gone to college, but we're doing well, established in our respective industries. Then she starts to slip, spending time out of the house more, going out with friends. I'm ok with this, since she didn't have a traditional post high school life since she was pregnant her senior year of high school. But then she goes silent, and we rarely talk. Then on a Tuesday, she announces she's leaving.\nShe grabbed some stuff and went to live with a dude she met at work, and had been seeing on the sly when I was home with the kids.\nFast forward a few months, and she's back in town, her and her new BF have an apartment, and has more contact with our two sons.\nThen she gets pregnant with BF's kid, C.\nFast forward another few years, and they all live with her and BF and I see my two boys on the weekend.\nFast forward until last fall, they both get arrested, and DHS removed all kids, giving me full custody of my two sons, and placing the youngest with her sister. If her sister doesn't take him, he could be placed in foster care.\nNow I've spoken to my son's, and they both are kind indifferent to the youngest, C. C was treated like a prince, while A and B were both constantly ragged on by EX and BF.\nSo the question, am I the asshole for not wanting to take in the youngest? He's not my son, and I've had very little contact with him.\n\n(I've kept this very non descript because I don't want anyone I know to find out I'm reaching out)",

      "description": "So I have a trip to Disney coming up soon, we leave on Sunday. My girlfriend and I have been planning this trip for a long time, she has never been to Disney before, and we have never been on a vacation on our own before. Of course we are very excited. Well my mom also happened to be planning to go to Disney few days after we will have arrived. \n\nThey are flying down, wheras we will driving about 12 hours there. We agreed months ago to take my sister who is also in college with us because her spring break aligns with ours. As it happens, my mom's boyfriend is terrified of flying, so he had planned to get a ride down with some friends of his instead of getting on the plane with my mom and the kids. It turns out for whatever reason he can no longer ride down with those friends so my mom asked my girlfriend and I if he can ride with us and my sister. I said that I would really rather not take him with us, I don't know him that well and my girlfriend really doesn't know him very well, and we were all pretty excited to have our first road trip as adults without any older people with us. We are fully paying for the trip ourselves, and planned it all out on our own. \n\nNow my mom seems to be mad at me because I said I don't want to take her boyfriend with us. Am I an asshole for not wanting to take my mom's boyfriend on a road trip with us with 2 days notice? ",

      "title": "AITA for expecting an extra class to be free when the teacher called me to apologize for forgetting to teach important things in previous lessons?",
      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy husband and I started taking dance classes about a month ago. The center where we take classes offered a free private trial class. After we took that we signed up for their \"new students\" course/level which was 4 private classes and a few group classes for about $500. Once we completed that we entered the next level which is \"elementary\". For this and pretty much all future levels we pay the same $500 and we get 4 private classes and access to all group classes as long as they aren't super high level. There are about 10 classes a week we could attend that aren't too high level. We decided to attend at least five a week to get our money's worth.\n\nWe take one private a week and we were set to take our third private this month yesterday. Our teacher called me on Wednesday and immediately apologized. She said she had been focusing too much on certain dances and failed to teach us some important basic footwork. She taught a group class where we got a little lost on the footwork because we hadn't learned it yet, but we just did our best and didn't mind being lost. I told her it's no problem and we expect to be confused sometimes since we're still new. She said she wants to fix this since she should've taught us this already, she asked if  we could take an additional private class, making back to back privates on Thursday, in place of our next group class so she can teach us this footwork and we can catch up faster. I said yes, that sounds good and thank you for caring so much about our progress. \n\nWhen we finished the first private on Thursday and took a quick break, my husband asked if there was a cost for this next private. The teacher said it's part of the package, so we would just need to pay our monthly fee earlier once we use up our four privates. This means we'd lose a week of group classes essentially. The faster we take our four privates the faster we need to pay the $500 again for access to the group classes and to re-up our privates. I think we have to at least take one private a week to get access to all the group classes.\n\n I was surprised and kind of embarrassed, on the phone I was positive she was saying she felt bad and wanted to correct her mistake and I assumed this meant it was free as we pay a monthly fee to the center. We apologized and said we can't pay more than the $500/month, and we'd be happy to take the group class in place of this extra private class since the group classes are included. She said she thought she made this all clear on the phone and this private was scheduled, so she couldn't teach anyone that hour. We went to the group class and she ended up helping teach the group class as she was free that hour. She didn't seem happy for the group class.\n\nI was a teacher myself for most of my 20s and I taught private classes both on my own and through my companies. I taught a handful of these types of privates where something went wrong or the student was unhappy and wanted a bit more class time to learn something. I expected to be paid for my time when I taught for the companies I worked for, but the student was only ever expected to continue paying their normal weekly/monthly tuition. The privates were free when they were offered to fix a mistake or essentially keep a student from changing companies. I thought this was fairly normal in for-profit companies.\n\nI want to know if I should have expected this to be charged considering she first presented it as a mistake on her part she wanted to correct. I know now I should have asked on the phone about money, but at the time I didn't even consider it since we pay monthly for a package. I wasn't going to ask at all, my husband was skeptical though and asked. I was surprised she called at all or felt bad about her teaching so far as we've been happy in her classes. My husband thinks she wasn't that concerned about our progress, but she had available slots and wanted to fill them to make more money and that's why she called. In any case, I want to bake something when we go back to classes next week since our teacher talked about loving cookies. I just want to awkwardness to be gone. I have no idea how her pay works with her company when it comes to teaching privates and classes and down time. I assume she was paid something for helping teach the group class. A few teachers often show up five minutes or so into group classes to help teach the main instructor when they're not teaching private lessons themselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My teacher called me and apologized for neglecting to teach us some important basic footwork in our private dance classes. She asked to have an additional private class with us to fix her mistake and get us caught up. I thought it was free or included in our monthly fee to the studio, it wasn't. We apologized and canceled the private for our original group class when we found out it was not free just before starting it, she's not happy now. It's awkward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for expecting the class to be free and for choosing the free group class when I learned we'd have to pay the monthly fee again a week early?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This is not an attempt to manipulate them into having kids\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in my mid 60's and have 6 kids (all adults, 4 daughters 3 sons).\n\n  \nI grew up in a very poor family and have worked incredibly hard my entire life to provide for my family. Working 50+ hours a week and investing every spare dollar into blue chips. As a result, my entire estate is worth well over $10M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to the topic of my post. Three of my kids are proud \"child-free\" adults. Not only do they not want kids, they actively celebrate it (I believe there's even a reddit dedicated for it...). Now, if they don't want to experience the joys of being parents, that's for them to decide. I'm not going to coerce them into having kids they don't want.\n\n  \nWith that said, I provided all my kids an immensely comfortable childhood, I've put them all through college, I basically gave them the best chance to starting out in life. Now that they're all grown up, I want to help raise the next generation of grandkids and provide for them as much as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the situation is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I have three kids who are proud \"child-free\" and genuinely boast about how much extra money they have\n2. I have four kids who have started raising families - intending to have more kids - and will actually need the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to leave a large sum of my hard earned money to my kids who will simply spend it all on their \"child-free\" life. I only want it to go to my kids who are actually raising a family. So I want to cut the three out of my will almost entirely (leaving a small amount to help with their mortgages).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI already anticipate they're going to throw a hissyfit, so I'm not sure if I should go through with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an \"asshole\" for doing this?",

      "description": "My partner moved into my apartment last year and , and him and his son have already taken over most of my house. (Changing my workshop and my guest room to be a play room and bedroom for his son) i never really cared about them taking over my space. I loved the feeling of a small family. However I do work from home. I make huge resin castings and various other art pieces that take days to cure and harden. Since I don’t have my work room anymore, I do all of this at my kitchen table. It’s a pretty messy and fumey project so I never work on them when my partners 3 year old son is at the house. My main problem, is for the past few weeks I’ve been “babysitting” his son and losing a lot of work time.My partners Ex thinks I don’t work because I’m disabled, and texts me almost daily asking if she can drop off the kid to me while she works her 4 hour shift then runs errands (this usually takes from 7am-7/8pm for some reason). If I don’t reply, she texts my partner and he says yes for me, (without asking). She usually leaves me with a bag of all dirty clothes, since my partner offered we would wash his clothes for some reason a long time ago. I’ve done it with the impression that at least his dad will get to see him and spend some time with him, but she always picks her son up a an hour to half an hour before his dad gets home. I don’t mind watching him on Friday’s (he stays with us every weekend) or on days when he will get to see his dad, but giving up my art and my work so that my partners Ex can just have some free time is bothering me so much. I just feel like my partners Ex thinks she can take advantage of me since I’m disabled but my partner isn’t seeing it. My partner heard my frustration and has been offering to pay me to watch his child, but I want to tell him to just pay an actual babysitter and let me get back to my work. ",

Ever since her mother found out that I have a genetic desease she basically hated me and wanted us to break up. She comes from a cultur which puts lots of emphasis on physical appearance. She wanted me to get a consultation about wheter my genetic condition is hereditary and I consented.\n\nI do understand that she wants to know the risk if my fiance and I decide to have children. Lately she has been suggesting me to get a major surgery to reconstruct my face. She even says that she will refuse to come to the wedding if I do not do this. This is something though I categorically refuse. My reasoning for this is the following:\n\n    There are risk just as with any major surgery. Also my self image is obviously tied to how I look now. I might not even like how I look even if in the best case my face came of symmetric without complications.\n\n    If is my body and I feel extremely violated of her (my fiances mother) to suggest this and even urge me to do this by threatening not coming to our wedding.\n\n    I very much doubt her motives. She says it is to improve my self image but if so she should be able to accept if I just do not want to do this. I strongly believe it is only about how her friends and family will think about her. Like how could her daughter marry someonly like me.\n\nMy fiance and me have been fighting about this issue a lot. She wants me to at least get a check up for the surgery and I refuse. I don't see the reason why I should get a check up if I do not want to go through with the surgery anyway.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to compromise even if my future mother in law will not come to the wedding?\n",

      "description": "My SO (30M) and I (20sF) have two kids, a 4 year old and an 18 month old, with a child on the way. I decided this year, to my SO’s dismay, that we were not going to get a real tree because I do not want to deal with the pine needles and having to water it. I dragged him along with me to pick up a tree, so I did not have to rely on a sales associate to load it for me (being pregnant and all). \n\nMy SO takes a break from playing Fortnite on the living room tv for the afternoon after the kids wake up from their naps. We head out to the store, and as soon as we get back he starts playing Fortnite with his online friends. He doesn’t eat dinner with us, and says he’ll eat later. Whatever, I’ll get over it. When we finish and I ask him to set up the tree, he kept his headset on and conversed with his friends. \n\nHe became annoyed with me as I fluffed up the branches because I had to stand partially blocking the tree (tree is next to the tv in the corner of the room). When I was ready to decorate, I had to wait until he finished his match as he mad it clear he would be upset if I blocked the tv. After the game ended, he promised his friends he’d be back on later. \n\nI was relieved, and hoped he would participate in decorating, or at the very least be present. The 18 month old, naturally, was making the process difficult, so I had the baby sit with my SO in front of the tree. Rather than even be a participant, my SO sat on his phone and looked at “funny” (to him) memes. I was thoroughly annoyed at this point. The only time he looked up from his phone was to scold the 4 year old for eagerly helping himself to putting ornaments up. \n\nAfter I finished the tree, he put the kids to bed and went out to his “man cave” to continue Fortnite. Am I the asshole and should let this go, or is my SO inconsiderate?\n\nI’d like to add that he isn’t necessarily a bad guy or a bad father, he’s just clueless and doesn’t understand little sentimental activities, I guess.

      "description": "To preface, this girl (22f) and I (22f) were friends for awhile a few years ago. She got engaged while we were still friends, and was on a good path. We had a falling out, and awhile after, she was dumped and started to spiral. To my knowledge, she was getting drunk every night, etc. but TBH I don’t know the extent or the story. I do know she entered an outpatient program for awhile.\n\nHowever, we connected again over Snapchat a few months ago and I saw she had started drinking again. I told her to be safe/careful and we started to chat a little. I still don’t know the story behind all of it, but I know she gets a little wild when she drinks if she’s out.\n\nLast night, my bf had some friends (around 8 of us total) over to drink and hang out. We drink MAYBE twice a month. It’s not a big part of our lives. One person there wasn’t drinking, and some were drinking pretty little - so it wasn’t as if this was anything too crazy. I decided to invite the aforementioned friend, as I hadn’t seen her in awhile and we’d been talking about getting together. She brought her new boyfriend and things started slow. I saw that she had brought alcohol and was drinking, but I didn’t feel it was my place to say something when I don’t know the full story of where she’s at, etc.\n\nAs the night when on, she teetered on the line of out of control. She kept saying “this is what happens when you invite an alcoholic to the party”, and I didn’t think much of it at the time. She’d sit down and have normal conversations with little spurts of wild and crazy.\n\nThis morning, I woke up and I feel like a horrible person. I feel like I enabled her, and that makes me a fucking awful human being. But at the same time, I felt it wasn’t my place - since we just reconnected - to step in. So, do your worst: AITA?\n\nTLDR; I let an alcoholic newly reconnected friend make her own choices, I feel like an assbag.",

      "title": "AITA For asking my girlfriend to pay rent for the 1 month she will live with me?",
      "description": "So my girlfriend and I are both juniors in college. this summer I am planning to spend 2 months away 3 hours from home taking classes so that I can get my pre-med classes out of the way. I plan to take 8 credits at a time, and work part-time to help sustain myself. \n\nWhen I told my girlfriend (of 4 years) of this plan, and the dates I'd be doing it, she offered to come spend 1 out of the 2 months with me (not both months because she has an internship starting back home, as well as a family vacation). She would  transfer her job to the nearby store (they wouldn't have a problem with it), and agreed that she would pay half the rent for that one month.\n\nAfter talking to her mom (who has always been a helicopter parent and essentially refuses to let my girlfriend \"leave the nest\"), her mom doesn't think that she should have to pay rent, because, \"It doesn't make sense for him to make you pay half the rent for the month if he is going to be there regardless of whether you are there or not.\"\n\nI feel like with this logic, you could say the same thing about when I am in medical school. Why pay half the rent to live in my apartment with me if I'm going to be there whether she's there or not?\n\nNow her mom has essentially convinced her that she shouldn't be paying rent. While half the rent for one month might not actually come out to that much money in the long run, it's the basic principle that she doesn't feel she should pay for it, even when it was *her idea*, that is bothering me.\n\nOn top of that, if I was expecting to be alone, I'd probably cram myself in the cheapest studio apartment I could find. But if I plan to be with someone else, I would probably try to find something a little bigger so that there's a little breathing room. I would still just pay the second month of rent myself. Her mom's response is that \"he shouldn't be basing the kind of apartment he gets off of whether you'll be there or not.\" As my girlfriend has grown up with her mom constantly being authoritarian, she is easily swayed by her opinions.\n\nAITA for this?",

      "description": "Okay, context is required for this, because otherwise, this would be an easy yes, I am the huge asshole and even I can see that. But there's more too it than that. So much so that I really can't tl;dr this, because I really do feel everything is important.\n\nI'm 18 years old and I live with my mum and my 12-year old sister who is autistic. Up until September last year, we also lived with my dad. He was... very abusive. Physically, mentally, even sexually. I told my boyfriend the truth of what I'd been living with and he went straight to the police. My dad was removed and I've not seen him since. The police investigation is ongoing.\n\nJust a bunch of more details: this occurred less than 6 months ago. There's been no mention of divorce between Mum and Dad. In fact, my sister still asks when he will come back. She doesn't understand. Mum is... much more vulnerable than she realizes, I think. She's seeing a therapist and going through something called the Freedom Program which helps identify and cope with coming out of abusive relationships with narcissistic and dominant partners. This was probably what inspired me to make the post, because although this question has been nagging me for a while and the argument I mention later happened a while back, she had her first Freedom Session today and came back with Personal Safety Alarms for myself and her (not my sister because she'd just mess with it).\n\nThis is my mum's second marriage and she's recently been talking to a man on FB, let's call him Steve (not really ofc). They were chatting and Mum insisted nothing was happening between them. Big fat lie. She was awful hiding the fact that every text they sent was finished with a flurry of hearts and he called her 'babes'. She also was having panic attacks whenever she went into the town where my dad worked, something she told Steve and not me, her own daughter. I also feel it important to mention that she's never met this Steve in person.\n\nI blew up at her over it. I just did not feel ready. I was not ready for Mum to jump into dating again, my sister certainly wouldn't be and I know for a fact that her therapist told her that she wasn't ready for it. I was really angry. But, on the other hand, I totally understand where Mum is coming from - she mentions a lot how she hasn't been happy for the past 20 years with him, how she wishes she could have someone who cares for her as my boyfriend cares for me (see above that he was the one who went to the police). She even mentioned at one point that she didn't want to have to choose between me as a daughter or being happy in a relationship.\n\nSo I don't know. I feel like none of us are really ready for her jumping into the dating pool again after everything that happened. But I also totally see why she wants to and I feel bad for saying anything. Should I have just kept my mouth shut?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to see my brother for the first time in a decade?",
      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nMy oldest (half)brother is now 31 years old. We met when I was 9 and he was 19. He showed up at my dad’s with his newborn son and girlfriend, so my parents took them in. We built a good relationship and I absolutely adored him. Suddenly, he took his family and left town when I’m 12 (I was outrageously upset). I found out later that he started stealing from our parents and got involved in drugs (snorting coke, selling weed, etc), so my parents kicked him out. I also found out that when he would take me to his friends’ houses who happened to have siblings/kids my age, he was actually taking me to his dealer’s house and he would sometimes make “deliveries” while I was with him. He also used to smoke joints in the car with me, and I couldn’t tell the difference between that and cigarettes.\n\nI haven’t seen the dude in almost a decade, and our phone conversations fizzled out when I was 16. I rarely ever thought about him. 3 weeks ago, he showed up at my dad’s house with his wife and now 9 year old son. He says he’s changed and wants his son to have a better life so he needs help raising him. Parents took him in again and they’re living with them permanently.\n\nMy parents keep telling me he’s changed and I believe them. They say that not only is he sober, but he’s kind, helpful, and happy. That’s great, but it doesn’t make me forget what happened. I actually cancelled a planned visit because I’m not ready to see him, which pissed my dad off. My brother even called once and said he’d like to talk to me, but I said, “I’m not ready to hear what you have to say, I need time” and hung up the phone. I admit, I’ve been frosty.\n\nI’m not ready to see him and I’m not even sure I want to. My dad offered to bring my brother down to my apartment, but I don’t want him in my space (and they know better than to just show up). They also keep asking me to come visit, but like I said, I’m not ready. I don’t know who this man is, and while I do have fond memories of him, I now know that those memories included him taking me to his dealer’s house and inadvertently giving me contact highs. I’m so angry at him for getting involved in heavy shit (and involving me, a child, in it); I would like to have a relationship with him again but anger is keeping me from that. \n\nMy dad isn’t speaking to me until I agree to speak to my brother, stepmom is staying out of it, other siblings have mixed opinions. I’m not saying I’ll never see him but I JUST found out that he’s back and I don’t think I’m ready to talk about a decade of repressed hurt and resentment with him. \n\nSo, AITA for avoiding my oldest brother and (inadvertently) our parents? \n\nTL;DR: oldest brother, whom I adored, got involved with drugs and inadvertently involved me in it. He left town when I was a kid and haven’t seen him in nearly a decade. He showed up recently, dad says he’s changed/sober and wants me to visit, but I’ve been avoiding it. AITA? ",

To which I said yes. He got really pissed about it and basically said that he has very little vacation time, how I don't like this type of vacation and don't appreciate what he sacrifices for me enough.\n\nNow for the reasons why I don't want him to go:\n- it's the third long vacation he'll be taking with his mom in a year and there will be another one next winter (I'm not invited)\n- we want to move in together this fall/winter and there's still a lot of planning to do\n- he has a bunch of work trips as well over summer which he extends by a day or two, meaning he isn't here a lot anyway\n- he wants to go abroad next summer, where he will be gone for at least 3 months\n\nTo be honest, I feel really left behind because he's gone so much and doesn't consider my feelings at all. I know he can't do anything about work trips and I usually wouldn't deny him a vacation but given the circumstances, I don't like it.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend will be gone a lot in the next months, wants to go on vacation with his mom, I said no.",

      "description": "Tldr below. \n\nMy wife and I just came from a romantic night where we watched the opera. When we got back, she went to the toilet. I sat in the room to settle down before I prepare to get myself cleaned up.\n\nWhile I was undressing myself, my wife walked in with sexy lingerie. Hot af, teasing me. I was already in my boxers, so I decided to drop them and just jump on the covers that was in bed. Spread out like a starfish awaiting sexy time.\n\nShe jumped on me and basic human reflexes, to protect my balls, I closed my legs and she was mid jump. She tried to avoid landing on my legs and instead, landed shin first on the metal side of the bed.\n\nIn that sexy lingerie, she cried and I panicked. I ran and grabbed some ice for her shin. She blamed me for closing my legs because she said she'd never hurt me but I indirectly hurt her by closing my legs, and by trying to avoid me, she hit her shin on the side of the bed. \n\nI was in two worlds. There she was, sexy as sexy can be but wailing and shivering in tears. I found the situation humorous so I chuckled a little bit and she got upset because I found it funny that she got hurt. When I finally saw the bruise after a few minutes of ice, the leg had a dark spot. It swelled and bruised. She couldn't walk properly to the toilet so I helped her clean up and sent her to bed. I showered after she's in bed. Now she's sitting down watching a movie on her laptop while complaining that it's pain. \n\nI think she's forgiven me but I feel really bad and I think she might have gotten a hairline fracture across the shin. Any medical experts can tell me about shin injuries? Symptoms? \n\nTldr: About to have sex and in a freak accident, Wife got injured and I accidentally laughed at the situation. ",

      "description": "Hey guys sorry for formatting errors, on mobile here. \n\nSo a little back story here, basically me and my first ex (we will call her Ex1), dated for about 2 years in highschool. We broke up at the beginning of senior year. Towards the end of senior year I started seeing this different girl (Ex2), we dated until summer ended, when I decided to end things because I was going to college and did not want to do long distance. We had a great relationship, but I knew I wouldn't last doing long distance. I originally told her I would try it then my brother told me it probably wasn't worth it in the end, and I realized he was right. Ex2 absolutely hated Ex1 because me and Ex1 were so on and off in highschool. Ex2 flipped absolute shit when Ex1 slid into my Instagram DMs to ask a harmless question. Ex2 made me promise to her that i would never go back to Ex1, when Ex2 and I broke up. It might have been wrong of me to agree to the promise with Ex2, but I only did it because I hate breaking up with people and I really just wanted her to stop crying, and for the whole thing to be done. My relationship with both of my exs was shitty when I went to college. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. Me and Ex1 decided to start harmlessly talking. Pretty quickly it turned into flirting. We decided we would see eachother when I was home. Had no plans to do anything, just hang out and see what happens.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago. I was at work until 10pm. I told Ex1 if she wanted to do something after she could meet me at work at 10.\n10 rolls around and I walk out to my car, and see right away ex1 parked right next to me. I approach my vehicle and see someone taking videos of me and laughing. I was trying to see who it was and all the while ex1 had gotten out of her car. Then the person proceeded to roll their window down, and who was it? Ex2. She screams \"I hope you have fun with that fucking whore, you prick!\" at the top of her lungs, across a relatively busy business parking lot at 10pm. I just flipped her off because I feared that retaliation would only make things worse and I did not want to be at fault for creating some huge problem. Me and Ex1 proceeded to leave after this.\n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole for going back to my ex? Did I deserve to get screamed at and insulted? Let me know.\n\nNote: I do not think Ex2 was stalking me or anything, this parking lot is a common place for people to smoke and she was there with friends.\n",

      "description": "A few hours ago (around 9pm; I live in australia) my neighbours started blaring ed sheeran hits at a pretty nasty volume level - to the point where even if I closed my windows and put on headphones on It was still annoying. This was made worse by the fact that my window looks over the bordering fence and onto their pool area, meaning that I had no external protection from the noise.\n\nI tried to ignore it for a few hours, and thought oh well its not that late anyway who cares. But, at about 12pm, the music wasnt letting up, and their choice of artist hadnt either - so I hatched a plan. I went into the living room and grabbed the wired bluetooth speaker, and set it up on my windowsill, pointing directly at the gathering. During the pause between songs, I played Full Moon by Death Grips at full volume from my speaker:\n https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsFmZ6WDkuj0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPme2o-_nfAhVJfysKHXhPDEAQo7QBCB0wAA&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NVEbVVXUXk4hlwbT7y5Po\n\n- This death grips song is particularly angry, and contains quite a bit of foul language - something I forgot to consider, seeing that there were kids present. -\n\nThey immediately stopped playing their music - and actually seemed to be freaking out a bit. (If you listen to the song, I think you'll know why.) They started to accuse each other of being the culprit, and after some arguments and shouting, they made their way back inside.\n\nSure it worked, but it didn't envoke the reaction I was expecting. AITA for freaking out the neihbours whilst exposing their kids to bad language?\n\nTLDR:\nI got back at my neighbours for playing loud music by playing some music myself, but i ended up freaking them out more than i hoped, AITA?",

      "description": "He tells me we’re arguing  semantics after this whole thing started and says I’m blowing it out of proportion. Last night we were talking about going to his grandmas house for Christmas which is 7 hours away. At first he invited me and I said yes I’d come, then we were talking about making a pit stop to see my family which is on the way, and he said he will ride with his brothers (to avoid going to see my family And I planned driving separately), then all of a sudden he says it would be one less thing to worry about if I don’t come because he has to plan sleeping arrangements and such. So I told him I felt uncomfortable coming and that I was a burden and he is trying to tell me I’m bent out of shape about it and deliberately misinterpreting what he said. Why would he say that if he wanted me to spend Christmas with him and his family? Yes, I’ve met them and spent Christmas with them last year.\n\n",

I (an average build male) went outside of the club for a smoke with one of my friends, when she suddenly told me to turn around. \n\nAs I turned around I saw a guy, probably between 25-35 getting pushed to the ground by another man. 2 other guys, probably the aggressors friends, tried to hold him back.\n\nAfter a few seconds both of them got up and the aggressor threw a punch at the other guy, then yelled something along the lines of \"Have some respect!\" and disappeared around the corner with his friends. \n\nAll this happened while was just standing 3-4 meters away. I wasn't even paralyzed by fear or something like that. It felt like I was consciously making the decision not to intervene, because I didn't know if he had a knife or any other weapon on him which could injure, or even kill me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not intervening in this confrontation?",

They put it in my mom's name. My mom would not let me put it in my name.\n\n Fast forward to me moving out. I could not garage the vehicle at my new place so, per an agreement, I left it at my mom's. The car is registered in her name and I assume her address. We had agreed to leave the car there since there is plenty of parking. There is street sweeping on her street so the car was required to be moved by law. I did not have a key to the car and it is not in my name. She was supposed to move it on the days posted on the street signs. \n\nMy mom did not move the vehicle. It gathered tickets. My mom then took my sister and her boyfriend to South Africa on a vacation. They left the car there and she had the keys. I recognized that the car would be ticketed so I called AAA to unlock the car so I could put it in neutral and push it into the empty driveway. Since I did not have the key I could not do even this. \n\nThe car ended up getting impounded. They say she owes the city several thousand for the tickets, tow and impound. \n\nMy mom wants me to help pay. She even wants me to sell my motorcycle and give her the money. I don't want to do this. I feel like she brought it on herself. So am it the asshole? ",

Fine I have time before my next appointment. He then goes in again to poop AGAIN at 10 am for 30 minutes and takes a 30 minute shower.  He has zero medical issues he just takes his sweet time in there. Probably looking at Reddit or something. \n\nMy husband is in the bathroom for at least an hour and a half each morning. I find it impossible to be in there that long and inconsiderate to me. For example if I have to use the restroom I’m in there for no longer than 5 minutes max. My showers are 20 minutes max.\n\nHis hogging of the bathroom is constantly making me late and I can’t do my hair and makeup like I should.\n\nI told him he needs to be a lot quicker or find a public restroom to do his business- he says that he can’t be quicker it’s just his speed. It’s created arguments with us. I find it impossible to believe a man needs 20-30 minutes to poop. \n\nWe live in a high cost of living area and our place is very small- and there is a shortage of rentals so moving is not an option. \n\nAITA for telling him to hurry up?

Well, as a month has passed there has been constant drama with associates, people calling off, extra work loads being added when we’re already under a manager, etc. I feel like her expectations for me are higher than the other two assistant managers.

When we hangout 50% of the time is spent on her talking about work or asking my plans of action for truck day, planograms, etc. it’s EXHAUSTING. I’m already burnt out after the long holiday season, I feel like I need a second to breathe. My mental health is struggling because I don’t have the time to take care of myself anymore. \n\nI’ve honestly been considering quitting for a few months now, but I afraid to as I know that would damage our friendship. \n\nToday is my off day, and our closing manager left early sick.

      "description": "A bit of context before I get in to the real story.\n\nI am 33 years old. I've been married for 7 years and have lived away from home since 2005 or so.\nI grew up in a family that is not affectionate. I have two brothers and my parents stayed married. They both loved me, but there was never I love yous, hugs, kisses, etc. I'm totally ok with that as I know nothing else. Hugs and affection is foreign to me and I've been working on it.\n\nWith that out or the way...\nAt the beginning of November, I lost my mother. She had been admitted for suicide watch to a local psych hospital on a Monday. On the Friday, she was determined safe to leave. She had struggled with depression all of my life, but never this bad.\n\nMy dad picked her up, and decided to go to work at 6pm, mere hours after coming home with her. He said she seemed normal and just wanted to sleep.\n\nAt 7am, my husband and I were woken up by the police banging on my door, with my oldest brother. It was then I found out that my mom killed herself sometime overnight and my dad found her in the bathtub at 6am when he got home from work.\n\nMy husband and I left our house to go to my brothers (my other brother lives 2000km away and would fly in that night).\nThe first few days were terrible. My dad spent every waking moment verbalizing everything. Every detail, every second, every moment. It was agonizing to hear him go on and on. He couldn't get out of this loop.\n\nIt got better. It's now been about six weeks. The new issue I am having is hanging out with my father. \nMy mom was a stay at home mom. I was their only daughter. My mom was my best friend. We lived only minutes away from each other and we hung out often.\nMy dad on the other hand worked full time growing up. He was always tired so never hung out. Even in my adult years when we went over he often wasn't there, or was outside smoking pot. Therefore I really never bonded with him.\n\nLately, my dad will just... Pop over. I feel like he's trying to make up for lost time but he is laying on the love way, way too much. I understand where he is coming from as he feels that mentality is what ended my mother. I get it. I cant however flip a switch. It honestly feels foreign and fake.\n\nBesides being way too overbearingly loving, every time he comes over he talks about her, and the events. He's gotten better about going over the story, but he spends a lot of time here just talking about her and how his life is different.\n\nI've gotten to the point where I've requested he ask before he comes over. I'm not used to people just coming over, and frankly I'm starting to find his presence uncomfortable. I do understand. My brothers have someone to talk to. my dad just has us. My oldest brother has gotten angry at him because he does the same at their house. I have never shown anger, but I will often make up an excuse if he wants to come over. It's not that I WANT to forget my mom or what happened, but I am healing a different way and every time he comes over it sets me back literally to day one.\n\nI feel like im being an asshole, but I don't really know any other way.",

      "description": "This is my first time posting so there might be some spelling mistakes and such, Sorry\n\nA background : This was around 3 years ago. Me being 12, and my sister being 17 and my brother being around 2. My sister has bi-polar disorder but had  her medications at the time from what I remember. She’s gets angry when in public a lot especially around this time.\n\nSo at the time we were outside of a museum where there was a lot of people around. My parents told me to be with my sister and my brother so they can buy something inside real quick.\n\nWe were waiting for a while and I was bored so I started to play with my brother. He was having fun and he started to yell a little cause I was tickling him. I stopped and told him to be quiet; then my sister looked annoyed and said (being vocal) “STOP doing that you Pedophile.”  with a very serious voice. I was caught off guard because she rarely says things like that. A lot of people with dirty faces started to look at me with him. I immediately got scared and started to get defensive, (Note I rarely ever swear, especially in a public spot) I said (Loudly) “IM HIS BROTHER YOU ASSHOLE, SHUT THE FUCK UP!” This got even more people looking at the 3 of us, more towards my sister. She immediately started to tear up and started to walk away from me and my brother trying to avoid being seen by the people. \nI stayed around the area still and the rest of my family came back and asked where my sister was.\nWe found her at the car, Crying. \n\nMy mom told me to apologize to my sister for cussing at her there and I was grounded. I told my mom what she said about me but she said “There is no excuse for you said to her back there.” \nIm still not to sure what to think about this.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Me 28 (nonEuropean) and my husband 31(European) are living in his home country which I have lived in for two years. Almost all of my friends I have met through him because it's not easy to make friends here. I work freelance so no colleagues to be friends with.  My husband told me that he's got a bachelor party the weekend of my 30th birthday. My birthday is going to be on a Sunday but I wanted to celebrate on Saturday. He will get back from the bachelor party ( taking place in Germany) on my birthday late at night, so suggested we celebrate the weekend before or after. I said yes.\n\nThen I thought about how lonely I would still be on my actual birthday weekend. The friends I have I don't really feel I know very well and don't get excited thinking about having a party with them without my husband there. So I planned a mini solo trip out of the country, somewhere I've never been before so I don't sit at home feeling sorry for myself that weekend while he's getting drunk and having fun with friends. When I told him my idea he got sad/upset that I chose to go on a trip without him, especially to a country he's never been to either. When I explained he's going to celebrate the bachelor party in a place I've never been to he explained that it wasn't his choice for the weekend or the place to celebrate and if he had the choice he wouldn't do the party that weekend or in that country. Nevertheless he is telling me that I should pick another place that I've never been to, but that he already has, so that we can go to new places together. He's asking me to wait until he has more money saved up so we can go together since he will have spent a lot of money on the bachelor party. He's suggesting he take me to a nice dinner the weekend before and the weekend of my birthday I try to plan a party at home with friends instead of traveling. I feel it's unfair that I can't go to a new country when it was his choice to go to the bachelor party. The countries he's already been to are twice as expensive to travel in, farther away, and not worth a weekend trip in my opinion.\n\nAITA for still considering going to a new country alone for a mini birthday trip while he's at a bachelor party?",

I like doing braids but have only ever done a few small ones at a time, or done single/double french braids. But I would like to have my whole head in small braids, like box braids. When I was a kid in the Philippines, my grandmother would make clothing for me and do my hair, and she used to braid my whole head this way. I am in my 20s now and I’d honestly love to have my hair done like this again after so many years (whether on my own or from a salon). \n\n\nI’m genuinely not sure if it falls under cultural appropriation against black culture, I don’t want to be insensitive.

      "description": "Hello, everyone.\n\nI (22M) met my girlfriend (29F) online a few months ago. In our first date, I went to her house and eventually we started to made out. \n\nA little background: I had a trauma in my past so I'm so afraid of getting an STD such as HIV. I tested multiple times over a long period and I developed a severe anxiety disorder. \n\nAfter we made out, things were going to sex. I stopped her and mentioned about my situation and I'm afraid of having sexual intercourses with someone I met recently. She listened my story and said that she understood and she will have an STD (I specifically asked for HIV) test in order to continue our relationship. I said okay.\n\nNext day, she texted me and wanted me to send laboratuary informations to get tested. I sent her and then she asked me about what she will say to get tested etc. Then suddenly she said \"You know what, let's not do this and break up at the first place\" I completely freaked out when I saw this. As I told you, my anxiety makes me feel worried even in a simple situation. I start to face panic attacks whenever I face a situation like this. I asked her and insisted to learn why she gave up and eventually she admitted that she has HPV. \n\nI wasn't mad at her but I freaked out. Not because of HPV but she hadn't been tested for any other STDs and as you know, once you get an STD it is easier to catch another one as well.\n\nI meet her again and convinced her to take test. (no pressure, just talking) She had tested for HIV and result came out as negative. We continued our relationship but I found out that she has been in a one night stand (unprotected) recently before me. So she might be her window period for testing. I talked to a couple professors and they suggested her to get tested again.\n\nNow, the problem is, it has been 3 months and I'm afraid to ask her again to get tested again. My anxiety kills me everyday because of this but I cannot mention about this to her.",

      "title": "AITA for parking my car in the street in front of a school?",
      "description": "My mother and I live in a duplex across the street from an elementary school. We live directly in front of the parking lot for parent pickups. Street is one lane each way, but it’s wide enough for parents to make a “turn lane” and let neighborhood traffic through.\n\nNeighborhood traffic *cannot* go through, however, if anyone is parked on the curb in front of our house. I frequently park there for three reasons:\n\n1. My mother’s car is more valuable than mine. We mutually agree it belongs in the (1-car) garage.\n\n2. She leaves for work before I do; sometimes even before I wake up. She often comes home later than I do. If I park in the driveway, I frequently need to move my car so she can get in/out.\n\n3. There is generally not enough space for me to park farther back in the driveway and for her to snake through to the garage.\n\nIf I sense that I won’t need to move my car for whatever reason (maybe she’s riding with someone else), I park in the driveway. More often than not, I need to park in the street to avoid dropping whatever I’m doing to move my car.\n\nNTA: Parking in the street is perfectly legal. If we lived literally anywhere else on this street, I wouldn’t be blocking traffic. I may be physically unable to move my car at times (napping, shitting, timed testing, etc) when my mother comes home. I make an effort to park in the driveway when I can and only in the street when it is explicitly more efficient (which happens to be more often). Neighborhood traffic can go around the school street by taking the street directly behind us.\n\nYTA: We chose to live on a school street. Although it was once *my* elementary school, we’re living in prime space for schoolchildren and ethically we should yield to their traffic. I can get off my lazy ass most of the time and move my car out of the driveway; the needs of the many (neighborhood traffic) outweigh the needs of the few (me) and I shouldn’t use the legality as a crutch.

      "description": "I live in a house apartment with a total of 5 people (three upstairs, where this takes place). I've been in the house for almost two years, and for as long as I've known it, it's been a pretty \"college\" house. Some of the decor is rather *tasteful* (read: sexual), and the living room is pretty regularly used for drinking and/or smoking pot, with the occasional parties being thrown. Admittedly it's kinda trashy, but there's rarely anyone over that isn't also college-aged, so the house environment is hardly ever a problem.\n\nLast month, I was working in my room with my headphones on when out of the corner of my eye I see a child darting across our living room with no one else around. I confronted my roommate about who the kid was and why she was alone in the living room. He explained that his father was picking him up for work, but that he came early to hang out but was also in charge of his five year old daughter. The two of them had stepped out to talk and hang out on the porch, leaving the child inside with the TV on.\n\nThis all took me by surprise because a few months back (but with different roommates), the house agreed that we aren't very kid-friendly and that children probably shouldn't be coming in. This wasn't a house rule or anything, just a mutual feeling we all had. I didn't think we would have to discuss the matter again when our current roommate moved in, but I told him that I didn't feel comfortable with a kid hanging out in our living room and to at least give a heads up if his dad is gonna bring his daughter over. \n\nI feel like an asshole because now I'm the only person in the upstairs apartment that thinks this is a problem. My roommate is pretty free-spirited and doesn't think it's a bad environment for his five year old sister, and my other roommate (his partner) is majoring in childhood education and loves kids, so is also okay with it. My downstairs roommates think it's weird, but don't wanna involve themselves in something happening exclusively upstairs.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So me \\[25M\\] and my gf \\[25F\\] have been together for almost 8 years and lived together for almost 2, we're engaged and are very happy together. As in any relationship we are not perfect and we both have flaws, we can talk about most of them and try to improve for each other. However lately i have been growing more annoyed due to the fact it seems i do most of what needs to be done in the apartment, such as cleaning, laundry, cooking, shopping for groceries and doing dishes. We dont have a set system for who does what or anything like that, when we talk about it we are both on the page we are both supposed to contribute equally.\n\nI work 70% and she works 60% and goes to school one day a week. We both are home and have about the same free time, we both play a lot of pc games in our spare time. Neither of us are very picky when it comes to cleanliness, our apt isnt filthy by any means but like we dont instantly do our dishes after we've used them. We dont like when it gets too much and both like it a lot if we've done something like spring cleaning. But if i dont do the dishes they will sit in the sink and pile up, if i dont do the laundry the laundry basket overflows and if i dont shop groceries and plan for dinners we wont have food at home or ready to cook. She still claims she does as much as me. Its also a pretty small apt so its very easy to see it any of the chores have been done. \n\nSince i started feeling i do more, about 6 months ago, i thought i might be overreacting and my observations and thoughts might be pushed by confirmation bias. So i went along with it for about 3 months until i felt i needed to say something to her. I told her i felt i might be pulling more of a weight and she very strongly disagreed, claiming she indeed does a lot. Conversation didnt really lead to anything and i still feel the same. So i thought that i could start counting and writing down every time i do a chore and every time she does one, my first thought was to do this without her knowledge, otherwise it might show false data. But i feel like it might be an asshole thing to do, so reddit WIBTA?",

      "description": "A bit of background first. My mother's side of the family isn't really close. She and her brother and sister haven't been in one room for a long time. She turned 50 recently and I tried organising a surprise party and invited her whole family, only 3 showed up and there were more people from my father's side than my mom's. \n\nMy father now has been planning another surprise party and somehow managed to get everyone from mom's family to say they're coming. He planned it so that everybody would be there when she comes home from work, but I have an exam that day. My exam ends when the party is supposed to begin, so my father called the professor and asked if I could do it earlier. He agreed so now I can begin earlier so I can be on time for the party, which is nice since the surprise part is most important to a surprise party. But for my exam to be earlier, I have to make it in the office of the professor who is a pretty important person in his field of research, which is very intimidating for me. It makes me really nervous, because if I fail, I won't be anonymous and that bothers me. I don't have very high hopes for this exam, I failed if before, so it already is a resit, but because of my busy schedule I was actually planning on redoing the course next year. \nMy father gave me a heads up about his plans after he organised everything and he even called the professor before asking me what I want. Now I feel obligated to go to the party and doing the exam in the professor's office with him there, but that gives me a lot more pressure for the exam, which I'm most likely to fail anyway.\nWIBTA if I rescheduled my exam back to the original time, missing the beginning of my mother's surprise party?

      "description": "A group of us were having a conversation, and sex work was brought up. I mentioned that years back I knew someone who did escorting and camming. We saw each other casually and had a FWB type situation, but I didn't want to go any further than that due to her work, so she broke it off after a few months. \n\nSome of my friends said that was an asshole move and that while no one is obligated to date anyone, it's a shitty excuse and I'm holding an unfair bias. They said that if I've ever consumed porn, camgirls, strip clubs, escorts etc then I'm being a hypocrite because I'm willing to benefit from the work but look down on the person providing it. \n\nMy argument is that people in a relationship should share similar values. I value intimacy beyond a simple commodity, and I want to be with someone who feels the same way about intimacy. \n\nI also admit that I do watch porn, and have been into a strip club twice in my entire life. My argument there is that there is no intimacy in porn. I'm watching a performance, and there is no interaction between me and the performers. As for the strip club, I went for my 19th birthday the first time out of curiosity, and then a bachelor party when I was 27 or so. I did not buy a dance either of those times, so again, my actual interaction with the performers is 0. As an escort however, she has turned intimacy into a commodity, so to me, that's different. More importantly, even if she sees it as a simple transaction, her clients most likely do not. \n\nLastly, I'm not \"looking down\" on her, because I would also not date a girl who didn't want children. I don't think any less of the person, but our values/life vision simply don't match up. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "Hello, first time posting so my apologies if it’s funky. I currently work for a small shipping store and the owner is someone I’m related to. I have two coworkers one who just got hired (we will call her Jen) and the other who I’ve worked with for the past 4 years (we will call him Tim). I recently got an unofficial offer to come work for another shipping store by their manager who happens to be my old coworker (Ari we’ll call her) before the new girl Jen arrived, she worked with Tim and I since I started working there four years ago but moved shipping stores because of better pay and hours. The problem is is if I was hired at Ari’s store she would be firing one of the workers. That worker would be Tim’s sister. On one hand I want to take the offer because I would be making more money (wouldn’t struggle paying bills anymore) and would have a more flexible schedule but on the other hand I would feel bad for basically screwing over the owner I’m related to by leaving him confused on why I left so suddenly even with a two weeks notice and I would be screwing over Tim’s sister which would obviously create problems with Tim and I the last two weeks of me working with him. Plus the new girl Jen we just hired has only been working with us for a month so it’s not like she has the same expertise and therefore leaving the store in a frantic hiring someone to replace me while still training Jen. So Reddit, would I be the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "Okay, so there's a lotta context to this. It was my mom and aunts' 50th birthday yesterday, and after the main party us adults decided to go to a local bar to finish the night off. There's about 8 of us. So I'm 18, my cousins' boyfriend who is 19 was also there, as was a mutual friend of our family who is also 19. The rest of us (about 5 other people) were of drinking age. I didn't expect to drink at this place since I'm not 21, but anyway. \n\nWe get to the bar and my mom orders a pitcher of beer, everyone starts drinking, including the two other underage people with us. They were not obvious about it or anything, just taking sips off other people's beers occasionally. This bar is kind of a dive and I was told they didn't really take drinking ages seriously. I order an iced tea, and I'm sipping on that for the first 15 minutes or so that we're there. My cousin decides she wants me to have some beer too so that I am not the only one not drinking so she switches my tea and her beer. I figure, the other underage people are drinking and it seems fine, so why not? I take one sip of her beer and switch the cups back around. IMMEDIATELY, an ugly old waitress storms up to our table and starts yelling and demanding to see my ID. I am not exaggerating, she was so loud she got the attention of half the damn bar. I tell her I took one sip and she says \"I've been watching you drink beer since you got in here!\" Now I'm pissed because she's outright lying. I didn't get the chance to really say anything to her because after she said that she stormed off. \n\nI'm dumbfounded at what just happened, embarrassed because of all the eyes that were now on me, and it made the atmosphere at our table incredibly awkward. After a minute conversation resumes but I'm still very uncomfortable because this lady seems like she's watching me now and waiting for me to try something again, as were some other members of staff. This continues the rest of the time we are there. Since it is my mom's birthday I didn't want to cause a scene or anything so I just sucked it up and stayed, even though I'm still very uneasy being watched by all these staff and that whole situation definitely soured the mood at our table.\n\nAfter we finish up (maybe 45 minutes after the incident), we get in the car and as we are driving my mom starts in about how I shouldn't have drank anyway and that I should've known better. I tell her about the other two underage people with us who were drinking a lot more than me without any problems and that didn't seem to change her opinion of what happened. After we get home I tell her that it kind of irritated me that she basically defended the actions of the waitress, and that if it were my kid in that situation I would've up and left the bar with them. I am definitely pretty disappointed that nobody took my side in that situation at all. AITA in thinking that?",

      "description": "I'm annoyed. This morning my (half) sister dramatically busted into the garage while I was smoking a cigarette. She walks up to me and asks in an ACCUSATORY manner\"Do you own a Sprint Wireless or Comcast account?\".\n\nI reply, \"No, why?\". I'm totally oblivious to what's going on. She then says, \"Well, I don't know where these charges came from, it's one for $200 and another for $370\". \n\nWe go back in the house and I start heating up some food in the microwave. I tell her she probably has a fraudulent charge and should contact her bank. I explain to her Comcast isn't even available in our area,  internet service is limited to Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) or ATnT. It obviously must be a charge from outside our area, andwhy would she even ask me?\n\nShe ignores the question. She then proceeds to complain about how this is disrupting her morning and she needs to go back to the bank. She rushes out the house slamming the door behind her.\n\nBackground: \n\nI've been staying with my sister for about two months since my husband and I have been separated. I'm a 25 year old young professional with a two year old daughter. I have a decent job doing web content management and graphic design. I've been paying rent to her on time, I contribute a share of groceries for the house, and do a fair share of chores. My husband and I are attending marriage counseling to work on things, but I'm preparing myself for the possibility of being a single parent if it doesn't.\n\nMy sister and I have the same dad. He's white. My mom is black. Her mom is white. There are some cultural differences and perspectives that are generally accepted by both of us, and we otherwise get along fine. She's 42. I don't understand why she would immediately confront ME about account charges that are obviously bogus. \n\nI believe it may be some underlying racial bias. \n\nPlus, I'm not a thief. I even buy my own laundry soap, toiletries, etc. I don't use ANY of her stuff. We drink beer together, I'll buy a case, she'll buy a case. Occasionally bum cigarettes from one other if we're out (I know gross habit I should quit).\n\nI'm pissed. It's like, really? She asks me before she contacts her bank. I have no history of theft or criminal behavior. No drug abuse or addiction. We both smoke pot, but whatever. Why would she immediately ask me about hacking her fucking bank account?\n\nAITA if I confront her about my feelings when she gets back? \n\nAITA if I tell her I think she confronted me based on racial bias, whether it was conscious or not, and that's not ok?\n\nTLDR - My (25F) sister (42F), who I am staying with temporarily, confronts me about fraudulent charges on her account that I have zero knowledge of. I'm pissed, because the only reason I FEEL she would have for questioning me must be racially biased. I want to know AITA if I call her out and express my feelings truthfully.\n\n",

We aren’t doing anything in class tomorrow and it’s an extra long day. My attendance is not important to me and there is nothing I gain or lose (except for sleep) out of going tomorrow.\n\nIf I go, it’s 6.5hrs I’m sleep deprived, unable to work on anything I need to get done. I have music classes I pay for afterwards and will only be able to squeeze in 3hrs to get my work done before I have to get sleep so I’m not sleep deprived for my unit test on Thursday.\n\nI could put off my online class for the weekend, but I’m trying to finish it by Thursday so I can talk to a counselor and drop my TA class so I can get out early(long story). The study guide MUST be done by tomorrow or I’ll be fucked for my test. The English homework I think is due Friday but I’m not sure.\n\nMy girlfriend wants me to go to school tomorrow regardless.

      "description": "Me(19F) and my bf (20M) have been together for just over 1 year. Our relationship is the best thing I ever had,  a dream relationship for me. I want to marry with him in future. Of course we never lied to each other. However, I have a huge secret. \nI got abortion illegally when I was 17. I was a terrible teenager and such an idiot. Somehow, I got pregnant as a 17 years old child, an underage. When I learned that I was pregnant, I freaked out. I've got no one I can tell my situation, just a bf(19) who don't give a fuck for my pregnancy and I didn't know what can I do. Anywise, I found some contacts, I got abortion and I dump my bf.\nI was in an unbelievably bad situation. My parents didn't know even I do sex and I've got abortion. I never told anyone, even my most closest friends, because I was in shame.\nThis is a very traumatic experience for me. I didn't share and I won't share with anyone. However, my actual bf isn't \"anyone\". I feel bad for keeping a secret but this is my most hidden, bad, huge, personal secret. \nThe concept of abortion is terrifying for him too. This is a taboo for everyone around us. If he learn, he may want to break up, he may think that I am not the person l am offering him. I don't know maybe he will understand me and my situation but I'm not sure. Our relationship may change and I really really don't want to lose this relationship. Also, breaking up or changing of our relationship aren't the only things I hesitated. I'm really not ready for share my biggest secret. This is a real trauma for me. I've never told anyone and I will never. Moreover, if I had told him, he would be in same position that I was in when I got abortion. He wouldn't find anyone to share, he wouldn't know what to do. My shit would be something he needs to carry all his life.\nI guess, I will never tell him. AITA for this?\nSorry for my grammar.\n\ntl;dr: I got abortion when I was a stupid teenager. Now I have perfect relationship but he didn't know anything about my abortion. I won't tell him.",

      "description": "Okay so i'm going to explain this and give a bit of background information, also a throwaway account just in case. \n\nSo I have celiac disease an autoimmune disease where when I eat gluten it will trigger an immune response in my small intestine and damages the small intestines lining (villis). Celiac disease is different for everybody and everybody can have different symptoms, For me since I had a late diagnosis I have harsh symptoms (and gall bladder disease and anemia) Like bowel issues, vomiting, gall bladder attacks and seizures. I am extremely careful when it comes to eating out at places because I get very sick. And a small note that celiac disease is NOT an allergy like a lot of people assume, it is an autoimmune disease.\n\nNow I get to the story, So I went to Tim Hortons one day for lunch with my friend and as most people with celiac disease or people who just don't eat gluten when we go out there is not a ton of options for us at restaurants and fast food places. So I ordered a salad with no croutons and I told them I have celiac which usually tells the people to be careful because some people like me who have celiac really rough can get very sick from cross contamination. My friend ordered a bagel and her bagel was made first, So i'm waiting for my salad and i'm watching the Tim Hortons worker make it and i watch her cut up the bacon and make my entire salad using the dirty bread cutting board and the bread knife, so my salad had bread crumbs all over it. The lady handed me the salad and I asked her \"Hey I'm sorry but I have celiac disease and I just watched you make this salad on the bread cutting board and it'll make me sick if i eat this, by any chance could you remake this?\" And she had an obviously annoyed face by me asking her this and told me \"It's an allergy you will be fine\" and shoved the salad my way. This got me extremely angry and upset since I have had a ton of bad experiences with my disease and cross contamination and I screamed at her and said \"It's a disease that is serious, not an allergy and i can get extremely sick and have gall bladder attacks and seizures from gluten and i'm not going to risk it by eating this that you improperly made, you don't know what my reactions are and I would appreciate it if I could either get a refund or this remade\". She didn't say a word and threw the salad in the garbage and proceeded to make me a new one while another co worker of hers who overheard the whole conversation showed her how to make it safely. \n\nThis happened several months ago now but I still feel guilty and worry if I went too far. Well reddit, judge me and tell me what you think!!",

      "description": "Kind of a longer one-\n\nI (29 m) have been living for the past few months at my parents with my wife, and our almost 2 year old dog Lily. Our dog Lily is an Australian Cattle/Lab mix, who takes medication for anxiety. She’s always had lots of energy because of her breed, requiring a ton of exercise. We bought her as a puppy from a sketchy guy at a gas station. We weren’t sure how he treated her, but she has always been petrified of men and scared of almost everything. If you try to give her a bath, she cries like you’re trying to kill her. I like to only think happy thoughts in my head though, or it’d break me. Anyways... she’s the biggest velcro dog in the world to my wife and I. She has to be with us ALL the time. She doesn’t just sit near me. She literally sits on my foot if I’m at a chair or something. If we leave, and my parents are still here, it doesn’t matter. She will just lay in her crate or whine while staring out the door. And she doesn’t eat too much while we’re gone. Very good guard dog though, if anyone tries to come near the house... you will damn sure know and you’ll think she wants to kill you (it was great when the Jehovah’s Witnesses came by... I’ve never seen them leave in such a hurry!).  :)\n\nA little more background.  We’re at my parents house as a temporary solution because of the timing of us buying a house, and the issues/conditions from the sellers needing to “rent back” from us for an additional 2 months after closing. We by no means are “freeloading” at their house. They offered it up since they have a 4br house and all 4 of us kids (me and my siblings) were gone. We buy groceries for us and them. We cook meals. Clean and pitch in constantly. I pay my parents for us to live here, including the full utilities too. But we are extremely ready to get out for sure, as you can imagine. \n\nSo the main AITA piece now-\nThanksgiving is next week. My siblings are coming in from Florida from today (Saturday) and staying at my parents’ until the following Sunday, so like 9 days. My sister has a little girl and boy (both less than 3). She also has her Shih-Tzu dog and he’s 10 now. My mom asked if we could just board our dog somewhere the whole time, or send her to my wife’s parents house. She thinks that with the two kids and my sister’s dog here, that it’s too much and we should just get rid of her for the holidays until my siblings leave. \n\nYes, my dog is like 55lbs and her Shih-Tzu is like 10lbs. But ever since my dog was a puppy, the Shih-Tzu has always been the one to try to bite and nip at our dog when we’re all together. He also barks at Lily while she just sits there. When we all visited for Christmas last year, we had to gate off the dining room and our dog was banished there, while we sat on the floor with her a few days because she didn’t want to be alone. She whimpered and just wanted to see everyone too. We put a gate in front of the living room entrance and she was finally allowed to be on a leash inside and she just sat with us all happy from the steps, looking into the living room at everyone. Then falling asleep there like a good girl. \n\nSo my mom wants us to send the dog away. We rotate holidays, and my wife and I were going to do thanksgiving at my parents’ house this year. Now I’m planning on spending both Thanksgiving and Christmas at my wife’s parents. \n\nI don’t think we should have to send our dog off to be alone for the holidays. She would be so torn without us. And we would be sad without her too. I’m one of those people where my dog is my child, dammit. Lily was with me while I lived alone in the middle of nowhere for the first year of her life. She was the one to comfort me and get me through losing my 19-yr old cousin tragically last year. She makes our day better after the long days at work. Lily just wants to cuddle us and make everyone happy. So why do I have to send her off for the holidays, when the whole time I’ll just be thinking about how scared she will be that we’re never coming back?!? Or how I know she will be sad and cry. Why should I have to cast my dog out, that I devote hours a day to every single day to make sure she’s getting the required exercise and attention (getting up an extra couple hours before work to play, and spending hours at night tiring her out)? I worked through her anxiety and biting phase when she was a puppy, just Lily and I. She’s all good now, but she’s just such an integral part of my life and my wife’s, that I feel angry for everyone seeing Lily as “just a dog” and something that we can just drop off somewhere and pick up when it’s convenient for everyone. \n\nBut it’s not my house, and I know my dog can get excited sometimes to see family she knows, and wants to jump up to say hi. \n\nSo judge me please, Reddit. AITA?\n\nTL;DR - live at parents house temporarily, with wife and my 2 yr old dog, who has anxiety issues. Parents want my dog out for holidays, so sister and her kids/dog can be here. I’m skipping the holiday to be with wife and dog instead at her parents. ",

      "description": "Obligatory on mobile and further apologies for crappy writing. I don't make long winded internet posts often and I tend to ramble and jump around.\n\nI'm a young guy. I have been saying \"what's up\" as both a greeting and a colloquialism for \"what's going on\" for a few years now. To be clear I don't say\"whassup.\" That is totally different and I recognize the difference. It has become a part of my speech patterns and basically automatic. My Assistant boss (not assistant to me but assistant to the boss who is another person entirely) has berated me a few times for saying \"what's up\" to both her and other people for a few different reasons. She has cited A) That it is a respect issue B) It offends her C) If a third party overhears it can become an issue because they don't know what is being discussed (I don't understand that at all) and D) It is unprofessional. I have never heard anyone else have a problem with this phrase in my life. My coworker thinks that she is just out to get me because she doesn't like me. I am trying to not do it but like I said before when someone addresses me it is my instinctual response and when I do accidentally forget to stop and think about what I am saying so I don't say \"what's up\" she gets upset even when I apologize immediately afterward. The boss doesn't seem to personally care but he is letting here just take the reins for this. I am going to continue trying to avoid it but I wanted to ask you random internet strangers your opinions. AITA or is my assistant boss just picking at nothing?",

      "description": "The main players:\n\nMe - on 23andme\nSister - full-blooded sister, younger than me and has our father on a pedestal\nFather - deceased for 17 years, was an alcoholic and possibly a sex offender\nHalf-brother - in jail for 10 years, convicted rapist.  Will be released in 2 years.\n\n\nSo thanks to the miracle of 23andme and DNA relatives, I recently found out that I have a half-brother through my father.  I actually matched with his 13yo daughter on the website, and through comparing timelines, photos, stories from relatives... We've come to the conclusion that the only way she could share such a large percentage of DNA with me was if her father was my half-sibling.\n\n\nBefore we go any further, my half-brother's real father has been CONFIRMED by his mother.  As in, our assumptions were correct and that he really is my half-brother.\n\n\n-----begin family story------\n\nFeel free to skip, but this is the story as we know it.  My father dropped out of school when he was 16 and moved from Pennsylvania to Florida for work.  A couple years later at 18 he hit a rough patch and moved back in with his mother in PA.  At this time he began hanging around a local 16yo girl.  My father only stayed in PA for a couple months before moving back to Florida.  No one from my father's family ever heard of the girl again.\n\n\nTurns out, the girl was pregnant.  This was a small, rural, Catholic town so she couldn't have a child out of wedlock.  She found another guy, married him ASAP and passed off the son (my half-brother) as this other man's child.  Now if this guy knew that the child wasn't his, we don't know!  Also unknown is if my father ever knew about his son.\n\n\nFast forward 20-some years, and my father marries my mother and I am promptly born.  7 years later my sister was born.  4 years after that (about 30 years after the birth of my half-brother), my father died in a car accident.  My parents had a very tumultuous relationship and divorced a couple years after my birth.  They were in stages of separation/reconciliation all the way up to his death.  My mother moved me and my sister away from Florida and we lost contact with my father's side of the familly.\n\n-----end of family story------\n\n\nMy half-brother is in jail for raping his teenage niece.  He will be released in a couple of years.  He is almost fully estranged from his daughters (my half-nieces) but they do contact him occasionally.\n\n\nMy sister and I are arguing over whether we should write and tell him who his real father is.\n\n\nMy argument:\n1) this guy is a POS and I don't want any contact with him.\n2) I don't think we're the right ones to tell him this, let his mother tell him.\n3) our father has been dead for over 15 years.  There isn't much I'm going to be able to tell half-brother about him.\n4) THIS IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T TELL MY SISTER but turns out our father was a POS too.  He was a heavy alcoholic, actually died driving drunk.  What my sister doesn't know was that my father was arrested for sexual assault... right around the time I was conceived.\n\n\nMy sister's argument:\n1) he is going to find out eventually anyway, between his daughters and his mother\n2) if his mother tells him, she might paint our father in a bad light.  We should tell him first and preserve our father's image.\n\nI acknowledge that my sister's two points are valid, but I think my 3rd and 4th points counter her 2nd point.\n\nIMPORTANT:  I am not refusing contact with my half-nieces because of their father.  Since they're both minors, I'm letting them (and their mother) decide how much contact they want.  I am more than happy to talk to them and even meet with them in person.\n\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not writing to my half-brother and telling him who his real father is?\n\n\nTldr - recently discovered I have a half-brother through my (deceased) father.  Half-brother is in prison for raping his teenage niece and is a POS.  My sister wants to write to him and tell him the story, while I have no interest in any contact with him.  AITA?",

My line of thinking was that (I forgot she was disabled, and) she didn’t have her own car (which is common with freshmen), so it made sense for me to offer since I have a car. She declined and said that it was okay, but I insisted. While she was telling me no again, I suddenly remembered that she literally can’t go with me because I don’t have a wheelchair-accessible car. I felt so embarrassed for probably humiliating her in front of the rest of the group that I dropped the subject. Now my classmates probably think I’m an airhead. :(",

      "description": "Context: My sister and I had a cool pocket speaker that we share. Most of the time, she uses it since I have a bluetooth headset. We also had a bit of rivalry when it comes to lost items, my sister was the favorite sibling between us and my parents dote on her. She often forces me to find HER lost items.\n\nNow onto the story: My sister and I were chilling in the living room(y'know like you do), when she suddenly kicks me(it wasn't painful, but it did annoy me) and asks me to find the speakers.\n\nI go to the usual place we place our speakers and.... It's not there. I told her this and she starts ordering me around, saying that if I didn't find it, she would tell mom to get me grounded.\n\nI've already dealt with this kind of BS so I'm used to threats. After 2 hours of searching *by myself may I add*, I couldn't find it. She starts asking me if I found it, I keep avoiding her.\n\nShe then confronts me, takes my phone, and smashes it to the ground. I. Was. Pissed. The audacity to break my phone because of HER *ignorance* therefore makes her a stupid can of beans full of shit.\n\nI then expertly grabbed her phone. After which I run and lock the door to my room. After about an hour, my parents arrived home and she *I assume* tattles on me taking her phone. I changed the passcode of her phone(the phone had a fingerprint scanner that accepts all our fingerprints) and deleted the fingerprints except mine.\n\nBefore I could explain to them, they immediately did an ultimatum grounding me and taking my laptop. I literally do not know why I am at fault here. I mean, I did steal her phone, but it's a small price for all the BS that she put me through.",

      "description": "tThrowaway account. Will try to keep it short, but feel free to ask anything. First time posting on Reddit. **TL;DR at the end**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a woman in my mid-twenties, and so are most of my friends. I've always been pretty thin, skinny even, but most of my friends are now either a bit chubby or simply fat, and most of them have been putting weight on consistently for the past few years. Mid-twenties, as I said. As a result, most of them are now always trying to watch what they eat, trying new diets (and failing), complaining about how hard it is to lose weight. Typical stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, when we meet up, we usually go out to eat. And even though I'm skinny myself, by no means I have a healthy, balanced diet. I always have high-calorie, nutrient-poor food (far from ideal, I know). I just happen to have very little appetite, so I get full easily and thus end up eating calories in moderation and remain \"naturally\" thin. So my friends and I will be at the table, they will be having salads, water, bland-tasting low-calorie stuff, while I will be having junk food, sweets, sugary drinks, and the such. And because of this, they have been complaining more and more each time about how I'm \"sabotaging\" their diets, because it's really hard for them to eat \"green\" and healthily while they watch me having all the food they're craving so badly (even if I'm not having too much of it). They say they're more likely to give in to temptation or to binge-eat during or after watching me eat. They say I'm \"inconsiderate\" for not changing my diet \"only\" when around them, to match theirs. It's unfortunately starting to affect my relationship with some of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear, **as far as I know**, none of them currently have or have had in the past any eating disorders. None of them use food as a coping mechanism for emotional distress. None of them are morbidly obese and/or in desperate need to lose weight. They are just your regular chubby folk who like chili fries a bit too much, but would also like to lose a few pounds. They are also adults. And **as I see it**, as adults, they alone are responsible for sticking to their diets, however much discipline that requires, and I shouldn't have to stop eating what I enjoy just for them. For me and my own health? Yeah, probably. But not for anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I've been told so many times that I'm \"unsupportive\" and that I \"don't understand the struggle of weight loss\" that I'm left wondering. Am I the asshole here?\n\n  \nTL;DR: friends trying to lose weight say I make it harder by refusing to stop eating junk food when around them and call me \"inconsiderate\" and \"unsupportive\".",

      "description": "Last night was my final day of working in a bar that I have been at for almost 3 years, we had drinks when we finished and then went back to mine to carry on drinking. At the end of the night I let 2 of my workmates (1 male and 1 female) sleep in my bed and I slept on the floor in my lounge. My girlfriend is very upset that I let another girl sleep in my bed and blew up at me about it (she is 21 and im 23). She thinks shes justified in being mad at me where i feel like ive done nothing wrong and am copping shit for it. AITA for letting my close friends/workmates sleep in my bed or should i have kicked them out? Any input is greatly appreciated. \n\n(also I have my own place and my girlfriend does not live with me)",

      "description": "On mobile sorry for the format or mistakes. Kinda long so TL;DR at bottom. Here goes.\n\n\nSo my brother used to be really good friends with this guy (let's call him jason).  So one day out of the blue my brother tells me that he needs me to do something very important for him and that is to block jason on everything and not to speak to him.  I agree and block him on everything (this was about a year or 2 ago)\n\nFast forward to today and I get a call from jason and multiple texts asking me for help on something IT related.  Now I currently go to college for IT (working on a bachelor's) and I went to a vocational school for IT, so i know a good chunck of stuff about servers and OS's and any other IT related problems.\n\nI decide to text him and he is wanting to know what type of books and videos he should look into if he wanted to get to know more about servers.  He said he was looking into getting his MTA or MCSA certification for windows server 2016.  As it turns out I just finished a semester on server 2016 so i knew exaclty where to start and told him what books he should get and gave him a couple video suggestions to watch and even sent him a link for an entire online class he can take for $10 to learn more about server 2016.  After I give Jason the information that was it.  I didn't text him after that or anything else.\n\nThe next day I'm texting my brother and I tell him Jason messaged me yesterday wanting to learn more about servers so I gave him some book titles and video information for him to look at.  After I tell him this he gets all mad and tells me \"you know my stance on it but you're gonna do what you want to do.\"  The fight continued on with \"you're my brother you should uphold it if i ask you to not talk to someone.\"  I then told him that all I did was give him book titles to look into and that was it, I didnt casually talk to him or anything, I just gave him book titles, video suggestions and a class he can take.  Jason's not dumb with technology, he used to be smarter than me back then but he's only ever learned the hardware side of IT.  He never learned anything about the networking side or server sides of IT.\n\nWhile me and my older brother continue arguing over text I tell him that all he wanted was some info on where to start.  When i first started IT, I found it damn near impossible to find a place to start when it came to learning an IT subject and no one was willing to help me or even give me a place to start.  (The IT teacher of my vocational school was a complete joke and my IT colleagues from my job were condescending and assholes if I even asked for help from them)  It wasn't until I went to college and found my AMAZING IT teacher that helped guide me into finding the right places to start when I wanted to learn a certain subject in IT.  Anyway we keep arguing and I keep telling him that all i did was give him book titles and ect. as to where to start and he starts saying things like \"I would never help stanley (MY Ex-bestfriend) out for the rest of my life because of what you asked of me.\"\n\n (Stanley is not his name and that is also a whole other story in itself)\n\nWe continue arguing when I tell my brother that I know what its like to want to start something new in IT but have no idea where to begin. I also told him that I promised myself a very long time ago that I wasn't gonna become one of those typical condescending IT guys that tells you to screw off or make fun of you when you have an IT related question, no matter how stupid the question might be.  I told him even if we were fighting and haven't talked in years because of a fight that if you ever had an IT question that I would help you with it, even if we hated each other.\n\nAfter I told him this he then says \"I don't need justification from you, IT has always been more important than our brothership so you do what you want.\" \n\nNow IT is NOT more important than mine and my brothers relationship so idk where he got that from and also, he has never even told me why him and Jason stopped being friends.  One day he asked me to block him and I did without question but Jason still had my phone number.  I at least told my brother the reasons I wanted him to block stanley and they were good reasons that I gave him.  My brother has never told me any reasons why he and Jason stopped being friends or why I should block him, and when i did bring it up in the argument today, he said that he's \"not arguing about this anymore\" and he hasn't replied since.  Brother told me one day to block him and I blocked him on everything, no questions asked. But Jason still had my phone number and thats how he was able to get ahold of me.\n\nSo am I the asshole for giving my brothers ex-bestfriend some information on where to start in an IT subject?\n\nTL;DR: Brother gets mad at me because his Ex-bestfriend contacted me to get information on where he should start when it came to learning server 2016.  Tell brother about conversation we had which starts a fight and he has not talked to me since.",

My family is asian.\n\nLast year, my dad bought me a nice camera which i really liked and had a lot of good photos with it.\nAt first, I agreed to take pictures of 2 or 3 weddings of my cousins with the reason to train my skills which I had absolutely no problem. But things get really uncomfortable after that.\n\nI became kinda tired with the whole thing because I just wanna have some fun in those events not some kind of an unpaid photographer who stands alone in the crowd (Im sure that some of you photographers out there can understand this feeling). However, My parents refused to understand this.\n\nOn the first wedding they let it slip. But on the next, they started ranting that I was such an ungrateful and disrepectful kid etc and forced me to do what I hate. In the meantime, the angry me, unable to do anything, resentfully took just enough pictures and sometimes \"forgot\" the camera at home.\n\nIts really stupid because all the weddings have their own professional photographers, and I was there, an amateur, being forced to do a job with no pay. My parents line of reason was that only I have the time to take group pictures of them and the relatives, which a phone can do just fine. It could have been better if nobody cares about the quality of my work, but they do.\n\nAITA, guys? Im starting to feel that they just buy it not for me to develop a hobby but just so that they can have nice pictures.",

      "description": "So I am very bisexual and in a relationship with an awesome guy I love (both 22). I do wish I could be with a girl on occasion. We decided if an opportunity came along we would go for it, but never seek a threesome out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were hanging out with our friends and met this cute girl (19) that was super fun. I asked our friends if I was reading into things too much, or if she actually seemed to be flirting with me and my boyfriend. They said it seemed like she was and that I should go for it. A week later I invite her to drink and watch movies with *only* me and my boyfriend. She was super excited about it over text. Unrelated to being an asshole, but accepting that kind of invitation seems kind of weird if you don't want to have a threesome right??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't have a car, so we picked her up and brought her back to our apartment. After she starts drinking she starts getting a bit crazy. She kept saying \"fuck you\" to my boyfriend, obviously as a bad joke. But my boyfriend did NOT like that and kept telling her to shut up and not disrespect him in his house. He gets along very well with pretty much every person he meets, so it takes a lot to make him angry. I ask him to just leave it alone because she was obviously joking and there was no point in fighting with her on it every time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end up blatantly asking her about the threesome. She said she could never do that with anyone and she is very straight, but she was having fun just hanging out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe go to our neighbor's house to chill for a bit. She continues to say \"fuck you\" as a bad joke to our friends AND she begins being super loud, and kicking and pulling people around. There's no reasoning with this annoying and rude drunk girl. But my boyfriend begins telling her not to disrespect our friends and getting heated. I apologized to both our friends privately and they said they understood the situation. I begged my boyfriend to stop trying to control her and control himself instead. Their conflict was making my anxiety go through the roof. It was a bad situation: he just didn't need to make it worse. Our friends also were more compliant with her demands so she was less rowdy. They also got the hint it was one night and this was the best way to smooth things over. After a little bit I took her upstairs, put on a movie, I snuggled with her until she fell asleep before joining my bf in bed. We took her home early the next  morning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just felt like because she had no way of getting home until we were sober enough to drive, she should have been treated as a guest. I wouldn't want to feel like I was stuck in an uncomfortable situation if I was drunk and with people I just met.\n\nAITA for how I wanted to handle the situation?",

      "description": "My bf goes out sometimes, albeit not frequently, but we do live together and it’s usually on work nights for me. I like to know roughly what time he will be back, just so I’m not worrying if I wake up and realise he’s not there or something, especially if he’s drinking bc my area is trash and I like to make sure he actually gets a cab home as he drink drives quite a lot (ik, he’s a dick. I make sure he gets taxis now). Plus I wake up p early. He told me he’d be home the same as he was last time, which was about 10pm - 11pm - it’s currently almost 1am and I had texted him around 10:30pm to ask what time he thought he’d be back just so I knew. He was posting places all throughout the time and just ignored me until now but seems pissed off at me for questioning where he is. Not in a controlling way, just a general, where are you at kinda deal as I was expecting him home earlier. \nAITA for questioning him where he is?? Is that a controlling thing lmao?",

This guy was weird, for the first month he was fine, but before our first after school show, I was complaining about the fact that I was worried my lipstick would come off if I drank some water and have to apply it again. So he said \" let's test that\" and leaned down like he was going to kiss me, he didn't, but everyone, except him, was uncomfortable.\n\nEver since that I've been uncomfortable around him and just don't like him. He inserts himself in my conversations, and I try for the most part to ignore him and continue normally. He sometimes keeps me from doing what I need as a director of a scene for the biggest play we do, even though he isn't in my scene. I tell him something like \" Go back to your scene dude, your directors going to be angry.\" but never \"Go away.\" \n\nI think it's clear from how I act that I don't like being around him, but I still feel like I'm kinda leading him on, in a friend way, if that's a thing.

I found out  two old uni friends(who I hadn’t seen in awhile) were also going so I meet up with them and introduce everyone to each other at the venue. When the concert started my old uni friends wanted to move to the front and so did I cos I couldn’t see anything so I pulled my other friends along through the crowd. \n\nWe ended up getting separated by like two rows of people. So I’m with my old uni friends and I keep looking back to keep an eye on my other friends cos they aren’t moving forward and then at some point they disappear. So I don’t want to have to push back through the crowd cos I have no idea where they are so I stick with my friends who haven’t disappeared. After the concert finishes my friend (not the one who gave me the free tickets) , is furious with me and has a go at me and says something along the lines of ‘I don’t know why I expect anything from you’ and hasn’t really spoken to me for about a month.  \n\nI’ve apologised and have made attempts to contact them after the incident thinking they needed at least a day to cool. However after I messaged they about 9 days after it happened they replied ‘a break is what I asked’.  I’ve made many other attempts to talk to them where I’ve called them and they said ‘it’s more of an in person thing’ and a couple of days ago I asked them when are we gonna have this talk and they replied ‘I don’t know’.

      "description": "Our long-tangled relationship is at a crossroads with where we are in life. Counting this time, it’ll be the 3rd time we have broken up and tried again. We started dating in Highschool. This went on and off for most of three years, with all the hurdles and challenges that one would associate with a relationship in this period. Based on our differences in university choices (which boiled down to a program which forced me to move every 4 months), and the seemingly overwhelming opinion of reddit, I decided it would be best for us to see other people. Looking back at this decision, I still think it was the right decision. However, this choice, along with several other actions that I made, conflicted sharply with her internal beliefs/core values. It would be several years before I would know this.\n\nDuring the second half of our degrees, she contacted me again. At this point in my life, I had effectively committed myself to pursuing my profession, and from a lack of success in finding another relationship, stopped trying until after university. She contacted me when I was half way across the globe from her. But like we used to, we talked and talked, more and more frequently. Before we knew it we had developed a long distance relationship. After seeing each other on a bi-weekly basis for the remainder of the term, I had to complete another internship as a part of my program. Not to blow my own horn, but this internship was at a highly sought-after company in my field. Knowing this, I was fully prepared to take the offer for full time. She then conveyed to me that after graduation, she will move to pursue a career in another city, far from where I will be for full time. This was the second time we broke up.\n\nAfter my internship ended, I received and signed the return offer. She contacted me again. This time she fully grew out of her shell in high school and made me aware of the times that I hurt her. Hearing these things made me feel an immense sense of regret and sadness. How could I have been so incompetent to not see that my actions conflicted with her core values? The thought of hurting her that severely brings about a great sense of failure and shame. For example, while we were dating long distance, I missed a scheduled call that we were supposed to have because I was working on a project. As soon as I realized the next day, I apologized and rescheduled for the night after. What I didn’t realize was that this act broke all expectations that she had of me in terms of dependability. She opted to not have any further expectations for me in this front so that she won’t be hurt again. She concluded, that this action was an active act of malice against her instead of my negligence. Does this distinction even matter? This one example generalizes to so many more. Including the act of our initial breakup after high school. What I thought was a rational choice/excusable temporary lapse in memory turned into a seemingly irreparable scar between us to this day.\n\n**tl;dr:** Throughout the course of my relationship, I did several things that hurt my girlfriend unintentionally because they contrasted with her core beliefs that I was not aware of. Am I the negligent asshole boyfriend?\n\n\n",

      "description": "I matched a woman on dating app, and all went well as we have similar interest on movie, TV etc. We even met up once beforehand and feel that we match.\n\nHowever all seems changed on the second date. (This may be long) In the beginning of the date, she brought me a present for my birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised. We made some banter and joked that since my birthday already passed, she should save up on the next occassion, like Christmas. (Not yet relevant, but will be later)\n\nOn my chatting, she also let loose that she is passive aggressive and she likes to be. Things start to turn south when I think she starts to flaunting passive aggressiveness, such as \"she may break up with me for bringing her to a bad restaunrant\" or joking \"she may be a man and I should break up with her\" and quite a bit of taunting that I should, which I think is a bit over.\n\nWe were also getting a bit touchy, but suddenly saying that I'm no longer allowed because I brought her to a bad restaurant. I'm only allowed to touch her again if I bring her to a nice restaurant in our next date. She also said \"I need to pay because I brought her to a bad restaurant\", which I was planning to anyway because it is true that she was not enjoying it.\n\nFinally when we said goodbye, she told me she's keeping the present for Christmas, as we joked before. I was very miffed by it.\n\nSo overall I thought that 1) she is passive aggressive and likes it, 2) she brings jokes way too far for me to be comfortable and 3) she leverages reward/punishment towards me. I feel altogether its just too much to deal with for a date I only met 2 times, and decided to call it quit. So, AITA for thinking these things as red flags and stop dating this woman?",

I’m not able to give an outsider opinion.** \n\nToday I was made aware that a friend’s (L) boyfriend (H) was not very fond of me as a person. For context, we are in grade 12. \n\nI decided to speak to H online. We just went finished our last day before a two week break, so it couldn’t have been done in person. I don’t like being on bad terms with people and so I like to sort issues out and find a resolution that benefits all parties - just my way of handling things. \n\nH pointed out some things he wasn’t happy with, that I then replied to. \n\n- My relationship with L is close. We are good friends and I used to smack her ass or hold hands entirely as a joke. She initiated some of it but it was never romantic (am gay myself). It was a large misjudgment on my part in how L handled this but I was never made aware of how she felt about it. \n\n- Weeks ago a graffiti in the school bathrooms read that I was a “hypocritical gay who acts superior to hide behind his insecurities.” I was never made aware this happened until weeks later. The handwriting and medium pointed towards L writing it. I was confused, however she does a lot of impulse things and confronted her to see if she did write it and what her side of the story was. \n\n- H said he was annoyed I stretch to get gossip from people, being nosy etc. My defence was, if people are having a public conversation and I’m sitting there in the group, of course I’m going to ask what’s going on and involve myself in the conversation. It’s weird to sit back and not be acknowledged. \n\n- I joked often with L about her being bisexual. She admires a YouTubed who happens to be female and makes jokes about how she is attracted so I followed along. H said it felt like I was accusing his girlfriend of lying, which was not what I gathered from it. Again, not made aware of this being an issue and had no idea. \n\nAfter discussing with H, I thanked him for pointing out things he isn’t happy with and told him I was going to evaluate and change my behaviour because clearly it is out of line. I recognised that and told him my intent to change but he seemed stubborn and unwilling to change his perspective. \n\nMe: “I’ve clarified my side of the story and stated my recognition of wrong behaviour that will change. I don’t understand what more you want.” \n\nH: “If we mingle together at some point I don't care, just don't expect a sudden conversation from me.” \n\nOf course there a lot of conversation not included but the main gist is that he seems intent on viewing me how I /was/ and not how I /aim to be/. I want to change and not have this looming tension that he “doesnt like me sometimes”. So, AITA?",

      "description": "I am a grad student who just finished classes for the semester. My schedule is more flexible now so I sleep in and work late. During the semester I wake up based on my class times.\n\nMy so wonderful husband works every day during the week from 6am to 3pm. He is biologically set to sleep early and wake up early as a result. He works in traffic engineering, so his job involves him driving all around a big city all day. He is tired about 90% of the time.\n\nWe live 100 miles away because of grad school and work. Our main form of communication is Messenger. Sometimes he goes hours without responding to me. My first guess is he’s taking a nap, but for some weird (probably some wifely instinctive) reason I immediately get worried and think something bad happened to him. I do tend to fear the worst... I think of calling him but I don’t want to interrupt his nap. But I wish I wouldn’t have to worry so much...\n\nI feel like I shouldn’t worry so much but I do... Maybe if he didn’t pass out on me I wouldn’t have to worry but I want him to rest after working so hard... Am I just worrying unnecessarily? AITA for wishing he would save me some worry by not passing out on me sporadically? I guess I’m just feeling a little conflicted...",

Their house usually host large pre-drinks/parties before nights out.\n\nAnyway, a group of girls at this house (also our age) apparently were gossiping about me behind my back, which is what my friend told me. He said that they were saying that I was a weirdo and that I seem strange.\n\nI'm not sure what I did for them to think that...I usually go to their house and socialize at pres, I asked my friend whether I've done anything and for him to be honest and he said he couldn't pinpoint anything. I'm not the only person they've gossiped about either.\n\nI tend to get pissed off if people chat shit about me and don't have the guts to say it to me, so I shot up a Facebook message to the 3 girls in a group message and said:\n\n&gt; **I know you girls have been chatting shit about me...but if you're going to say things about me, at least say it directly to me...**\n\nThey read the message but didn't say anything. When I next went to their house, one of the girls came up to me and apologized...the other two just awkwardly avoided me...\n\nI can be quite confrontational...if people say shit about me, then I will confront them. My friend thought what I did was a bit assholish and unnecessary, but I did what I thought I was right...\n",

      "description": "Some info here, I'm 20f he 21m. We haven't exactly discussed this yet because I feel like it would be unfair to ask of him because he loves is a lot. But right now it's so time consuming I'm getting a bit mad.\n\nSo my boyfriend is a scout, he is in the oldest group which means that his group has to take care of everything without a lot of guidance. \n\nHe is the \"president\" of his group which means he has to get everything in order to make sure they can go on camp and do activities. He didn't exactly apply for this job it's just that no one else would do it and he was nice enough to take it on him. \n\nThis group exists out of 12 people from 18 till the age of 21. No one does anything to help him. Everyone is very unmotivated and is not doing their assigned tasks, this gives him a lot of stress. He has to get everything in order in the end but everyone had their own task and no one is doing theirs. I already told him that if no one is helping him than that would result in no activities and no camp. I thought he should be hard in this, he is also graduating and doesn't have a lot of time in his hands to get this all together. \n\nHe is also leader of the youngest group together with some other people. This is something he loves and I don't have any problems with this.\n\nSo now you've got some background. I myself have been a scout for a long time but quit because I didn't like my group. \n\nSo because he is president he has to attend meetings, the next 4 weeks he is at least 3 evenings gone and in the weekends gone. I am also studying and all those evenings gone results into me seeing him only 2 hours in a week. \n\nHe has so many meetings and weekends away with staff and kids that last year he skipped my birthday, I'm still a bit pissed about this. \n\nSo I did ask him if there was a possibility if he could give his position as president away but no one wants to take over and he couldn't miss a meeting. He is very dedicated but this is just too much, he is already set back at his study and has to retake a few exams and he is graduating. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking him to maybe even quit or take a break from the oldest group? He is also talking about how he doesn't really like everyone who is in there and how the age gap is a bit big. \n\nHe has been talking about maybe quitting next year but he said that last year too and I don't want to push him. \n\n\nTLDR: as president of his scout group he has to attend a lot of meetings which means he doesn't have a lot of time for me or his school. He is failing some classes already and it's taking its toll on our relationship. \n\n\n ",

She couldn't take a joke when it required thinking. That's sounds douchey, but she tried to much.\n\nSo near the end of the year, she was speaking out loud, and she passed for a bit, after saying, \"write down what you didn't liked doing in class this year\". In my usual sarcastic manner, I said kinda loudly, but not quite, \"Science\". My friend next to me also said it, but I was taken outside for being \"rude\". I didn't want to listen to her anymore than I needed to, so I just said that I didn't mean it to come off that way. She also went on a tangent about my grade (which was a B, she must've been high it something). \n\n\nIn short, AITA for making a sarcastic remark about what the teacher mainly taught? It's minor, but eh- memory lane.",

      "title": "AITA for being angry that my husband's party guests stayed 9 hours longer than I wanted?",
      "description": "For full background, see my comment (I realized I went on way too long).    \n**Background TLDR**: My aunt and dad both died this year, and my husband was not as supportive as I needed him to be, putting our relationship on thinner ice than it was before (we have been discussing divorce/separation for years). We have been married six years.        \n  \nLast Thursday I got about two hours notice before my ex, who I remained friends with, died. It was really fucking tragic, unexpected, and I was left in the position of telling a lot of people, because he befriended most of my friends the four years we were together, and I was the only one who knew he'd died, so I had to tell at least a dozen friends. It has been difficult.   \n   \nIn honor of my late mom and dad, I decided to put up my first Christmas tree (my mother loved Christmas), and host family gatherings. It was a big deal to me, because it is the first time I've felt ready to celebrate Christmas since my mother died. I invited my bio-dad's side of the family over for Christmas Eve dinner, and planned to have brunch for the remainder of my mother's family. But all my mom's family declined my invite, and my bio-father and brother told me they could only come for lunch on Christmas Eve. I was sad, because it really hit home how many family members have died, when only two wanted to see me for Christmas, and only when convenient for them. I felt lonely.   \n    \nSo I invited all my friends over for brunch on Christmas day. Most of them didn't respond. Only one did, saying she couldn't make it. I thought I'd have a quiet day with my husband, and maybe invite the neighbors over for bagels.    \n   \nWhen I told my husband that no one was coming over on Christmas for bagels, he asked if he could invite some friends. I said \"sure\". He asked me when. I said, \"11a-3p\". We bought supplies to share bagels with a few friends.    \n    \nWe had a nice Christmas morning, and then my SIL and husband's friends arrived at 11. After eating, I watched some Doctor Who with my SIL, and my husband played a 2 player game with his friend. His girlfriend just sort of watched.   \n   \nI was doing okay until 12:30, when a friend who I'd called on Friday to tell him about our friend's death texted me. \"OMG! Did your ex DIE? What happened? My wife just saw memorial stuff for him on Facebook.\" So I had to explain the tragedy of his death again (and I don't even know all the details). I was no longer having fun.   \n   \nI did my best to be a good sport. People kept coming over. I chatted. When I realized I was only talking about my dead friend and it was bumming people out, I moved to the couch and played with my tablet, and chatted with people on discord.    \n    \nI got hungry at some point (3 or 4pm), so I threw the ham we'd bought as an easy meal into the oven, as all of the bagels were gone. While they played games, I cleaned up the kitchen, made cookie dough, and cleaned the kitchen some more.    \n\nI suggested an easy, multiplayer game, and his friend agreed to give it a try, but was a dick about it, and took all the fun from the game.   \n   \nBy 7:30 I was not feeling well, and wanted everyone gone. I had reached the limit of being able to somewhat successfully socialize. I texted my husband, \"I'm not feeling well. Throat is sore. Stomach not feeling so hot. I am probably going to retire to the bedroom, unless everyone is about to leave.\"   \n   \nIn hindsight, I could have been far more direct. \"I wanted this gathering to end at 4. Could you please ask your friends to leave?\" I didn't do this because my husband wanted to get brunch with his friends the other morning, and I asked if he would stay home with me, as I was still reeling from my friend's death, and wanted his company. We determined that I'd resent him if he went, and he'd resent me if he stayed. I asked him to go. He stayed, leaving me feel like an asshole for disrupting his social life with my grief.   \n     \nA little bit more context: due to recent events, I have stopped sleeping in the bedroom, and now sleep in the living room. I did not want to have to go into the bedroom; the living room is my bedroom. He knew that, so I hoped he'd say goodnight to his friends.   \n   \nInstead they started making dinner plans that did not include me. Again, I hoped that he would use that to have everyone leave: they could all go get dinner together. Instead they called in an order, picked it up, and brought it back here. I pulled my husband aside. I told him that I couldn't socialize anymore, and if he was going to continue hanging out with his friends, that I'd go (unhappily) to the bedroom, and would sleep there all night: he could take the couch. \n  \nHe agreed, and I made sure he had everything he needed (pillows, blankets, etc) before I said goodnight  to everyone (it was now 10pm), and barricaded myself in the bedroom. They were loud, so I put on a Netflix show I like to fall asleep to. They were still loud as I fell asleep, around 11:30pm.   \n   \nI woke up angry with my husband for, again, not respecting that my ability to socialize is less when I'm grieving, and ending the gathering at 3, like we initially discussed. I wanted some quiet time in the evening with him, and instead went to bed more alone then ever.  \n    \nAm I the asshole for asking him to miss two social events (one in Oct, and one in Dec) to spend time with me while I grieve, and then asking that he kick his friends out after four hours? For letting my grief effect his social life? I've had a lot of people die this year, so I could see how it could be taxing on him.   \n  \nOr is he an asshole for prioritizing socializing with his friends over being there for me when I ask? For not checking in with me at 3pm, when I wanted the gathering to end, and letting the party continue until 1am? ",

      "description": "A little back story about those friend and me vs bonuses:\nWe usually do the same job with three or more, in which one joins and he refers the others, because those jobs usually give a bonus varying between 50 and 200 bucks. I've always been fair at the deals we made, where the first person refers the others and splits each bonus with the person he got the bonus for. Which always means the first at the company needs to learn how the job is done, explains it to the others and gets 50% of the total amount for explaining and managing it all.\n\nSo a few years ago, I would refer 6 people, which would grant me 150$ per person, of which each of them 6 would get 50$, which basically means everyone would end up with 50 and I would end up with 600. After I referred the first(I'll call him Bob for now), I then explained the job to everyone. And then Bob referred the others behind my back, though I did the work for it. So he basically made 550 off me.\n\nThey basically broke the deal and soon after we didn't talk much anymore. Now with other friends I'm still having the same compromise.\n\nI would explain everything to em and then refer the both of em. Each one would grant me 100 bucks, I then would split each bonus in half and keep 100 bucks in total myself.\nNow the second guy, just told me he's gonna grt referred by the first guy I referred myself, after I explained everything. Normally I wouldn't make a big deal out of it. But the reason why he did this, is \"because the first guy needs it for a big holiday\", while I'm just working to finance my study.\n\nTL:DR\n\nI made a deal of referring two people, granting each of em 50 bucks and myself 100 bucks, then behind my they changed so one of them gets more. I now feel like keeping my bonus myself. ",

      "description": "About a year ago, I was in an accident and was injured. After working with a physical therapist for a number of months, I was discharged. In addition to continuing to do my physical therapy exercises on my own, it was suggested to me that I also start strength training. Since I don’t have any experience strength training and don’t want to injure myself any further, I decided to hire a personal trainer.\n\nI had consultations with a couple trainers and picked the one that I liked best. I explained to him that my physical therapist suggested that I hire a personal trainer so I can gain overall strength, especially around the area of my injury. At the beginning of our first session, he got my weight and determined my body fat percentage. That evening, he sent me homework to do at home and a nutrition plan (the same one that he sends to all of his clients).\n\nDuring our sessions, he would ask me what I had eaten that day, what I was eating for dinner, etc. I would tell him and he would critique my food choices. I would tell him that I am not concerned about that at the moment and just want to get to where I was before the accident.\n\nHe would back off for a bit and then it would start again: “You should make better food choices. You’ll feel a lot better if we get your body fat down.” Again, I explained that I wasn’t here to lose weight, body fat, learn about nutrition, etc. and again, he backed off. After six months of this, I fired him. \n\nI know that many people hire personal trainers because they want to lose weight. I know that tracking weight and body fat is a good measurement of success but that isn’t my focus. For the record, I started at a BMI of 21.5 and a body fat percentage of 28%. He was only concerned about my body fat, not my weight. Someone else I talked to about this said that I am a walking advertisement for him. If I don’t look good, he doesn’t look good.\n\nWas I wrong for firing my trainer for wanting me to eat better?\n",

      "description": "Before anyone rags on me, **this story is not about me**. It is about my friend. I apologize if this isn't allowed, but he is convinced he wasn't in the wrong here so I decided to get reddits opinion about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: My friend is a nice guy who over the summer was talking to this one girl(**Female A)** and they had a thing going on. They weren't dating, but they were \"talking\". Before homecoming, they were still talking and she liked him a lot and I think he liked her aswell, but clearly not enough to prevent himself from doing the following. After homecoming, there was an afterparty which another girl(**Female B**) he was friends with was invited to, but the girl he was currently talking to was not. The girl specifically asks the girl who *is* going to the party(her good friend)to let her know if my friend hooks up with anyone. Lo and behold, female B ends up hooking up with my friend and she didn't even let her other friend, female A, about what happened and she only found out through someone else. My friend wasn't really apologetic because he claimed they weren't dating so it's really not a problem. This was in September and everything was fine about 2 weeks after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis takes us to Friday night. My friend plays on the varsity basketball team at school and they had a big game. He and female B have been talking since homecoming night and she really likes him, and he knows it. They go out to lunch together a few weeks before and everything thinks they're going to start to date soon. Well, my friend was actually talking to another girl(**Female C**)while he was talking to female B without her knowing. He decides to bring her to the big game and gets her a ticket. Female C pulls up to the game and sits right next to female B. Female B then realizes what's going on and she runs to the bathroom crying. Later that night, I'm snapchatting my friend and he sends me a picture of female C and I ask \"new jawn?\" because I figured he was just at a party or something and he went out to his car with a friend or something. His response is \"I don't know what that means...\" He is clearly joking, and I decided to drop it. Well, the next day comes and he has practice. Afterwards, he goes out to lunch with another girl(**female D)**, who happens to be supposedly friends with female C and one of two other people who knew about my friend and his \"relationship\" with female C. She knew about the situation all along and didn't tell anyone about it, which very much angered female B's friend group, which she was previously(not after this weekend)apart of. Female D believes she did nothing wrong and had no right to tell female B about female C, yet female B and her friendgroup believe that female B was a much better friend to her than my friend was. As for my friend, he claims he did nothing wrong because they weren't dating. He doesn't think he led her on, and really didn't apologize for anything. In fact, he got mad at me for not taking his side in all of this. I believe he is in the wrong, but I wouldn't tell that to him because we're pretty good friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe jist of all this is: I want to know who is the asshole here. Is it my friend for what he did? Is it female D for not telling female B about female C? Is it both? There are a lot of conflicting opinions at school about this, and while many of you may be thinking this is trivial high school drama, it's basically been the discussion of our class for the past two days and I'm in need of unbiased opinions.

      "description": "Warning ⚠️ long post \n\nOkay so this was sometime last year but I still see him at school and can’t help but feel bad/annoyed. My friend has recently started speaking to him and I don’t know if I’m making a big deal out of nothing. \n\nWe’d been speaking quite a bit and I wanted to make new friends after starting a school not knowing anyone. He’d mentioned wanting to watch a film together so I was like yeah sure I’ll come to yours one day after school and that was that. \n\nWalking to his house he started talking shit about people that we were friends with and that made me paranoid about what he said about me but I let it go because I hadn’t known them as long as he had. Arriving at his house he let me know his parents wouldn’t be back a while and I was like sure whatever. \n\nThis guy takes me to his room to dump my stuff and goes into his bathroom to get changed whilst I sit on the bed. I sit there waiting and can see nails (as in toe and finger nails) on the floor which makes me feel a bit ill because it’s unhygienic or whatever. \n\nSo he comes back in and let’s me choose a film which I think is really nice and am happy to choose. He gets on the bed and tries to get me to lay down with him but I refuse and he tried to pressure me some more but gives up when he realises I’m not going to. Everything is fine whilst we watch the film and I’m like okay maybe I was overreacting. \n\nThe film finishes and he wants to go downstairs for food, he offers to make me something and I decline as I’m not hungry and feel it would be rude not to eat something if he made it. He’s pretty upset but let’s it go. Next he puts on a song that I recommended to him and asks me if I’m not going to dance. He wanted me to dance for him?! It might just be me but I found this incredibly weird. \n\nI decided to leave early and was waiting for my lift. When I let him know he out on his ‘sad music’ playlist and starts talking about how sad he is and then just sits with his back to me until I leave. \n\nI message him about how he made me feel like shit and he only said that he’d done nothing wrong. He’d been treated like shit before and he hasn’t treated me that way.\n\nI thought he was really manipulative but I still think I could’ve handled things differently. So, am I the asshole? \n",

      "description": "To add some context, physics Uno is a form of Uno that me and a few other friends created that has a bunch of random rules that we normally play during our work time in physics. So now that you know what it is Ill begin. Yesterday we had a substitute teacher who was given fairly vague yet clear instructions. We were told to complete a survey, teach ourselves a new concept, and finish an old lab that required said concept. However, our teacher failed to give us access to the material because he forgot to put it on google classroom. Since we didn't have the work, we decided to play Uno the whole block instead. We did email him letting him know that we weren't able to do any of the activities. Earlier today we got an email saying that it was unacceptable that we were playing Uno the whole time and that Uno is now banned from our class as well as any other form of card game. Are we the assholes? Just for context, nearly the whole class was playing, 10/14.",

      "description": "This is gonn seem like such a damn shitpost, but I need to know. \n\nI met a girl on an online game where she sent me her contact details because she really liked me. Within 3 days, she confessed that she thinks she loves me and I kinda freaked out. Eventually though, I started liking her so much that I reciprocated. We told each other everything, things that neither have ever told anyone else. I made her feel incredibly comfortable, even sexually.\n\nMind you, Im in Australia and shes in South Korea.\n\n*Important Detail: she has chronic depression and considerable self image issues.*\n\nAlmost 3 weeks go by and she blocks me out of nowhere, claiming that Im too distracting.\n\nI contact her a month later on her birthday letting her know that I am happy to wait for her, Idc how long it takes. She says no because she doesn't see it working at all. \n\nHer reasoning included immature things like  \"but we broke up it never fucking works it always goes to shit\"\n\nShe eventually confesses that she used a fake picture and that \"i lied so much I can never be truthful to anyone I only put up an image said person would like\" \n\nIdk what % of her she lied about but goddamnit I didn't love her for her pretty face or the fact that she seeked help after her drug abuse. I loved her for the way she talked, her ambitions, her sense of humour, her kindness. \n\nShe also said shit that I refuse to believe such as \"I dont have any feelings for you\" bullshit. Shes trying to make me move on I fucking swear. No one moves on that quickly. \n\nOf course that fucking destroyed me, but after we parted again I took time to think about it. I decided that she doesn't need *judgement*, she needs to be *understood* and learn to love herself. I told her goodbye.\n\nI know think it was the guilt that made her make her choice.\n\nHer intentions dont strike me as malicious, I don't think I got used as something to fill the void either.\n\nBut our connection strikes me as really rare and I feel that most people just dont get lucky to find someone who they mutually respect, trust, all the while having incredibly good sexual compatibility etc\n\nShe had so many issues and flaws and I saw past it all and still saw her as perfect. \n\nI want to message her on one of her social medias in December or January. Idk how to proceed. All her social media has the same username so it took 2 seconds to find her. \n\nBut I really want to get in touch later. I need to tell her that I wouldve accepted her as she is and that we can be happy. I am seriously not going to get so lucky again and IF the break up was due to something that warranted it I wouldve moved on but its not - we're young and stupid, but a year will clear our heads, especially hers I hope. \n\nI feel like I am right. That I know what I am talking about. I am not settling. The grass is NOT always greener and Im not going to pretend Ill find such a strong connection like this again easily if at all.\n\nAm I the asshole for pulling such a stunt? \n\nTysm :)",

      "description": "Hey everyone. Just looking for some outside perspective here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for almost two years, and he is amazing. I love his family as well, and we spend a ton of time with them, which I am generally totally fine with. We go out to dinner at least once a week, have family dinners at his mom's house every Sunday, and spend every holiday with his family. Last Thanksgiving, we traveled out of state to spend Thanksgiving with his extended family, we spent 16 hours with them last Christmas (and two with my family in between), New Years, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July... Every single holiday is dominated by his family and what they want to do. I never complain, but I have expressed to him that it bothers me that all of our holidays are centered around his family while mine takes a backseat. A couple of weeks ago, his mom unexpectedly asked if we wanted to go out of state to see his family for NYE this year. We got home that evening, and I explained to him that while I really appreciated the invitation and I love his family dearly, I would really like for us to spend one holiday doing what \\*we\\* want to do. I wanted this ONE holiday to be ours this year. As much as I love spending holidays with his family, it would be so nice to start making our own traditions and being our own people. Of course holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving will ALWAYS be centered around family, but it's New Years. It is not a family holiday. He agreed that I was right, we do spend every single holiday with his family, and that we needed to start taking a breather to be our own people sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFifteen minutes later, he re-approached me and basically said \"Look, I don't want to disappoint my Mom/family, I'm going. You can stay here if you want, or the offer is still on the table if you want to change your mind and come with us,\" and there was never any real discussion about us  not going, just about him going without me or me going despite not wanting to do so. I told him that I felt like he was being incredibly dismissive of my feelings in order to appease his family, and that I didn't feel like he was even making an attempt to empathize with me or understand. This is the first holiday I have EVER asked to spend apart from his family, and he's unwilling to budge at all. I get that adult relationships are about compromise, and I am willing to do so, and DO, all the time. This is the one time I have ever asked him to do the same with regard to holidays and he never even considered it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for feeling this way? Do we both suck in this situation? We are not fighting about this anymore and have already hashed it out, but I would love to know if I am at least justified in my feelings or if I'm being totally unreasonable.",

My little sister was just recently within the year diagnosed with autism on the high functioning end.  Feel the need to state that my sister is — although I would never refer to her this way normally— is my half sister so she is not related to my cousin. And my cousin just started working at the center where she goes to. I asked my cousin to go out with me for food and some drinks and then she said that her coworkers would come along. And they came along. But before they got there my cousin started talking about this kid that would hit her in the face. He was also autistic. Saying that if he were her son or nephew that she would hit him back. And then when her coworkers got there she started retelling the story saying that it was a struggle because you know “we can’t leave marks on the kids” and it was unnerving because non of them disagreed. Naturally I told my mom what all happened and what was said because my baby sister goes there.\n\nThey fired her and she has deleted me off multiple media’s. \n\nAlong with all of this my cousin tried to walk out on the tab shorting the server $25. And I ended up happening to foot the rest of her bill and paid the tip for the rest of the table because the server made it apparent that none of them tipped him at all.

      "description": "This was at an airport restaurant.\n  \n My flight was at 2:30pm and I as always, decided to reach the airport a couple hours early and go through the check in and security process (because I’m paranoid like that and don’t want to miss any flights).\n \nThe cost of this comes in terms of me having my lunch at an airport restaurant. \n \nSo I go to this restaurant that looks good. Went in, nobody came to host. Normal for some of these airport places. I don’t mind in the least, I walk in and find myself a table and sit myself there.\n \n5 minutes in I’m handed the menu and I pick a quick salad and a salmon. Price? $30. I sigh and it seems so expensive but I’m super hungry at this point and just want to eat and catch my flight. \n \nI got a call at some point just after ordering and I casually noticed the time. Then began the waiting. \n \n15 minutes in I finished my water and waited for a refill or for the lone server at this point to come so I could request for more. At this point two ladies seated near me are getting super restless as well because they seem to be waiting for a long time as well.\n \nThe server tends to them at which point I make a very polite call and the guy, assumes I’m just getting restless because of the wait and quite rudely, tells me “it’ll just be a moment”. \n  \nAttends to the ladies, never gets back to me. I try getting his attention a second time, no avail. The guy disappears for another 15 minutes not to be seen at all. \n \n35-40 minutes in and I’m slightly restless and annoyed at this point. Only 15 minutes left for my boarding to begin. Finally the server appears with my food. \n \nThe food is the epitome of disappointing letdowns but I know it’s not the servers fault. However I did order no sauces/glaze on the salmon but obviously that’s not the case (happens at most places and I have learnt to get over it)\n \nI finish my food in a hurry (5-10 mins?) and wait for the server to come and bring the check. However the server is nowhere in sight. \n \nI finally get frustrated enough to go stand at the host counter and wait for the server to appear. When he does I ask for the check.   \nOnce I get it, I have absolutely no doubts in my mind at this point to how bad the service was and how the guy didn’t deserve any tip. \n \nI left 50 cents just to make a point though.\n \nAm i the asshole for the 50 cent tip here?\n \nI’ve never worked in service Industry and am honestly looking to see if I did something wrong here \n\n",

It's my own savings from the part time jobs I've been doing since late December.\n\nTo her, I'm wasting my time and money which I could be using for other stuff(??)\n\nI explained to her why I wanted a personal trainer and the benefits, but she was kept on telling me that 'they are just stealing my money'. \n\nI know personal trainers cost a lot but I managed to find one within budget, a close proximity to my home and I'm willing to stick to it (also did a one day trial already) \n\nMy whole plan to get a trainer is because I want to lose the fat and become fitter. Heck, my cardio and stamina is shit. Is it so bad that I want to become more healthy and fit? She says I can do it at home and honestly, I already tried to. Totalled up to 3 days before I lost motivation. That's why I figured I needed someone to boost my morale up and keep me moving. \n\nApparently, she told me that she HAD signed up for a weight loss class but NEVER showed up. How's that my problem? I don't mean to come off as rude but if she never actually tried it, can she actually judge it? \n\nBecause of this, we've been arguing about it for a week. She even said I was stupid for wanting to sign up and that nothing will change. \n\nSo AITA for wanting to sign up or like is she right in the sense that yes, I am spending a butt load amount of money to have someone help me workout etc?",

Anyways, whenever I go out to various Dinners, I don't feel that my waiter deserves a tip, now don't get me wrong, if the waiter was exceptionally good I will happily leave a tip. But!\n\nI personally think that if a waiter is underpaid, they should be talking to their employer about it, instead of expecting tips. In the same way I would be expected my employer for a raise sense I'm usually tight on money. I as a cashier get paid the same rate of pay as a waiter does, minus tips. So I'm usually pretty tight on money, therefore I try my best to conserve as much money as I can. Am I being a cheap a**? Does this make me an A-Hole?",

I haven't really stayed in touch with many of my old colleagues, just a select few. \nAbout 2 weeks ago I received a text from an unknown number, saying it was Girl N from X workplace and she was inviting me to a farewell dinner for another ex coworker. I thought it was a nice gesture as I would be able to catch up with the old team, so I said yes. \n\nSince I said yes, she has been texting me constantly asking me to put money towards a goodbye gift for this other girl. \n\nThere are a couple of reasons why I don't want to. The top (salty) reason being, when I left the job, I got invited as an afterthought to someone else's goodbye party like \"oh yeah, you left like 2 months ago didnt you! Let's make it a joint party\" and didn't get so much as a thank you let alone a gift. \n\nSecond reason is more reasonable, I feel. I haven't been paid for the last 2 weeks and I won't be paid again until next Friday. She's only asking $10, but at the same time....I only have $30 and some cash to last me a week. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I refused to pitch in for this gift, but still attend the dinner?  \n",

Recently his mother died and his father was never in the picture to begin with.  He has a younger brother that is about to turn 18.  His mother lived about 45 minutes away from us.  She died recently and we’ve been staying in her house with his younger brother. \n\nMy fiancé wants us to move into his mother’s house permanently and take care of his brother.    I’m just going to be blunt and say that I’ve never liked his brother.  He’s rude, into drugs, a total klepto, and sometimes even violent.  He’s been in and out of trouble with the law since his early teens.  I can’t see how any of these things will get anything but worse now that his mother just died.  \n\nMy fiancé told me that I’m his family now as much as anyone and if I really don’t want to do it, he won’t force me to.  He just asked me to really think about it, that it’s his brother and he’s almost an adult now so it wouldn’t be forever.  The problem is that it wouldn’t be a short period of time either.  He doesn’t have a job or plans to go to college.  As far as I can tell his plans are to just keep getting high and drunk and pissing as many people as he can off in the process.  \n\nWe are just about to start our lives together, I really don’t want to start them off like this.

I acted a little childish back then since I was 7 so don't say that I am being a child.\n\nI was at a day care once and a lot of people would bring their own board games. I decide to bring my new Lego board game (you know about those?) that was exclusive to Europe which I had just gotten back from and before this I had carried some firewood for money. We went to a store and I saw the game and had half the money possible to buy it and my mom agreed to get it for me if I paid the half I could. At the daycare we all decide to go to the retirement home to play with the old people just down the street. We had already gotten permission from our parents. I set up my game then go to the restroom. My brother didn't hold my seat so someone decided to come sit in my seat. But now you might be asking \"oh OP, why not sit somewhere else at the table.\" That was my original idea but there was no where else at the table to sit. I tell person, who I will call Rich, to get out of my seat. He said he was there first, which was objectively wrong, and my brother backs me up. Rich proceeds to tell me, \"It's not your game,\" which is also objectively wrong and my brother informs him that I paid for it. Rich looks at the box and says, \"You don't even meet the age REQUIREMENT,\" which is true. It had a age suggestion of 8+ but does anyone pay attention to those? It was sort of a lie but only halfway. Rich refuses to move so one of the teachers (or whatever the daycare equivalent is) has to get involved and Rich still refuses. I am forced to play other games.",

      "description": "My girlfriend, “Sam” (I’m 24 and she’s 23) and I have been together almost two years. She is very bubbly and outgoing and attractive (obviously!) and so has no trouble making friends, especially with guys. \n\nI have never said anything up until now about who she hangs out with as it’s not my business however the other day I finally reached the end of my rope. \n\nI have had a suspicion that one of her good guy friends “Luke” has had feelings for her for a while now. He is always calling her, texting her, wanting to spend time alone with her, etc. My suspicions were confirmed the other weekend when we were all drinking and in a drunken state he confessed to me that “I was so lucky to have her” and that he wishes he could have her instead of me. Pretty sure he went to go puke after this. \n\nI was a little unnerved after this and I pulled one of my Sam’s friends aside and asked her if she knew anything more about Sam’s and Luke’s friendship and I told her what Luke had just told me. \n\nShe basically shut me down and told me to “stop being such a prick” and to trust Sam. This makes me even more suspicious because of there was nothing going on there, I wouldn’t expect that kind of defensive response. \n\nWell the other day I confronted Sam about this and I asked her if she could perhaps not spend so much time with Luke (for obvious reasons) and her other friends who seem like they are encouraging all this stuff to happen. \n\nSam told me I was being a “controlling asshole” and that “I didn’t get to tell her who she could and couldn’t hang out with”. She accused me of always “pulling this shit” and that I should trust her to handle the Luke situation by herself. \n\nI told her that she wasn’t being respectful of my feelings and I slammed my hand on the table and said “When he tries to fuck you, don’t forget I told you so”. \n\nI just walked after I said this because I didn’t want to escalate the argument any further. \n\nThis was two days ago and between work and the argument, we have barely talked to each other. \n\nSo AITA for asking her to not spend so much time with Luke and her other friends? \n\n\n\n",

I'm talking HOURS on the phone so he can relieve our childhood and talk about our alcoholic/abusive mom (something I've made peace with decades ago and don't want to rehash), talk about his gorgeous daughter who is 22 and yet he hovers over non stop and complains that she can't be independent and how he thinks she is fucking up, talk about his ex wife, current girl friends, how much he misses our dad (passed away almost 8 years ago), work...EVERYTHING!  And yet whenever I tried talking about things in my life and need an ear he cuts me off, tells me to put on my big girl pants and grow up.  I have 2 boys with autism and when he drinks he says autism is not real, it's all bullshit, I need to be stricter, toughen them up, etc.  Anybody who knows me knows I don't coddle them, if anything  I ride them harder because they need to learn to adapt for the world, not the other way around.  They are good young men and we've worked very hard with them over the years and at times it was horribly tough with one of them, but I couldn't talk to my brother out it because he would just say, \"Fuck that autism bullshit!\".  It's hurtful and meant to hurt me.  Should I just accept his horrible behavior because he is drunk and keep letting him apologize when he sobers up?\n\nLately he has been lying, creating made up stories to cause fighting between family members.  I've called him out on it all, and he's admitted to it but then becomes a horrible prick..saying hurtful things one second and saying he loves us the next.\n\nI really think he needs professional help, I can't be that person, I'm not qualified.  I've told him exactly that too, but it goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nI finally just blocked him tonight, it's too draining emotionally and he is becoming angry and mean and I can't take it anymore.\n\nBut then I worry because he says I am the only person he can talk to.\n\nSo now I'm wondering AITA for blocking him?  Am I being selfish?  What if he does something stupid, will it be my fault for blocking him?  ",

All he did was go to church (so he hates church now) He had no birthdays or Christmas because his 5 kid family was too poor (So he hates holidays) And he never got a childhood dog so he just randomly decided to get a dog one day, putting stress on the rest of us. And I'm not saying its his fault for having a bad childhood, but I feel like he doesn't have to make me and my mom feel bad about holidays as well just because his childhood was so poor during holiday times. So he hates Christmas and does this weird sabotage thing where he spends too much money on stuff we need but can get it at much cheaper, and then ignores bills. So near Christmas we don't have much to get or do during Christmas. It pisses me off that he can't let us have a nice day. My birthday was Literally just me sitting at home chilling, and I got little to no gifts besides a mug from my mom. Whatever, I don't care much for my birthday, but I want Christmas to be the time where I get gifts and I get to GIVE gifts to my family, But of course, We can't, because \n\n1. my mom does all the Christmas shopping and my dad is sabotaging it (she doesn't work) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. I can't buy many good gifts because my parents don't like driving me to the bank and I only have about 20 dollars in real cash right now (I have more then enough to buy them gifts, but they'd have to drive me to the store, bank ect. and I can't have them all there so I have to go with one of them to get each other the gift, and again, My dads being stupid about it.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd 3. My dad is too busy with bills because he set them off for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here or is my dad being unreasonable?",

      "description": "The conversation I will be talking about took place yesterday (Wednesday) for time reference. I bought annual passes to universal studios for me and my gf a while back and have been meaning to use them. Our schedule allows us to only have 1 day of the week to spend a full day at universal studios. Unlike my gf I prefer to take advantage of this free time while she likes to sleep in and start the day late. Now we had planned to go to universal studios today (Thursday) and I had mentioned wanting to be out the door no later than 9 am. She tells me she has a test on Friday and would need to somehow spend time preparing for it. Now we had prior plans to go out for Wednesday trivia night and she said she would have to stay up till 3 am that night to study after trivia night and would like to leave at 10 am rather than 9 am. Now my gf is the type of person to never follow anything I say exactly and would often think that I am being controlling. I suspected she said she wanted to go at 10am because she said it herself and it was a time different than what I had proposed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn all honesty an hour difference wouldn't of mattered to me but just the fact that she needed to stay up at 3 am made me rethink plans to go to universal studios at all. If she could she would sleep in as long as she could so I know that staying up till 3 am means its very unlikely for her to be out the door by 10 am let alone spend a full day at universal studios. I asked her to stay back from trivia night to spend some more time studying so we could still leave relatively early while she also gets more sleep, but she had already told others she would be there. I then told her we should just not go at all to universal studios and we started to get into a fight. She says I'm controlling for not wanting to go at 10am but she didn't see the real reason for why I didn't want to go at all anymore. There's no point to go if she's just going to get tired early on in the day. She did the usual breaking up with me, blocking me, getting her things from my house and here I am spending my day off alone not knowing what's going on in our relationship. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Had plans to go to universal wanting to leave at 9am, gf has test to study wants to leave 10am, I say lets not go at all cause she has to stay up late to study the night before.",

It's no secret that the main Xbox demographic is male, so naturally I receive a lot of attention. I have a friend on Xbox that I've known for around 7 months. A few days ago he asked me to be his valentines. He specified that it wasn't in a \"relationship\" way and that it was just for fun. With that being said, I agreed to being his valentine.\n\n So today at school this other guy I know asked me to be his valentine as well. He's a really sweet guy so I decided to say yes. I didn't see a problem with this because my Xbox friend specifically said that it wasn't in a relationship way. It's not like I'm cheating on anyone, I'm a single individual. Also, valentines day is literally one day out of the whole year. I told one of my close friends about this and she said I'm deceiving both of them.\n\n AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to sublet our apartment over the summer?",
      "description": "My fiancé and I will be moving across the country (Philadelphia --&gt; west coast) for the summer for his MBA internship. The company he is interning with gives interns $2,000/month post tax to spend on living expenses (i.e. rent). The area of the west coast we will be in is pretty expensive and we will likely end up having to pay close to $3,000/month or more, meaning we are likely still looking at paying 1,000/month out of pocket. \n\nHere is where the debate comes in: He wants to sublet our place in Philadelphia over the summer and I do not. We are currently paying $2,400 here in Philadelphia so we would likely charge in the ballpark of $2,300 for the sublet with a refundable deposit of $1,000. I understand that this would save us a ton of money and we’d also likely come out of it with a profit by the end of the summer, but I just think subletting is way too risky and not worth the hassle. We would leave mostly all of our belongings behind with the exception of the clothes we take with us and perhaps renting a storage unit to put valuables in over the summer.\n\nMaybe I have been on the Legal Advice subreddit too much, but I am very afraid of having a stranger move into our apartment for 3 months with all our belongings. What if the subletter decides they don’t want to leave at the end of the summer? What if the subletter causes damage that costs more than the security deposit? What if the subletter doesn’t admit they are a smoker and we come back to an apartment filled with cigarette smoke? What if the subletter steals from us and we do not even realize it until they are long gone? To be honest, it also just weirds me out to have a stranger living in our apartment for 3 months sleeping in our bed, using our furniture and kitchen supplies, and having our clothes still mostly still left behind. It also just feels like a huge hassle to be completely honest and I know I would mostly get stuck with figuring out all of the logistics of the sublet (I work a full time job).\n\nSo what do you think – am I an asshole for depriving us of saving money and instead costing us money over the summer because I do not want to deal with a subletter?

      "description": "Kind of long but I would appreciate any insight.\n\nI go to a state college and live at my fraternity house off campus. I had to move my truck, which I am trying to sell, out of our driveway for a day and so I parked it in a lot right down the street from our house. We live pretty far off campus and usually use this lot for overflow parking because it's always empty but very recently the college designated this as a campus lot. As I pulled out of my drive, my truck died in the street. Stone dead battery. I had a friend hook up a tow strap and we dragged it to the lot. I come back from class a couple days later and find it gone. I call the campus police and ask them about it and they say it probably got towed. I go to the garage where it is and they charge me $460 to get it back. Because I was selling, I had taken off the plates and removed insurance/registration. I had to get it towed back to my house because it had no plates. Another 200. This was in February in New York. There was a ton of snow. The flatbed could not get up our steep driveway and was forced to put it in the same lot. This lot also has a steep drive to get out of and he barely got out after. My 4x4 was broken at the time and, that night we got another ton of snow. I couldn't get out of the lot with all the snow and only 2 wheel drive and wouldn't have been able to get up my driveway. I met with the campus police chief and explained my situation and he basically told me it wasn't his problem and I had two days to move it. Physically, this was impossible and I couldn't get out of the lot. Two days later, I get towed again. Another $460. I decide to have it towed back to my home two hours north. Garage charges me 45 a day to have it parked behind their shop while I wait for the 500 dollar transport. All in all cost me 1700 bucks. I've been bitter with the garage for charging college students outrageous fees and the campus police for having zero compassion for my plight.",

      "description": "Six months ago I moved 11 hours away from my hometown. My best friend who still lives there has been planning to visit me for a few months, but always rescheduled the dates. I eventually offered to help pay for a ticket for whenever she could come, and she said okay. We kept trying to plan but something always came up with her so I gave it a rest.\n\nFinally she settled on dates in Feb to visit with her s/o. They were going to drive. We'd gotten further with this plan than ever before so I also took off work, planned the itinerary, and spent about $200 on groceries the day before their arrival. Everything was in order for weeks... **until the day before**.\n\nHer s/o plows snow in the winter for his job but didn't request the days off work. He just gambled it wouldn't snow while he was away. So the day before they were supposed to arrive, she told me that his weather app said it **may** snow during their stay here, meaning that her s/o would have to work, and they couldn't come.\n\nMy weather app said no snow, so I remained optimistic. I suggested they get up early as planned, check the weather, and let me know if they’re coming. She agreed.\n\nThe day of, I woke up with no messages. I texted and asked what was going on. She answered 1 hour later saying that they just woke up. She said she woke up early as planned, but her s/o did not. I asked why she didn't text me or wake up her s/o. I **did not** get a response to these questions. Another hour later, she told me that his weather app said it would snow. They officially canceled. At this point, I was upset that:\n\n1. Her s/o did not request off work\n2. She waited late into the day they were supposed to arrive to tell me they weren't coming\n3. I've been trying to help her plan a trip here for months\n\nI told her this was not planned well. She defended her s/o entirely. I asked why she didn't text me that morning as planned. She did not answer. We went back and forth for a little while, just upset, and then she stopped responding for 3 weeks.\n\n3 weeks later--a few days ago--she texted me for the first time:\n\n&gt;\"I love you but you got too upset over a canceled trip. (Her s/o) doesn't plan his work schedule around when we feel like going on trips. You were inconsiderate about my side and I was upset too. But I just want to get over this and be friends again.\"\n\nThis is where I want to know AITA because I did not respond in a friendly manner:\n\n&gt;\"Firstly, you haven't talked to me in 3 weeks. Secondly, he offered to drive you guys down here. I did not ask him to work around 'our trips.' I want to know why he didn't request PTO on the chance it wouldn’t snow in winter. Thirdly, you were supposed to text me in the morning of and let me know if you were coming. I feel like you knew you weren't coming but entertained me into the next day. I can't believe you don't get why I'm upset. I don't know how I feel about being friends right now.\"\n\nThat was our last text exchange and I haven't heard from her in days.",

I cant grow hair on parts of my head, my ear is curved, and my eye is sort of droopy. The other scars on my arms and chest i can cover up.\n\nI was very shy growing up because of this. I didnt have any real friends or social interaction. My mom would try to arrange play dates but no kids would play with me at the park. When i was six my mom would have my brother play with me. When we were alone he was nice to me, but when he was around his friends he would say I looked like a little Freddy Krueger. I didnt know who this was until halloween but even still i played along because i wanted to play with other kids. I would tell my mom me and my bobo were just playing.\n\nI went as batman for halloween but my brothers friend had me take off my costume and go as tiny freddie krueger. And i didnt like this because he was a bad guy and i wanted to be good but i did it anyway.\n\nAs we grew up i became sort of the running joke. My brother would have me hide around corners and have girls run into me and scream, like i was a monster. I was 12 and he made me do this with my crush who i like.\n\nAt the beach whenever i would show the rest of my body they would laugh at me saying i dont need a tan.\n\nHe would take turns calling me quasimodo or lil freddy even when i grew as tall as him despite our age.\n\nHe wouldnt hang out with me at all as i got older because his friends didnt like me anymore since i was to shy to do their pranks.\n\nWhen i was 14 i was in highschool and my brother had just left, so i had to make my own friends. My stepdad was very supportive and had me try out for football since i was taller. I learned to make friends and i had a lot of self confidence. During my junior year i told my brother that he was wrong to treat me like that. He didnt apologize and said that i was having fun.\n\nI am now married and have a good life. My brother is very successful and is also religious now. He has apologized now that hes an adult. But i think back on all the times i would consider suicide or felt like a freak or that i wasnt good enough and i cry. I cant forgive him. I hate him.\n\nI do see a religious counselor (not involved with my brothers church) who advises me to forgive but i disagree. I feel like i missed out on having a real childhood. AITA?",

      "description": "tl;dr at the bottom.\nSo, currently I'm having lots of problems at school. I'm failing several subjects, overall pretty bad grades and deadlines and test dates are busting my ass. After being the \"good kid\" with perfect grades, attendance and politeness when I was younger, I'm not used to having to study.\nSo now I have unbearable stress with studying, homework and presentations, which I can not cope with due to depression. I just can't get myself to do anything besides lying in bed and worrying about my grades. Often I sleep even if I'm not tired just to escape the suffocating feeling of stress.\nI am very aware that at my age, the depression is more often than not teen depression, but a) that doesn't make the feelings any less valid b) I've been feeling this way and wanting to die since age 8 and c) I feel like shit regardless of what type of depression it is.\nOver the last months, I've been opening up to my mother about my feelings and how I want to die. How when I was 9, I would pray to the gods every night in bed, begging for death. I am a very prideful and self confident person, so opening up like that was already a huge blow to my self esteem, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I felt a lot better, and at first she was very nice to me - I knew that it was ingenuine, but I didn't care; I just had to get it off my chest. \n\nThe worst thing about my depression or whatever it is is the heavy feeling. Holy shit, I almost cannot describe that feeling. It feels like my body is filled with wet sand or steel. My limbs become heavy, my heart drops, I get nauseous, a knot forms in the back of my throat, and I just want to end it all. This feeling comes when I have to make decisions and have to be responsible, and when I have to do very important things. It's not nervosity; nervosity is cold sweaty hands, a stale mouth and andrenaline - the heavy feeling is the exact opposite. I feel warm, almost hot, my stomach is cramped, my heart aches, and I feel like I'm about to break through the floor because all the heavy, wet sand in my body.\n\nAnyway, when I told her about that, she told me that all those years, she and my dad thought that I was just a lazy piece of shit. \nInstead of cheering me up, trying to help and motivate me, she just put more pressure and me. Do this, do that. Have you done that and that already? You have to get movin, young lady!\n\nShe was CONVINCED that I just had to get up and do something. I just had to cheer up. Get more fresh air. Spend less time in front of the phone etc. The typical r/wowthanksimcured stuff.\nWhenever I try to talk to her about feeling horribly again, I expect a hug, a kiss on the cheek and her telling me that I'll get through it, I can do it, everything will be okay etc. I just want someone that gives me the power to want to survive, because I've been running on empty for the last 6-7 months.\n\nWhat do I get?\n\"Just do your work\", \"you just have to get out of bed and do anything productive for once\", \"why don't you just get up and do it?\".\nThis is all correct; I know all that myself. \nBut I can't.\nI physically cannot get myself to do it.\nAnd at first, I was like yea, thanks mom, I know. You don't have to tell me. I just want you to give me confidence, and lend me an ear. You don't have to give me advice, I just want it off my chest. \nBut she doesn't listen.\nShe goes on and on, making it sound like I'm a lazy piece if trash once again.\nThis has been going on for about three months now. I tell her about my problems, she blames me or something completely unrelated (my phone for example) and tells me to do what I have to do. I tell her that telling me that I useless because I already know, but she keeps going.\nAt this point I feel very insulted when she goes on with her usual tirade, because I feel like she doesn't even listen when I tell her something and she just wants to force me to do it her way instead of offering emotional support. \nIt's always the same.\nI ask her if she has time to talk a bit, she says yeah, I tell her whats wrong, and she tells me what to do in a way that makes me feel like it's my fault. After our talks I always feel worse than before, but I have nobody but her to talk about my problems.\n\nAnd today I snapped.\nShe comes into my room uncalled for, invades my privacy and starts talking the same shit as always  to me. I tell her that she is being very mean to me right now and that I feel like she is belittling me. She doesn't care. We go back and forth for a while, both becoming more aggressive, and me starting to cry from anger and frustration. I have been having anger issues for as long as I can think, so I ask her to leave my room as I can feel the anger boiling up. I have snapped before and when I do, there's no holding me back - and since we're both very physically strong women, we would probably both end up in the hospital if a fight ensued. \n\nI ask her to leave - she doesn't listen. I ask her again and again, becoming more and more aggressive, and she doesn't listen. \nAt this point I stand right in front of her, face to face, our noses centimeters from each other. I'm still crying, tears streaming down my face, my eyes swollen and red, my fists balled. I try to shove her out of my door, and she....\n....she laughs.\nShe laughs, right in my face, her eyes locked onto mines. \nShe tries to say some bullshit, but I have had enough. \nI am not going to get laughed at for reaching out for help by my mother.\nI shove her out the door, screaming that she is no help and that she should just shut up if she doesn't have anything to say that matters. I screamed things along those lines at her, still crying and trembling of anger. I didn't call her names, I didn't use any of her weaknesses. I just told her what I had been thinking for the last months. \nAt one point, she wipes the stupid grin off her face and starts to look sad.\n\"Oh. Ok.\", she says, really quietly and as if I hurt her. She then walked away.\nThis is something that I know the does to manipulate her children into doing what she wants; she's been doing it for years.\nAnd even if I know she's just trying to make me feel bad for her.... it works, god damn it. I am a very harsh person, and she always makes me question if I went to far even if I know I didn't. \n\nNow I feel really bad once again and I really don't know if I'm the asshole for screaming at her or if she's the asshole for pushing me too far.\n\ntl;dr:\nMy mother constantly puts me down and then expects me to be nice to her. Today I screamed at her after her harrassing me for too long and then she acted all sad and hurt.\nAm I the asshole for screaming at her?\n\nSorry for any English errors.\n",

No big deal-- down to 10 girls. Still a fun party. \n\nWe got a text last night from a mom we don't really know saying that her daughter heard about my daughter's party and asking if her daughter was invited. For background this girl did invite my daughter to a party about a month ago but it was clear she wasn't on the A-list, since she wasn't on the first set of invites. And that party was relatively structureless at the dad's home (living apart) with a lot of phone time, etc. (I know, 9-10 y/o's on phones).\n\nWe decided to call the venue this morning to ask if we could even add another child. They said yes. She's coming. Yay again.\n\nBut I'm still really irritated. This isn't at all about the extra head cost. It's the chutzpah. Who does this?\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "So there's a lot of story but I'll start with the TL;DR: I came out as transgender (mtf) and my wife came out as pansexual. Her very Mormon family flipped out. Her sister blocked me on Facebook making my wife angry because we're a package deal. Her sister refused to acknowledge my pronouns until recently. A bunch more drama ensues - most of it around me and my relationship with my niece. Her sister is either lying about what happened, a 1 in a billion glitch happened, or she honestly has memory issues. So her sister won't apologize and is mad at being called a liar. Her daughter (our niece) is crying about missing us. I bumped into them and she spent 5 minutes explaining to her daughter my new pronouns and how I am a girl. Wife is still upset and hurt and doesn't want to fix things. A child is honestly crying over not seeing us. I'm mad. I've nicely talked about it with her, because I know she's hurting so me being angry won't help. But in my mind she needs to grow up, be the bigger person, and work stuff out with her sister - even if it means compromising things she'd rather not. AITA for being upset here?\n\nSo to go into more detail. We announced leaving the mormon church and came out all in one fell swoop. My wifes sister and her fought because she didn't tell her. Her sister said it was a betrayal not to confide on her and that she should have told her the moment she knew I was transgender. At this point, my wife actually brought up conversations where she tried, and brought up transgender people in general and her sister said down right transphobic things. Even saying that all transgender people are child molesters. Her sister acknowledged that she said those things, acknowledged that she still felt those things and then told her sister it wasn't too late to leave me. \n\nMy wife goes on a tirade for about 2-3 months on Facebook with bi-weekly posts about how the mormon church is an awful organization. I post daily, I use rhetoric that I know is hurtful because I'm mad. It's part of what happens when you find out your depression was preyed upon to bring you to a false-god. Rightfully, this causes some distress to her family, sister included.\n\nHer sister uses the take a break option on Facebook with me making it so I can only see her public posts. The next week she calls my wife and tells her she misses talking and can they chat more about life. She doesn't use the right pronouns for me and when confronted with it she says she never will. Invites my wife to my nieces birthday and at that point my wife agrees to go because she knows my niece shouldn't be caught in between them. \n\nMy wife goes and is informed of the rules. No telling the niece to call me aunt (I was specifically told I wasn't invited). They weren't to use my pronouns around her while talking about me. And there would be no talk of me transitioning. The niece was told to only refer to me by John (pretend dead name so I don't dox myself) or it (not he or she). My wife comes home and says that she wouldn't deal with her sister if it wasn't for the niece. \n\nA few months go by and it's my wifes birthday. I'm big on family and conversations with her mom were going well - though tenuous. I asked her if she wanted to get together with them and her response was, only so we can see the niece. So I set it all up. I was told I wasn't allowed to be alone with the niece ever and I wasn't to hug her or touch her unless she was in immediate danger. And the same rules my wife had before. When I asked why I was told that I know why. Now, bear in mind, Brother In Law has been relatively silent about this, but chose to enforce these rules with me. His brother lived with them, child-sat and was alone with their daughter for hours at a time. Not really noteworthy his brother if you ignore the fact that he had just gotten out of a 5 year prison stay for sexually assaulting children as young as the niece. \n\nThe birthday party comes and goes and my wife agrees that her mom is really trying and would like to see more of her. We hang out with her mom once a month and anytime I'm in the area for work I get together alone with her for lunch or dinner. She's treating my wife better than I have ever seen her, and honestly she's fun to be around most times. We have a great time and we've worked most of it out. She struggles to use my pronouns, but no more than my own mom and she's always quick to correct herself. She hasn't used my dead name in months, so the relationship is thriving there.\n\nOne day, at a lunch with her, I find out that my wifes sister is having a pretty big surgery and unexpectedly within a week. She never calls my wife or texts her only letting her find out if it went well through her husband Facebook post (which I couldn't see still). This drives a bigger wedge between them. During her surgery there was a moment where her heart stopped and that caused them to talk to their daughter about death. (She's 6). Every night since she prays she gets to see her aunt and me before we die. (Were in our 20s so it's not about to happen, but she doesn't get that). My mother in law informs me of this and the fact that she's cried quite a few times about it during a phonecall trying to plan Christmas. \n\nWell, my wifes sister messaged her last week and went with the whole we never talk and it's because of you (despite never reaching out herself) and I want to know why. So my wife tells her it's because she doesn't respect me, treats me worse than an actual pedophile she knows, and blocked me on Facebook. We're a package deal, if you cut one of us out of your life you cut the other. They go back and forth and the sisters timeline doesn't match up to when she actually blocked me - she says it was after the birthday party but we know that's not the case (thanks to my religious journaling). She then unblocked me and claims that she had done it weeks ago but conveniently didn't actually take effect until the same day she was confronted about it. They never resolved the issue and my wife called her a liar and stopped responding.\n\nI happened to have another lunch with my mother in law the next day and it had snowed so my wifes sister had to borrow her moms car so I had to pick her up at their place. Well, she fell in the driveway, so when we got back from lunch I shoveled their driveway. My wifes sister pulled up with my niece in the backseat and my niece was desperately trying to get out but my wifes sister was talking to her. A five minute conversation later and they got out. My niece used the right pronouns and the right name. My wifes sister never used any pronouns or names. She did let my niece give me a hug goodbye. \n\nSo I tell my wife all this. She knows about my crying niece. She knows all of it and she still doesn't want to try to fix things. I've told her she doesn't have to take blame. I've told her you can fix things by giving her another chance. She's clearly trying herself and my wife says it sucks for the niece but her sister refuses to acknowledge her wrongdoing and until she does she won't see her. My wife has acknowledge her wrongdoing to her. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still mad about the things she's said and done but I'd rather move forward and fix family issues than let them get worse. I haven't used the words grow up with my wife. Like I said, when we talk about this, I am calm, cool and collected. I've tried to reason with her. I've talked about the turmoil its cause everyone. She says without an apology and acceptance of wrongdoing she won't see her. While her sister is clearly trying (or at least pretending to try for her daughters sake) she wants and demands an apology. \n\nUntil we came out and left the mormon church they were super close. They have lived together in adulthood. They have always been two peas in a pod. But then everything happened and now my wife won't move past it. \n\nAITA for thinking my wife needs to grow up and be the bigger person here? Or is she right in her anger. ",

      "description": "Both my boyfriend (39M) and I (27F) were raised very religiously, although in different religions, and are no longer practicing or have any desire to rejoin. We do not look back fondly on that time of our lives to put it lightly. We have lived together for almost a year (dating for almost 2) and definitely plan to get married eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and her husband are planning on a small family reunion in 2 weeks; my family hasn't seen her in about a year, and she has not yet met my boyfriend. The reunion destination is 4 hours away by car and is in a remote location so a hotel is not a possibility. There will be approximately 17 of us staying in this house over 3-4 days, and she said it sleeps 18 total but there are only 3 bedrooms? It is unclear where everyone will sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom was upfront about the sleeping arrangement rules... once I asked. She stated her &amp; her husband were excited to meet/get to know my boyfriend but that unless we got married and didn't tell them, we have to sleep separately. I was expecting some sort of scriptural explanation or something but all she sent (this is all by text) was \"Based on God's moral standards, no sex before marriage.\" I let her know that we would consider having sex during this time, under the same roof as family, to be both gross and rude but I didn't receive a reply. Considering all of the people coming/going I suggested wouldn't it be easier for us to stay in the same bed, to consolidate space, but she replied \"It would be easier, but you're not married, so no it wouldn't be easier.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my mom that I'm fully prepared to respect their rules because I know it's their house, their rules. I don't want to push back too much but I can't help but feel.. unaccepted? Our family relationship is already strained; in short I am the black sheep. I am only in regular contact with 3 of the 17 people attending (my sister, BIL, and my mom). The rest do not speak to me or invite me to family events. This would be my boyfriend's first time meeting my mom/extended family and I'm afraid of how this situation will make him feel once we get there. I'm afraid of all the people in one house, at one time, leading to my boyfriend having to share a room with people he has never met or on a shitty cot or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom did say, at least, he won't have to sleep in the garage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit. Tell it to me real. \n\nWIBTA if I said we just couldn't make it? Or should we suck it up? Do I have any basis to argue their Rules?",

      "description": "Mobile post \n\nMy friend was in a four year relationship with her bf, R, who she met around the same time as me. R and I spent a lot of time together because of her and I thought he was a great guy. He was very good to her, and I respected him a lot for treating my friend the way everyone wants their friends to be treated. \n\nMy friend had an affair three years in. She cheated on him with a co-worker for several months and felt terrible about it. She didn't stop the affair but she often complained to me that she felt like shit for what she was doing and wanted to stop. \n\nWe went out in my bday and got super drunk. A guy was trying to hit on her while she was wasted and we were waiting on our Uber. I stepped in and said \"sorry, she has a boyfriend\" while he was asking for her number. He told me to stop being me and I told him to have some respect for himself and other people's relationships. She was kinda miffed (she has hooked up with other guys while out with me before) but I didn't care at the time because I was drunk.   \n\nWhat do you think. AITA for stepping in? ",

He took it out of his pocket and tried to find it still riding, no hands on the handlebars. I was riding right  in front of him when he told me to stop so he can show me. I braked and somehow lost my balance and swerved slightly to the left. I tried to regain the balance with my arms and my elbow hit his phone and sent it flying. It smashed on concrete. To this day he says that it was my fault for my god awful riding skills. I think that he shouldn't have used his brand new phone on a bike not keeping a safe distance.

The party was being held at 5 pm and it was 3 pm when she got the text. First of all, I should say that both my girlfriend and I are extremely introverted. She asked me and I said I did not feel like socializing. She implored for me to go with her and how having me there with her would make it possible for her to leave earlier. I still said no, because all I wanted to do this weekend was to sit my ass at home. she ended up going alone. Later that night she sent me a long text stating that she felt that I had a choice and I did not choose her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAIAA here?",

After I completed 150 deliveries within the 60 day limit, he would receive a $1500 bonus and I would receive a $100 bonus. We agreed that I would be getting kinda fucked over, especially because Postmates is a much better platform. (better pay, more flexible, much less technical and logistical issues). We agreed to split both bonuses so each of us would receive $800. The other day we were texting and the bonus came up, conversation went like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend: You think you'll get it by next week?\n\nMe: Yup.\n\nFriend: Only one prob, I blocked the account.\n\nMe: What does that mean?\n\nFriend: I don't know if I'm gonna receive the promo.\n\nMe: It bothers me that you're just telling me this now, like I still feel you should give me the $800 if you don't get the money.\n\nFriend: Yeah... no, you're on crack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be clear \"I blocked the account\" meant he blocked the number that sent him notifications and deleted the app. I don't think this is at all gonna be a problem, I'm mainly posting this cause I'm interested in the hypothetical. I fell he would owe me as I have been working for both of us the last month and a half. Without the bonus I would be losing money considering I would be making more with postmates, also I have dealt with a considerable amount of bullshit with Doordash's faulty platform. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for trying to cheapen Christmas for my Family?",
      "description": "Recently, my parents have elected to spend more money on Christmas and fun events as my dad just got another job (was unemployed for about 2 years). When I say a new job, he is a marketing executive, and my mom is a teacher, so when unemployed we are lower-middle class where as when he is employed we are upper-middle. This has lead to more expensive purchases for fun.\n\nHowever, I know my parents don't have nearly enough saved for retirement for their age as they were barely treading water during the last 2 years, and when pressing them about it they often say \"fun now with you is our top priority\", as I am the youngest and am in college, so they do not have much time with younger adults left. Plus, I understand that living poor for 2 years is not fun, so they want to have that now. I also know a major factor in them saying this is that my high school and early college days were very rough, and my dad in particular feels bad about \"taking a normal childhood away from me\" by sending me to private school and pushing me really hard (spending a lot of our money on me, which I feel bad about, but this post is not about me). Now I don't feel so bad about sacrificing fun at my current age and so despite the push back, I have declined the offering of fun events and gifts on the grounds its too much money and they can start saving.\n\nIn response to push backs like this, I often hear things like \"quit trying to make this about money\", \"you need to have once in a while\", \"I don't care how much it costs\", and other statements of varying negativity toward me and the cost in general. I feel like this is fiscally irresponsible, but I also feel bad for \"cramping the style\" of my family right now and being the only one with a problem with spending. \n\nSide note: I don't know their financial situation fully, so I can only estimate from what I have seen maybe 2 years ago (begin of the unemployment) about what they have saved. It is possible that they have saved a lot since then, as the family is only three people now (my bro is staying home for a year then moving out) as opposed to four and my dad has a job now, so its possible I am assuming the worst. But, I still feel like saving is better than fun at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA for saying no to events and gifts for Christmas on the grounds that it would cost to much for my parents/family  ",

      "description": "I'll start it off with this. I'm not a meals person, and I've never been one. Sure, I'll sit down with family to eat a lunch, or any other scheduled meal, but on my own I rarely ever sit down for a real meal. I still live with my parents, but I'm in college and have a part time job. This puts me on my own schedule 70-80% of the day. This normally isn't a problem, but recently it's become more of one. My father will ask me if I've eaten [insert meal here like breakfast] and I'll say no, because I haven't and don't plan on it. He will want me to get something to eat, and I'll decline saying I'm not hungry. I've done this for years, and every time he will relentlessly insist that I eat a meal. Most of the time I have no choice but to sit down and eat a little bit, and it usually costs me no harm. Lately however, he's gotten a little more hostile about me not eating meals. He has said things like \"it's rude of you to not want to eat on everyone's schedule\" and \"I don't know if you're just being difficult or rude, saying you aren't hungry, but I don't care for it.\" He's said on multiple occasions that it doesn't matter what I think/feel about eating, and that I should be eating at meal time. Come home from work around dinner time? I'm not that hungry, but I've gotta load my plate or else I'm being rude. I'm sure you get the gist of it. Today just a little bit ago, I got a call from him about whether or not I had eaten lunch. Of course, I haven't and he asked if I wanted lunch. I said no, I'm not that hungry and he got angry at me for \"being difficult and obtuse\". AITA?",

We keep a dog out and he knows very well that we don't leave the gate open so it doesn't escape. And next he goes in a direction that usually no one goes to and he got out of my sight. So I get out of the room, call my dog so it doesn't escape and since everything he did seemed odd/suspicious, I ask what's happening what's the problem? It ended up just being that his niece's ball fell in my yard while playing. \nBut apparently that sounded rude enough for him to tell my mom, and her yelling at me that I'm \"rude\". In their eyes it seemed like I was asking for a fight or something.\nMy mom suggested that when stuff like that happens I should be \"polite\" and ask stuff like do you need anything.\nIn my eyes what I asked seemed perfectly fine, and there is no reason for my neighbor to get offended in a way, when he's clearly entering my property leaving the door open and acting kinda suspicious.\nWell my parents and neighbors think the opposite. \nAITA?

      "description": "Reddit, I need some advice and have no-one I can talk to about this.\nI met this girl and we hit it off and became close. Turns out we’re both a bit fucked up from things in our past and I guess we bonded over that.\nOne night out I made out with a guy I know and then ended up making out with her later that night. We talked about it afterwards and I told her I care about her but it was a drunken thing, I’m not ready to be anything for anyone at the moment due to stuff I’m still trying to work through. She said the same. \nShe admitted later she was pissed I kissed the guy in front of her and wanted to head fuck me by saying she did it because she was bored because I was treating it like a game by kissing them both. I apologised and reiterated the above.\nWe occasionally made out still. I tried to stop it but then thought why not? We both like each other and know where we stand so what’s the harm? She’d tell me about guys/girls she’d hooked up with and then ask if I was annoyed. I try to put things into perspective so when she’s telling me these things, I know it’s done so what can I do and I don’t have any right to be mad because I’m offering her nothing. But not being mad seems to annoy her and then she says it seems like I don’t care about her.\nOne night she told me she liked me then drunkenly shouted at me about how I don’t care etc. I tried to calm her down and told her we just should be friends and she basically pushed me against the wall and forcibly kissed me, I told we should talk about it when sober. We talked and everything seemed ok. We still made out at times when we were drunk which I know we shouldn’t but I think we both just needed a cuddle and kiss at times and I didn’t think it was anything special for her because she was still hooking up with other people.\nLast month she told me she’s had a hard time with her mum (catholic and not at all supportive of her sexuality), her mum had been asking about us and didn’t believe the truth and was giving her shit. I sympathised and offered to go talk to her mum, she got pissed saying I don’t take things seriously and don’t understand. I asked what she wanted me to do, it’s a shit situation but I can’t control anything about it. She also said she’d slept with someone from work who’s married with kids. I said that’s shit but also it’s not just on her so not to punish herself too much over it, what’s done is done. This probs came off as unsympathetic but I didn’t know what else to say! \nAfter she messaged me saying whatever relationship we have isn’t good for her and its getting to her, she doesn’t think it’s healthy and it’s upsetting her, good luck and then blocked me.\nI feel so sad I’ve lost this friendship and have been going over what I should of done differently. Yesterday she randomly unblocked me with a ‘How’s life? :)’ and I don’t want to start being like WTF and argue yet again but I’m so confused right now. So AITA in this situation and WIBTA if I asked WTF is going on?",

      "description": "About a week ago my parents, my girlfriend, and I were driving home from a college tour. It was late and we had been in the car for about 4 hours so I was already pretty irritated. So my dad brings up the fact that my flight instructor has just offered me a time in the morning at 7:30. He asked me if I could make and I told him no. I wasn't going to even be awake because we weren't going to be home till at least 12 and I already had a event planned for that morning. \n\nWhen I told him that he just asked again. This went on for another 6 time until he became angry and started to scream about how I was a POS for not appreciating what is giving to me and how I waste everyone's time and money.\n\nI (stupidly) argued back and we got into a giant fight in front of my GF and it was just rough. When we got home my dad and my mom came to me and told me how ashamed they were of me for how I acted.\n\nFast forward to today, my family has just kinda ignored me and my existence for the past week. I've been making my own dinners and they just don't talk to me. It's been kinda depressing, I just want the opportunity to just talk to my family. \n\nAlong with that today I started a part time job so I can afford to pay for my own gas and other things. But I still don't get paid for another week. So I needed money for; gas, prom (which is this weekend), and some Walmart work clothes. All of which I promised I would pay back with my first pay check. I asked my parents if they could help me out, they responded Yes but only if I apologised for my \" terrible \" behavior. I just looked at them and said No and left the room.\n\n So I guess the question is AITA for not apologising to my parents after all that happened.\n",

      "description": "I was really excited for next weekend. One of my best friends (I'll call her Dee) is coming to visit me, and we're going to another close friend's (Omar) birthday party. I haven't seen Dee in almost 6 months and we've been planning this weekend since January. She is also really good friends with Omar and he is really looking forward to seeing her again. This week, my bf informed me he had invited another friend (Ashley) to come up and stay.\n\nI told him I wish he hadn't invited her without talking to me first, and he got very mad at me! I didn't even tell him to un-invite her, I just expressed that in future, I would like him to talk to me. He thinks I'm being controlling and that I'm jealous.\n\nI don't want her to come this weekend because:\n\na) I don't want to spend the weekend entertaining and cooking for 5 people, I want to spend time catching up with Dee and hanging out with my close friends.\n\nb) I don't actually know Ashley that well. I have nothing against her but she's just not really a person I mesh with, and my bf always tries to force me to spend time with her. She came to visit last summer and I did try to include her but she just thought me and Dee were weird and seemed annoyed.\n\nc) She also didn't really talk to anyone besides me, my bf and a friend of hers from high school, so I feel like I'm going to end up with a tag-along at the party.\n\nLast time she came, I was very sick and hungover and my bf spent the morning with me at my mom's house and she went back to our place. She was PISSED. I could tell a big part of his choice to stay with me was because he was sick of entertaining by this point in the weekend. I was happy he stayed with me but I thought it was really rude of him. He shouldn't invite people unless he's willing to put in the work of playing host all weekend and I'm concerned that if he feels this way again, he's going to pawn her off on me.\n\nI told him I would have just preferred he invited Ashley a different weekend. If Dee wasn't coming I could at least go \"study\" when I want to get away from his friend. He doesn't know I'm not a big fan of Ashley. I don't want him to feel like he can't be friends with her or can't invite her to stay. He can be friends with whoever he wants but he just needs to be prepared to host all weekend because I don't really want to spend that much time with her. Thinking about this weekend, my feelings have gone from excitement to exhaustion.",

      "description": "I had a debate with my friend and he said I am the asshole for breaking about a dozen car windows this summer where people had dogs in their cars on hot days, primarily at a gas station. He says I should have just warned the driver because I saw them leave the dog there in almost every case except two. Here’s an example:\n\n\nI’m sitting in my car at gas station scratching some lotto tickets. I saw a guy pull up in a huge red pickup truck, and left his (I think) German Shepard mix in the truck with the truck on. I immediately made my way over to the truck as the guy was walking into the gas station, and using an aluminum baseball bat I keep specifically for this situation, i began recording to have evidence of the dog in a hot car, and I bash in the rear window of the truck, the drivers window, and the windshield. I left the passenger window as the dog was sitting there wagging its tail at its rescuer and I didn’t want to risk hurting it with stray glass, adorable pup. As I’m retreating to my car to continue my scratch offs and wait for the next perpetrator, the driver of the pickup runs over to me and yells WTF why the fuck did you break my windows? I begin recording on my phone to ensure that any potential assault is caught on camera and I calmly explain that he left his dog in a hot car. He calls me a bunch of names, tries to justify it saying he just ran in to buy a Gatorade and snacks, spent less than 2 mins in the store, etc. but I wasn’t having it and told him to go ahead and call the police and he can explain to them why he left a dog in a hot truck. He cursed me out and left. I did this about a dozen times over the course of the summer. ",

      "description": "So every since I've moved to Texas, my neighbors has never really talked to us or even acknowledged us. She has 2 big dogs that she keeps in her fenced house. However, she does a shit job at keeping locked. The dogs get out often, resulting with them going onto my property and shiting in my back yard. One of them bit my dad in the leg before, but he simply gave a warning to my stupid neighbor.\nUnfortunately, what we anticipated occured unexpectedly.\nMy 2 small dogs were in my backyard, and one of them went to my front yard to sunbathe. My dad was washing dishes and watching her through the window. What he didn't see were the two dogs who had bad intentions.\nThey both began to attack my dog, partly skinning her back and digging into her organs. My dad kicks the front door open and tells them to scram but they had her in their mouths. She was yelping in pain. He went inside for the gun but at that point my other neighbor got the dogs inside and locked their gate.\nWe immediately took her to the vet and she stayed overnight.\nMy poor dog unfortunately died on Saturday due to internal damage. My neighbor just shrugged and didn't make an effort to at least lock her gate.\nWe talked to animal control and they can't do anything unless we have evidence her dogs were out. He did say however, that if we feel endangered for our family (including my baby siblings and dog), that we should do whatever we can to defend ourselves, including shooting the dog(s).\n Both dogs pooped on the same spot they killed my dog, possibly as a taunt to my other dog. They have tried hurting her too. She is all we have and I cannot lose my other dog.\nAITAH for my family wanting to take actions into our own hands?\n",

      "description": "So last January I put my son in karate. They were running a special $1 for 6 weeks and I thought it sounded fun. My son absolutely loved it (he’s 9) so after the 6 week I decided to keep him in it for $169 a month.\nI have 2 older daughters 11 and 13 (and a 2 y/o). Neither of the girls seemed to really care that he was in karate or showed any interest in it. Fast forward to June and I find out both girls need braces at $145 per month. \nNow last week after attending one of my sons tournaments (where he got first place) both girls have decided they also want to be in karate. When they first asked me about it I said no because well, they have braces. Now I get that it’s not REALLY fair and they didn’t really choose to get braces but it is what it is and I Can’t afford another $340 monthly bill. \nMy husband thinks that the best option would be to take my son out of karate like if they all can’t do it nobody should. But I refuse to do that to him.\nI’d also like to note that the oldest is involved in every school sport their is and while it’s not nearly as expensive it can still be costly. And the younger one is in orchestra and drama. They both very much enjoy their extra curricular activities and I support them in every way. I never miss a game, play etc.\nAnyways I feel like I may be rambling here but I really am conflicted on what’s right. Especially after reading a certain post on here where she was clearly TA .\n",

      "description": "I met my now GF through a mutual friend on this friends birthday. She wanted me to get to know her because she thought we would be a good match despite only knowing me for a short period of time. This girl and I were both pretty drunk when she introduced us. We had a long conversation and got along well, but I had the feeling that she wasn't what I was looking for in a partner. The evening got longer and after a while, we sat down next to each other and talked some more. Eventually, I kissed her even though I knew I had no intention of ever being together with her. Still, we started dating after a while and we are now together for 1.5 years despite that. The reasons which made me think we're not \"meant\" for each other are still ever present but she has some other qualities that made me overlook them. Part of them is she is really sweet and overall just a loving and caring person and we also totally match sexually and have amazing sex. Still,  There a just a couple of things about her that are a dealbreaker for me in the long run. Anyway, now that this relationship is getting more long term I wonder if I should break up, because deep down I know I wouldn't want to marry her or start a \"future\" with her.  I talked to her about it and she says she doesn't care because I am the best thing that ever happened to her and that she doesn't care as long as we are together. Also, we both love each other, but I still think that that is not enough for a long term relationship. \n\nTo further complicate things I'm moving away for college in 2 months to a city that's about a 3h drive away. I don't want to stay there longer than necessary and move back home eventually, but I think that it will be probably 1.5 to 3.5 years before I can move back to my home town. She offered to move with me but I refused because I'm unsure about the relationship in general and I wouldn't want her to make a commitment like that while I'm unsure about our relationship. At the moment we are planning to have a long distance relationship.\n\nSo now my questions are:\n\nAITA for dating her in the 1st place?\n\nAITA for staying in this relationship even though I'd want something else long term and I am also preventing her from meeting someone who wants what she wants?\n\nAITA for agreeing to a long distance relationship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very curious to hear what you guys think and thank you in advance for your answers. English is not my 1st language so I'm sorry if my spelling or grammar is bad.",

      "description": "Ok a little backstory. So I met this girl on tinder in October, things didn't work and she started dating someone new. Nothing horrible. She texted me around New Years and we started dating.\n\nNow shortly into the relationship she mentioned that when she thinks the relationship is going to end poorly, she'll look at other options. She asssures me she wouldn't do that to me, but I take that with a grain of salt as I do most things.\n\nWell at one point we got into a fight about her exes and dudes that very clearly had a crush on her asking for nudes and her refusing to tell them that she was taken, just simply said no. Shortly after, I saw that she texted her ex, and asked when they were going to meet up. This of course caused another fight about how I shouldn't worry and all this. But then I might've gone a bit far and mentioned that I didn't like any of the dudes blatantly hitting on her and her refusing to acknowledge our relationship outsde of us two and family.\n\nAnd before I make it sound like I'm an angel, I'll admit I had the same type of things happening where girls I had hooked up with were still my friends. But when she expressed that she didn't like that,  I cut contact with them. But she refuses to do anything like that and defends the guys at the same time. \n\nSo reddit, Am I the Asshole for this?",

      "description": "AITA? Hi, as the title implies, I set up a really fun sounding four way for my boyfriend (54m) and I (34f). We have been together for two years. He is wealthy and I like to treat him like a king because he takes care of me in other ways. He mentioned a few weeks ago that he’d like another woman to join us. He expressed multiple times since then that the best part  for him would be them being into me and me enjoying their going down on me. Them making me cum was the biggest turn on. \n\nIt took a ton of coordinating, but I got a friend (27f) and another woman I met at hot yoga (21f) to agreeing to come for a night of drinks and rendezvous with me and the man. It seemed perfect and we were all really excited.\n\nNow, some backstory is that it seems especially lately, that my SO seems to criticize me over everything. He seems to create impossible situations in which no matter what I choose, it seems to be the wrong answer. I have spent a good portion of our relationship eggshell walking. He is very difficult to please.\n\nFast forward to today, and we got some dinner before meeting the women. I tried to touch base with him, after noticing that he totally cleaned the apartment, went overboard with his getting primped, shaved, and grooming preparations, and cleaning the apartment and decorating, about how I felt it was important that we try to keep our focus on each other, and be the primary team. That nobody is more important to impress than each other, and these two women should really feel like we are truly in love, and we are with them in an exercise in sharing our love. He reacted to this surprisingly negatively and irritatedly, short fused-ly snapping about how we’re gonna do this or we aren’t, and if I’m getting cold feet just say so, in a very annoyed way. I tried to explain what I meant and that instead I was just trying to connect with him about this experience before we went into it, and he persisted that I “always have to ruin everything”.\n\nOne of my rules I made clear to the women and he before tonight, was that I wouldn’t be comfortable with anyone having sex alone without me. That all seemed reasonable to everyone, and he said said more or less psht, of course. That would never come up.\n\nDrinks went well and we all really connected. He still had a standoffish vibe, but I tried to make the best of it. We went home and when things got busy, everyone seemed to have fun but I noticed he was having difficulty getting hard. I spent some time going down and jerking with lube, and he got hard enough to fuck two of the three of us while we did various other pleasing each other activities. I was very invested in making sure he was attended to at every moment. I definitely made sure to show how turned on I was when the girls were going down on me, like he insisted he wanted to see. I thought it was all fun but did notice a persistent issue with his not being able to stay very hard. I imagined a possible nervous issue, and maybe a little extra drinking we all partook in. So I suggested we take a break for a sec, and the other girls left the room. When he and I were alone,  I said, “it is me”? Because my touching his arm made him wince away. He said he didn’t know and maybe it was me. This hurt me s lot. He didn’t elaborate further. Of note the sexual four way experience lasted all of maybe 5-10 min. \n\nI then noticed back in the living room him paying particular attention to the 21F. She was quite beautiful, and I guess was drunk and acting most hanging on him. They disappeared for a few inside and I realized upon checking inside they were making out and touching each other. I went and told them well, if he doesn’t want me involved but wants her, how can I force that rule and make him want me. I told them both they should be intimate together if that would be a better experience than being with me or us all. and they did. For a couple hours. The other friend and I went to the rooftop for a bit to give them privacy because even though this hurt me, I did want him to be satisfied, even though it hurt me deeply that he didn’t want me there, despite everyone knowing my “boundary”. Granted I know I gave them permission but it still hurt to know he preferred her to me. She asked us to come back in no more than 10 min. We came back in about 25 min later to get the other friends belongings who was going to leave, and these othe two were still going at it. Oral, full sex, everything. I walked the friend downstairs and got her a cab and gave them even some more time, again as hurt as I was.\n\nI came back up eventually and the girl was crying that she couldn’t make him cum. I reassured her it wasn’t her, but she told me later he said he couldn’t cum bc of me.\n\nWhen everyone left, he got irate at me. Saying I ignored him in the 4 way, humiliated him bc he couldn’t stay hard (that’s my fault despite my efforts!), kept the girls to myself (not true/ I made certain he fucked US ALL and that he was taken care of at every moment by someone in some way), but WORSE yet was he was mad that I interrupted him with the woman he was alone with for hours a couple of times. HE MAD MAD HIS GIRLFRIEND INTERRUPTED HIM WOTH ANOTHER WOMAN! I honestly hoped one or two times that my coming in would get me invited to join, but it didn’t. I just got a look of disgust. The other time was us just coming in to get the friends things and leave again. \n\nAm I the asshole? For interrupting his private time w this woman which wasn’t even supposed to happen privately? For feeling like he preferred some woman over me? For wishing I’d be invited into a sexual encounter I arranged for us, and wasn’t? He is livid at me and called me a lesbian whore who he doesn’t want next to him in bed, and doesn’t even want my whore lesbian self on his couch.  I think left him this morning soon as I was awake and sober.",

      "description": "So throughout the school year, my roommate and I have discovered me have different sleeping patterns. I sleep like a human, she sleeps like a vampire. She's coming in at 5 am which makes NO SENSE bc she's got class from 9-3 every other day, meaning she'll only get sto sleep like 4 hours before her day starts. But whatever, I can't tell her what to do (and I've tried. She's always asking me to help her do stuff like laundry and hw and cleaning and getting her life together and to hold her accountable but when I try she ignores me and tells me I can't control her. So I've stopped  helping her and she understands why)\n\nAnyways, she keeps coming to the dorm around 4, then eating w me at 5, then she'll in and do NOTHING or nap til 9. Then she'll leave and do some shit w her friends til 1. Then she'll come back. And most nights that's where she stays in, but sometimes, she'll go out to eat dinner, then she'll come back around 4 or 5 (which... I mean why wouldn't you just stay out). When she's finally in, she'll do her homework or browse some social media shit and I know she's trying to be quiet but just get opening the loud ass done wakes me up. Then she turns on her v dim fairy lights. And the clacking on the computer??? But if she's feeling productive she'll do her laundry or clean or shower. And I know she's trying to be quiet but it's fucking buttfuck in the morning, everything you do is loud. (For example it's 7:35 am right now and she's watching some movie like.... WHAT ARE HEADPHONES?? on another tangent, at the beginning if the semester, I bought this bitch headphones so she could fucking use them and she never did)\n\nReguardless of anyone's complete inconsideration of me, I try to be quiet during the day time hours, when she's sleeping but lately I just don't feel like I should have to be. It's NORMAL FUCKING DAY TIME HOURS BITCH. It's 11 am. It's 2pm. It's fucking 4 pm. WAKE UP. I used headphones, I walked lightly, I attempt to open and close any doors could as quietly as possible, I didn't turn on the lights. But lately I've just been doing whatever. I bought an electric toothbrush and user it every morning when I wake up. I play Reddit videos out loud when my headphones are too far to reach. I turn the light on when it's dark. \n\nThe reason this all came about is bc she keeps getting phone calls at 3 am and answering them in the room. I already asked her to take them outside but this morning I was awaken by the door. Then her phone. Then her voice. I just don't give a fuck anymore. Am I an asshole for loving my litteral life if I just stop complain that she's living hers?",

      "description": "So my mom is getting married on V day next week.. she asked me what I was going to do to my hair. I told her I wanted to do it myself and had a certain style in mind. She insisted that I go to the Dominicans and have them wash, blow dry, and straighten it. I wasnt really wanting to do that because my hair is slightly damaged from the micro braids I had in a couple months ago. And I was just trying to stay away from heat for a while. She said she just wants it to \"look nice\" as if I dont know how to do my own hair I guess lol idk. She said it's just for that day and I can wash it and do whatever to it after the wedding and she would pay for it (I'm not working right now so money is tight on my end) but I'm just like I really dont want her to spend her money on something that's only going to be for one day, especially when she has better things to worry about.. then my grandma asks me what i'm doing about my nails. I told her I brought my own nail polish and will do it myself. She then says the same thing my mom said about looking nice and she would pay for them.. I'm just like 😪🙄 I'm a 21 year old woman, I know how to do things myself without spending money on it if i have the necessary tools to do so which I do.\n\nMy question is, am I the asshole for feeling this way? I know it's for my mom's wedding but I'm really just not the type of person to go to the salon if I really dont need to. Idk.",

      "description": "I hope the title isn’t too confusing to read, but just in case it is, let me make it make sense lol. Basically one of my moms friends came into town from SD, we’ll call the friend, R. R’s daughter was having a birthday party at some kiddy place and I guess my mom, brother, and I were invited lol. Now here’s the thing, I’m 24 and the last thing I want to do is hang out with a bunch of loud, annoying kids at some cruddy smelly kiddy place after working 8 hours at a job where I encounter more than enough kids.\n\nAnyway, my mom doesn’t even really ask me, it was implied that I didn’t really have a choice lol. So I told her I work 8-5 the next day, and when the party would be, she said 5, so ok I left it at that. Fast forward, she comes home in a huff and says, “don’t worry you don’t have to go to the party anymore” before she storms out of the house and slams the door. ...ok? You’d think that’d be over right? You’d be wrong! I get a long-winded text the next day at work basically saying that I should be putting family above all else, I seemed to have lost my “sensitivity” chip along the way, and that i should have said yes because I shouldn’t let her go alone.\n\n....to an 8 year old girls birthday party. \n\nMind you, this is all over a LITTLE GIRLS BIRTHDAY PARTY from some mutual friend of hers, that I personally haven’t seen or talked to in 7 years. So why in God’s name would I want to go to this thing? And my moms reasoning is that she doesn’t want to go “alone”. Because being seen alone at a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese is so terrible. Here’s an idea, don’t go??? I could understand if it was like a super important dinner with like a client or something, but... come on man.\n\nAITA here? Feel free to call me out if I am, but I mean, I think I should have a choice if I want to go, (which I don’t lol), but my god man, now I feel like an asshole because of that sole reason! God, don’t you just love it when parents play the guilt card?",

      "description": "I'm a new content editor at one of my university's publications, let's call it *The Owl*. It's not widely read, but every once in a while an article blows up and the whole school will see it. Before I was really involved in that I was a member of my school's Student Union.\n\nThe Union is a very new club, I was one of three members. Its main cause last year was ensuring that every student worker was paid minimum wage and had a valid employment contract. They have lots of other causes too, and I got involved because I thought they were fighting for justice in a way (corny I know). \n\nI resigned last year because the other two members decided to reveal confidential information sent by another student regarding the wage issue. They refused to ask her about it before revealing it because they were worried she might say no. This information was sensitive because the anonymous student accused her boss, employed by the school, of some pretty shady stuff. They argued that it was really important to the cause because it would be embarrassing for the school to have it revealed, so the ends justified the means. They also didn't like this girl personally.\n\nNow my new editing job at *The Owl* comes in. I plan to assign an article to one of my writers about the Union. I also plan to tell the writer that the Union can't be trusted with confidential information. I also plan to get in touch with the girl whose info was leaked and tell her exactly what happened. I'm going to invite her to be interviewed by the writer. My goal is to let the whole school know that the Union can't be trusted because they encourage people to tell them confidential information, but don't hold themselves to ethical standards.\n\nAITA for blowing up their spot, essentially? They do a lot of good work, they did get minimum wage for every student. And they plan to do a lot of other things I support. If I publish this, they might lose all credibility as a club. People already kind of hate them for \"threatening\" the stability of the work-study program (there was some talk that it would be shut down instead of raising the wage). Also, it's not really any of my business, and if I just let it go, no one would ever know. But I am a journalist now, and it's important to hold people accountable.",

The house was kind of a mess when she left, so she told us to split to chores between us.\n\nMy middle sister was working both afternoons and evenings, leaving my youngest sister and I to pull part of her weight, so we decided to split it half way between us. \n\nShe did her half first and then cane to tell me what was left to do. I got around to it and completed it in my own time Friday evening and then I went back to my room to chill.\n\nOn Saturday, I began work at 7pm and I came home at 4am this morning. (I’m a bar tender, nights like that are normal)\n\nShe leaves it to 6pm Saturday evening to tell me I did a shit job and that I should start over. I told her that even if I wanted to do that, I have no time as I had to get ready and leave for work in the space if 40 min and she was PISSED. She was swearing, slamming doors, just throwing a huge childish tantrum (she’s 14).\n\nSo I go to work, I come home exhausted and she wakes me up 6 hours later to tell me that Grandad has come to visit. I look like I just been stood behind a plane taking off, I can barely understand what he was saying because I was just that tired.\n\nAfter he leaves, my sister is like “So are you going to help me now?” I told her not right now, I’m exhausted, I got home at 4am this morning, I’ve slept 6 hours after a painfully long and exhausting bar shift, the last thing I want to do is pack the dishwasher. So she throws another tantrum, complaining about how lazy I was yesterday, that she has to do everything in the house and just all round that life is unfair.\n\n\nAITA and how can I convince her otherwise if I’m not.",

      "description": "Let me start this by saying that I love dogs, and I’ve always wanted my own for a long time. My roommate and I started living together in August,  and things started out great. We have known each other since we were kids, and always got along very well. But these past few months she has stopped cleaning up after herself, and at one point her cats litter box hadn’t been cleaned in about 2 months. After asking her for a week straight to do it, I finally got sick and tired of gagging every time I walked into the bathroom so I had to do it myself, literally scraping cat poop out of the pan. I also always have to feed her cat, because my roommate sleeps 11-12 hours a day and only gets up at 15 minutes before she has to leave for work. She already has a ball python which I reluctantly agreed to, and once when I was gone for 10 days she trashed the place, leaving me to clean it all up. One of her friends dogs is having puppies soon, and when she asked if we could get one I finally put my foot down and said no. The apartment is only so big, and there is no back yard for the dog to run around in, since it’ll be a Husky-Lab mix it’ll need a lot of room to run. My roommate got really angry and has been very defensive, even saying “I’m just like her mom when I argue” and that she “deserves this dog” and when I say she can get her own dog when she lives in her own place she said that “she wouldn’t spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars by herself on a dog.” So what do you guys think?

      "description": "My mom told me i would be babysitting sunday and i asked her if im getting payed this time. Last time i babysat these kids i was payed with a box of pizza and a bag of chips. I didnt say anything because i thought it would be a one time thing but my mom wanted me to do it again for free. It is the weekend and the last day of spring break so i said thats basically child labor. She got pissed and said that im ungrateful of how much she does for me and that i should be fine spending my weekend helping her out she also threatened to drive me to the police station and have me ask them if i am correct but thats way extra and i just said fine you win. To make things even more annoying i asked her if i would be good to go by 2 and she said yes. It is currently 4 and she is still not back. \n\n\nSummary:\nAm i the asshole for not wanting to babysit my moms friends for free",

      "description": "So I left my mom and dad’s house last night in a big old pissy huff because of an argument that we had on this subject and I’m still angry mainly because I can’t figure out how I feel about this.\n\nI’ve known about my cousin’s wedding for about six months now and my mom and dad went and got my immediate family plane tickets and a place to stay in the town where it’s taking place. I also have been helping to plan and generally get hyped about one of my coworkers’ bachelorette party. We met pretty recently but were really hitting it off as friends and I feel like it has the potential to be a very good friendship. Plus it’s the first bachelorette party I’ve ever ever been invited to and I’m actually super stoked. \n\nHOWEVER I literally just realized it’s the same weekend as said wedding because I am kind of a poor plan-aheader. I went ahead and told my parents that I may pull out of the wedding festivities and instead send them a nice gift and a message. This is not a cousin who I have spoken with in maybe 5 years save the occasional back and forth on Instagram chat. Of course my mom and sister immediately leapt at my throat, all, “Gee maybe you should uphold the first commitment you made?” I come from a rather passive-aggressive family. \n\nMy dad meanwhile is over here like, If you can manage to get your flight refunded or switched to another trip and then pay me for it I’m cool with it. *But make sure this is really what you want to do.* (ominous dad voice)\n\nIDK, am I the asshole here? I’m 25, don’t feel like I need to be going along with all the things my folks decide I need to do anymore, and sometimes things come up and you just can’t make it. Life is short. Also I have like no female friends and I’m so terrible at making friends. I’m thinking this party, all booze and poor decisions aside, could be exactly what I need in order to stay sane/ not feel so fucking lonely and hopeless. Help? \n\n**TL;DR:** Just realized my cousin’s wedding falls on the same weekend as a bachelorette party I was just invited to — AITA for wanting to bail on the wedding?",

      "description": "I recently bought my new co worker from out of state lunch, and offered him to stay in an extra room at my place for $500 a month to avoid hotel costs. He declined because he wanted to find a place his wife could move into with him as well. However, since money was tight while starting a new job, he asked if he could stay with me for just a week until he got paid.  \n\n\nI agreed to let him stay that week free of charge. A week passed by, he comes back with his wife and realizes how expensive it will be to acquire their own place and asks to stay with me. Even though I offered the $500 rate to only him he assumed it would also cover his wife as well. Since its only one room I figured it would be cool. \n\n\nHowever, a week goes by with those two here and my propane usage rate has been through the roof and my plumbing has been backed up in both bathrooms, Im assuming from feminine products since Ive lived here for 4 months without a single plumbing problem by myself.  Ive had to pay $475 for the propane refill(which is mostly due my usage alone) and now $139-$200 for a plumbing repair. They fill the kitchen trash without taking it to the dumpster, they order take out without offering to reciprocate the meal I bought him when offering a room initially and she just isnt friendly at all in general (comes out only when ive went back in my room, rarley speaks, avoids contact, etc).\n\nThe toilet started backing up in their bathroom initially, they used a plunger and draino which provided temporary relief and allowed it to drain slowly but today my bath tub was full of sewage forcing me to call a plumber. \n\nAm i an asshole for requesting them pay for the plumber?\nAm i an asshole for asking them to to split the rent equally between all 3 adults instead of those two pay 50 percent and I alone pay 50 percent?

      "description": "I have been looking for a dog for about a month. This past weekend I saw a dog that was very friendly and cat safe. He seemed perfect. I was looking to foster a dog from the animal shelter, but they happened to have a sale for $15 dogs for that day only. In the rush of the moment I adopted a dog. \n\nI could see that he was a big dog, but he is morbidly obese so I thought it was mostly fat. When I was filling out the paperwork adopting him the animal shelter volunteer read his medical records and said he is 87 lbs currently but will be 60 lbs at a healthy weight. \n\nI felt like I had made a mistake almost immediately after leaving the shelter. I felt ready for the commitment of a dog, but after getting a dog I’m not so sure. I would like to move to a larger city and I am not sure that an 87 lbs (60 lbs assuming he loses his excess weight) dog will be feasible for apartment shopping in a new city. There is a 30 day return policy at the shelter and I’m torn with what to do now.\n\nWIBTA if I returned the dog to the shelter?\n\nTLDR; Really thought I was ready for a dog -adopted dog from shelter, but now I’m not sure that I am as ready for the life-long responsibility as I thought that I was. WIBTA if I gave the dog back to the shelter? ",

I asked my boyfriend of almost 4 years if he was interested in being roommates with me and he said he would think about it. That was about 3 months ago and he still hasn’t given me an answer. I know I still have time, but I would prefer to know if I should be looking for other roommates. Today I brought this up to my boyfriend saying that he should just make a choice and tell me and it turns out that he has to ask his parents and see what they want him to do. For some reason he keeps putting it off and this sparked a fight between us, I got annoyed and told him just to bring it up with his parents because then I would have an answer, then I got annoyed that he even had to ask his parents because he’s 21 and should be able to make choices for himself. After telling him that I think it’s stupid that he can’t make decisions for himself and that he always has to have his parents permission he got upset with me and left. I feel like I was being honest with him, but I trust the people of reddit to tell me if I was justified to think that or not.",

      "description": "So I am in my university's dinning hall and my friends and I (all female) are eating lunch and this girl sits down up the table from us. All is well until this guy comes up and starts talking her head off but she's just nodding and looks very uncomfortable. \n\nNow let me tell you about this guy. He is known to do this kind of thing all the time in the dining hall. He never talks to you about normal things; his usual topics are hentai, boats, Japanese history, and other unusual things. (Not trying to shame anyone for their hobbies but you don't typically come up to a stranger and start talking about these things) He is also known to come into the dinning hall, pull out his huge ass drawing tablet and draw his own hentai/bronie shit for everyone to see. \n\nOnce I see that this is going to go on until the girl finishes her lunch and leaves, I decide to ask my friends if I should invite her to sit with us. I ask and they say I should. So I look up the table and ask her if I have class with her (trying not to be too obvious and rude to the guy). She says that she's not sure but we might and then I ask her if she wants to come sit with us. She gives me the rudest look and says, \"No, I'm good.\" Then she turns back to the guy and is trying to be engaged in what he's talking about. This continued for probably 15 more minutes until the guy leaves. Once he leaves, she gets up, walks towards us, then looks at me and says, \"Sometimes people just need someone to talk to, you didn't have to be so rude\" and then walked away. I had nothing but good intentions and was just trying to help this girl enjoy her lunch so it kinda hurt when she said that. The more I think about it, the more I think I'm an asshole but AITA?",

      "description": "This Christmas season I(23NB) have been visiting the family home, and so has all my siblings. This year we were a lot of people in a very small space. It has been very stressful for everyone, and I have wanted to help out my fair share around the house and with cooking, but I have not been able to do much at all.\nI suffer from avoidant personality disorder, deep depression, suicidal ideation, and some complex ptsd that is connected to my mom who was present.\n\nIn the little time I've been here I have had several bouts of depressive and suicidal moods, and had non-stop anxiety, resulting in many anxiety- and panic attacks, which I did my best to shield my family from, as to not make them worry about me.\nI did try to make it known to my family that I wasn't doing very well mentally, and couldn't contribute as much as I wanted to, which they seemed to accept.\n\nI felt like a terrible burden all the way through Christmas and new years. Everyone else went all out with amazing cooking and baking and kept the house nice, while I was stuck to my bed or the couch most of the time, debilitatingly miserable for no good reason, doing nothing of value. \nI tried to let everybody know, verbally, how much I appreciated them and their effort, because I really do, and I didn't want them to think I took it for granted.\n\nI tried to not let my feelings and thoughts of uselessness and helplessness get to me though, as I learned in therapy that that kind of thinking rarely helps.\nBut today I was let known that everyone in family felt strongly that I wasn't pulling my weight. My siblings had put in all this effort to make an amazing Christmas, but felt exhausted and unappreciated, and I didn't even offer to help. They had been afraid to call me out on my inactivity or to ask anything of me, as they know that any sort of responsibility can make me feel extremely anxious and upset, because of my many deepseated insecurities.\n\nToday, my mother finally confronted me about it. She insisted I should have been able to do more, but I honestly don't think I was able to. It turned into a nasty fight with no resolution.\n\nI want to let them all know how incredibly shitty I feel about this. I feel like a monster. I wanna die. I wanna run away. I don't want to come back next year to be a burden again. I feel so guilty, even though I know I can't do much better yet.\n\nBut I am afraid that telling them this could end up being manipulative of me, hurt their feelings and force them to not confront me about my flaws in the future either. \nI am also afraid of making any promises I cannot keep about helping out a lot more.\n\nI've considered leaving for my own home early, or going to a hotel, but I can't afford it.\n\nI feel so terrible and I need to know if I really am. Sorry that I write bad.",

So, my friend has this girl he likes who I'll call G (Girl) to keep her identity safe, but my friend liked her, and they went to a Tim Horton's, and the girl, who is my ex-neighbor, invited me to tag along as she thought my friend liked her. So we went and he quickly changed the discussion to dating, I was completely oblivious and answered any questions, comes to the end and I leave, (I had a hockey practice.), I had no clue what happened between them two, but she had a almost definite feeling he liked her. Cut to the next morning us three went to a local pancake shop where we bought a tower plate. (A plate with 25 pancakes), we are all enjoying ourselves, when my friend has to go for two minutes.\n\nHe gets back and we talk for a while about random things, the Habs game, etc. When he tries to bring up dating and romance as a topic for the third time in two days. She gets a little annoyed, seeming he won't get the hint that she doesn't like him. She then exclaimed that she liked me, I thought this was to prove to my friend she doesn't like him, he seems awkward (like anyone would in his position) hurries up his eating and walks out. She then tells me she actually does like me as of what I said the past 3ish days. It's been a week, and he's been calling me an ass, hoping we break up, and wanting \"payback\".  AITA here?",

      "description": "(Obligatory apology for posting on mobile) \nOk, for context, this is not just a normal teacher. I go to a highschool where you have a \"major\" and you take some classes pertaining to that major . All of these classes are taught by the major teacher. So I've had this teacher for 2 classes last semester and 2 this semester. All that to say that I see this teacher a lot. This teacher is supposed to be your mentor.\nRecently, we had a certain state competition for an event in which she was the teacher organizer. The competition went fine, or so I thought. When I came in to class today, I realized that I have my scoresheets from the judges. So I asked her to see them and she refused.\nWhen I asked why I couldn't see them, she said that she needed to go over them with me. This teacher then proceedes to pull me in her office (in the middle of class) and \"go over them with me\". That consisted of her pointing out every point I got off and how bad I must have done to get that score (she was not there to see me perform). I asked her multiple times throughout this \"interaction\" to have a moment by myself with the scoresheets.\nThis was my first time seeing the scoresheets. I was extremely upset about how the judges scored me. The hardwork I put in was not enough to do well. And while I was feeling this, she proceeded to nit pick through the comments on the sheet. \nShe reached a particular comment on one of the sheets that said \"[I] seemed angry\" and this teacher digs hard into that comment saying things like \"what went on in that room? You're representing this school and me, how could you seem angry!?\" When in the performance (it was a speech) I thought I was passionate. \nI snapped and told her something like, \"you don't know what it was like. You (the teacher) didn't give a shit about my speech until the day of the competition\" and then stormed out of the office and went to my next block. \nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "A friend of mine is terrible with money. In the worst way. To put it simply, he, while jobless and getting money from his grandmothers inheritance, spent 1,000 dollars on a gorilla because \"Harambe\". Thats well and good, I could give a shit what he decides to blow money on when it doesn't effect me. We're a tight group of friends, its me, him and another guy. The other guy is having a birthday this weekend. I let everyone know we should go to a bar at happy hour and get some drinks since he's turning 21. Bad money friend says nah he won't be doing that and he'll just get him a gift. I ask why, he's not someone who hates bars or alcohol. He says because he can't afford it. Fair enough, 20 minutes later he starts asking us what the best color is for a Nintendo switch joy cons are and what games he should get for one. I'm confused and ask him if he's buying one, he says he is. I then remind him that he is being laid off from his seasonal job this weekend and spending 360 dollars out of his 400\\~ paycheck is, frankly, retarded. He doesn't care. I tell him ask him if he really thinks spending that much money on himself is more important then spending 20-30 bucks on a night out for our friends birthday is the best idea, and also if it isn't bad financial sense. He says he knows its bad financial sense. We call each other a few names and now we're fuming. If he wants to blow all of his money and having nothing with no job, fair enough. But the fact that he's blowing it on a game console when he has both a high end computer and PS4 and Xbox1 and decides thats a better idea then 30 bucks on our friends 21st birthday is fucking unreal to me. Honestly put me in my place if I'm the asshole for telling him off.",

      "description": "tl;dr: Waitress spilt coffee all over me and drenched all of my shirt at a work brunch. I have anger management problems but did my best staying calm - so all I did was vent to my coworkers about it while the waitress was gone. I told a full-timer I expected compensation of some sort for her actions since I shouldn't have to deal with a ruined shirt. The full timer dry cleaned it herself with her money and brought it to me later. My boss said she was embarrassed. This was 2 weeks before my internship at Google ended and I had no time to redeem myself - so I did not get the full time job offer.\n\nThis summer I had the pleasure of being an intern with Google for their business side, I did customer experience for Google Ads. On a Saturday we had an optional event where we went to brunch. I was sitting in the middle of the table - it was split with interns on one side, and full timers on the other. I sat next to my boss as well. Everything was going great, we were all talking and what not. Next thing you know, the waitress bumps into me (I am sitting down the whole time, so I wasn’t at fault here at all) and she spills cold coffee all over the back of my white t-shirt. The whole back of it was drenched. She did apologize for the mistake and tried to go get towels.\n\nWhen she leaves to get towels, my intern group is laughing at me since they thought it was funny. Well for background, I am sensitive and get booty hurt easily. So I was visibly upset. When the waitress left to get towels, they asked why I was upset. I let them know and they asked what I expected her to do since it was an accident. I told them that I expected there to be consequences for her actions because my white Nike t-shirt that costs like $40 will now be stained. I said she should make it up to me somehow by reimbursing for dry cleaning. She came back and gave me the towels and it was not enough - I asked if she had any souvenir shirts that they sell that I can have to wear since drying the shirt wasn’t feasible.\n\nAs she did this, one of the full timers pulled me aside and we walked to the side of the restaurant and talked. She said I wasn’t being “googley” enough and that I wasn’t representing Google properly. I told her that I have anger management problems and that I was doing my best at keeping my cool. I told her that by venting to the interns (while she was away) was my outlet to making me feel better. I told her that I wanted my shirt dry cleaned. This full timer said to just keep quiet and she will take care of it. She ended up taking my shirt later that day and brought it to me the next week.\n\nFast forward and my boss told me at our weekly 1:1 meeting that she was embarrassed about it and that I should apologize to the group and full timers for acting like that. This was 2 weeks before the internship ended, so there was no time to redeem myself. I ended up not getting the job offer. I know this is what mainly caused it because I hit all my performance metrics and was the 2nd best on the team in terms of job performance. But since it's Google, they look mainly for \"Googleyness\" which means they look for good people and aren't so worried about performance.\n\nSo… Am I the asshole for acting like this? I do have anger management problems and honestly this was the best in this scenario. I was so upset, but I never once showed it to the waitress. I was never loud about it, just venting to the team. Was it reasonable to want my shirt dry cleaned? Why should I have to suck it up and lose money? I never paid for the brunch, Google did, so there would be no compensation there either.",

      "description": "AITA for not renting out my apartment to single moms with a kid because it is too small?\n\nI have recently put up my own 1 bedroom apartment for rent in a bigger European city and have been reading through various application. A few of these answers comes from single mothers that have a young child that wishes to rent my apartment. Personally, I feel like my apartment is way to small to have a family living in it, even if the family only consist of a mother and a child. I have kids myself and I cannot see how they would be able to fit their whole life in my apartment. So I reply to them, that I cannot in my good concious have a small family as tenants since I think the apartment is too small, but I wish them all the best. \n\nThese replies have been the reason for my gf arguing that I am an A-hole. She thinks that I should not presume that I know what is a right size apartment for the smaller families. She actually thinks if I don't want to rent out to a small family because there is higher risk of wear and tear and even damage to the apartment, that is my decision. But she really dislikes the way I decline  them, she thinks it sounds like I'm deciding for them what size of apartment their child should or should not live in. She says is better to be polite and lie to them about the reason they will not get the apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA quick, but important, note, my apartment is only 35 m^(2) and there is one small bedroom with a joint living-/kitchen room in the central part of the city.

Anyway, the other day I was walking downstairs and my mom was talking to me, and was telling me how the maid is her good friend. So I jokingly said to my mom, “she only likes you because you pay her.” Obviously, I insulted my mom, cause we always joke around, nothing against the maid. Anyway today she was cleaning, and my mom brought up how that hurt her the maid’s feelings. I quickly apologized and cleared the air, as I didn’t mean no harm, but I’m just really confused, as I didn’t even joke about her, only my mom. Am I the asshole? I never been this dumbfounded before.

      "title": "AITA: for wanting to change my legal name (Long-ish)",
      "description": "ok so TLDR: I want to change my name but my parents aren't supportive of the decision since they said they chose it 7 years before I was born. I am trans but I haven't told them cause when i try to they clearly show they are not supportive. Quoting my mum \"if I find a binder in your room I will cut it up and burn it.\" So should i change my name? i am legally allowed to change it next year since I am turning 18.\n\nOk now for the longer story since we got the most important details up:\nI am trans FtM (female-to-male) and found out about it when i was 12-13ish this was when I got a better search on the internet and found alot of people who felt the same as me (eg. body didn't feel right and they felt like they weren't supposed to have a 'chest' or 'lady parts. *sorry it makes me a little uncomfortable to say*)\nAnyways like I said in the TLDR my parents are not supportive and especially not my mum. in case you didn't read the TLDR the way i can tell she's not supportive is from a direct quote from her \"If I find a binder in your room I'm going to cut it up and burn it,\" so as you can see pretty clear answer there.\nAnyways some back ground but you can skip to the '**' for the more important stuff:\nBoth of them have said to me that they don't think I'm trans simply because i liked 'girly' things when I was younger. But really what does a 3 or 6 year old know about gender. As far as I was aware when I was younger I played with toys, did my school work and played in the team I was supposed to. I got along with both boys and girls fine and while I played with dolls and occasionally wore dresses, I also played in the rain, loved soccer and swimming, and I loved to be loud and roudy. Both obviously seem very driven towards boy activities and girl activities however to me when I was younger I just did what made me happy. I am a very artsy person so obvious I love colours and I especially love pastel due to the soft, cartoony styles that I think match it so well. I love cats and birds and I love cosplaying. However I also love swimming and working with wood and other carpentry, I don't mind getting dirty and just from task to task keeping myself active. Even now I love both sterotypically male and female things but their are reasons why I am a boy.\n1. Female isn't the image I have in my head:\nEveryone has an image of what they want to be now and in the future. For me however that future involves a more masculine body. My chest makes me very uncomfortable both physically and mentally and has impacted my self-esteem alot since it's rather hard to hide. I have a very soft jaw-line which is also a problem for me since it makes me appear very feminine and that's what alot of people look at first when assessing gender of a stranger, my face isn't very gender neutral so yeah. And my hips have started to become alot bigger of a problem than the other 2 since I even have problems with how I walk. My hips are naturally wider since I am born female but this also means that I have a natural sway in my walk. This makes me very uncomfortable since it means that I naturally walk like a girl. \n2. I hate girls uniforms:\nI am 16 so even though i am 1 1/2 years away from me being an adult (B'day in Sept) I still have to go to school like most other children. This means of course that since I have to put my legal gender down on my forms and documents I also have to wear the girls' uniform. This is usually a problem at alot of school but at the one I attend now until I graduate luckily, they have female pants. However this is still a problem. Pants made for females and males are obviously different from leg structure, to hip width, to the style that flatters the widest ranges of women. This usually means accentuating the hips and waist. Both of which are already defined when I wear normal clothes and even more defined when I wear the school uniform. My school is completely supportive of me and has emailed the teachers to ask them to use my preferred name and pro-nouns which I find absolutely amazing since my previous school was a very religious christian school. \n**\nAnyways so back to the story, I'm not completely heartless and won't force my parents to just immediately start using my preferred name since they are my parents and I understand that my original name was important to them and I have even tried to comprimise with them saying,\n\"I'm happy to keep the name as a middle name so it's still in official documents and you can still call me *Original Name*\"\n\"I wouldn't mind having 2 first names where the one I prefer can be used by colleagues and friends while you still call me *O/N*\"\nI have even said they can call me by my O/N for the rest of my life since they are my parents and I understand how important it is to them.\nThey however have not been as understanding:\nI had a chat to my mum about changing my name and she said that she was upset and offended that I wanted to change my name since they chose it 7 years before I was born and I was named after one of my aunts. Now I understand that this is a personal issue for them, I am their only 'daughter' and from their perspective it seems as though I am taking that away from them for no reason. However I also have other issues for wanting to change it (eg. I causes me unnecessary anxiety because of the sever bullying I got when I was younger it has caused me to become panicky due to people calling my name certain ways since that was how the bullies called it). So when I tried to explain this to them, they said they were offended and were implying I was selfish by telling I should watch some videos on compassion to 'understand them'. That may not be what they implied but it was how I perceived it.\nAnyways just some things for you guys to know as important counters:\n1. My parents do not abuse me. They have never hit me and bad words only really come out in the heat of an argument.\n2. I have Asperger's so I don't deal very well with complex emotions which is why I am asking here since I'm not completely sure however, I do not think I'm an asshole but I could kinda see how someone might see me as one...kinda.\n3. My parents are not religious and are accepting of the fact that I like girls (kinda with my mum she still prefers I date boys). \nAnd 4. Unless I see a really convincing argument what I will be doing next year is moving my old name to a middle name and using the name I prefer as the legal name. I will also be changing my gender on my birth certificate. However I will allow my parents to call me by my 'old name' as long as they want and will allow them to use she/her pro-nouns around friends and family.\nI believe this is an acceptable compromise, and I will as so be booking an appointment sometime in the future to get officially diagnosed.\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have had an on and off relationship with a girl I knew since I was a sophomore in high school. She’s quirky, and has a really high sex drive ever since I knew her. We had a few sexual encounters before in high school, but nothing out of the ordinary and it was always with protection.\n\nWe went to different colleges and drifted apart, only for her to chat me up in my second semester of college. We talked a lot, and said she had no place to stay for the night. I offered to let her have my bed in my dorm since my roommate was out for the weekend. One round of drinking later, we ended up having sex. But in the middle of the night we did it again, and I didn’t have another condom, so we just did it without one, and nothing bad happened.\n\nAbout 2 years later, after having broke up again, we saw each other and decided to try dating again, mostly because she told me she had matured and just wanted something stable, after a pretty nasty engagement on her side. We got somewhat sexual quickly, but didn’t actually do anything up until she invited me over to her folks place so she could cook me dinner.\n\nAfter dinner, she drank some wine, but because I knew, or at least thought, I was just going back home later, I didn’t have any. She kept insisting I have some and stay the night, but I had school really early, and repetitively said no, to her frustrations, but the night was still nice... except for her telling me that her previous fiancé had sex with questionable women before her, and didn’t know how safe it was.\n\nAfter making out, we started to undress... and then realized I forgot my condoms in my car. I told her I could go back and get them, but she told me that might wake her parents, and that we should just do it without one, to which I said no. This was mostly because of all the talk of her fiancé having unprotected sex with her and the questionable women of his past, kinda making me paranoid. Didn’t help the house was old, and that I just generally like to play it safe when I’m sober. \n\nShe reminded me that we had done it with no protection before, and that there was nothing different now, that she should trust her judgement. In response, I just apologized and said I don’t think I should, to which she got dejected and the night ended with me going home. 2 days later she said she no longer wanted to talk to me.\n\nThis all happened around a month ago with no talking since. \n\nAt first I was sure I wasn’t being the asshole... but in recent speculation, maybe I should have trusted her judgement, avoided the fight, and kept going.\n\nAITA? I’m severely doubting my own judgement now ",

He also lives right across from the house we meet at before we go. \n\nHow it usually goes is we ( including J) agree on a time. Say 7. We all go to one persons house and chill for a while. Eventually, we go to the bar. However, J is never there at 7. We try to text or call but J never answers. So after a while we just go to the bar without him. Usually we get back around 11. J then shows up, ready to go to the bar and is dissapointed that we already went. He also doesnt really make any excuse, and often wont acknowledge he was late unless we mention it. We have tried discussing this, but it doesnt change.\n\nTLDR: My group will go to the bar without one of our friends because he is consistantly several hours late and doesnt answer and calls or texts asking where he is.",

      "description": "Get home late one night with my SO from a party to find a stranger lying on the road outside our house with a couple of passersby stood over him. Went to investigate as I work I'm a doctor and I have an ethical obligation to help and there is a guy who is obviously intoxicated lying down trying to have a sleep with a couple of women who saw him whilst driving past on the phone for an ambulance. I try to ascertain what has happened but neither of the women know much about it so I do a quick assessment of this guy. Turns out he has taken an overdose along with a significant amount of alcohol and actively wants to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to get a bit more information from him but the whole time during this evening my SO is sat next to him on the floor trying to get him to open up about the stress and bereavement in his life that has led him to this suicide attempt. I tell the passersby they aren't needed and they look relieved to be leaving and I also tell my SO that I don't think they needs to wait outside in the cold for an ambulance, they wants to stay outside though and are sat on the floor half hugging the drunk guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The whole time as I am trying to get more information about this guy (such as previous health conditions, previous psychiatric conditions, more information about the attempted suicide etc) his attention is distracted by my wife asking him about his family and grandchildren etc. After the event my SO tells me they think I was a jerk to the patient for not showing more empathy. When the paramedic arrives I give him the rundown and my SO contributes some of the social background. I felt annoyed as I was being very professional and my SO was being incredibly sympathetic but just in the wrong time &amp; place (ie not when someone needs acute medical treatment) and not listening to my feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being annoyed that my SO kind of interrupted my flow as a good samaritan making it harder for me to do a good job of assessment?",

      "title": "AITA for seeking closure with a 'friend' who believes I tried to manipulate him?",
      "description": "I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \n\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \n\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\n\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\n\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \n\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\n\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\n\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \n\nThanks in advance.",

      "description": "To;dr - I made my husband throw away pictures of him and his ex girlfriend. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 4 years now. We have two beautiful boys aged 3 and 2. I was 6 months pregnant when we got married because our first son was a complete accident. For the most part we’re very happy. He’s affectionate, honest, and helpful around the house even though I’m a stay at home mom. \n\nBefore we were married he dated his high school sweetheart for 4 years. The only reason they stopped dating is because he joined the military and got stationed to the other side of the US and she was going to a nursing school and couldn’t leave to be with him. I’ve always wondered what would have happened if we hadn’t gotten pregnant. If we would have still been married. \n\nThey remained friends well into our relationship to the point that when he went to a 10 week school on a base near his hometown he went to visit her. Nothing happened and I trust him completely on that, however I was in my 2nd trimester at the time. We weren’t married yet, but he had already bought a ring. She told him after that that they shouldn’t talk anymore because it was too difficult for her to move on. Since then they haven’t talked at all. \n\nRecently his parents moved about 5 hours away from us and we’re finally able to give my husband his personal things that he had to leave behind when he joined the military. In it was a huge box of pictures of her, some nudes and lingerie, and all of the letters that she sent to him while he was in basic training. Not going to lie, it hurt seeing all of that because of my anxiety over the beginning of our relationship and having to start with a baby and work up to love.\n\nI told him I didn’t care about the trinkets she gave him. In fact we still have some decorations up in our house that she gave him. I don’t care about the letters. They’re part of his history. But I do care about the pictures and nudes. I don’t want our boys to go through his boxes one day and find nudes of their dad and some other girl. \n\nI asked him to get rid of them. He got really mad at me and when I persisted he threw away the entire box in his anger saying I wanted to make him forget about his past. We’re so happy otherwise and this is really the only huge fight we’ve had in all four years of marriage. \n\nAm I in the wrong for not wanting him to keep pictures of his ex girlfriend? Or am I really just jealous and insecure in our relationship? ",

      "description": "This just happened. Also I don’t apologize for the formatting because half of us are on mobile and I think we can all agree as long as you can tell a story, it doesn’t matter ;) \n\nI work at a Canadian skateboard clothing company. We have started to become very popular with kids ranging from 7-16 years old. This of course means I deal with A LOT of parents, especially mothers.\n\nIt’s a pretty common rule in clothing retail places that only one person is permitted in the change room. We obviously bend the rules for those under the age of 7 of people who may have a disability that would require them to have assistance. \n\nNow these rules are posted in the change rooms themselves and on the wall right before you walk in. I set the kid up in the change room and go to help other customers. After about 5 minutes I notice the mother is nowhere to be seen so I go check the change room areas. She is in the change room.\n\nI politely say “I’m very sorry miss but we only allow one person per change room unless they are under the age of 7”\nBefore I could even say that if he needed assistance she would be able to stay there as long as she didn’t mind stepping out with her bags and items from other stores, she starts going  “EXCUSE ME? What kind of rule is this? IVE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE! CANT YOU SEE THAT MY SON NEEDS HELP TYING HIS PANTS AND HE NEEDS ADVICE IF THINGS LOOK GOOD”\n\nI again in a polite tone explain to her that this isn’t a rule I make up but that lost prevention has asked all their stores to follow.  I told her that if her son needed some help tying his pants her could step out and ask for her to help him. She tried to yell at me saying I’m embarrassing her son in front of all these people (keep in mind, she is yelling while I’m just standing there straight faced” \n\nShe of course calls me rude and “bitchy”, goes up to my coworker to complain and he explains that I’m the manager and yes that is our rule and has been from day 1. This just upsets her more and she grabs her sons arm and drags him to the entrance and rushes off, but not before calling me an asshole. \n\nThankfully my coworker and I got a good laugh out of this but after these issues happen I always wonder if I was being an asshole in the beginning. I know the customer is “always right” but should I have just let her do her thing? \n\nThanks :) \n\n",

      "description": "We are living with our inlaws for a couple months while we square away stuff with purchasing a house. My husband and his mom are fire and gasoline and just the smallest thing gets them arguing. It makes situations incredibly tense and awkward and I'm counting the days till we close on the house. \n\n\nToday, they got into it again about 5 hours ago. I get home from work about 1 hour ago and start working on a project. A half an hour or so later, he comes back from the gym and after 15 minutes or so says to me \"I need to you to upstairs and get me a banana, shes not mad at you.\" (We occupy the lower portion, the kitchen is upstairs). I explained to him that this keeps happening and it puts me in a weird position and it's getting hard having to constantly do this. He then went and got the banana and is now fuming in the other room. \n\n\nThis is a 1-3 times a week thing where I have to get stuff for him because his mom and him got into a fight. I'm his wife, not his intern. I would like them to eventually act like grownups and not fight like 2 crazy roosters all the time but that's next to impossible. Being put in the middle is driving me nuts. Am I being selfish here? Should i do this for him because it's a nice thing to do, or is this too much? ",

      "description": "So a little background. \nHusband and I are in our 30s. 3 kids. high school sweethearts. Our relationship has its ups and downs but overall I cant complain. \n\nSo about 8 years ago I found out hubby had an affair for 2 years. i suspected something was going on but decided to not investigate further because I was pregnant and didnt want the stress. when that baby was a year old by chance I found incriminating texts and confronted him. it was a shitstorm as you can imagine but we worked through it and had another baby. \n\nthe last 6 months have been a little off between us. Money is tight. He got a promotion so more work is brought home. We're on the market for a house. plus 3 kids etc. \nSometime mid January on a Friday he came home saying his back was killing him and he couldn't shake it. Saturday morning it was much worse, however that night he mumbles that hes going out with his boys. I thought was weird bc hey dude your back is killing you stay home! he comes home 11:30 that night still in pain. Sunday he takes an ibuprofen and slept most of the day. He gets a text on his phone. Number isn't saved and is not familiar to me. the text read something like \"hey thanks for hanging out. Thanks for motivating me etc\" I memorized the number and went on full detective mode, found all types of info on this girl. He went out with her again mid February he told me he was hanging out w his boys. he went out around 6pm ish and didnt get home till 5:30am. through gps and knowing the info on this girl he spent 10-5am at her apt. \nI confronted him, went crazy and started hitting him (yeah I know, dont hit people) and in short he tells me shes just a good friend. hes known her for about 8 years and never told me about her because his past cheating and he didnt want me to feel weird about it. My thing is we talk about everything else. He'll tell me about some girl that used to work at his office came by and she lost a lot of weight for her wedding... but why dont you mention your really good friend?! He tells me I'm insecure, I should trust him and that he is entitled to his own life and just because were married doesnt mean i need to know everything. So AITA here? \n\ntl;dr. past infidelity, spouse has a good friend I never knew about. ",

And i might have also forgotten if i was told in person or over the phone, but I've checked my text messages and there's no mention of anything on there.\n\nIn response to this and after consultation with my flatmates, I've decided i will not be having my weekly telephone call with my mother this evening.\n\nSo AITA for getting annoyed at (probably) not being invited to a family event even though I wouldn't have gone and as such ghosting my mother?",

      "description": "My mom called me, she said my grandmother, who's in her eighties, has had a major stroke and is hospitalized. The doctor told her my grandmother probably only has few days left to live. She's conscious but a bit incoherent, and apparently asked if she could see me because I was her first grandchild and that has always meant a lot to her. I also knew this would mean the world to my mom.\n\n\nMy initial gut reaction was that I feel really uncomfortable for being put on a spot like that, and I need to process all the feelings this brought up, so I told my mom I need to think about it before committing to the trip. I spent several hours trying to think if I even have a choice here or am I just complete asshole for saying \"no\", and what would saying \"no\" do to my mom who very much would have loved for me to visit my grandmother.\n\nIn the end I decided not to visit her, and she did pass away after few days.\n\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nMy family, my extended family, everyone I was related to, were all super religious and it affected absolutely everything when growing up. I lost my faith early and rebelled hard against having to participate despite no longer believing. That earned me frequent physical discipline but it only hardened my non-believing ways, I couldn't wait to grow up and make decisions for my self.\n\nWhen I finally did grow up and earned my freedom, I cut almost all ties to my relatives. I would still sometimes show up for events for the few people I felt close to and involuntarily meet a lot of the people I did not wish to have relations with, because everyone would always show up for weddings and such. And I would act cordial and put on a fake smile, knowing I'd only have to endure their presence as long as I chose to. Anything to do with religion would always make me sick, bring back bad memories and I would just leave.\n\n\nAnd that's what drove me to my decision not to see my grandmother on her death bed despite her request. I had not seen my grandmother in decades and we had grown apart, and despite the love I still feel for my mom I was done pretending, I would not put on a fake smile and listen to my grandmother talk about God. I could not even think what I would do if she wanted to talk about God's mercy, or bless me, or ask me to pray with her. So I decided it would be better to not go, than go and potentially cause a scene.",

      "description": "Some context to this is that I’m not quite top of the class but I’m probably one of the smartest females in my year at school. \n\nIn chemistry I got really annoyed at myself for not getting my target grade in an end of topic test in like October. I had never gotten lower than that before in chemistry and it made me really upset because I had revised a lot and I didn’t manage to get to my potential because I knew the mark that lost me the grade was the most stupid mistake ever. I tried my best not to get upset but I couldn’t help it. I also performed quite badly on my history test, getting two grades below what my target was for even more stupid mistakes. I get 8/32 in my french test and I’m bummed out because I’m literally fluent in french.\n\nMy friend told me that because I was getting kind of upset over what I’m getting they think just because I’ve done badly that I reckon they’ve done badly too. I spoke to someone else about this too because I think it’s stupid to try and compare to someone who isn’t yourself because that mindset made me very egotistical and also quite miserable. She’s basically saying that I can’t be upset even though I literally cannot help it sometimes.\n\nTwo months later, to now, my luck slightly turns around and my grades are picking up. I’m finally out of my small slump and it feels great because I know I’m getting my potential now. I get 1 mark of full marks in both my chemistry and geography tests. My grades in french are also improving. I get 100% in my citizenship studies test, I get top of the year in physics and history; I’m fucking proud of myself. I should be allowed to do that, right? \n\nI had a friend confront me about this again. I made this post on my instagram stories about how I was really proud of myself for working hard but at the end of the day I still need to learn that my grades aren’t everything. She said this post made her feel and others really bad about themselves. She said that because they think they’ve done well and they look at me being glad I’ve done well they think that well “Thiz wouldn’t think I’ve done well” even though I don’t compare others to myself. \n\nI really don’t know if I’ve being an arsehole about this or not. I genuinely think I haven’t really done that much wrong but if I’m upsetting people then surely I am?\n",

      "description": "So me and my friend group is pretty large, but close knit. It's a odd group, it's mostly odd misfits just kind of mashed together, but we are generally all very close, think of it like an old western gang, that all stick together, through everything, despite everyone being from radically different walks of life, and such. \n\nThis guy, A, is one of the senior members I suppose. He's known a few of the more prominent folks since they were kids. I only met him last summer, since I basically made my way into the group in the last 8 months or so. Despite that, I can probably say that I'm a big part of the group now. I'm one of the people that is basically up for whatever, and as such I've gotten to know people fairly well. \n\nA, however, comes and goes as he pleases. This is fine, lots of people do this, but he seems to think he has this huge amount of authority in the group. Like, if there's a problem between two people, he's the one that goes and fixes (not) things, wether he knows the people or even the first thing about the situation. He basically inserts himself in whatever happens, without asking, and sort of hangs on until you ignore him, like even deep seated family shit.\n\nHe also has no sense of what's socially appropriate. Once, he randomly sat down with me and the girl I was seeing at the time, and basically sort of nagged his way into helping me and her with her essay, despite her never even having even met this guy before.\n\nAlso, he's a HUGE leech, he basically refuses to clean up when hanging out, and refuses to leave if you let him stay over.\n\nThe last straw was this week, when he apparently decided he wanted to become a shaman. All of the sudden everyone's FB walls were filled with shaman nature shit, and videos of him doing \"shaman rituals\". This is nothing new, last month he was apparently a pagan, and spammed pagan shit, despite knowing that there are legitimate pagans in our group. We ended up gathered and just ripping on that shaman shit, and we got to discussing other things about him, and his behavior, which is interesting but not really interested in sharing here. AWTA?\n\nTL;DR - A friend recently became a shaman or whatever, me and my friends got to talking about him in general after having a laugh about the shaman stuff. Turns out we all think he's creepy, a huge leech, and we all made sort of a group decision to stop associating with him en masse. Am I, and my friends the assholes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok. So I recently broke ties with my boyfriend of a couple months because I didn't like his body type. \n\nWe were together for about three months, and on a whim (he was probably a little tipsy, honestly) he sent a naked photo of himself. If I'm being honest, I didn't really like what I saw. I knew he was a overweight, but he was just a little too overweight for me to consider attractive. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't expect men to be in top-tape shape with six-packs and all that jazz (I actually prefer guys with a little meat on their bones. Better to cuddle with \\^\\_\\^),  but he was just out of that range I considered attractive. \n\nHe also had a wonderful personality, and we clicked very well together due to our similar senses of humour and interests. He liked a lot of WoW and manga, as well as DnD and MTG. We were both giant nerds, and I loved that part of him. I felt like I could truly say anything to him. That being said, I'm not a perfect person, and I don't expect my partners to be either, but I just didn't like how he looked. \n\nI thought about encouraging him to lose weight, and stayed with him to see if it played out right. I didn't do that for a couple reasons. For one, I felt if I did, I'd be leading him on, and I would hate to do that to someone. It's possibly one of the worst things you *can* do to someone. And secondly, I felt I wouldn't be able to \"fake\" attraction to him. I loved him as buddy and a wonderful friend, but I would not consider him a sexual partner, as he considered me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My mom basically wants me to be her best friend. She tells me all of her most intimate thoughts and feelings. She wants me to do the same, and if I don’t volunteer, she will ask again and again. If that doesn’t work, she’ll overshare and then guilt trip me into levelling with her. At least that’s what it feels like – but I can’t actually know that she’s consciously being that manipulative. Maybe she's just desperate to be close to me.\n\nI have gotten better at setting up boundaries for myself, even if it is stressful to enforce them. I sometimes slip up because I’m tired, and it makes me feel more naked than being without clothes ever has. But even when I make her stay clear of that, it takes emotional effort to talk to her. She’s a very negative person. Her two subjects for conversation are complaining about mundane stuff, and shit talking other people. I have pointed out many times that I don't like this, especially the badmouthing, but she seems unable to come up with anything else. Of course I try to provide subjects, but if I get into my own stuff she starts with the prying again.\n\nShe gives me a break from time to time, but for long periods she will call me incessantly – sometimes multiple times a day. If I don’t respond for a few days, she’ll lament to other family members that she’s worried I must be having a depressive episode (which I had in my teenage years, but I’m not unstable enough for anyone else to overthink my behaviour in this way). Then my family members text me and say I need to give her a call, because she’s feeling rejected and I’m making her worried.\n\nWhat I would really like is to have an amicable, but less intimate relationship with her. I would love to come visit my parents for dinner perhaps once a month, just updating each other on our lives and discuss some interesting topics. Is that unusually distant? Do I need to accept that this emotional labour is my job as her daughter? She has few friends she feels close to. She’s still married to my father though, so she’s not completely alone. She also has my brother, but for some reason she’s not that obsessed with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I feel guilty for keeping her at the distance I already do, refusing to confide in her and to be her confidante to the degree she wants. AITA about that?\n\n2) AITA If I reduce contact with her? Bear in mind, reducing contact would mean blatantly ignoring her (and my family's requests to call her), because she ignores my expressed wishes to talk less frequently. She makes a sad voice and says she's just so hungry for contact. The more I answer her, the more she calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA if I insist on a level of closeness that I would prefer, even if it hurts my mother? She’s not abusive, but has boundary issues and fills my head with negativity.",

      "description": "Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called “Jan”. I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I’m a tall and lanky guy at 6’1 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.\n\n\nRecently, we had a watch party at Jan’s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said “I sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.” \n\nJan has a huge man crush on Dylan and didn’t appreciate that I called him skinny. \n\nThis caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying “what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you’re literally built of twigs?” “You would die playing football. Tbh I don’t think you could even lift a helmet!” \n\nAt first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.\n\n“Look at you, you’re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials”  (I’m brown but not African)\n“That’s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished”\n\nShe kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn’t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.\n\nHer: “Go lift some weights. It’s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.”\n\nMe: “If you could tell me what your current diet is, I’m sure I’ll put on weight in no time.”\n\n*silence*\n\nHer: “What are you trying to say?”\n\nMe: “I’m saying that if I’m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I’m pretty certain you wouldn’t win.\n\nHer: No wonder [ex] didn’t want you. Go fuck yourself.\n\nMe: And no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.\n\nAt this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.\n\nSince this was at Jan’s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of friends who is Jan’s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn’t feel that way and I don’t want to apologize.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n\n\n\n",

First of all, she says that she isn’t a smoker even tho every single time she sees family (1-3 times a week) she repeatedly asks to bum a few off of them while nervous-laughing and saying she *never* smokes, she also gives my husband endless shit for the fact that he vapes (nicotine free) a few times a month. She also got pissed when my brother started vaping because ‘it’s so unhealthy’.\n\nBut the thing that pisses me off the most is that she has health issues that involve her lungs and she actually has to use an inhaler and does breathing treatments. I also have health issues and she loses her goddamn mind if I do anything she thinks is bad for me (she’s an antivaxxer who thinks essential oils can cure cancer....I’m only slightly exaggerating) which includes taking my prescription medications, but god forbid I even hint that smoking isn’t a good idea for her. It’s her life and her choice but when she does it right in front of me and then wants my approval it pisses me off. \n\nSo, AITA for getting pissed every time she wants me to smile and tell her it’s ok for her to keep smoking?\n\n",

      "description": "Before school started, I was playing Egyptian Rat Screw with a friend of my sister. (We’re pretty much friends because I roll with Sis’ group) Friend was trash talking everyone about her skills with the game the day before. Anyways, it’s a popular game with lots of different names and rule variations. I brought my deck and we got down to business. Anytime I missed a slap, she calls me slow. So I start calling her slow back. Eventually, I have a thin deck with lots of doubles (if 2 cards of the same number are played consecutively, you can slap the pile and take it.) and I start counting. I end up winning, she gets MEGA salty. Yelling at me for cheating, rigging the deck, anything she can think of. Fin.\nI’m like 90 percent sure this is an NTA, but I wanted to ask.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I turn my ex in for not paying child support?",
      "description": "My ex doesn’t pay her child support. She can afford to, she just doesn’t. She has monthly contempt hearings where she claims she’s disabled and works limited hours. She convinced her doctor too so the court’s hands are tied. She also has a fraudulent claim open with SSI. \n\nShe works for herself and her clients pay cash under the table. She leased space at my business last year and used my front desk staff for scheduling, so I have proof she’s lying. I’m considering taking it to the prosecutor. He’s a friend of a friend; if I tell him what I know he can subpoena my business records so it won’t look vindictive on my part. \n\nReasons to turn her in:\n\n1. She was abusive when we were together and has been even more abusive since I terminated her contract with my business due to her poor behavior. \n\n2. She extorted $8,000 from me and made false claims to an agency that oversees my business, resulting in thousands of dollars in attorney fees to defend myself. \n\n3. She took our dog (he’s legally hers, but I helped raise him and can provide a much better home) and jerks me around when I want to see him. I want him back. She’s not feeding him right, she gives him marijuana, he’s skinny and malnourished and I’m worried for him. \n\n4. She’s committing fraud by not paying her taxes and if her SSI claim goes through she’ll be stealing directly from all of us. As someone who pays a lot in taxes each year, this pisses me off. \n\nReasons I’m hesitating:\n\n1. My motives aren’t pure. I’m angry and seeking revenge and that really isn’t my style nor a good reason to do it. \n\n2. The child support judgment was unfair. She was a stay at home mom with no income. Her ex controlled the money so he got an attorney, she didn’t so they destroyed her in court. She’s been hiding from the system since. \n\n3. The money won’t help her child. Her ex makes twice her income. The last time the court seized her money, he spent it on a cruise. \n\n4. She’s talked about not wanting to be alive. The court will likely take everything she owns (which isn’t much tbh) and put her in jail for awhile. With nothing left to lose I’m afraid it will push her over the edge and I don’t want that on my conscience. \n\n5. She’s planning to move out of state soon. If I turn her in, she’ll be stuck here longer. \n\nMy staff can’t stand her, they’ve all had to deal with her shenanigans and are encouraging me to turn her in. She’s still playing games with us, harassing us with fake social media accounts and so on. \n\nI’m really torn and I’ve been agonizing over this for months. Mostly I just want the dog back before he dies in her “care” and I feel like she’ll have little choice but to sell him to me when this all comes down. She’ll be hard up for money and I’m the only person she knows who has any. She’s said she would sell him to me on many occasions but always backs out with some lame excuse; she’s clearly using my love for him to manipulate me. ",

      "title": "AITA for using my kitchen in the morning?",
      "description": "I’ve lived with two roommates for 2.5 years. Aside from them not helping with housekeeping, things have been generally fine. Until this morning. The beef is between me and my roommate who I’ll call Ada.  \n  \nI am a full time law student, and my schedule makes it impossible for me to hold down a part time job. I live on loans, and a monthly gift card to a grocery store from my parents. The cost of living in my city is absurd, so I don’t have much, if any, room in my budget for luxuries like going out for a beer or ordering pizza every so often. Since I really love to bake, and I can get ingredients in bulk for cheap, I started a side hustle selling baked goods. Business isn’t exactly booming, but I get enough cash to let me enjoy my some little things every now and then.  \n  \nLast night I got an order for a batch of cupcakes. My policy is to take any order I get, as long as I don’t have another one that I’m making, since if I say no I likely lose that customer forever. I can crank out a batch in an hour, but my partner and I had plans last night so I decided that instead of staying up late I’d just get up a little early and take care of it then.  \n  \nSo at 6:30 I got up and started doing prep work. Pulling out bowls, measuring out ingredients, warming butter, etc. Everything I use, except my mixer, is lexan or silicone, so it’s not noisy. At 7:00, I started putting everything together and turned on my mixer, which is kind of annoying but on low speeds it’s pretty quiet. I also cover my mixer with a towel, to keep dry ingredients from splashing out, which helps muffle the noise.  \n  \nAt 7:40, Ada bursts out of her room demanding to know what’s wrong with me, reminds me that I live with other people, and complains that it’s ridiculous that I’m doing this when she already has to suffer through “falling asleep to gunshots” every night. Pretty sure that is referring to me playing xbox in the evening. I generally keep the volume so low that I can barely hear it, I rarely play past 10-11pm and certainly not every night, and she falls asleep watching Law and Order or Game of Thrones, so even if the volume WASN’T whisper quiet I don’t see how she could hear my tv over hers, when I can hear hers over mine. She’s also seen me playing with headphones on before, so it’s not like she couldn’t have asked me to put headphones on at some point over the past two years if it was bothering her.  \n  \nSo, am I the asshole here? Is it really so absurd that I use my kitchen in the morning? I mean, what if I wanted to make a smoothie for myself for breakfast every morning, I’ve lived with people who do that and it never bothered me.  Would I be yelled at for using a blender? I feel like living with other people includes occasional inconvenience. This is the only time I’ve ever started baking this early, and if she’d complained to me about noise from gaming earlier I’d have taken steps to fix it.",

      "description": "My apologies for the limited title - I wasn’t sure how to explain my dilemma in such a short phrase, so please keep reading. An important clarification: I have absolutely nothing against people with mental disabilities (other than some internalized prejudice I’m sure I have) and fully support them interacting freely with mentally abled people. \n\nMy issue is that I have a good amount social anxiety mixed into a generalized anxiety disorder, as well as a panic disorder. I really struggle with how to react to people with mental disabilities, because I am constantly worried that I will offend them, say something generally offensive/incorrect/otherwise unacceptable and be judged for it, and/or that I will somehow make a faux pas that ends up giving the impression that I am consciously prejudiced. Due to the fact that these interactions or potential interactions are so fraught with ‘danger’ for me, (even though logically I know it will be fine and that most slip ups can be alleviated with apologies and acknowledgements) I usually end up having a panic attack, or generally just running away from interactions with mentally disabled folks. \n\nSo, here’s my question: AITA for wanting to completely avoid interactions with mentally disabled people, and generally avoid being around them, to spare myself the anxiety and panic that comes from it? Is it wrong of me to just want to escape however possible? I always try to be kind, but I know that it’s still obvious that I’m brushing them off in the hopes they’ll stop talking to me/ being around me. Am I a shitty person for prioritizing my anxiety/ panic issues over giving someone the time of day? \n\nTL;DR: I generally try to avoid people with mental disabilities because the complex social issues around those interactions make my anxiety/panic get really bad. AITA? ",

      "description": "For some context: My roommate [25F] and I [27F] have lived together for a few years now. Overall it's a nice arrangement, despite the fact that she has some rather inconsiderate living habits. I let it slide bc it's no biggie in the long run. One of the perks of our place is a washer and dryer in unit, though it is in the garage so if clothes get left out they get dusty/linty and I feel they need to be rewashed (she doesnt).\n\nI put in a load of wash before bed last night and moved it to the dryer this morning. My roommate knows that I dont like my clothes left out because I've asked her to please tell me and I'll move it if it's ever in the way. She hasn't had to ask more than a half dozen times in the several years we've lived together bc I'm good about getting my clothes within 24 hrs. \n\nSo today I come home and my stuff is piled on the dryer and covered in dust/lint/dog hair. So, I texted her.\n\nMe: Hey, just as a heads up, can you not put my stuff on top of the dryer? It gets all dusty and linty in the garage and then I feel like I have to wash it again, I'd rather you just let me know and I can move it in the future please :) \n\nRM: Hey sorry i meant to text you. I really needed to put my stuff in the dryer but I was running late and didn't want to climb 2 flights of stairs in heels. My bad, I know you don't like things being left out. But to be fair, you did the same thing to my sheets. Not saying that's an excuse or anything but still\n\nMe: Well, you also had left it in there for 5 days and were gone, and I usually bring it upstairs for you and have even folded stuff for you. I've said a number of times that I dont like the stuff left out and it was only in there for a day...those arent really equivalent if you ask me\n\nRM: I was literally dead [she was sick with a cold and went home for several days], that's why I didn't move them. honestly I forgot because I was dead. I also have taken your stuff upstairs every single time since you mentioned it to me first and this was the first time and I said I meant to text you and apologize. I honestly don't appreciate being berated. It's literally just laundry I don't wanna fight over this\n\nMe: I'm not berating you, I was just being direct and I thought I was pretty nice about the request, simply pointed out the differences as I saw them since you had mentioned how you saw the situation. I dont want to fight over this either. Didnt know we were.\n\nShe then told me that my messages were aggressive. Shes very nonconfrontational but it's like I cant say anything without her getting defensive and playing the victim. I wasn't even mad/mean, just a bit annoyed but trying to be clear and polite. I told her I didnt mean to come across that way, that I was just trying to be straightforward not confrontational and that I didnt want to go further since it was devolving into bickering.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Feedback on my \"aggressive\" behavior is most welcome",

      "description": "Sorry, kinda bait title. Here's the full story of my ex and I to get some context on why I said this:\n\nNovember 2017, I started dating this 17 year old girl (I was 15 at the time). Everything was decent enough up to two months in. Late January 2018, I went over to her house for a cuddle movie night type of thing, and I notice she is hiding something from me. (She would do this high pitch tone if she wasn't fully honest) I spent 5 minutes asking about what she was hiding from me and she told me she was pregnant with her ex's child the entire time we dated and didn't tell me. I broke up with her on the spot and left.\nFast forward to the very end of May 2018 and she texts me asking if we could try again. We talk for a few days and comes around early June and we get back together... for 20 minutes. I notice her mood change rather quick and realized, yet again, she was lying to me. (She sucks ass at hiding her lies) She tells me her ex she is having the kid with and her got back together and wanted to try and trick me into keeping their kid once it was born. So this girl not only didn't tell me about the kid when she was with me but also tried to make me keep it. I kick her out of my house.\nMy birthday passes on June 19, and I get a text over Instagram on June 22 from her. She basically tries to get back with me again, and I profusely kept saying no at every advancement she tried to pull. This would start her trying to get back with me every once and a while for the next almost 6 and a half months.\nFinally a week ago, I snapped. She tried to pull the whole \"I'm gonna kill myself\" ordeal that people use when rejected, in which I then told her that I wouldn't care if she killed herself and to never text me again, that I was done with her shit right then and there.\nThere are some other details after that but they need to stay private due to them still going on and for identity reasons.\nSo, AITA?",

I get an hourly rate for this particular company, which a 5 hour gig is the standard, not including the time to and from the gig.  A couple of months ago is accidentally double booked myself and only realized is when this particular boss called me asking why I was 15 minutes late. I was working another gig 97 miles away and there was no way I’d be able to make it there, for anything. So he was forced to find someone else to mix last minute. It was my fault, I apologized to everyone, told them it would ever happen again, I didn’t get fired (luckily all of our clients like and prefer me on gigs) and I have a booking for tomorrow. This same boss asks me to to come 45 minutes early, to prep the show because it’s an extra large band. My reply was, “hey, why don’t we just chalk it up to an extra hour pay and I’ll be there at 4:30” . Plenty of time to get the band situated/sound checked/ etc. \n\nHis response... \n“Nah, just be ready for sound check at 5. If it makes you feel better you can count it towards the time you messed up the Lakewood gig and it ended up costing me an extra 300 for the guy that covered you”\n\n\nI’m not really sure how to take that?

      "title": "AITA for wanting to attend my best friend's (wife's) baby shower?",
      "description": "My friend (S) and his wife (L) (I don't say friends because L and I unfortunately just don't know eachother very well. We get on just fine, but aren't super close.) are having a baby, and they posted an open invitation on Facebook to their baby shower on Sunday. The invite said everyone is invited to come and celebrate with them, and they affirmed in person that this was the case, but S's mother and another woman that were organizing the event said \"ladies\" are invited when announcing it.\n\nI showed up a bit before hand, and S, L, and S's family invited me to go to lunch with them, saying, \"You're family, come on!\" (S and I have been friends for about 15 years, though within the last few years we have drifted apart. Sunday was the first time he and I had spoken in several months.) We caught up a bit, they graciously offered to pay for my lunch, and then we headed back to the place the shower was being held.\n\nWe all worked on decorating and setting things up, which took about 40 minutes or so. Then S and his father (P) had planned to leave and kill time until the shower was over. I had told S I wanted to attend the shower when I arrived earlier, which he seemed fine with at the time; he actually wanted to attend as well. His mother (R) said, \"alright guys, time to leave.\" So P came over and asked if I wanted to ride with them, or if I had some other way of getting home.\n\nI stepped out to talk to S and P, and clarify that I actually wanted to attend the shower. P responded, \"Well, you have to leave, R said no guys.\" At this point L wandered out, and asked what we were talking about. I told her, \"Obviously if it would make you uncomfortable for me to stay I would be happy to go; would it bother you if I stayed?\" To which she replied, \"No, I don't mind.\" So I said, \"alright, then I think I'll stay.\" S said, \"well, she just wants everyone to be there,\" and laughed a bit. He said she should head back in and make sure everything was ready for the shower, so she left.\n\nP said again that I couldn't stay because R said no guys allowed. They all know I'm a trans lady, and that I've been medically transitioning since April 2018. I had discussed this with S and L months ago, and they implied they were supportive, with L even asking me if I wanted to go clothes shopping with her the next time she went and work on figuring out what styles I like, although we never set a date and that plan feel through. Earlier in the day they had all remarked that I looked like I had lost a lot of weight, and P asked me if I had been exercising a ton, what was my secret, etc. I told him it was probably the feminizing hormones, and joked that that routine probably isn't for most people. (I should add that P made probably 2 or 3 comments about my weight/dieting at different times throughout the day, which seemed uncharacteristic of him; I don't know what to make of that.)\n\nI felt embarrassed at the conversation just before the shower, and felt like I was making a spectacle, but I guess I looked upset or disappointed enough, that S asked R if it really mattered who attended. She relented, and said S could stay if he wanted, so he and I went inside and P left to kill time for a couple of hours until the baby shower was over.\n\nThe baby shower was fine, it didn't seem awkward or weird at all. When S walked in and was looking for a seat R said, \"S really wanted to stay,\" and one of the ladies joked, \"Its 2019, the more the merrier!\" I didn't know what to expect, it was a little boring, but some of the gifts were really sweet, and I thought I should be glad I attended. Instead I just felt petty and selfish for making it about myself. I had told myself I was there to support L, but honestly I wanted to go so I would feel like less of an imposter. I felt like baby showers are a thing that women just do, a social obligation, and I wanted to prove to my family and the people in my life that I really am a lady, and I'm not just pretending.\n\nNow I just feel like a dumbass for making a fuss and being so self-centered. The point of the shower was to support L, and I could have ended up causing a huge issue and ruining it. I don't think S even cares about me anymore, tbh. I'm on the autistic spectrum, and I'm just not very good at reading people, empathy has never been my strong suit. Maybe he was just trying not to make waves. I don't know if I should feel this way or not, I have absolutely no idea what I should have done differently.\n\nTL;DR I, a trans woman, wanted to attend a baby shower for my (used-to-be) best friend, am almost turned away because it's for ladies only, complain, am allowed to stay, feel like shit afterward.",

      "description": "Today I woke up to her whistling to my bird (who has a room in the basement with plenty of toys, food, water, AND a tv) for a few minutes until I finally got out of bed and went downstairs. When I came back up, he flew off my shoulder and took a lap before colliding with a window. I was very frustrated (although I was calm, you could hear it in my voice. I did not yell.) and I asked her to “please stop whistling at him from the upstairs, it riles him up, it encourages him to scream for attention”\n\nA couple things: I’ve asked her to stop this at least four times in the last 3 months that I’ve lived at home. She has allowed her cat to “train” her (rewards for knocking things over and feeding him from her plate). She is a manipulative woman who doesn’t work or go out. We aren’t close because of years of emotional abuse. She loves to be the victim. About a year prior, she gave away the last bird I had because she was mad at me. \nIn short, I do have a lot of pent up aggression towards her. \n\nShe immediately started crying, saying that she was just about to go down and be with him, she can’t do anything right, she just wanted to be nice to a lonely animal. Her argument is that she was only doing it for a second and she was planning on going downstairs. \nAITA?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for feeling smothered by my generous friend?",
      "description": "AITA for feeling smothered by a new friend I made 6 months ago?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the length in advance, I just want to make sure I don't miss any important details.\n\nIn July 2018 I (F 32) started seeing a new hair stylist, Pablo (M 36) who I initially thought was gay. He's very flamboyant and metrosexual, we bonded quite easily and I made the mistake of saying that I thought we might have been best friends in another life. It's not long before he mentions his GF, Lana (F 28)... now things start getting a little weird. Pablo tells me that right before him and Lana started dating he had been in a very serious relationship that was heading towards marriage, when the girl suddenly ghosted him with no explanation whatsoever.  He goes on to tell me that even though he is 100% committed to Lana, he's not over what happened and he just hasn't really been giving it 100% (yikes, but I decide not to judge him because I've had my heart broken too and know what it feels like to be trying to move on)...\n\nSoon Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana. We link up for happy hour, I meet her and she is really sweet and wonderful. I like her a lot.  Now Pablo and Lana start inviting me out more and more as well as paying for me (even though I wanted to paying for myself), first it was weekly then progressively more and more... I have a really busy schedule and pretty full life, so I'm just not available that much and can't hang out as much as they would like to.... I'm actually relieved when the holidays come because they finally let up on asking me to hang out as much.\n\nNow during this time I actually think things are getting better and our friendship is balancing out... WRONG! Pablo messages me and tells me to go to the \\*\\*\\*\\* (expensive clothing brand) website and pick out my Christmas gift, anything I want! This makes me feel a little uncomfortable because me and my friends don't spend that much money on each other during the holidays and I usually do home made gifts, so I pick out something very modest. We meet up before Christmas to exchange gifts (I made them a thoughtful couples gift) and everything seems pretty good... Then a few days later he sends me a picture of a second gift he has gotten me.... Okay, what? WHY??????\n\nNow I'm asking myself if Lana knows about this? Pablo gives me the impression that she does know because he bought her the same gift as me plus more.  So I start asking if I'm just not used to someone being so generous towards me and if I'm making this into something it's not???\n\nI decide to ignore my gut feeling and not get all weirded out by it. (I've never been comfortable accepting gifts from men because in my experience they take it to mean I want something more.)\n\nJump forward to about a week ago. I'm in for another hair cut and  Pablo brings up the gift thing... he goes on about how he usually spends so much more money on his friends, and that my gifts were so cheap that's why he bought me two... okay? Then while I'm getting my hair washed Pablo says \"Do you know what I like about your body? I love how curvy your hips are and that you're not fat.\"  I just feel like this is too \"friendly\"....\n\nI should also take this time to say that I am in no way sexually attracted to Pablo. I think he has a really cool personality and we get along really well as friends, except that I think he wants to hang out too often and is too friendly sometimes.\n\nNow I start confiding in my best friend and she says that is completely inappropriate and disrespectful to his GF.  I agree and decide its best decide to talk to his GF about it next time I see her. So, the next day Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana, I agree. We end up going to a concert a day later and there's just no good time to talk to her... Plus I ate something that wrecked my stomach. I was in so much pain by the end, I told them I needed to go home and didn't feel well. They said that they were going to go hot tubing and that if I felt better I should join them. I told them the chances of that were basically non existent. I go home, take some tums and crawl into bed. as soon as I'm snuggled under the covers I get 3 texts.... 2 from her and 1 from him... both basically saying \"we're at the hot tub, when are you coming over?\"\n\nNow at this point, I'm getting really annoyed. I reply back \"My stomach is wrecked so I'm taking some tums and going to bed.\" Lana replies to \"Feel better\" and Pablo replies \"Damn! You still look good though!  Coming back out tonight?\" I didn't reply and I put both of their numbers on do not disturb mode. (also no this is not a group text, they both message me separately... her not so much, but him like everyday.)\n\nI'm also starting to realize that Pablo has my schedule memorized. He messages me the next day \"Good morning!\"\n\n\"Morning.\" - Me\n\n\"Going to the gym today?\"-Pablo\n\n\\-\\_- (my face) \"I'm here now.\" - me\n\n\"damn! I wanted to go with you!\" -Pablo\n\n\\-\\_-  I start getting annoyed again and don't reply.\n\n\"Are you off tomorrow?\" -Pablo\n\n\"Yes, but I have a completely full schedule already.\"-Me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..... okay, so He knows what days I go to the gym, and he knew I was working that day, so asked (already knowing the answer) if I was off tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly don't know If I'm the asshole for not wanting to hang out every god damn single day and blowing this out of proportion and Pablo is really just a nice, generous guy?\n\n.... Or, if Pablo has a secret crush on me or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I am the asshole... how do I say in a nice way that I have a life of my own, with friends and family that I want to see too and that I don't want to see them everyday? I've told them before that I'm not a very high maintenance friend and that I don't need to text or see people THAT often. I also feel like the more often he tries to see me the less I want to see him. I like having space and time to myself, and I am very, very close with my family and see them at least 5 times a week. Plus I have best friends I've known for 10 years that I prefer to see when I get the chance.... I have also told them this in a nice way, and I just think it is selfish of them to try and bogart all of my time. They stress me out and annoy me when they ask me my plans every single day and then want to invite themselves to do things. Sorry, but I am a serious gym goer and don't want distractions. I spend two hours at the gym and have a set routine.\n\nI definitely feel like the asshole here, but 'I also feel like he is becoming obsessed with me or something... i really don't know.\n\nPlease help!",

I feel that if it’s graded on completion then I’m just providing her with the opportunity to finish them, but this way it seems like cheating. I later sent her a long text saying I was sorry but I didn’t want to risk sending her all the papers because it could get us both in trouble. Also as there are 25 scanned pages it’s very obvious to tell that these are not the original and were scanned and sent by me to her. I feel sooooo awful because I feel like I have ruined someone’s grade and I have been feeling unbelievably guilty for days because I feel so obligated to extend my help to people all the time and it is killing me that I said no, especially since it may not be a big deal at all? I would have sent it in a heartbeat if I knew it is being graded based on completion but I feel that it’s not the case and our professor is strict and specified that it is for the purpose of assessing attendance based on how many hand outs we actually have. But it may also get us both into a failing position but I feel that it’s rather unlikely that the latter is the case. ",

We only spoke through text but we did agree on a price $500 less than my asking. Somebody else hit me up on craigslist who is local and came in at full asking.  I sold it to the second guy.\n\n My reasoning is this is craigslist. People flake out all the time. There’s a chance the first guy could’ve seen the vehicle in person and then tried to lowball me. I figure I would get the money while I can. Cash talks.\n\nAm I the asshole for going back on my word?  I didn’t take a deposit or anything.",

      "description": "So a bit of backstory, at my workplace, anything goes. Everyone is really playful with banter, you wanna throw something across the store? go for it. Wanna shout to the bakery person \"Hey, Masturbater\" (nickname for the master baker) sure thing! wanna literally tackle each other and call each other pricks/cunts etc? Knock yourself out! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway, my supervisor, who's the most playful and full of fun banter, known for jumpscaring people and trying to hand you stuff, dropping at infront of you and walking away, he tells me his SO is coming in the store, and she's more brutally full of dark humor and harsh banter than anyone in the store, talking up some pretty big game, so I think it might be fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe comes in and hears that we playfully throw soft things at each other and fake hit each other all the time and she gets protective in a way like \"only I can bully my man\" kinda attitude and I play along and say stuff like \"it's only self defense\" and \"I just give as good as I get\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it's coming a bit forward in to the day and we're chatting, my supervisor throws something at me so I say \"is that so\" and walk behind him to fake kick him in the ass, his SO jumps inbetween us with her fist raised as if to say \"do it and I'll punch you\" and we both know it's only banter. I then say \"Oh hey, looks like you've got a loyal guard dog on your side\" and everyone bursts out laughing except for her, she goes red in the face and starts getting aggressive because I used the word \"dog\" even though I meant it in a positive and banterish way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for assuming she wouldn't freak out at a non-negative context \"loyal guard dog\" because she was willing to fight for her partner, even though everyone said she's more brutal and doesn't get bothered by anything?

      "description": "So there's a little backstory with a neighbor that is  single that has my husband do her favors, fixing sink, carrying heavy things ect. I have never talked to her and she doesnt really look at or respond if I say hello in passing most of the time, and if she does its a short hi. \n\nThis started when I was out of town for a few weeks he did them some favors (The neighbor, her mom, and her son) my husband visited with them and was telling me how he joked with the neighbor and she told him some pretty personal stuff. I thought it was strange for them to talk about private stuff but just mentioned it to my husband and moved on. \n\nThis week again I said hi and she didnt engage in conversation with me or look at me moments after talking to my husband. So the last few says I've mentioned it a few times to my husband that I feel a little hurt and think its odd she has never talked to me, but does with him.\n\nAnyways tonight I went to lay with my daughter to get her to sleep and my husband said he was coming to bed in a bit but was having some drinka first. At around midnight I hear him moving around and about 30 minutes later I go to see what he's up to, he is gone. I call his phone over and over and look all around and know he didnt drive after drinking. \n\nI go to see of hes in our shed and hear his voice at the neighbors house, I called his name and said it was shady he wasnt answering his phone and then went back inside, expecting him to come explain. \n\nHe opens their door and then closes it so I call more and then finally decide to go over and see whats going on. \n\nWell at that point I was sure something was up because this is not like him at all to ignore calls ans texts. So I basically stomp up to the door and knock and asked him why the hell he wasnt answering his phone. \n\nWell he opens the door and I comment that it reeks like weed loudly, but see he is visting with the grandma and young son and talking about household related things. As I was realizing that,  I was saying it was inappropriate he was over there at midnight ignoring my calls. I wasnt yelling but was definitely angry and assertive.\n\nWhen I saw that it was innocent I said I was worried he didnt answer and why did it reek like weed with a kid right there. I walked away and he followed and is embarrassed and said I hurt his feelings. His phone was in a hoodie pocket so he didnt realize I was calling.\n\nI just cried and said sorry for embarrassing him and then came to lay down to gather my feelings. I feel embarrassed but also still a little angry because I've mentioned her ignoring me and I was starting to feel uncomfortable \n\nSo AITA for making a scene on their porch and thinking the worst was going on? \n\nTLDR; husband disappeared to the neighbors at midnight and ignored my calls, I thought he may have been cheating and made a scene. He was really just visiting with the grandma. \n",

My classmates are all going off on crazy adventures for spring break so I was thinking I should go out somewhere too. I got the days off work and was thinking up destinations in my price range. So I asked my friends, “hey, where should I go off for spring break? I’m thinking maybe New York or Massachusetts”. And then they went off on me. Started with basic “oh and you didn’t invite us?” And I thought it was all jokes. Turns out it wasn’t.\n\nThey started saying how “we talked about going on a trip to New York like a year ago” and “kinda sucks that you didn’t even ask”. Now, my friends could never afford this trip. It’s not super expensive because it’d just be a couple days, but they literally just got a new house and they both owe me money, so they’re in no position to be going on vacations. That’s why I never bothered asking them in the first place, I knew they couldn’t say yes even if they wanted to.\n\nI apologized to avoid it being a bigger issue, but I can’t help but think that I shouldn’t have had to apologize for not inviting someone to a small getaway trip. But then again, I’m not quite sure because I have a hard time understanding social situations. ",

      "title": "AITA For trying to take a transfer pass when the bus driver was having trouble",
      "description": "First off, some context before I get into the meat and potatoes of my story. I live in Edmonton Canada so our transit system may be different to yours. Essentially we can buy a monthly bus pass, or a set of ten tickets for twenty some dollars that we can then use to get a transfer ticket on buses, they work as advanced payment essentially. I have these set of tickets as I don't ride the bus every single day. I should also tell you that I struggle with PTSD, depression and GAD, I'm training my own service dog (with a professional) to help me just live my life. This will hopefully give you some context of my reaction to the situation. \n\nSo when I was walking to the bus stop after work there was a train holding up traffic so of course everyone had to wait for it to pass before they could get moving again. If you know anything about Edmonton trains, it sucks and they're slow as hell.\n\nWhen the train finally passes traffic gets moving and my bus stops for me to get on. I step on the bus and put my pre paid ticket in the cash bin and the driver goes to rip a transfer pass from his pack but he has some trouble grabbing the pass so he just closes the bus doors and drives off. I though \"well that's okay, I'll grab the ticket myself to save him the trouble and I can go sit down\" when I reach and begin to grab ONE pass, I did try to make it obvious that I was grabbing one plus I had paid so I saw no problem with it, he slammed his hand down on the passes and yelled extremely loudly \"DON'T TOUCH THE TRANSFERS\".\n\nI ripped my hand away and was scared shitless (mind you, he didn't touch my hand but he was very close to it), I didn't know what was going on. He then spoke in a normal tone that he said \"no\" for a reason and was driving to the next stop to not back up traffic more because of the train, I apologized for my actions and agreed with him on the train situation and took the ticket when he stopped and ripped it. I went to sit down and people seemed super awkward (could just be my anxiety). Maybe he thought I was going to steal the passes but that doesn't make sense as they all expire at the same time so what would I do with, like, fifty transfer passes?\n\nAnyway, because of how he yelled at me the arm I used to go and grab the ticket was extremely tense and in pain for hours (again, he did not touch me it's just due to my horrible anxiety and PTSD), I was so shaken when I got home I had a huge break down and tried rubbing my arm to normal. My dog helped me out but damn did it suck. I feel so horrible about the whole thing, on one side I don't like how he spoke to me but on the other I feel like a huge dick for trying to take the pass. Am I the asshole or?\n\nP.S. If you're wondering why I didn't have my dog with me, I work at a doggy daycare so it's not a good place for her to be. I should also tell you that the bus driver did see me pay for the pass.",

      "description": "TLDR at the end\n\nContext: I recently moved states because an opportunity arose and I felt I needed change.\n\nI’m a social butterfly like my father but more of the “clown” in every group of friends I get. I’m good at one liners and generally being quick with a joke or pun. But that’s about it. My last friend group (this one) all met in high school, but came closer together once we started college. So we got to meet everyday for studying and food breaks and it was fun!\n\nBut I lost motivation and dropped out on my third semester. I started realizing that my career path was going to be a simple desk job or manual labor until I retire. A good career path opened up and my best friend had a place to rent together in another state so I moved.\n\nMonths before I moved, I was already distancing myself from the group so that I don’t hurt anyone; or more like “pull the bandaid of quickly” if they found out. We had a group chat through text, and it was active more or less, at least a good conversation once a week or so, but if I ever got super depressed or just wanted to be alone, I would leave it, only to be added again very quickly. They would always ask why, but I would always give a vague answer.\n\nSo about a month before the move I left the group chat and said “please don’t add me back” and that worked temporarily. No one texted me, not in the group, or individually.\n\nA few days before the move one of the group members personally called me to chat, which we would do every so often. She liked to vent to me, and I would like to listen. She vented and I listened, like we normally do, but at the end I informed her that I was moving and that I was leaving the group chat forever and...oh man.\n\nWe cried over FaceTime I said sorry a thousand times, she kept saying “I don’t want to lose you”  all of the works.\n\nI don’t think very highly of myself and consider myself a very bad friend, so I just wanted to burn all of my bridges and start fresh in a new state. \n\nSorry for such a long post but the final question is AITA for wanting to start fresh and not hurt my friend group by completely ghosting them to work on my own mental health?\n\n(Clarification: They were supportive, good friends, but I was pretty depressed and really bringing them down. So I didn’t want to be a nuisance on them.)\n\nTLDR: I felt like a nuisance to my supportive, good friend group so I ghosted them completely when I moved states to “Peel the bandaid quickly”",

On the spur I told the manager I would be there and then I texted my girlfriend that could she meet me 2 hours ahead of the time she was acctually meant to meet me due to me having a match. I also told her she could stay longer than usual to make up for the time. \n\nShe absolutely snapped at me and told me no that i wasn’t allowed to go to the match (be aware I have not been to a soccer trainings in 2 weeks due to important exams and the weather). I continuously told her that she could stay longer and that it was only 2 hours and she kept being in denial and putting the blame on me.\n\nAnd now the bigger problem is I came home and texted her that I’m home and she can meet me but she’s gone off into town and expects me to meet her even though I’m wrecked from a football match and I need to relax\n\nAITA for delaying her to meet me because I wanted to go to soccer and keep myself active and my mental health in shape plus offering her to stay longer at mine or am I just being ridiculous?

      "description": "For context, I am an 18 year old male. 3 years ago, I lived with my father, stepmother (of 10 years at the time) and my younger brother. My freshman year of high school (now a Senior) I lost my dad to mental illness. I never had the best relationship with my stepmother, so I moved in with my grandparents for a year, before realizing I couldn't stand my school, and so I moved back in with my stepmother and brother.\n\nWhile I was gone with my grandparents, my stepmom (SM from here on out) sold the house, and bought an RV, as a temporary stopgap to her dream of building a tiny home. I was told we would have our own bedrooms. My room wkuld be 10x9, plenty big enough for a teenage boy. When she offered to take me back in, she told me that we would be moved in by the winter. It's been two years now and we still live in an RV. She bought me my own camper, wasn't much, but it had a bed. I slept there for a year and a half, until the heater broke in October I continued to sleep in my camper for another two months, despite the inside temperature being often in the high 40's, because I valued my privacy and a bed more than being warm. \n\nEventually, based on our climate, it got too cold to stay there, and so I started sleeping in the RV. I sleep on a loveseat, and use the armrest as a pillow. This is the same coach that my dog sleeps on all day, and our family uses while watching TV.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received a notice from our homeless advocate at school, saying that based on my living conditions, I qualify for certain benefits. I told SM about this, and she got upset, saying our home isn't substandard, and shouldn't qualify. I then said that I see why they believe it is, and  pointed out the deficiencies (water heater has been broken lately so I have to go to YMCA 30 minutes away to shower, we used a composting toilet until a month ago, I sleep on a loveseat, my heater was broken, our living room is also my bedroom....and the dining room, etc etc). She freaked out, saying I wasn't thankful. I think I'm more than thankful that she let me move back to the school I love so much. But I also think she is incredibly lazy. She got out of the army 3 years ago, and has taken random classes to get the GI Bill benefits. That's what she lives off of. She is more than capable of getting a job. she also hasn't made a meal for our family for as long as I can remember. The only time I get a cooked meal is when I go to my friend's house (I can't afford to stock our pantry myself). \n\nSo, AITA for calling my living arrangement substandard?",

It was Friday, the last week before finals week, and the last class of the day. We all left our backpacks in our classroom before going to the gym to do the AP test. I got done early and got back to the class and saw her backpack close to mine. I was seated in the very back of class where no one would see me easily, as there were only a few kids there. We hadn’t turned in our final projects yet and most of the other classes hadn’t had their final tests or projects due either. What I did was take everything out of her backpack while no one was looking (it was a pretty full backpack as she had all advanced classes) and put it into mine and put a few of her other belongings in the other kids backpacks so they would be suspected first. The class was over before she was finished with the test so I went home and threw all of her stuff in the trash. I never said a word about it to anyone and no one suspected me of doing it. I never found out how bad it affected her but I can assume it hurt her grades pretty badly. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I put boyfriend in quotes because we (28F and 26M) have been going out on dates and having sex for about a year but until now he has not called us boyfriend and girlfriend. When I had the \"define the relationship\" talk he said we were \"hanging out\" and even though that wasn't really what I wanted to hear, I have kept at it because he is a really amazing guy. He's always in a good mood, always lifts me up and makes me happy, he has gotten me out of the house on more adventures in the last year than I'd ever done before in my life. Because of him I've started hiking, geocaching, actually started cooking food instead of just heating it up, been sketching more and just generally more involved in my art and life. And I have been kind of holding on, hoping to get that commitment from him, but this is not what I had in mind.\n\nI recently switched birth control methods and I guess I was wrong about how protected I was during the switch because I just found out on Wednesday that I am pregnant. I'm not sure how far along yet but I have literally taken four tests, all positive, so I'm sure this is really happening. I told my not-bf right away and it was an instant 180 with him. He says he wants to marry me, he's ready to settle down and this is a sign, he thinks we will be amazing parents.\n\nTo be honest I do want kids eventually, but I am pretty sure I don't want them right now and pretty unsure that this is the guy I want to have them with. It was actually kind of a wake-up call when I saw that blue line and my first thought was how I didn't think me and my not-bf were in it for life. As much as I like him and as much as he is talking about commitment now, the fact that it took a pregnancy to get him there really worries me that he is not in this for real or not in it for the right reasons. And to be honest I would be much happier having my first kid at 35 than 28. Financials are good right now. Not great, but good. I can't see myself putting x% of my income towards a child right now and being happy.\n\nSo between the uncertainty of my stability with my partner and just a general feeling of \"not yet\" I am leaning towards having an abortion. Not-bf is crushed. He has been begging me not to go through with it or to put it off until I've thought about it more, but I would really rather get it done as earlier as possible while the pill option is still available. Not-bf is basically a changed man as far as commitment goes but I'm worried it's too little, too late. Whenever I try to talk to him about what *I* want to do, he always ends up steering the conversation towards how rewarding it would be to be parents and how much he loves me. It's honestly so upsetting that I just want to go get the abortion done and tell him about it after. But would this be an unforgivable move? Is it okay to say \"better ask forgiveness than permission\" over something this big?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off a friend after he refused to apologize?",
      "description": "I had a friend, let's call him C. Now C and I have been friends for 4 years now. He lives in another city so we mostly played games together. However, there was a time where we were kind of trying to date, but that didn't work out so I broke it off. That was three years ago and all of that is now forgotten. \n\nHe has always been difficult. He's had a rough childhood, he's stubborn and won't listen to anyone but himself. In those years, there were many fights that did not end because he just kept going and going even after I told him to stop discussing it(basically he does not understand what boundaries are). We have different views on almost everything, he also dismissed my anxiety when I opened up to him about 2 years ago, basically said all I have to do is work out and eat healthily and it will all go away. Now I have let those things slide because somehow we always found a way back and he was also my only friend who plays games so I needed him for that(or maybe that's an excuse and we were just in a toxic friendship).\n\nNow a couple of weeks ago, we were playing and he called my BF a sissy (that's the best translation to English I could do from my native language). Since there have been a couple of times where he was also trying to disrespect my BF, but actually didn't go through with it, I reacted. Closed the game. He then wrote to me and asked what's wrong. I explained to him that I will not tolerate him disrespecting my BF and that I want him to apologize. He answered that \"I account being silent as admitting I fucked up\". What he meant by that is after calling my BF a sissy he instantly got quiet. I told him that it's not good enough and I expect him to admit he fucked up with words and apologize. He didn't.\n\nNow fast forward a week and every time he contacts me, I tell him \"not good enough\". Nothing else, just that sentence. He finally understands that I'm not kidding and I will not talk to him unless he apologizes. He proceeds to tell that \"he feels like he didn't hurt anyone, so no need to apologize\". He also tells me \"it was clear that I was trying to make a joke and when you felt offended I stopped.\" \n\nLike I wrote before, he has tried making \"jokes\" like that before but I always shut him down before. So he should know that I will not tolerate that. So basically we went back and forth by me telling him \"not good enough\" and explaining that I want him to apologize for dissing my BF and him telling me \"Too bad, that's all you get and it's more than necessary\". Since I have let his actions slide before I've had enough and put my foot down. Told him that if he does not apologize, I will not consider him my friend any longer. Then comes this sentence:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Not sure I want to. You felt disrespected by a thing that was not meant to hurt also I clarified it was not meant to hurt and now I have to apologize? Wow. And you talked about friendship or something.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the part where he says \"and you talked about friendship or something\" refers to a conversation we had a month ago when we were both feeling low, talking about it and trying to help one another. He opened up to me that he feels like he has no friends and I told him I consider him my friend. At this point, I'm starting to get tired because this is nothing new to us and those fight never end so I tell him that I made myself clear and will no longer continue with this discussion. He then tells me that \"I hope your boyfriend can tolerate you\" and that he was hoping our friendship will end with some big drama, not a little mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for cutting him off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A friend called my boyfriend a sissy(as an insult), refused to apologize because \"it was clear he was trying to make a joke\" and I cut him off after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My brother (28yo) wrecked his old car a month ago. He’s bought a new one in a different state, but he still hasn’t gotten it shipped yet. Until it does, I have to drive him to work. I wouldn’t mind it, but lately my schedule has been conflicting with his, so I’m left rushing the house to try to make it to work after dropping him off. His work is a half hour drive away. \n\nI want to ask him about it, but he gets frustrated every time it’s brought up. Apparently my parents are losing patience with him, because he’s putting off getting the car shipped. But I can’t keep giving him rides if it means I’m barely making it to work on time. I’m growing more and more frustrated by the day. I honestly feel like he’s not making the effort to get his car, anymore. As long as he’s getting rides, why bother trying to get the car shipped, right?\n\nI’m not even trying to be nice about it anymore. I let my annoyance show when he asks me for rides. He says he feels guilty about it, but nothing has changed. Hell, he doesn’t even want to take Uber or Lyft because it’s “too expensive “. He’ll fill up my tank to the half way mark when I’m low, which I am appreciative for. But if he can afford that, then why not use a driving service?\n\n\nWould I be the asshole for telling him he has to stop procrastinating on getting his car?",

      "description": "Context: My family is in the UK, I'm a 25yo guy, my older sister is 26, our dad left pretty early on and rarely paid child support, Our mum raised us singlehandedly and had to live very frugally to be able to make the finances work and ensure that we still got the same opportunities as everyone else our age.\n\nWe both started working full time from the age of 17. \nI started paying rent as soon as I had an income, and I always paid more with each salary increase as my professional opportunities began to improve with experience. Shortly after turning 23 I moved out into my own place and have maintained financial independence my whole working life. \n\nMy sister however has spent every penny she ever earned on herself, didn't start paying rent until after I'd already moved out, took out multiple loans and maxed out several credit cards before she even turned 20 just for completely frivolous spending on nights out and several holidays abroad each year. By the time she was 22 she had defaulted on multiple payments, completely decimated her credit score, and monthly interest payments alone were exceeding her monthly income, forcing her to admit her spending issues to the family. We had to all scrape out our savings accounts to bail her out. \n\nNow, cutting forward to last week: \nMum's trying to sell the family home we grew up in and therefore needs my sister to move out. While my sister was on her latest holiday with her friends mum went ahead and found her an amazing new place. The upshot is it's far nicer than any place I've ever had, and far far cheaper, with a whole bunch of perks and stuff included in the rent because mum knows someone who knows someone and managed to renegotiate the whole thing with the landlord. My sister is moving out next month having done virtually nothing to organise it for herself, mum will rent a van herself to help with the move, and my recent birthday meal last week was completely overshadowed by everyone in the family talking about all the insanely nice and very expensive furnishings that they could give to her for free to help her out.\n\nI'm pleased that she's finally moving out, but at the same time I'm really irritated that she is putting in a tiny fraction of the effort, planning and commitment that I've been putting in for years, and yet she gets enough handouts to consistently come off better anyway. \nI guess she's getting more support because she's a bit of a liability and probably couldn't do it without all the handouts, but at the same time it just makes me wonder why I even bother.\n\nThoughts?",

I said I would because I have done that previously and as I had a different schedule then. But since then, my timings have changed and my mental health has taken a dive for the worse leading to something mental break downs in between. Also the fact that I work for a call center doesn't make things better.\n\nDue to all of this, I'm too exhausted emotionally and mentally to do any task which leads to me falling behind on a lot of things.

      "description": "AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood?\n\nMy parents and I live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....\n\nWhen the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother \"your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms\".\n\nMy mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....\n\nMy mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that \"the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it\". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? \n\nEventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.\n\nThis brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.\n\nSo I took matters into my own hands.\n\nUnhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.\n\nThey either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.\n\nI filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.\n\nWhile we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....\n\nAITA for having the dogs removed?",

      "description": "[I am a 21M, girlfriend 21F] My side: Her and her best “guy friend” have been in a pretty volatile friendship, on and off fighting and not. So Thursday night, I drop her off at a party at his house. I have to get up early for work so I stay in. She says she wants to be home by 12, I said ok, text me when you’re home. \n\nAt 1 am, she’s at the bar where he works at, posting kind of inappropriate pictures. No big deal, we talked about it whatever. \n\nWe’ve had numerous problems in the past like this where she would go to bars and parties that she swore she didn’t want to be at; she was never there at any of the times (2,3,4 hours past when she said she would be leaving), and generally not who she said she would be with. She claims she was not going to any bars, but I wake up and always find her there. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she’s suppose to be coming over. It’s late, 3-4 AM. She hasn’t shown yet, so I call, say I’m coming to pick her up. 4 am I arrive, she reads my message, never comes out. I wait 20-30 minutes, and she never comes out. She’s at the guys house. \n\nMy roommate and very good friend, early in our relationship heard a rumor; At a bar, someone asked if she was single, she said no. Always kind of in the back of my head. \n\nBack to Thursday night / Friday afternoon. While in the tanning bed, I looked at her phone. I am obviously suspicious, and I feel have a reason to be. I found some videos of her and the guy friend laying on his bed, which I find extremely inappropriate. \n\nHer side of the story is she’s fine, and that her father, mother, and sister agree her friend is not threatening or inappropriate because they are such good friends. She believes she is rightfully mad because I was distrusting. \n\nAITA? I feel like she’s being extremely manipulative, and if I were to talk into the room with them she would absolutely know it was wrong. ",

      "description": "Not here for validation. Haven't been thinking too clearly and need some strangers to weigh in, my support circle has given me mixed responses\n\nWhen I was 28 my wife of 7 years (together for 13) and 4 year old daughter died in a home invasion while I was helping out a friend a few hours away. Afterwards I survived two attempts on my own life, went through a a few years of drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness as I stopped working. After a lot of effort I got back on my feet.\n\nI've turned 40 a few months ago. A few years ago I met my current wife. We had been friends for a bit and have been together for 2 years. She knew what I'd been through and was extremely supportive, we've helped eachother through a lot and have overall had a great marriage.\n\nThe other night we had a major blow-up. We've both been dealing with family issues and work related problems and had been short with eachother for a few days. We went out for a date which helped, and she asked to go the next night as well. I had already committed to helping a friend move that day, so I told her we could the day after. In retrospect I know this was wrong of me.\n\nFor the first time she start swearing at me, pushing chairs, telling me to leave. It ended with her saying, verbatim, \"last time you neglected your fucking family for a friend you lost them, that's on you. What if we had a kid [my name], would it take letting them die too before you smarten up?\"\n\nI left that night and came back the next day. We talked and she was extremely apologetic and said she's just been stressed from work, but it came out that she had always been jealous of my first wife which she never mentioned before. I told her I wanted wasn't sure if I could be with her, she's been staying with her sister but begging me for a chance to work through it.\n\nFriends are mixed. Some support me, others think I owe it to her to try to move past it because it was one issue in an otherwise solid marriage and because \"I do still think about my wife so she's right to be jealous.\" I visit my family on their birthdays and Christmas. I keep a photo of my first wife and daughter in my wallet (I also keep one of my current wife) and I've had their names on my back for 10+ years. That's it. I don't compare her to my first wife, nor do I love her less and I don't wallow in grief while ignoring my marriage, I just don't feel like being remarried means I have to act like they never existed. She knew I was a widower when we met. She was the one who offered to talk to me about my wife back then, and I haven't talked to her about my wife since we married. Had she brought up these concerns in a better way, I'd have gladly reassured her and worked on it, but while I can forgive a lot I don't know if I can forgive or ever forget how she said it.\n\nI need opinions. I love her, but I feel sick in my stomach when I think about her now. I feel so betrayed and hurt because while things are said in anger this felt purposely crafted to hurt most",

      "description": "So this originally started about 2 months ago. I was planning on moving out 2 month before our lease ends (February)  and my roommate, (lets call her Ashley) allowed her friends to come and takeover the apt. Mind you they moved all my stuff out overnight into a UHaul that i didnt ask for and wanted me to pay them $150 for getting me a truck..  \n\nThis started a big fight between me, ashley and her 2 friends what were taking over the apt. They said they would pay the rent and utilities for the remaining 2 months. Granted my name along with Ashleys are on the lease so i know they cant do much without ashley taking a hit. We are both in our early 20s. Im 23 shes 21. They day after i moved my stuff and them still messaging me to pay them the $150 for the truck i told Ashley that i was stopping the electric service there on 12/10. I moved out and told her this on 12/3. I gave her a week to call and start service in her name. \n\nNow we are here in February and move out day is the 3rd. I havent lived there since December and she sent me a photo of the electric bill. Apparently the apt complex keeps the power running in Florida regardless if tenants are in the unit.  so they assumed we stopped paying and she wants me to pay half of the bill. I told her that i informed her about everything going on with electric. I have messages from her stating that she was going to call the electric company as well as her friends stating they would pay the rent and utilities. Now they are throwing threats at me and im not having it. \n\nI told her i am NOT going to pay for electricity at a place i dont live in. She wanted them to stay with her. I told her multiple times that they were going to have issues, but shes very nieve and believed everything her friends told her. They tried saying they would fuck me over and promised none of it would have any negative effects on her.  Isaid that im willing to let the mgmt take the cost out of the security deposit.  (Which she thinks isnt fair) \n\nSo thats how my morning is going so far. I am going to the complex office this afternoon to give them my key and ask that our security deposit is split into 2 separate checks. ",

      "description": "Throwaway, I don’t support Trump btw, the S stands for “Screw”\n\nSo, little backstory. I will designate my ex-compadre as Chet and his girlfriend as Bri.\n\nChet and Bri have been dating for the better part of six years now, since senior year of high school, we are now all out of college. Bri has (as far as I know) always been faithful to Chet in every way, Chet however, would (by my count) cheat with 13 different females over the course of their 6 years together, then went to different universities for four years which made the entire thing easier on Chef’s behalf.\n\n13 is not a guess, me and that group of friends would always get together during uni breaks and often go on group dates or throw gatherings in one of our houses and basically party, all of these instances Chet would bring a different girl, he often kept us updated on when he was going on dates (in our groupchat), or funny situations that happened with these girls, and yes he was having sex with each one. \n\nWhen I was younger I didn’t really care too much, not expecting them to last this long regardless of the constant cheating, but somehow they did. I used to bring it up with Chet and tell him that I felt like its messed up to tell her that he loves Bri and the next day go take another girl on a date, each instance I bring this up, Chet would simply say he doesn’t know why he does it, he just does but his feelings for Bri are real.\n\nCue to current state of events, me and Chet aren’t really friends anymore, haven’t been for a long time (couple months), not because of this but because of another incident. I recently saw an update on social media where she was saying that they were starting to talk about marriage and it made me a little sick to think that she would marry this guy when he’s just been cheating the entire time. I feel crappy because I know for a fact that if she had seen even 1/100th of what Iv’e seen Chet doing, she would no longer be with him, let alone marry him.\n\nIv’e been thinking about telling her what I know, but I’m worried honestly. How would that even go? I’m also worried about about my motivations. Maybe a couple years ago I was around bri and Chet and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t develop a crush on Bri (never acted on it obviously). Granted me and Chet aren’t friends, but I don’t want to torpedo their relationship unless I’m doing it for completely selfless reasons, hell I don’t want to torpedo it at all, but I know how I would feel if someone I knew had information like this about someone I was planning to marry, and I would want them to step up. \n\nAITA if I tell this girl whats been going on? Or should I just leave it alone and hope their relationship falls apart on its own? ",

      "description": "I am 17...I study in a private high school.\nKindly excuse my English, it isn't very good.\n\nMy father is a garbage man, I have been extremely fortunate to get to study here. I genuinely feel like I deserve it since I worked really hard to ace the entrance exams and competitions.\nI didn't feel very welcome when I got here at first. Everyone had parents who were millionaires or had a stable income, and a lot of them distanced themselves when I told them what my father did. I considered that a blessing though, since a few gems came by. Two of them also had parents who were lower middle class like me, so I really grew connected to them. We all have been the founders the school robotics club, and represent our school. We have won several national and international level competitions.\n\nFor the past few months, we have a STEM for women or something like that initiative taken by the school. I am completely for this and like the concept.\n\nThe problem just started when an all girls robotics club was formed. They took away 80% of our funding. I argued with the cultural secretary that we should have a 50/50 split, and I myself would guide them after class. It seemed nonsensical to me, it had far fewer members.\n\nDespite this, I planned on helping them after school, but my first interaction was extremely unpleasant. I said fuck it and left mid way when one of them insinuated I was mansplaining and they all proceeded to laugh. I told them to not expect any help from me and that they would do terribly because they weren't serious about it.\n\n Then the school proceeded to make them represent the school in all competitions, and they finished dead last in most. They clearly didn't know even the basics, since they had far more funding than there competitors. Their last model was just a dog shaped device that walked, taken straight from YouTube. You can make it in like 6 hours at most. They had so much funding, so it hurt me to see it all go to waste. When I told them to be passionate about it, they brushed it off.\n\n We had a robot which solved the Rubik's cube with half the funds.\n\nI wrote a long letter to the headmaster about the issue and the club got closed because of it.\n\nI personally met the ex club president, telling her to  make a club she actually liked and not waste the school's money. She apparently made a whole Instagram story about it with a crying emoji and called me a misogynistic asshole who brutally shut down her budding club before it even aquired it's wings. Something melodramatic like that. \nShe is pretty popular and has almost 4000 followers, so she is making me look bad in front of all these people.\nI honestly don't really get her here. I think I am not in the wrong.\n\nWould be glad if I could have an unbiased opinion though. I have said everything as it is.\n\n  ",

One of the friends recently asked if we’d be open to one more joining and then admitted this new person is a guy she’s been dating for a month, and she’s apparently already invited him prior to checking with us. As of right now the trip is farther away than the amount of time they’ve even been dating so I think this is just a bad idea in general. Additionally, I don’t have a lot of faith in this friend’s dating choices and haven’t liked a lot of her previous partners. I’ll be traveling up until the time we go to Nepal so I won’t get to meet him beforehand, and I fear I’m going to get stuck with a total douchebag on my once in a lifetime trip. Also, even if he’s a cool guy, there’s just a lot that could go wrong between them being so early in a relationship that I don’t want to get pulled into on the mountain.

      "description": "I have a 28 year old older sister who is....a shit show. I’m 25, also female, and we have never gotten along. She is very impulsive and spoiled. We had a similar upbringing but I had her as a role model of all the things I didn’t want to be. I’m also currently in therapy for setting boundaries because I always end up being my family’s janitor (I have to solve everyone’s problems). But anyways, her life is always in crisis mode due to her lack of planning.\n\nWell anyways, my sister and her boyfriend broke up on friday and my parents called and demanded offer her a place to stay. She has not talked to me in a few months because she is mad at me, so I said I am happy to host her as long as she is mature enough to call me herself instead of going through our parents. Parents and her complied.\n\nAnyways, she has to move out of her boyfriends house and of course i get a call this morning from my parents saying they are in the city to help her move and I need to join. I work from home and it is very important to me to maintain a schedule. I also have been unable to work for two weeks because I was recovering from a minor surgery.\n\nSo I tell my parents no, and they start saying “you can miss work”. I say “I won’t see you before five, and after work I am walking the dog”. But now they have just called me again to renegotiate and say they are here all the way from home (2hr away - I usually go home once a month) and they want to see me, oh and also they need help unloading. Then when I say I can meet for dinner after walking the dog they say I’m full of excuses!\n\nYes, I don’t really like my older sister, but I think the real problem is that she’s 28 and has been taught that it doesn’t matter how much of a mess she lets her life become because my parents or me will always be there to break her fall. Why not just let her struggle so she learns to do better in the future??\n\nSimple example, she makes the same salary I did when I worked an office job. In the three years I had it I was able to save $35k to take a few years off to focus on music. She has had the same type of job as me and has nothing in savings because she goes out drinking and to concerts every weekend. I don’t care that she does this, but then she always complains about not having money. So my parents come help her move because she’s “broke” and then she signs a new lease for a place that costs triple ($1800/mo) what she was just living in!\n\nMaybe Im wrong, I usually try and manange my problems by myself as much as I can. I could easily rent a uhaul myself, or if I did need help, I would at least assure that the people helping were okay with the timeline!\n\nI just feel like my parents enable her and I shouldn’t be expected to participate in this. But everyone in my family resoundingly thinks IATA. AITA? \n\n**TL;DR:** sister and parents expect me to stop what I’m doing in middle of work day to help sister move on a whim.",

      "description": "Background: we're both in our late 20s/early 30s, been together ~18 months. No serious problems in the relationship.\n\nI have a few tattoos and have an appointment to get a new one in a couple weeks. The new tattoo is something I've been thinking about getting for about a year. It's tasteful but sort of large (it'll be on one of my upper arms). My boyfriend has no particular opinion about my tats either way. He doesn't have any himself and doesn't really like them on other people, but he thinks mine are nice (because they are) and has a very strong \"It's your body\" attitude toward anything I want to do with mine. I don't always tell him before I change my hair color or style or get new glasses, and he has never even indicated that he has a problem with this - he respects my bodily autonomy and is attracted to me regardless.\n\nThe other day I brought up the subject of my upcoming new tattoo with an acquaintance and she asked if I'd told my boyfriend about it. I said no, because I honestly didn't think he'd care that much, and she reacted in a horrified way, telling me that such a big permanent modification to my body is something I should obviously consult my partner about, and I'm a bad girlfriend for not thinking to do so.\n\nHonestly, I think it's nonsense - it's not like I'm getting a face tattoo or having someone else's name inked on me. It's partially inspired by (but not directly commemorative of) a friend who passed away last year, who my boyfriend only met once. The piece is meaningful on multiple levels and the artist has a really great style. I just don't think this is something my partner will have a ton of opinions on besides \"Oh, cool tattoo,\" and he certainly wouldn't stop me from getting it. So, would I be the asshole for not consulting him before getting this?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting BF to visit me at work and flirting w/ customers?",
      "description": "I (21 F) have been w/ my BF since senior year of HS. We have a good relationship and typically don’t fight. We go to the same college. He comes from a poor background, but got a full ride so doesn’t have to worry about loans.  My family is middle class but I don’t have a scholarship, we are a big family, and I am going into journalism, so loans are going to be a real issue for me. Because of this I work hard to earn as much as possible.\n\nDuring school I work at the Office of the Bursar, babysit, write people’s papers, and run a small photography business. During the summer I have an internship with the newspaper 4 days a week, work as a receptionist in the evening, babysit, take photos, mow lawns when I can, and bartend on Friday and Saturday nights. I still find time to devote to my BF, family, friends, and school, but it’s hard.\n\nThe bar I work at is mostly 30-60 yr old guys and I get hit on a lot. Some of them are creepy but I don’t mind because I make good tips. My bf is turning 21 this summer and remarked he was excited to come into the bar I work at. I explained that I didn’t feel comfortable w/ that because a)it would be distracting and b)I would feel weird when the guys hit on me and I laugh and play along when he’s right there. He got very upset and accused me of basically cheating.\n\nI told him that I understand where he’s coming from and I get that it’s upsetting to think about other ppl hitting on ur SO and ur SO having to play along with it. But he couldn’t realistically expect me not to be friendly with customers as a female bartender, and while I’ll admit to glamming myself up a little and wearing a push up bra, it’s not like I’m prostituting and I’m not unprofessional about it. And it’s very clear that I have ZERO interest in anything but these guys tips- like I said they are old and mostly gross. I think that although he doesn’t have to worry about loans, he should still understand doing what you have to to make money, since back in HS he did some illegal things for money because he was in a shitty situation, and flirting with customers is nowhere near what he used to do.\n\nBF then says I’m being lazy and undignified by dressing up for these guys and being flirty for a tip. Normally I have pretty thick skin but this really offended me, as I work my ass off, so I called him an asshole and walked away. After cooling off I’m reconsidering my view. I am better at putting feelings aside to get a job done than most people, sometimes to a fault, and maybe it’s unrealistic to expect him to be ok with how I act at my job. He is not a controlling bf and doesn’t usually get insecure, even though I have a lot of guy friends. I would appreciate the input because I love my bf and would feel terrible if I’m actually in the wrong here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are all in the same friend group so we meet on a semi-regular basis.\n\nWe all went to a party at friends house yesterday.

On the way back to my house my best friend drunkenly tells me that he \"begged\" (his words) for her to kiss him and that she obliged three times. I told my best friend that this upset me and he shrugged it off then continued to tell me that he would have sex with her if given the chance.  I haven't talked to either of them yet.

      "description": "So a throwaway because i'm pretty sure my bf knows my actual account, basically last week I was busy with appointments for a few days straight and couldn't really spend time with my boyfriend during the evening, but was still able to spend some time during the day (we are a ldr and mainly talk online). After all those busy days, I had a free day, so I decided to spend some time with a friend I haven't hanged out with in a while, and my bf got very pissed at me, he was in a shitty mood and took it as an excuse to treat me like shit, and claimed that he was hurt because I had a bunch of busy days where I couldn't spend the evening with him and then I choose to spend it with a friend and not him. Then yesterday I asked if I could hang out with my mom for the day and he got in a pissy mood (although we ended up cancelling our plans anyways)  \n\n\nI tried to make a compromise and fix what was wrong by saying I'd spend more time with him and schedule my shit better, so basically I wouldn't hang out with people after a few busy days BUT I asked him to not hurt me anymore and say shitty things to me when he's mad, and he replies \"no promises\" I lose my shit and tell him \"if you're not going to fucking put in the effort in this relationship I won't either\" and he seemed to not care about that at all.   \n\n\nDoes he have a right to be upset? I do care for him and I don't want him to think I put priority on things over him. I also don't want him to be the only thing my life revolves around of course. If I treated him unfairly I'd apologize to him but I'm honestly not sure. Some people say this would be controlling behavior, but wouldn't anyone be pissed if their partner didn't spend enough time with them?  \n\n\nI guess this is two AITAs, should he be allowed to say whatever he wants to me while pissed? I feel everybody has the right to feel what they feel and I don't believe in telling people \"don't be sad\" or \"don't be angry\", because those are reasonable responses to being wronged. Over the course of my life I've had people say really hurtful (imo) things to me when they're pissed, should I just let them say these things because obviously what I've done warrants it? I used to think people were mean to me a lot but I'm starting to follow the phrase \"if everything smells like shit, look under your shoe\"",

Which I expected, I mean I've known her most of my life. I go back to our hometown every couple of months and I would love to see her but she does a lot of coke. Every time I've been back and hung out with her, we always snort coke. I have never done it here in the city I live in and am really trying to make a name for myself in this profession. I just have the issue of knowing if she's doing it, I'll probably participate. Am I the asshole for just avoiding her, my closest friend, because I know I'll do it if I'm around her?",

      "description": "My family on my mother’s side has always been super “close”. I say this because my family thinks they are close with everyone but in reality they only know so much about one another because of everyone gossiping and having a big mouth. Anything that goes on in my family, everyone finds out somehow. So growing up my cousin, my older sister and I were super close. Told each other everything. As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized how toxic my family is and the reason why I was so depressed in the past was because of my family and where I was living. I moved almost 2 years ago to live with my husband in the uk due to the military. I do miss home sometimes but I’m very happy I moved to the uk. Best decision ever honestly. I am somewhat close with my older sister but our relationship definitely has changed. My cousin and I are not close at all now. We grew apart or I should say I grew apart from her because of how toxic she is and how shitty she makes me feel. She has always bullied me growing up, etc. Anyways my family has this negative view of my husband (even though they never had time to get to know him and they can’t just assume how he is). My husband is my best friend and the sweetest man, but my family likes to gossip and start drama. So I’ve been hearing stuff from my sister how I never talk to anyone in the family since I moved and how they are all worried about me (because of my husband). They think my relationship is like my parents which is very offensive to me because my dad is very disrespectful and an asshole. None of my family likes him. Anyways my cousin and I recently spoke on the phone and she was complaining how I never tell her anything anymore and that she always has told me things. I just don’t think I’ll ever want to share things with my family because of how toxic they are. Am I the asshole if I want to stop speaking to most of my family? \n\nBtw I love my younger siblings and one of my eldest brothers, so they don’t apply to this post. ",

      "description": "My dear best friend lost her husband to cancer a few months ago and last week she held a charity ball and fundraiser for the charity that helped during his illness.\n\nIt was a fantastic night and they managed to raise around £22,000 for the charity.\nThere was various different ways of raising money but near the end of the night they held an auction. Our table had many, many drinks throughout the evening and my husband was quite merry. He decided he wanted to bid on a few item but with alcohol involved he ended up going further than he should have. We got a signed painting of a footballer and signed football boots. Worn and signed by a very well known UK football player. He paid £550 in total for these.\n\nIt turns out that neither of the items actually come with an authentication certificate. Neither myself or my husband are over enthusiastic about the purchases but we are glad that the money went to charity. However when I voiced to friends that I was quite upset that there was no way to prove they were authentic and therefore had very little chance of resale, my friends stated I was an asshole for even being annoyed. She said it was for charity and that's all that matters. I still feel like if we've paid an amount of money for something thinking it was genuine we should at least get what we were promised? I know nothing can be done now but I wanted others opinions on this to see if i am being unreasonable or not.",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with my dm regarding my characters personality and gimmick?",
      "description": "So i got into an argument with my dm and parts of my dnd group regarding the handling of my character. I’m playing a charismatic fighter who’s goal is to reform his old vigilante/mercenary group (basically the Minutemen from fallout 4) this requires me to go about recruiting willing people to join my cause, be they mercenaries,beggars, etc etc. This campaign has been planned for about 6 months and I remember deciding in passive aggressive anger over something I’ve forgotten that instead of working up to making the “not” Minutemen I would start with the company already formed with about 120 troops. The dm offered no push back at all on this. \n\nThe session started and we were being hired by the king to go find the queen who had been taken by the generic baddies. He was also sending his son to accompany us and to serve as our blank cheek (meaning we wouldn’t have to pay for anything at all during our campaign) I informed the king that he would have to also pay for my mercenary company’s maintenance costs. Seeing as I had point tons of points into charisma I expected me to be told to make a charisma roll. No such luck. Instead I ended up in an hour long in character discussion with the king about paying for my company. No roles, just arguing. Eventually the king agreed to pay for my company seeing as I planned to use them during the adventure. With that concluded, we set off to the market and tavern to both give orders to my company and also purchase anything we needed before setting off. It was at this point that I asked the prince to buy me plate armor from the local store, which the warforged shop owner cheerful gave to me for free. At Lvl 1. We then proceeded to the tavern to give orders to the company to set up camp elsewhere in the kingdom and wait for further instructions as well as breaking off 10 men to accompany us to the next town for auxiliary work (not participate in combat) as well as to give another player who couldn’t make it to the session a reason to be with the party since he was one of my mercenaries. We set off to the next town, when on the way there we discovered some traps on the road, the dm then said that we disarmed them, no roll, or even who disarmed them, just that we disarmed them with no input from any players. We were then ambushed by ravens and a tree person (I think a dryad). After that was sorted we went to the next town and ended the session there. \n\nOver the next few days the topic of my character came up in the group chat and we were told we would be voting as a party what would happen to my character, explicitly being told that of our group consisting of seven, six would have to agree to banning my character. after a lengthy discussion where I was told that I was ruining the game due to my mercenary company being disruptive to the game flow, me and two other party members argued that the only time they came up in a way that effected the party was in the hour long discussion that was only due to me not being told to roll charisma.  The dm then proceeded to tell me that I had to make a new character because my current one was so disruptive to the game. Every time me and the other two party members pointed out why it was bullshit (the two party members backstories relied on my character existing, me having less effect on the game then other players) we were told by another player that what the dm says is final and we should stop arguing. It was at this point that me and the other two considered leaving since i was being told to drop a character I had invested a bit of work into and that we essentially had no say in what happened despite being told we would. After some more discussion I said that I was perfectly happy to go to my original idea of trying to reform the company instead of already starting with it (as was my original intent) this was followed by another hour of arguing about how I couldn’t recruit people to join us because the dm didn’t want to deal with an entire new party, thus defeating the purpose of my character. We did eventually come to the conclusion to restart the game and allow me to recruit characters to assist our party. \n\nRight now however I’m not sure if my actions were appropriate, the two other party members seem to this so but I’m not sure myself. I acknowledge that starting with the mercenary company was a bad idea done in spite which is why I was so willing to reverse it, but I don’t know about the dm’s response of flat out banning my charismatic fighter. I’m curious to hear others thoughts on this.",

      "description": "My boyfriend gets defensive when I tell him he has a drinking problem. He tells me he “doesn’t qualify” because he doesn’t drink everyday. This is true, but when he does drink he thinks he needs to be hammered. The night will eventually lead to him throwing up and passing out around 6am. He turns into a completely different person when he’s drunk and I usually spend the night cooped up in our bedroom because I don’t want to deal with his antics. \n\nThe thing is, his mom is DEFINITELY an alcoholic. She drinks all of the time and just got out of a DUI (luckily) because I answered my phone for the cops at 2am and came to get her. I know alcoholism runs in families and I don’t want him to end up in the same boat as his mom. \n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend he is an alcoholic and needs help? I love him dearly and just want him to be safe. Also, if I am the asshole, how to I go about fixing this? ",

I'm really torn on this since i don't want to do everything in the appartment by myself but he's also my best friend and i kinda wanna help him out. I'm allready trying to help (for example doing his part when i know hes gonna be extra late or has to get up very early the next morning) but he doesn't seem to recognize that and has labled me as \"lazy\" a few days ago.",

      "description": "I'm 15, in tenth grade, and taking iGCSEs. The way it works in the US, I think, is you take the most important exam of your school career in twelfth grade, the last year of school, right? For us taking *international* (not sure about the UK) GCSEs, we do our single most important exam in year ten. I've known someone who applied to university at 16 with their year ten report card and would you believe it, they got in. It's a very difficult curriculum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight, so term finals are coming up next week, and it just so happens to coincide with National Day, which is in all countries I think, a holiday.  I was thrilled because I'm sort of lagging in physics so it was a great chance to catch up, you know, because school takes away 8 potential hours of revision a day. The day before national day though, our physics teacher hands us our grades (they're shit) and says that because they're shit she'll have us do an extra mini-quiz as a sort of bonus question if we show up on ND.  She also said that even if just one student shows up, she'll do the exam. We all groan but there's no question about it, our grades are awful and we can't afford to not do this. I asked her if she was entirely sure and she got all upset what with me questioning the legitimacy of her offer and all that. Mind you, I have not slept more than 7 hours in the past month and was thankful for this holiday so I could catch up, if for a bit.\n\nSo we show up and she's fucking absent. She's not there. Fucking piece of shit pulled one over on us and didn't even show up. She made us wake up at 5 and half in the morning, having studied the night before, and wasted our holiday while she stayed at home. I was livid, somehow more so than the others, and when we had physics today (this ordeal happened yesterday), I brought it up before she even began teaching. I raised my hand and said how I *only* showed up yesterday to that quiz, and how I was planning on spending that time at home studying, and she got immediately defensive talking about how she was \"terribly sick\" and talking a great deal of shite about how we she placed her health before anyone else and before our education, and how this was \"non of our business\". I told her that she had made it our business by having us show up to school on what would have been a holiday and she said we \"had no right\" \"interrogating\" her over what is \"her legal right\". Clearly, she was thinking of this legally while I was thinking of it ethically. It doesn't quite sit well with me, telling kids to give up their holiday and then standing them up like that, it really doesn't. By the way, \"sick\" my ASS. My absolute ass. Is it a coincidence that she \"got sick\" the only day that nobody could penalize her for it?\n\nBut somehow I found myself wondering if I was being a bit of asshole myself, you know? What do you think?",

      "description": "This has never been an issue for me but so many people told me I’m borderline (sexually) abusing my pets that I don’t know what to believe anymore. \n\nTo set the scene for you, I live in an open space studio apartment which is relatively small and the only room thats divided from the rest is the bathroom, so basically no privacy. I also live with my 2 dogs I adopted. \n\nA few days ago, my friend who occasionally petsits for me called my phone and I ran to answer it, telling her I was just in the shower. She asked me where my dogs were and I told her in the room (I mean where else would they be). This snowballed into a conversation about pets and nudity in our whole friend group and I admitted that I change clothes in front of my pets, walk topless from time to time, basically I live my life without having to be decent in front of my animals. The only thing I 100% do not do is engage in any form of sexual activity around them, ever.  \n\nThis became a raging debate for nearly everyone I hang out with and the replies are 70-30 in favor of it being weird, reasons being they’re animals and their natural instinct is to sexualize females, they cannot consent to seeing my naked body, I’ve even been told that it could count as animal abuse of my pets and if the shelters I adopted them from knew thats what was happening they would refuse the adoptions or take the dogs away. \n\nMy firm opinion has been that it’s my home and they’re animals and to me it’s ridiculous to say they will sexualize me because they see me naked. We aren’t even the same species!!! How can I be attractive to them? I’m not exposing them to any sexual activity they might recognize. Honestly, I never even thought twice about this so I genuinely don’t know if I’m being ignorant to my dogs or if everything is being blown way out of proportion. ",

      "description": "Background: High school Freshman, Male\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago my AP English teacher assigned a year long group research paper on the writing style of “Jane Eyre” and how it contributed to the overall story. She said that we could partner with whomever we wanted, but we must be in groups of 5-7. I have a friend in this class who I’ll call R. I’ve been friends with R for 2 years, but never actually had any classes with him. This year was the first time we have had a class, and it’s also when I realized that I don’t like working with him in school. Despite him being a good student, he sucks up to our teacher on extreme levels, is very extroverted and has a “My way or the highway” mentality that came out on every other project that we’ve worked on together thus far, and is very belittling and doesn’t let anyone else do any work. When we were getting into groups, R asked if I could join. I was on the fence, until I saw the other people he had picked to be in it, all of which were who you could consider “popular” kids that I didn’t really like, including one girl who never stopped talking about herself and always fished for compliments by calling herself ugly, and another girl who was extremely racist, despite being black. They were toxic people, and when R is around them, he acts like a completely different person and is a total asshole to anyone that isn’t them. I also have another friend named A who is in that class, who, like me, is not talkative and very introverted. I asked if he could join, and of course, R told me no because the racist girl doesn’t like Asians very much. \n\nAt this point, I knew that I would be in hell if I joined this group, and decided to decline. I joined with A, Another friend named L, and 2 others that I was acquainted with. R was OK and understanding of this decision, as he knows that we are not compatible when working on projects, but the others in his group called me selfish and an asshole for not joining them and doing a project with my friend, and even tried to convince him not to be friends with me anymore. I think that what I did was completely OK, but since I did have people disagreeing, a decided to this subreddit if I am in the wrong or not. Thank you for your input in advance",

I posted on the school page first to give them a chance to move their car before I reported it and when It didn't get moved I reported it and I got blown off by one of the parking monitors who said she'd try to find who's car it was so I reported it to someone higher up and the car got towed.\n\ni got a lot of shit from people once someone else mentioned that the car had been towed on my post line \"well karma and it was none of your business.\"\n\nAnd \"you probably just seriously ruined someone's day.\" \n\nSo am I the asshole, Reddit?

      "description": "This happened in December but it still gnaws at me sometimes. \n\nI always take drivethroughs when parking if I can (i.e., a situation where there are no cars in either the front or back spot so you can drive right through—don’t know how else to explain it). I don’t like driving in parking lots, reversing to back into a spot or reverse to get out. Just driving straight into a drive through parking spot means you are facing out and can just drive right out when you’re done—no reversing.\n\nSo I was shopping at the mall during Christmas time and even though it was crazy busy I got lucky saw a drive through and just went for it. There’s somebody behind me who sees this and follows behind me so that he would have the back spot and I would have the front.\n\nWell I’m half way in and somebody else coming from the front starts to drive in, so now I’m sandwiched! The man coming from the front is so mad at me—dagger eyes coming from a guy who has been searching for a spot during holiday Christmas shopping time and it’s just taken from him. But i can’t back down because there’s a guy behind me too.\n\nI’m sorry if that was confusing but AITA for taking a drivethrough parking spot during busy Christmas season.",

      "description": "So, my friend, lets call her KC had a BF, we can call him Kenny or whatever. Kenny is a diagnosed sociopath, his brain is literally wired differently from other people, and he doesn't have empathy for anyone, really. He's also really intelligent and manipulative. KC and Kenny first broke up half a year ago, I found him screaming at KC with her in a fetal position, completely hysterical. The week before he had also apparently kicked her lip open.\n\nAfter that he blocked her everywhere, but called me, KCs mother, and other close friends to tell tales about how \"she was hanging out in drug dens\" and other bullshit. He cooled off after I talked to him, mostly because I was about one more thing away from splitting a bottle over his face. Then he started stalking her. He tried getting a job at her job, he has hacked most of her social media at least 5 different times, and has threatened to kill one of our closest friend, this really friendly, awkward guy. \n\nThe problem is that she still has feelings for him, and doesn't want him to get hurt, the only reason I haven't done the brotherly thing and smashed his skull in with some friends. Finally she got rid of him, only for him to weasel his filthy ass back into her life. He has threatened to kill a 15-year old boy, another one of our friends, he has threatened to kill KC, and her DOG, the last of which made me so angry I had to be restrained from stabbing him with a pocket knife. Now they are hanging out again, and I am just so fucking sick of this. \n\nWould I be the Asshole to get him arrested on false charges? I know he has already done some criminal shit, but the only thing our police cares about is drugs, so would it be wrong to ruin his life by planting drugs on him? At this point I feel it's either gonna be that, or me/one of my friends putting a knife through his face, because he doesn't seem to ever stop.",

      "description": "On mobile,sorry for the format and there will be a TL;DR.\n\nSo today I finally brought up the subject to my mother that I wanted my father to sit with his wife during my wedding. He and my mother have been divorced almost 20 years and he remarried back in 2004, she remarried 2 years ago but my stepfather passed due to liver failure. She flipped her shit and got professionally offended,saying she wasnt going to share the church pew row with her,she didnt raise me,and I had some audacity to ask her that,as well as treating her like shit. My stepmother has done nothing but treat my father, myself and my brother amazingly. My mom refuses to meet her because she still holds on to the past and constantly spits poison about her and my father. \n\nMy mother made him leave due to constant infidelity,him in general not being around, and religious differences which they couldn't agree on where my brother and I would go to church.\n\nMy father did continue with his terrible lifestyle up until the point he had a serious medical issue that almost killed him and from there he turned his life around,getting clean,making time for my brother and I, trying to be apart of our lives, and sticking to his religious beliefs.\n\nFor context of our relationship my mother, post divorce for roughly 6 years, would take her anger and frustrations out on me because Iook just like my father and I had given up on myself at school due to constant harassment. Which in turn would cause a vicious cycle, crap beat out of me at school, being put down,wouldnt do my work,bad grades,mom saw grades,beating with a belt. Then her and dad would get into something trivial and she would treat me like crap on top of that,not making me dinner, took everything out but clothes,sheet and a pillow in my room. Would leave me at work with no ride back and would deny my brother coming to get me. Would also try to control every aspect of my life, such as work,extracurricular activities, etc. Which she had managed to do with my brother.\n\nNeedless to say once I could drive myself I made myself scarce and she still tried to control me. What caused me to eventually leave was a fight over the car I had bought with my money. After I had left I would live with friends and bounce around town until I managed to get a decent enough job to live on my own a few years back. Back in 2012 she had finally realized how bad she was treating everyone around her and finally got help but it seems over the past few years shes been regressing.\n\nI feel like the day should be about my fiance and I and celebrating our love. As well as everyone enjoying the day and putting personal feelings aside to celebrate with us, at least being civil with each other. Was I an asshole for my request?\n\nTL;DR:\nTold my mother I wanted my stepmother to sit with my dad during my wedding,bad divorce between parents,moms a control freak,flipped her shit over the request. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I’m sorry for my spelling and my grammar, English is not my first language.\n\nIn the last few months, my (16F) grandparents have come over to our house many times. I don‘t know why but when they see me, they always make rude comments about my appearance or my habits. My grandmother is even worse than my grandfather. She constanly says racist things and I can‘t stand it. Once I tried to tell her that the things she said were wrong and not true but she wouldn’t listen to me, I even had to apologise to her because I was told that it was not okay to argue with her, even if she‘s wrong. In the past, my parents and I would go over to their house during weekends to eat lunch but I haven‘t joined them much the last few months. I make up excuses to not be there. I don‘t see my grandparents that much anymore even if they live just about 2 minutes away from me. Spending time with them makes me feel sad and depressed and when my grandmother throws her rude comments around, I want to cry because she makes me feel so down or because she makes me furious with her attitude. Sometimes, when they‘re at our house, I try to hide or to pretend that I‘m not home. I also try to avoid them at family gatherings because I‘m embarassed when they start to make comments. \n\nI know that my behaviour is kind of wrong and it makes me feel guilty because they‘re my grandparents but AITA for wanting to take care of my mental health?",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago, but it occasionally nags at me. \n\nAn old coworker recently had a baby. She's fairly young, around 20, and wasn't prepared for a baby. However, it seems like she's been doing the best she can and her daughter is safe and happy, for the most part. \n\nWell, she posted a photo of her baby on Facebook in her crib. She was surrounded by toys, laying on a boppy pillow and covered by a blanket. She captioned her picture \"X just woke up so happy!\" or something along those lines, basically indicating that this is how her baby slept. \n\nAnyone who has cared for children knows that this is a huge no-no. Babies are supposed to sleep in an empty crib, otherwise you increase their risk of crib death. \n\nI work in childcare, I have for a few years (Former coworker does not, we worked together at a second job that I had at a grocery store). I am a huge advocate for child safety, especially things like car seats and safe sleeping practices. So many new moms don't know that certain things are unsafe and with the culture of \"don't give me advice unless I ask\", many people just choose not to speak up. I would feel absolutely sick if I saw something like this and by some horrible chance, that child passed away or was injured due to unsafe practices in the future and I chose not to speak up. \n\nI commented on the photo something along the lines of, \"Hey girl, be super careful of letting her sleep with things in her crib like that, it can be really unsafe for little ones!\" I tried my hardest not to sound condescending and friendly. \n\nThe thing is, she wasn't even really bothered by it. She sort of disregarded me, but in an equally friendly manner. I didn't argue with her, I informed her and did my part and felt like that was that. But then, all of her mom friends jumped down my throat about how I shouldn't give unsolicited advice to moms and they were being pretty nasty. They stated that since I didn't have children myself, I shouldn't have opened my mouth. I apparently cannot know anything about caring for babies if I didn't push my own own, despite the fact that I was very active in raising my sister after she was born when I was 16, as well as the fact that I'm state-certified in infant and child care. \n\nI just don't know if I was an asshole here. I think maybe I could've just kept my mouth shut, but this was a baby's safety that was being compromised, and it felt wrong to say nothing. The mom wasn't even entirely bothered, it was her friends more than anything. What do you guys think? Could I go about this better in the future, or just keep my mouth shut completely? ",

      "description": "Not sure if this is the right sub for this; I had a disagreement with an officer this morning and cant find any legal requirement to yield to an emergency vehicle without lights/sirens.\n\nA little back story here; My morning commute is 45 minutes mainly interstate driving of which I typically travel in the passing lane. Posted limit is 65 and I typically travel 75-80 in the left lane by no means do I intentionally hold up the lane. In my area police have a tendency to tailgate (no sirens or lights) and push people out of lane. I think this is an abuse of power, a small one but abuse none the less. Several days ago an officer began tailgating me going 70-75 in a fairly congested area, when I didn't yield the lane the sirens came on and when I was finally able to move over the lights went off till he reached the next person. Rinse and repeat. I have a dash-cam and saved the video but doubt anything will come of it.\n\nFlash forward to this morning. Similar situation I'm traveling about 75 and spot the cop car closing in so I decide to turn cruise control on and keep it at 72 (over 85 is considered reckless in my state) fast enough to still pass the right lane but under the reckless limit. He eventually catches up and begins tailgating, I maintain my speed and stay in lane. He flashes the highs at me and I hold my lane, this continues for about 2 miles and finally the lights and sirens come on.\n\nI pull over and he asks why I didn't just yield the lane to which I ask why he was tailgating me. He says he wasn't and I was being pulled over for going 76 in a 65, I direct his attention to my dash which shows the current settings for my cruise control. He then redirects and says I was delaying him from getting to an accident. At this point I'm getting heated because I feel I'm being lied to and he can tell. I ask him why he wasn't using his sirens or top lights if he was on his way to an accident, he then \"corrects\" me and says it's not an accident but an incident. They are supposedly searching a wooded area for someone...I repeat my question to which he answers \"sirens weren't warranted\" to which I reply \"yielding my lane to high beams isn't warranted\". He tells me I was now being disrespectful, I let him know that it was not my intention but I was fed up with the abuse of authority minor or otherwise and fill him in on my recent experience with an officer using his siren to circumvent other commuters and follow up with another question. If your on the way to assist in a search why are you wasting time pulling me over wouldn't it have been faster to use your emergency equipment from the start? After some more round about question and answer he hands me back my documentation and tells me it seems to him I've had a bad experience with another officer and was having a bad morning so he'd let me go with a warning. We shake hands and he pulls off back into the passing lane with no sirens to his \"incident\".",

I start to tell them that Creepy has touched me multiple times, different occasions. They decide to text Creepy and confront him about this and some other things, I was there with them and wanted to confront him too since that what he did was weird. After texting him, Creepy calls me and I hand it over to my other friend (Chad) and Creepy starts to yell into the phone that he didn't touch me and cant recall the memory. Creepy hangs up and my friends and I go back to playing games. (Creepy texts chad saying that he is going to tell his parents about this)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to when I'm home. I get a text from one of Creepys friends (which I'm also friends with) saying that Creepy is in deep shit with his parents because they were next to him when he called. I told Creepys friend (Gabe) the stuff that Creepy did to me, and he says that its not sexual harassment (which I didn't say it was) and that I was being a scumbag over a joke. Ive told Creepy to stop, but I guess he didn't hear me or just ignored it.\n\n\\~What Creepy did to me\\~\n\n* Touched my legs multiple times \n* Put his hand on my thigh and kept it there for at least a minute\n* Touched one of my breasts with a hammer\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm the ass hole for putting it out there, and what I should do to try and fix it.

      "description": "Hey so this is currently unfolding as I type this. I'll attach pics at the end so you can see my friends positions as well. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nI just graduated college and want to live in a city closer to the company where I will be starting work. My friend from college (who shall now be referred to as Friend 1), who has been graduated, and I brought up the idea of living together in the said city after I graduated.  December 27th I texted him saying that we should live together like we talked about, and he responded by saying he is about to move in with our other friend (who shall now be referred to as Friend 2) in January, but he'll ask Friend 2 if he would like to all move in together. We start a group chat that day.\n\nBackstory: We were all in the same fraternity and have known each other for four years now. Friend 1 is a close friend while Friend 2 is a friend I enjoy, though I do dislike somewhat because he can be obnoxious and rude. \n\nFour days later Monday December 31st I'm told to fill out an application for an \"amazing apartment\". I am currently out of town at this point celebrating the New Year and don't really think about it.\n\nWednesday January 2nd Friend 1 asks me again to fill out the application and I respond apologizing for lagging and that I also want to make sure I want to actually live there. Friend 1 responds that he understands but urges me to hurry. I respond that I will get back to him ASAP after talking with my mom about it. He responds saying he bailed on the 2 bedroom houses he and Friend 2 were looking at because they were \"juiced\" on this apartment\n\nThursday January 3rd Friend 1 says they need my application by Saturday or else. I respond asking if she is able to show me the apartment before then. Friend 1 says he'll ask as well as asking what is holding me back from committing. I say I don't think it's wise to make a huge financial decision without even seeing the place and without asking people for advice. This prompts both friends to post stories on their Facebooks searching for a new 3rd roommate. I don't say anything to it. Friend 1 later tells me to trust him and Friend 2 tells me to fill out the application anyway to hold our place as first in line. I concede with Friend 2 and fill out the application. Friend 1 arranges for us to visit the apartment on Saturday and to turn in other paperwork needed.\n\nSaturday we visit the apartment and turn in our paperwork. I thought the place was all right, while they are in love with it. We then spend the rest of the day hanging out and getting food.\n\nSunday Friend 1 tells me we were approved to live there and that he wants to sign the lease. I tell him I'm not 100% sold on it because I don't love the place/I'm not sure if I want to live with Friend 2.\n\nNow I'm currently getting chewed out in the group chat. See pics below.  \n\n\nAITA?\n\n  \n[screenshot of groupchat](https://imgur.com/a/mvL9wlV)",

My mother has a heart of gold, even though her siblings are all huge pieces of shit. My father is more pragmatic. Regardless, we are all very close.\n\nSo, the Friday before memorial day, I come home, after my 5th 14hr (13.5 hr paid) day in a row. I drive tractor trailers and after a 13+ day fighting holiday traffic to drive 600 miles (with only 11hrs drive time for those unfamiliar with DOT regulations) I'm mentally exhausted. I come home to find our piece of shit l, meth addicted uncle in our living room.\n\nMy mother expects me to be pleasant and converse, but I'm not hugely interested. I'm dead, I've been averaging 55hr work weeks for the past 9 months. \n\nI join the conversation for a short time and am informed that he will be living with us short term. I wait the weekend to catch my father privately (he is an over the road trucker running a sleeper with my brother, who also lives with us) and ask his feelings on the situation. He is livid. Short term isn't short term, the uncle thinks 5 years is short term. My father, brother and I don't agree.\n\nFast forward 7 months. The uncle ODs, loses the job we got him, and is broke. Both parents want him out, and he leaves, but he has fuck tons of shit in our home. I'm talking a complete 20ft uhaul worth of shit. \n\nMy mother wants me, my brother and my father to load the shit into a rental box truck, move it to a storage unit he has easy access to, 2 hrs away, and pay for both the truck and storage unit. The storage unit rental is for 2 months... \n\nThis is garbage, I don't want anything to do with this, I, my brother and my father didn't even want this drug addicted piece of shit in our house. \n\nI suggested that I would put out the price of a rental box truck, storage for 2 months and let him cherry pick whatever shit he can fit in his truck for  the price it would cost us otherwise in cash, if he would take the cash and I can put the shit directly in the garbage and never be bothered with him again. \n\nNo one wants this piece of shit around, and if I added up our hourly rate for work, which we could volunteer for on Saturday, the time between the 3 of us is worth $2850, I'm offering $500 and the shit is straight in the garbage. My mother is unhappy with that option.\n",

      "description": "My son is five. He’s going through something. A stage in identity development, my wife calls it. His sister is seven and he’s taken to wearing her old clothes. Thus far, this has been largely confined to the house. However, on Halloween last year we decided to be more lenient and let him go as a unicorn, which was a somewhat feminine costume, but not quite drag either. \n\nI would say the whole dress up thing has been going on since he was three (so only like two years).\n\nAnyway this coming holiday we’re all dressing up, which is pretty normal in my family (when we do Christmas celebrations with my wife’s parents, it’s more lax so outfits aren’t as big a concern). My daughter is wearing a pretty elaborate, puffy red dress that looks like what the pageant kids wear (slightly over the top, but my wife picked it). \n\nMy son saw my daughter’s dress and for whatever reason became obsessed with wearing something similar. I have no idea why he’s so fixated on this but he’s managed to wear my wife down to the point where she thinks we should just let him wear a dress. \n\nI am personally unwilling to let my son’s outfit be the main point of discussion on Christmas Eve (and it would be). I put my foot down and said that this just isn’t the time for this sort of experimentation. He doesn’t necessarily have to wear a little suit, but it’s not going to be a dress either. \n\nI figured I would make it known several days in advance to avoid a meltdown the day of. My son became hysterical and it didn’t go over well with my wife. She thinks I should just let it go but she also is a fairly passive, unargumentative person so I don’t see her fighting me on it either. \n\nLook, I am not trying to be the villain in this scenario. I just think that the holidays aren’t the right time for this sort of thing. Christmas Eve comes once a year and I want it to be drama and spectacle-free. Does that make me the a-hole, Grinch in this situation?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok, so all of this has been unfolding in the past week or so since I’ve been back from school for the holidays. I (22M) go to a school about 3 hours from my hometown, so I’m not home often and would rather not have to work during my time off. I go to school for engineering, which I find really hard and mentally straining, so when I get time off, I just wanna relax, see old friends, not really do much. \n\nHere’s where my brother and dad come in. We’ll  call them Matt and Stan, respectively. They opened up a restaurant about a month ago. My first day back in town, I decide to go check it out since I haven’t seen it yet. Everything was fine here, I ordered some food, chatted a bit with Matt and went home. A day or so later, Matt (30M) comes to visit (he doesn’t live at home) and he pretty much commands me to come in and help out the next day. He didn’t even ask, it was more of a statement, which I pointed out to him was a rude way of asking for help anyways. It’s like I’m expected to help, even tho I had nothing to do with the business before and never really wanted to anyway. So even after I point this out, he still doesn’t properly ask (effing frustrating) but I say I’ll come in anyway. \n\nI get there the next day around 11, and he’s FULLY staffed. He’s got a prep guy and girl chopping veggies and making rice and potatoes and what not, and a grill guy to help him out with orders. Plus my dad’s floating around doing misc. things here and there. Around 4 pm, another staff member showed up to work the till , do dishes and wipe tables. So there wasn’t much to do, and he didn’t have any set plan or tasks for me ahead of time. He was like “uhh, okay, peel all the potato’s in this bag.” I felt totally under-utilized, but whatever I didn’t want to be there anyway. \n\nAll together there’s 6 of us in this tiny kitchen, which IMO would run way smoother with like 3 or 4, plus the till girl that showed up later. After I was done peeling potatoes, there was pretty much nothing left for me to do. I spent around 3 hours just wiping stuff down, sweeping, little bit of dishes here and there. I’ve worked in kitchens before and wouldn’t mind helping the business if I could do some of the cooking and order preparing. I think that stuff is fun. But he didn’t want me helping with that because he hired people for it, so I was just loitering around, really. I felt awkward when customers saw me in the back doing nothing. And I felt awkward standing in the back watching the other employees doing work. It was just weird. Also there’s tension between my dad and bro, which I guess is expected for new business owners, but they often bickered with each other in front of staff and customers which made me feel even more awkward. Anyways, I figured they didn’t need my help, so I didn’t go in the next day.\n\nA couple days later, Matt comes over again, and he asks why I’m not showing up to the restaurant to help out. That was literally the first thing he said to me, like I was one of his employees getting in trouble for skipping out on work. I don’t like confrontation at all, and Matt is effing stubborn, won’t matter what I say about how he’s fully staffed, he’ll expect me to come in anyways because of ‘family’. So I give him an excuse about waking up late and how my sleep schedule is off since finals, which it actually was.  \n\nThe next day I didn’t go again, I couldn’t sleep that night, I was tired and irritable and didn’t really wanna leave the house. This time my dad tries to guilt me. I had just gotten back from a McDonald’s drive thru trip. Similar to Matt, he doesn’t say hi, he immediately asks “why would you get McDonald’s and not come to the store and get food there? You don’t have to help, you should just be there for family.” He wants me to just go hangout at the store?? I dunno, felt like a trap to get me there to do the little bullshit tasks  again that he’s got employees for. \n\nNo one else is getting this treatment in my family. My little brother (14M) helps out but he’s getting paid and I’m not. My other brother (26M) was smart enough to clearly state he wants nothing to do with this and so he doesn’t get bothered with it and doesn’t live at home so he’s not constantly guilted by my dad like I am. \n\nAITA here? My dad says I HAVE to go in tomorrow and the next day because I’m being rude and disrespectful to the family. Tomorrow is Friday :/. I don’t wanna work during my break, especially on the weekend. Uhhhhh. \n\nAny suggestions on how I can deal with this would be greatly appreciated. All of this stresses me out and gives me anxiety, honestly.\n\nI imagine I’ll make an update tomorrow about how ‘work’ went.\n\n",

      "description": "Normally, I let things like this go because it's not worth fighting over. But he keeps bringing it up and before I tell him that I don't think it counts, I'm looking for unbiased opinions. \n\nBackstory: Eight years ago, when we moved in together, I had to find a home for my two cats because his dog food not get along with cats and he insisted that she would kill them. So one of our mutual friends took them in and I've honestly regretted it ever since. But at the time, the deal was always that when his dog died, I could have a cat again. His dog died a couple years later, but he had already gotten a second dog before she passed, and didn't want another animal. Okay, fine. But then we ended up fostering two *other* dogs in the meantime. Through the years he's always said he hates cats. And he's \"teased\" me about there never being a deal that I would adopt another cat. We ended up spending a lot of time with friends who had two cats and two dogs who are not well behaved and he constantly talked about how nice it is to only have one animal and how he doesn't ever want more than one. It got to the point this past autumn, where I told him that if I knew he was going to be like this, I would have never moved in with him and rehoming my cats should have been a deal breaker.\n\nLast Christmas: The only \"gift\" he gave me was a cat that he basically picked. He went to the shelter of his choice, filled out the paperwork, met the cats, told them which ones he liked, then \"surprised\" me with it one day by taking me there and letting me \"pick\" from the ones with personalities the shelter had deemed acceptable based on what he told them. I wasn't allowed to look at kittens, which is what I wanted tbh. \n\nI don't care that he didn't get me a gift, he really doesn't ever. But I don't think it's fair for him to say that the cat was an actual gift, especially when he wants to use it as brownie points later. We agreed years ago that I could adopt another cat. \n\nAm I the asshole or was this not an actual gift? ",

      "description": "I have a very close knit friend group of about five people but had one friend that I considered my best friend. We all met only a year ago when we started college together but in that time we have become extremely close. However about a 2 months ago my best friend started spiraling downwards in terms of depression, drinking, and smoking. Now my other friends and I both drink and smoke on occasion but the amount she did it started to be a little worrying. We all tried to be there and support her but she pushed us away. Fine. Like she can choose to open up to whoever like that's fine, but what became really irritating is that whenever we hung out with people outside of this friend group she would insult us to these other people. Talking about things that were said in confidence to her and making us out to be bad friends to her. It always felt like a slap, since we were best friends and we tried to be there for her and all. Then she'd notice that we weren't exactly happy about this and get mad because \"we keep getting mad at her and there's nothing she can do that's right\". This went on and then about three weeks ago she dropped all contact with me and my other friends. We were dead to her overnight, and she immediately spread lies about us to any mutual friends that we had. I was honestly devastated about this.\n\nNow she says she wants to have a talk and see if we can get things back on track, but frankly I don't want to get things back on track. I frankly don't want to be friends with her again. My other friends think it's a good idea though, AITA?",

I had given some advice and I wanted to make sure she was alright, as she seemed disheartened and distressed over her relationship.

      "description": "Sorry for mobile formatting, also not really sure how detailed I need to be so here goes. \n\nMy roommate (RM) started dating this girl (GF) about two months ago, and at first there wasn't a problem. She was over a lot, but they were always chill and we (me, my live-in boyfriend (BF), RM, and GF) hung out a lot, and they didn't really do anything to cause issues. \n\nAbout two weeks into their relationship though, they went to the bar and got into a really big argument. She went off on him and he ended up coming home, passing out, and locking her out with all her stuff inside our apartment, including her purse and car keys. I woke up at about 2 AM to GF pounding on the door extremely loudly (I later noticed that the window on our front door was loose due to this) trying to get in because all her stuff was here and she had nowhere to go and no way to get home. \n\nA side note, I had a really bad roommate previous to this one who was very loud and had people over all the time, leading to multiple noise complaints and us being on thin ice with our landlords in that regard, which is where most of my concerns stem from. \n\nAnyways, after that I was wary of having her over again and asked RM to try not to have her over as often, which he did, and things were fairly uneventful after that. But of course, I wouldn't be here asking if I'm the asshole if that were the end of it, so that brings us to part 2. So about two weeks ago they come home from the bar, and she starts going off on him again. This time she's screaming at him at the top of her lungs and wakes me up (I'm a fairly heavy sleeper) again. I can hear him trying to quiet/calm her down, but she's not having it and just keeps yelling until she finally passes out. That was the end of it for me and I told him I didn't want her over here anymore because of how crazy she is when she drinks, and since we live in a very bar-heavy area, that's pretty much every night she's over. \n\nOriginally things were fine, he was just going between staying here and at her place (she lives with her parents I think) and I thought that was the end of it. But maybe 2-3 days ago she messaged me to apologize, she said she thinks she was drugged that night because she didn't remember anything and that not being able to have any alone time with RM was having a bad effect on their relationship and asking for a second chance. \n\nI feel bad because I like them both and don't want them to break up or have problems because of me, and he's an adult and banning his girlfriend from our shared home somehow feels wrong, but I'm the only one on the lease here so I'm the only one that would have any long term effects if we were evicted, plus it's happened twice before already and I don't want to risk losing my home because of someone who doesn't even live here. So, AITA? Any suggestions on how to remedy this or any possible compromises would be greatly appreciated too.",

      "description": "High school student here (junior), Im gonna be honest and say that I haven't had the best success with relationships. Mostly cause I dont know what to do after 1st base and I have strict parents lol. But not too long ago I got my really first \"girlfriend\" after our 2nd date. Allot of the girls that I had been interested in in high school before had either told me that I wasn't their type, or that we should stay friends, or that I wasn't even in their league. (Completely fine with this, they aren't required to like me for any reason.) Most of these times their denials ended up circling around our grade and making me kind of a laughingstock. HOWEVER, after I posted on my Snapchat/Instagram stories as did her about our relationship. Many of the girls in my class who had rejected me in someway have now snapped me things like do you want to hang out? or come to a party with me? or just other requests I had never been given when I was single. One of the girls that had flat out said that she didn't like me personally texted me if I wanted to sit next to her at lunches and called me Hun.  I felt kinda mad because of the complete 180 in their behavior and I don't believe this is a prank because of the girls that have replied to me are from COMPLETELY different social circles and for the most part hate one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I confronted them about this Publically and/or Privately?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: When I say \"them\" I only talking about 3-4 Girls who I have asked out or tried to ask out in my highschool career.

I was definitely a 10 out of 10.\n\nI could not find any tickets for the musical that cost below several hundred dollars. His financial situation is a little iffy, so I couldn't ask him to spend all that money. I also couldn't afford to pay for two tickets myself. And I knew he would feel bad if I went without him.\n\nYou can probably guess what I did: I bought a ticket for a day when he was busy and went to the musical by myself, and I didn't tell him about it.

So my view is very different, but I did share my traumatic experiences with him.\n\nAnyways, R is very into BDSM and masochism etc. in his own words, he likes to push the boundaries of what people think about sexuality. Whatever. Cool. However, this often leads to him sharing details with me about his sexual experiences that make me very uncomfortable. To him, that’s the point. To me, he’s making me anxious and relive certain things I’d rather not think about.\n\nWhenever I ask him not to, I’m usually met with accusations of being a prude. I do have a sex life and am open to new things, but I only enjoy these discussions in the privacy of my long term partner. \n\nR thinks I’m an asshole for being so “close minded”. Im not trying to be, but graphic details about blood and the sound of a female being hit makes me mad anxious.\n\nAITA??\n\n**TL;DR:** friend has an edgy POV about sex that makes me uncomfortable due to my traumatic past, thinks ITA for asking for discretion",

      "description": "For context, I was finishing up grad school in a different state and the business my husband is taking over is the the state we live in now. Last April, We decided it would be important for our future if he came bak to the state we currently live in about 6 months before me in order to get his business started and to have a little money saved up for when I moved back as well. He came back out to help me move in early November. \n\nThere were a few nights I woke up to him having some sort of anxiety attack and he would tell me how sorry he was and that he didn't deserve me. I would always calm him down and convince him to come back to bed. He finally (and randomly) admitted to me in late November that over the summer he had gone out drinking alone with one of his (female) best friends. They had gotten drunk and rather than going out to the house he was staying (about a 45 minute walk) , he went home with his friend and cuddled with her in her bed. \n\nThe issue is that he lied to me about it for almost 6 months without showing any remorse or conflict until he came back out with me, and I had visited him for almost a month about a week after the incident occurred, and he never felt the need to mention it. When I asked him about it further and if there had been any texts between them the day after, he lied about there being bad service or something and that the texts were all missing (which only an idiot would believe) and when I pressed him further he admitted to deleting all the texts between them during that time period. I asked for his phone and he reluctantly gave it to me, and when I opened the texts between him and the girl he had a message written out to her but not sent that basically said how he was an idiot for lying to me and that I found out and that he was sorry. I decided to hit send on the message, and the next morning she responded that she \"felt sick\" about the whole thing since it happened. \n\nAbout half of the friend I have talked to believe something more happened with the girl (who happens to have a reputation for sleeping with the boyfriends of other girls) and the other half believe that he loves me too much to ever betray me like that. He has apologized profusely and we had a big blowout where I explained how our trust had been majorly damaged and that it will take a lot of time to rebuild. It has now been almost 3 months since he admitted that to me and I still have trouble with trusting him and I have not gotten over it. He says if I am going to forgive him I need to do it fully and not continue to bring it up, which I have previously when we fight. AITA?",

      "description": "Been dating her for about 2.5 years. She has always had a problem with my son’s mother. Severe jealousy. It started when she went through my phone and saw that her (son’s mother) and I talk like we’re friends. Sending funny pictures back and forth, etc. (My son was 3 then, he’s about to be six now.)\n\nI dial it back, because I reason while I see her as my son’s mother, my GF sees her an an ex. I can see where I could be wrong.\n\nSome of her complaints are legitimate. Some of her complaints are unreasonable. It’s gotten to the point that I have a difficult time communicating with my son’s mother about anything because any amount of contact gets me a tremendous amount of grief. \n\nLast mother’s day I got some canvas picture frames made. One for my mom, one for my GF of her kid, and one for my son’s mother of our son. \n\nBeing completely honest I was dreading my GF finding out that I did that. It’s something we used to do all the time. Christmas, birthdays, etc. We’d get each other a small gift “from our son.” Now, not so much. But mother’s day is specifically for having a kid, so I still wanted to.\n\nHowever the place I had the canvas pictures made ran out of the smaller size I ordered, and upgraded one to a larger size. Which happened to be the one I was giving to my son’s mother. \n\nSo I lied and I said I didn’t get my son’s mother anything. I knew she’d be upset at getting the same type of gift as her (it would make them equal in her eyes.) - if she saw that my son’s mother was larger she wouldn’t believe me and assume it was intentionally telling my son’s mother I still have feelings for her. \n\nWell last night it came out. We dropped my son off with his mom, and my son demanded my GF come up to the house so he could show her something in his. She wouldn’t normally be around my ex, but my son insisted. And she saw the canvas picture of my son hanging up from last Mother’s Day.\n\nSo last night I got the silent treatment. Going into this day. When I asked her to talk to me, she went off on me as expected. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to take my son to visit my mom anymore?",
      "description": "I'm feeling very torn about this predicament and am not sure if I'm making the rational choice.\n\nFor several years now my mother and youngest brother have lived in a neighborhood that has steadily become more and more unsafe. Lots of domestic violence crimes, drug deals, suspicious activities, constantly smells of weed, etc. There's usually a cop somewhere in the neighborhood but things never seem to get better.\n\nLast week a delivery driver was shot and killed on my mother's street. The police still haven't caught the perpetrator, and she was supposed to watch my 7 month old son tommorow so I could go to a concert.\n\nObviously I told my partner about this and we agreed the neighborhood isn't safe and that we don't feel comfortable with him being in the neighborhood (especially at night). So I talked to my mom about our decision and she was obviously hurt about it.\n\nShe told me that I didn't need to tell my partner about what happened so that she could have watched my son, but I don't think it's right to hide that kind of information from my partner. She's also worried now that she won't get to see her only grandchild now because of it.\n\nNow, to be transparent I should state that my family has always lived in poorer neighborhoods and gangs, drugs, and just general \"hood\" life is nothing new to me as I grew up in it. But my son is so little and like any parent I don't want him to be exposed to that life even though I was.\n\nTo make the issue even more complicated my youngest brother (who is also autistic) has been having a lot of problems with anxiety and feeling \"abandoned\" since my other brother and I both moved out of my mom's house. He has asked me numerous times to visit more often but after the homicide, I don't even want to drive through the area, let alone stay there any extended period of time.\n\nAm I the asshole because I don't want to go to that neighborhood anymore? Even if it means my son and I don't get to see my family as often? I like to think I'm a logical person but it's hard to take out my emotions from the equations and I'd like some outside perspective. Any help is appreciated.\n\nTLDR; My mom lives in a bad neighborhood and I don't want to bring my son to visit her because of recent crimes having taken place there.",

I'm practically blind without them I think I'm minus 4 and my parents don't want me to get contact lenses for some reason. Anyways there is this one dude in my class that really does not like me and finds a way to put me down all the time. I don't care really. I do well in school and I'm off to University next year to study Computer Science so who cares. \n\nAnyways in soccer today I scored multiple goals and i was feeling proud. We took a break afterwards and he literally kicked the ball so hard into my face and my entire glasses shattered and the shattered lenses cut up my face and was bleeding. I'm convinced he did this on purpose. The way he aimed the ball was just too obvious. It was obvious he was aiming for my face and had a smug look on his face when my glasses were in pieces on the floor. These were expensive ones too. Hugo Boss. He knew what he was doing. I told the principal and he told the principal I was a liar and I was trying to make him look bad and that I was accusing him and the principal told us she will call us in for further questioning. ",

      "description": "I'm leaving for Marines boot camp in about a month, and this concert is likely the last I'll perform at for a long time, and the last time I'll get to see my friend (F). However, her ex, who for simplicity we'll just call X, also is in the band. They broke up recently because for he has never been emotionally supportive of her, and only ever really talks about himself or his own interests. Whenever she tries to reach out to him, he'll pull some excuse like \"oh I'm too tired, I've had a long day\". Now, I know his schedule. It's one class every other day and band rehearsal every Monday/Wednesday/Friday. Not that exhausting if you ask me. After they broke up, he lashed out at her, saying he never wants to hear from her again and has begun shit talking her to everyone they know. It's gotten to the point where she's afraid of him, physically and emotionally. As far as I know, he hasn't physically hurt her before but I feel her concerns are genuine given his reaction to the breakup. I don't want her to be in a position where she feels extremely unsafe, but at the same time I know that I'd be able to stop him should he try anything given that I'm stronger and faster at this point. Anyway, before I ramble too much and go to bed, WIBTA? \n\n\nTL;DR: I want to invite a friend who just had a nasty breakup to a concert I'm performing in that their angry ex is also performing in",

      "description": "Okay so I’m gonna start this off by saying me [18] and my girlfriend [17] have been together 6 months and I am not gonna do anything drastic like break up.\nMy girlfriend used to do a decent amount of drugs at parties like a year before we started dating. Since we’ve been dating she’s been very anti drug with me, I have done stuff just not as much and only over a month last summer. Around January she getting drunk with her friends and smoked some weed which I have no problem with btw. Recently however she’s started saying I’m too nice for drugs and has been pointing it out to her sister and friends and all that (it’s said as a sort of half joke but still). I’ve told her I don’t like it and tried to debate it but it didn’t help.\n\nToday I made a joke in poor taste about her mum not being around all the time (just because of her mums work and boyfriend) which I thought was okay considering it’s a topic she’s made jokes about. She told me she was hurt by it so I apologised, fairly standard. I then told her I find the “too nice to do drugs” thing offensive at which point she said “I don’t know why your offended”. I explained it to her and to be fair at the end I added “it’s really not hard to understand” which was uneeded. This is where shit hit the fan and she brought up the joke I made earlier and apologised for. We argued and it ended in me apologising just because I didn’t want to argue more. She refused to give any ground and in the end her apology was “I’m sorry you got offended”.\n\nSince, we’ve had a discussion and agreed this sorta thing needs to be dealt with a lot better next time but I’m still pretty mad she hasn’t apologised. It feels like she’s not being empathetic because she doesn’t understand it hurt me.",

      "description": "This isn’t really an issue anymore, but I was recently reminded of this situation and thought I’d ask what you all think.\n\nA while back my neighbours moved out, and a new old (~60) woman moved in alone. Soon after this time, since it was in the holidays, she told me that I had been keeping her up late at night for the last few weeks, and while she had been trying to deal with it patiently, it’d gotten too much.\n\nI of course agreed and tried to be quieter, since I didn’t really know this was an issue until then, however from my perspective, no matter how quiet I was or how late I was up, it was either too loud or too late (even whispering is too much for her to sleep through).\n\nWhen trying to compromise, since this situation was annoying for me in that I was almost never able to play with friends anymore, and she couldn’t sleep as well; I discovered that her extent of effort in getting to sleep was just listening to music to cover me up, but that wasn’t working since after getting to sleep, once the music stopped I would end up waking her up again. Sometimes as late as 3AM (but very rarely)\n\nI did suggest a few other solutions, such as sound proofing the walls, buying better noise cancelling headphones, or moving rooms, agreeing to fund or otherwise help with any of them, however she didn’t want to do any of them, due to effort, comfort when sleeping, and feeling unsafe in the other rooms in the 3 bedroomed house she lived alone in... \n\nSince I understood that those solutions could easily be reversed onto me, the issue here for me is really who’s responsibility is it? \n\nI definitely don’t feel responsible for her good sleep, and don’t feel like I should change my actions, and I am really only changing my actions to avoid the hassle of an angry neighbour.\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": " I'm in a house of 4, and one of the two girls, Betty (fake name), has been the following:\n\nSocially not being a comfortable presence in the room\n\nMoments of crying downstairs uncontrollably due to a high level of stress and depression\n\nCertain moments of lashing out at us due to her own personal issues\n\nNot accepting that things may be deteriorating.\n\nMy other girl roommate is stating there is a clear sign of gaslighting occurring between the two of them. Betty, who is much older, has asked this girl to not interact with Betty's friends when she is not present, made unbecoming comments of this girl's appearance, and believes that they are supposed to be really great friends while primarily taking up this girl's time for her own needs. Basically overall a shitty friendship relationship with poor ass communication on both parts. Their relationship now stands completely broken with Betty thinking she can fix it and the other girl not wanting to live with her, and considering moving out herself.\n\nMy other guy roommate has this genuine feeling of unease around her. He has stated \"I am not comfortable sometimes coming in the front door of my own house\". This is the nicest guy around and the person who brought Betty into the mix. He has expressed that this is not a good fit.\n\nWith both of my other roommates expressing it's not a good fit (put lightly), along with me for the most part not seeing eye to eye with this woman, I felt that it was important that I communicate to her that I didn't think this 6 month old housing situation was any longer a good fit. I asked her to consider finding new housing, but expressly stated she doesn't have to as that is her right, we are all on the lease. I offered to help her find a new place and do whatever I could do to smooth the transition. I figure it's good to get it in the open.\n\nShe said no. My other guy roommate has on his own asked the same of her at this point. Regardless of that, she has communicated she feels it isn't fair and that we have bullied her (probably have at this point just by all of us expressing our issue we have with her (separately)) and she wants to stay and fix this. She definitely feels like we are at fault here as well, that we are scapegoating, and that we can't just fix a problem by \"kicking someone off the island\". I just straight up disagree that this is just that. I genuinely think this isn't worth trying to work on when we are all just getting to know each other.\n\nWe all could have definitely communicated better about these issues we have with Betty and done so earlier on, but the fact of the matter is we didn't, and now we're here. So I operated with what I still have. Not defending myself, just explaining that us, the rest of the house, could have done a better job communicating our issues earlier. Thanks!",

About 3 women actually use the shower: I run to work, another woman bikes to work, and another woman goes to the gym before work. Bike lady starts work at 7 and is often done before me and gym lady arrive. I work at 7:50 but I also do my makeup and meditate so I come early. Gym lady starts work at 7 but usually arrives while I am in the shower.\n\nI take longer in the shower and gym lady is mad about it. If we arrive at the same time I always let gym or bike lady go first. But, if I am already showering, gym lady often calls out to me in the shower to tell me she's waiting and is visibly irritated with me when I come out. She arrives with barely enough time to shower and is sometimes late, so I'm sure waiting for me is very frustrating.\n\nI timed our showers the other day. Both bike and gym lady take about 4.5 to 5 minutes in the stall. I took 9 minutes and 45 seconds. This includes undressing, drying off, and dressing time. However, bike lady and gym lady work in the operating room and are required to wear hats. I work in the recovery room with my hair uncovered. I wash my hair, they do not wash their hair. I do not relax in the shower, the extra 4 minutes is strictly hair related time.\n\nTechnically I'm taking twice as long in the shower, but I feel justified in washing my hair, given I don't cover my hair for work.

      "description": "Jess and I have been friends for years and I have always got a sense of insecurity from her. She would often try to put me down to bring herself up. \n\nFor example, she would insult my weight in front of other people. I am super skinny and she’s a bigger girl. So, there would always be these snide comments every now and then. I talked to her about it (meaning I told her if she couldn’t keep it to herself I just wouldn’t associate with her) and she cut back a lot. \n\nI also got a call from a friend Liam, who she was trying to hook up with even though she had a boyfriend at the time. He told me about how she was weirdly obsessed with nagging him about the fact that he had a crush on me before. He warned me to stay away from her because she was crazy. Now, Liam and I hadn’t talked in months and I wouldn’t say that our relationship was that close. Yeah, we had liked each other, but it never went anywhere. Jess has also messaged me telling me about the fight and the two stories were vastly different. Not sure who to trust. I just took a big step back from her and Liam went back to not talking to me. So, I guess I can say I was kinda annoyed with him and less inclined to listen. \n\nA few months later, I am with my fiancé (boyfriend at this time.) Jess meets him and things seemed to go off well. Then, she messaged him telling him how she was upset because she had seen him being sweet with me and it hurt her Because she had no one. She then told him that he didn’t need to be hugging on me and loving on me at all. This really pissed me off. I ended up confronting her and she blamed being depressed because her ex was walking in and out of her life. (She’s his booty call. She just ignores everyone telling her that.) Our relationship got onto thin ice and we didn’t really mend from it. Well, months later,  she just starts bashing my relationship and acting like he’s a horrible guy because his ex is stalking us, even though it’s been a constant issue from the beginning. He literally moved and changed his number to get away from her. Also, she sends my other friend a message complaining about my couple pictures on Facebook and basically says I’m deliberately being mean because I know she’s single. Well, after seeing these messages I just blocked her off Facebook and block her number. \n\nThis came up the other day and I’m wondering if I’m wrong for not telling her why I blocked her (she complained about it to someone else.)

      "description": "Hi, I am using a throwaway account because I am active on a few subreddits that I know I'd get huge backlash from this opinion. Some background, I have a friend that I went to school with, who is black and is extremely politically active with social justice. We became friends by happenstance because I was playing a game on my Nintendo DS and she saw it over my shoulder and we talked about the game and played it together quite a lot. \n\nFast forward to high school and she changes quite a bit, she gets more outspoken on politics, and Ferguson happens and she becomes an entirely new person. Despite all of this, I tried not to take any of her posts on social media personally, figuring that she was just venting her frustrations and we were still friends so I didn't engage any posts on social justice topics. Eventually getting exposure to the subject I started to see where she was coming from and I am very sympathetic to the idea that black people are systematically disenfranchised in our society. \n\nA few days ago she was talking about something called digital blackface, which is when someone portrays themselves as black online, when they are not, specifically for the purposes of trolling and wasting the emotional labor of black activists. I was thinking wow, that's crazy that people do that, I didn't know that was a thing. A few hours later into our conversation she said something funny and I reacted with a reaction gif of Charlie Murphy from the Chappelle show laughing realy hard. My choice of this gif was because I was a big fan of the Chappelle show when it was on and a huge fan of Charlie Murphy in general. \n\nShe responded to this gif by saying, \"That's a perfect example of digital blackface\". I was sort of gobsmacked, I wasn't trolling, I wasn't trying to portray myself as black, and I said that doesn't match up at all with the definition of blackface she gave me. So she explained that white people using black people's exaggerated reactions to things as a way to portray their feelings is wrong because black people are not here for white people's entertainment. To which I replied that Charlie Murphy is quite literally an entertainer, and is definitely IS here for everyone's entertainment. I told her I was getting ready for bed and had to go, but this is really bothering me. I feel like I was just accused of trivializing and participating in racism, and that if I never use one of these gifs (which I do heavily in conversation) I'd just be validating her opinion. What do you all think? Should I play along when I don't agree? I've seen in the past how she treats people who don't agree with her opinions of social justice, they are immediately considered racists. I'm not sure how to react here in balancing my own opinions with wanting to maintain a friendship. \n",

      "description": "I (24) have been with my bf (30) for 3 months and we both live in a country neither of us are from. \n\nRecently his grandmother, who has been sick for while, took a turn for the worst. He went back to his home country to visit her last week and he knows she will die soon. A year ago he saw his godmother die from cancer and this has affected him greatly.\n\nThe way he is dealing with this grief is to drink a lot, smoke weed and isolate himself emotionally from anyone. He will still go out to meet his friends but I know that he is not talking to them about what he is going through, but just partying. \n\nMy bf knows I previously escaped an abusive relationship with someone who had mental health issues worsened by a cannabis addiction. I was diagnosed with PTSD later on. For this reason, I ask my bf not to get high around me (I feel this is reasonable as we only see eachother about once a week). One time he rolled a spliff in secret in the bathroom and lied about it when I confronted him. He later apologised. \n\nMy father was also an alcoholic who had been in rehab several times and constantly threatened suicide. My bf also knows this.\n\nI understand that he prefers space so I have constantly reassured him that I am here to talk but I will not push him. He has cried a couple of times and i have comforted him, staying up all night and trying my best to reassure him he is not alone.\n\nOther than these infrequent moments of him letting me in, he will usually behave like an asshole. If you were not to know that he is suffering so much, you would just think he was a shitty bf by the way he behaves. \n\nFor 1 out of the 3 moths we have been dating he has been incredibly distant and uncaring. He rarely wants to meet and when we do he seems very uninterested and selfish. He says this is because he goes into a shell when he grieves. I constantly do nice things for him (helping him with a job presentation written in my native language and not his, making him cute gifts, coming to his flat so that he doesn’t have to come to mine, asking about his day etc.), but this is never reciprocated.\n\nUnfortunately I do also suffer from anxiety and depression. Recently I went through 3 days or so of intense suicidal idealisation to the point of planning. Despite me trying to reach out to my bf about my depression, albeit cryptically, I was met with replies like “you’ll be fine. Think of people who are much worse off like me”. I have not mentioned it since, and he has chastised me for being closed off regarding this topic. I have explained that I felt shut down the last time and he has apologised. \n\nA few days ago he was flying back from his country and we had planned to meet. Messaging me from the airport, he tells me the flight is delayed. I had cancelled plans with my friends to spend some much coveted time with him and asked him to tell me when the flight would take off.\n\nA few hours later of waiting, I message him and it turns out he has already landed and is on his way to his flat. I told him I was disappointed he didn’t update me since I was waiting on him but he just told me he was in a rush and he was sorry. He told me he was too sad to go work the following day and would call in sick, however asked if I wanted to go with him to a birthday party that night. A little taken aback that he wanted to go out, I still agreed. He said he was running late so I could meet him there. This was the final straw for me since I did know these people and I did not want to turn up to a flat I’ve never been before for someone’s birthday i don’t know on my own. My bf also told me he was feeling self-destructive “like when [his] godmother died” and planned to drink and smoke a lot and that I could not change his mind about this. \n\nI told him this would be upsetting for me and I didn’t want to go. The next 2 days after that he was unresponsive to my messages. I begged him to talk to me about what was going on and how he felt about the relationship and he refused. Because he made it impossible to meet and talk I broke up with him via text.\n\nI am very open to the possibility that AIMA. Unfortunately I have a warped sense of what is ok in a relationship due to previous abuse, so I find it hard to tell if I’m being too sensitive and selfish or if I’m too forgiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He hates my hockey team, which may be part of his bitterness, but Idk.\n\nWe did not talk about sports too often, but I was talking about my teams, I would mention my two favorite players. It's just that these players are the best on their teams and score and contribute to the game. A few times, I made a comment like \"that play/goal was almost as beautiful as he is\" and jokingly called my fav player my one true love. Exbf would get offended I would even say anything like that. We had been dating for two months so it wasn't like I even loved exbf at this point.\n\nIt apparently bothered him so much that when I didn't want to give him a bj, he asked if I would be willing to suck the player's dick. I am a virgin and it takes me a little while to get comfortable in a relationship before I am ready to do anything sexual. He knew this because I had to explain it to him multiple times. He would get frustrated when I did not want to go farther and accuse me of denying him while being open to having sex with my favorite player. I honestly never said anything sexual about the players in front of him and I don't know where he got it from.\n\nAITA for making him insecure with a few throwaway comments about an athlete's attractiveness or how they were my one true love? Should I just not joke around like that in front of future boyfriends?",

      "description": "In January, I was looking for a job and decided to apply to a local supermarket. After applying, I had learned that one of my close friends had started working there 2 weeks prior. I was already hired when my friend tells me about a referral program where if I worked 3 months at the supermarket, the person who referred me would receive an $100 bonus. In reality, he did NOT refer me to the job, as I had already applied to said job before I knew he had starting working there. \n\n    I agreed to signing the referral form for him, on the condition that we split the money considering he did not actually refer me. I give him an ultimatum of either zero dollars or splitting the $100. He reluctantly agrees, we drop the subject, and consider it done.\n     \n      Fast forward 3 months later, and the referral bonus will be given 2 weeks from now. However, he mentions to me that when he gets the bonus, he would NOT be splitting it with me, as he thinks it is stupid to split the referral money. He says no one else has done this before, and that when he was referred (by someone who actually DID refer him), the person who referred him kept the $100.    I explain to him that ours is a separate case because he did **not actually refer me**. I stress to him that I would have not signed the referral form if I knew he would be keeping the $100 for himself, and he responds by saying that he only yes’d me in order for me to sign the form. He thinks I am going back on my word for signing the referral bonus if I did not plan on giving it to him, and I think he went back on *his* word by only agreeing to split the $100 in order for my to sign the paper.

      "description": "This holiday season, I cussed out one of my sisters. Now the family and a couple in-laws are telling me what to do, and I disagree. I’m too biased and clouded in frustration to judge. \n\nTo provide a better background, I will objectively provide information as I can recall it, in no particular order. Please save your judgements until the end. And it’s a long one so if you’re not ready, maybe come back later. \n\nThis holiday blunder was triggered when Sister 1 commented “Better.” on my Instagram photo, of before and after a shave and a haircut. In this context, my sister already has a history of making judgements on my appearance and criticizing my choice of shirts or hairstyles or shaving. We only see each other during the holidays, and this is box usually gets checked pretty quickly into her visits. \n\nThis holiday season, like many recent holidays, Sister 1’s in-laws hosted dinner at their house. Usually 10-20 people dinners. Sister 1 and my mother stay with said in-laws over the holidays. I go up to visit the day after they drove  to town, and the first thing Sister 1 says is “Untuck your shirt. You’re not a cowboy.” I was wearing a plaid shirt, and had tucked it in to look more presentable. All the nice sweaters or jackets I have are hand-me-downs from her husband, and I didn’t want to show up to HIS family’s dinner, wearing HIS old clothes. We’re the same size, and have similar tastes. Sister 1’s comment irritated me, but I spent the day with them, played with the kids, and we had dinner. After dinner, Sister 2 and I went out for a dart and she helped me carry some bags to my car. \n\nSister 2 tried to pull an ultimatum on me, holding my Christmas gift hostage. My family grew up in City A, but my Mom moved 8 hours away to City B to be a full-time Grandma and nanny for Sister 1. When she asked what I wanted for Christmas, I asked her to take me grocery shopping at Costco. She is on a pension, but receives assistance for taking care of the grandkids, and earns a small income by cleaning. She is not struggling, but dipped into a local food bank for cans regardless. She claims that no one was taking any food and it’s always overflowing. She brought the food up to give to me, and while I do not agree with taking from the food bank, I was not going to refuse canned goods that she drove across the province with: I’m a student who cooks in a microwave and a toaster-oven.  My sister was concerned that my mother is struggling. While helping me bring the cans to my car, she said “If you take the cans from Mom, you can’t go with her to Costco. She can’t afford it.” I had already discussed this with my mother. She asked what I wanted for Christmas, and of course “nothing” is not an acceptable answer, so I asked her to take me grocery shopping at Costco. I expressed my concerns for her budget and she insisted that she was glad to. So we went anyway. With the food bank stuff and her old pantry stuff, we only spent $120 CAD at Costco, with about 11 items. I felt depressed the whole time, and although my mother encouraged me to get more, I insisted I was done shopping and wanted to go home. \n\nChristmas Day comes around. I was supposed to go up for breakfast, but I felt so anxious about my sister making rude comments. Normally, I go smoke with Sister 2 and we vent about how Sister 1 is behaving, but I didn’t want to talker to Sister 2 after what she said about the cans. In my anxiety, I had spent Christmas Eve self-medicating and trying to decide whether or not I wanted to go up and watch the kids open gifts. I decided to stay out of it and slept in. I was anxious about dealing with Sister 1 and Sister 2, and knew I was stressed out. I skipped Christmas dinner because leaving in the middle of the visit would be making a scene. Instead I drank and smoked all day in my basement. Before I went to bed, drunk and stoned, at 5am on the 26th, I texted Sister 2 that she she really shat on my Christmas and I felt very disrespected in how she’s been treating me both recently, and over the years. This got me riled up as I texted Sister 1 how I felt about her comments, using a couple curses. Sister 1 responded with “I’m sorry you feel that way.” Sister 2 did not respond. I spoke to Sister 5 later that day, and she encouraged me to apologize. I eventually compromised with a “I’m sorry I got snippy over text, but I’m still not ready to talk to you.”\n\nCouple days later, Sister 1 txts me in the morning to invite me to hot pot dinner at Sister-in-law’s place. We got a big snow drop that day, and Sister-in-law lives 40 minutes out of town, and my car and winter tires are all junky. I did not RSVP to this dinner: I felt weird about bailing on Christmas, and didn’t want to lie to the in-laws about why I wasn’t there. For Christmas dinner, I had told my mother to say I made last-minute plans and was busy. If I attended this dinner, I’m sure they’d ask how my Christmas was, and I’d have to perpetuate the lie or tell them I was tired of dealing with Sisters 1 &amp; 2, which I would be rude and causing a scene in their impression. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go or not. I guess the plans changed a few times because of weather, but no one told me. I messaged and called an hour before leaving the house, but they were busy with family, the kids, etc. I left the house, drove out 40 minutes to an out of town property in heavy snowfall, and found an dark, empty house. I played a bit of fetch with the dog, had a smoke, and drove home. \n\nWhen I got home, I texted Sister 1 my frustration about driving out there and no one trying to call or text me. I didn’t hear from them until I was halfway into town, and didn’t see the missed call or txt until I got home. I told her “Holy F’in Inconsiderate”, less the censor. \n\nShe responded with an “Are you kidding me?!” tone, noting that I hadn’t RSVP’d. I chewed her out for not even apologizing for being a “F’in B” to me and her “Half-A’d apology. What a joke” and “F’in passive aggressive.” again, less the censors. She defended her “I’m sorry you feel that way.”, saying it wasn’t passive aggressive to acknowledge and accept your feelings. I called her a highroading ‘see you next Tuesday’, with more efficient vocabulary. And that was that. \n\nLater that night Sister-in-law-2 messages me saying I should apologize and family is family sisterly love, whatever. I told her I’m a “Let’s work it out” type, not so much a “Forgive, and forget” type, but that I need my sisters to put in a bit effort if I’m gonna keep apologizing for feeling upset about the way they treat me. \n\nI spend New Years with my friends. \n\nThe day before the family drives home, we have dinner at a local restaurant. It’s a little tense, but I laugh along with a few stories, talked to Sister 2 about how she’s doing, and played with the kids. Sister 1’s hubby, Brother-in-law, pays for dinner. As we are all leaving and exchanging awkward hugs, the family starts walking to their cars. I hang back because I want to have a quick smoke before jumping in my car. Brother-in-law hugs me and then holds me in place. I tried moving his arms and pushing him back lightly, but he held by my shoulders and wouldn’t let me move. He said “I’m sorry about all the confusion, it was crazy. But don’t ever swear at your family.” I felt affronted, said Ok, and said goodbye. \n\nI picked up my friend after dinner to play video games, but still felt frustrated. I txted Brother-in-law, “I’m sorry I upset your wife. But please don’t hold me in place while you tell me how to behave with my family”. And yes, I get that’s my sister is his family now too. He txted “Do you want to talk, instead of txt?” I told him that’s all I wanted to say. Then he tried calling me, so I answered and said “&lt;Name&gt;, I’m with my friend right now. The quarrel is between my sisters and I and I don’t want to talk with YOU.” — “OK.” — “Have a good night... drive safe, thanks again for dinner.” \n\nThat’s it. I feel like the asshole. I used words as weapons. But at this point, simply apologizing would diminish my plight, and solve a symptom, but not the problem. Am I being an irrational asshole? My friends support me standing up for myself, but any family who knows says I should be apologizing and that it’s not OK to swear at family. \n\nTl;dr Been feeling disrespected by my sister, and when I had enough of it, I cussed her out.

      "description": "*My father passed away in November of 2017. It was a peaceful death, it was in his sleep and in his own bed, in his own home. His birthday is today (5th of February.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: My Dad passed away in 2017, today was his birthday. I didn't wanna do anything, Aunt insisted I did and to stop being selfish. I decline her in a pretty disrespectful way after accusing me of being selfish. AITA for wanting to spend time alone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently 17m. My mom, aunt (father's sister) and my brother all want to go out to eat, spend time with each other and light off these lanterns in the sky (I'm highly against these because they're horrible for the environment and can cause fires, but that's just another nitpick) I respectfully declined. In a depressive state, not really wanting to be involved in this whole day. I just want to sit in my room, have little to no interaction with anyone and try my best not to have a panic attack. I spoke with my girlfriend and even told her If I'm not as open to talk today, that is why. She said she totally understood and gave me my space. I just wish my family was more like this. I had no problem with them going without me, I even encouraged it. I would've even been okay with making dinner at my place. I really just didn't want to go out. Not today. I didn't want to kill their somewhat good time. I wasn't in the mood to eat, talk, see, let alone go out to a restaurant and do all of the above. My aunt (who does not know when to keep her mouth shut) pretty much barges in on me in my room, asking (and I quote) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Aunt: \"So what the hell? You don't wanna come with us on your fathers birthday? Or light a lantern?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"No, I'd rather spend this time alone. I'd like to cope with this in my own way. He was my father ya know.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aunt: \"Well you need to come. You need to go out, support your mother through this and stop being so selfish.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Just get out, honestly. I don't need your shit right now, ever since my dad passed, you've been on my ass trying to make me feel like shit. Or at least that's what it feels like. I'm not doing anything or going anywhere, so just get the hell out please.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe stood there in awe and just left with my mom and brother to the restaurant. None of them tried to convince me otherwise except my aunt. I'd assume it's because they all respect my decision to cope with this by myself. So, AITA for not wanting to do anything besides spend my time alone? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer***: Not asking if I'm the asshole for talking the way I did to my aunt, I put it in there for context. Please try to focus on the point of \"Not wanting to do anything with my family for my dad's birthday.\" Thanks for reading guys. ",

      "description": "My gf and I have been dating for half a year. In that time, I've paid for most of our meals and drinks. I've paid for all our tickets to events, random snacks and ride shares which really add up. I know this because I use an app to budget what I spend so I don't go over.\n\nI usually don't mind paying but once in a while I'd ask if we'd be able to split the bill when we eat out. And we eat out a lot because it's something she enjoys. I try to steer her towards eating leftovers at times but she'd rather go to brunch or whatever she's craving atm. Anyway, there always seems to be tension when I ask so I try to not do it too often.\n\nThat being said, I did begin minding when I overheard her tell her friend that I'm stingy because I asked if we could split the bill. I didn't mention anything because, hey, maybe I was being stingy. But that comment really rooted itself in me and it came to a head recently.\n\nNow let me tell you something about my gf. She's forgetful. Really forgetful. You know how I say I pay for drinks and meals most of the time? It's because she forgets her wallet or it's cash only and she doesn't carry cash. She's the type of person to forget a conversation from an hour ago. \n\nBack to what happened. One day I mentioned to her if we could maybe not eat out so much because my statements have become double what they used to be. And I mean this literally. My expenses had literally doubled or more during the time we've dated.\n\nThis is when she said it's not due to her because she always pays half and doesn't think I always foot the bill. Which is when I got a little pissed. Here she is telling her friends I'm stingy while at the same time telling me she doesn't think I pay for much. I'm thinking she's probably telling her friends I don't pay for shit either. In anger, I list off a bunch of restaurants we've eaten at recently where I paid and explain to her Ubers and Lyfts and tickets aren't cheap.\n\nAnd that's when she blew up. I mean she lost it. If this was a cartoon, you'd literally see steam blow out her ears like a tea kettle. She went off on me about what kind of person remembers what meals they've paid for and stopped talking to me.\n\nSo, AITA? I feel like I could have phrased things better but the moment got to me.",

      "description": "So this afternoon I stopped by the neighborhood park to play some Pokémon GO when all of a sudden I realized I can’t feel my wallet. I panic since I had a hundred bucks cash in it along with my debit and credit cards. I start retracing my steps and at this point I’ve put my phone away and I’m looking down at the ground trying to see if it’s anywhere here. I’m  speed walking/running/regular walking and minding my own attention because I figure if I’ve dropped it within these past few minutes there’s still a high chance it’ll be here since it was still a bit early. Well, I spend about an hour to no avail and when I’m walking out to my car a car stops abruptly in front of me and there’s a lady with her boyfriend and a dog and she asks me if there’s any reason I’m walking around in the park by myself. I’m about to answer when she cuts me off and says I’m “creeping everyone around” and I should understand that a grown man walking around in the park by himself would creep people. That itself was sexist, but I try not to get angry and think maybe they might have found my wallet by chance? I look a little different than my ID picture so they might not recognize me if they had found it and I explain I’m sorta freaking out since I lost my wallet somewhere and I apologize for “scaring” you. I was in no mood pick a fight, but after a really crappy hour or so of walking around the park only to be told that by some rando who I had not even seen before really sucked.",

She then starts calling me a control freak because I wouldn't let her throw it away, I react and say that i don't want to waste food, frustradely, granted. She then went off to the bedroom and kept telling me i was being controlling and that i was a control freak.\n \nI went to ask her to speak about it, because i had got annoyed and i told her that and i wanted to explain how her calling me a control freak made me feel, and because i was annoyed and because i didn't relent (and didn't get to explain my feelings about what she was doing and what i was doing etc as she was not letting me in the midst of that) to talk about how i wanted to explain why i was making a stand on this decision she starts shouting me down and telling me she doesn't consent to the conversation.\n\nSeems petty (perhaps) but this is a small part of something bigger and is a standard for how she reacts when i want to talk about how what she does effects me and want to talk about our marriage in general. \n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "So some quick context: I and two of my friends, who I will call friend A and friend B, are three weeks away from our college finals. Since all three of us are gamers and we usually play together, we agreed that we wouldn't play together during the day to avoid procastination. \n\nThis morning friend A sent us a message, asking if we wanted to play. I reminded him of the rule, and we left it at that. Afterwards, I got a message from an online friend that wanted to talk to me/show me something real quick in a game. So I went into the game, and immediately I get messages from both A and B saying \"Wow, you said no to playing ealier but now you're in-game? Ok.\" I tell them that I was going into the game for a quick thing, and that didn't go against the rule since it was about playing together. I said they're the ones upset over nothing. I also mentioned that friend A would usually listen to study material while gaming, so them being upset for me going into a game for 5 minutes was really hypocritical.\n\nThat's when the argument broke out. They argued for the fact that it was rude for me to say no to playing and then immediately after going into another game alone. I said I was in it for 5 minutes max, and that me playing shouldn't bother them. I then mentioned that I'm even ahead of my study schedule and asked if they can say the same, and that it should be none of their business that I procastinate. \n\nI then got a bit petty (unusual for me) and decided to say that it's always you two against me, and that I didn't appreciate how they always had shade to throw at me. I critisised friend A for breaking the rule we had come up with, and he excused it with I forgot. When I said the study schedule thing he mentioned that he's sick and couldn't study. Fair enough, I wished him \"Get well\".\n\nAfter a bit more arguing that my procastination and solo gaming should be none of their business, friend B (who wasn't involved in most of the arguing) sent us an all caps message and told us to shut up, since she can't concentrate due to the notifications. I responded \"If I don't want to?\" She then responded that I should respect her studying, again in all caps. I told her about the scheduled do not disturb feature on the phone and left it at that. Later she sent a voicemail where she sobbed and said that I ruined her day.\n\nYou can do two judgements here: Was I an asshole from the start and was I an asshole by the end? I feel like somewhat of an ass by the end, but I didn't really do anything to upset her before the end, since the argument mainly ran between me and A.\n\nTLDR: Friend A asks us to game, I remind him of a rule between us against that. I then enter a game alone, friend A and B argue against me doing that and in the end friend B tells me I ruined her day due to the argument.\n",

So I thanked them and assured them that I would be voting republican now due to the post. That part I know I'm being an asshole, don't worry. \n\nBut then like half an hour later I got banned from the subreddit. Shocking I know. But I sent them a reply saying that I couldn't figure out why I was banned because I couldn't find which rule I had broken, nor did the thing banning me tell me which rules I had broken. Very cordial(at least i think it was).\n\n5 hours later havent heard anything so I ask for a confirmation that someone has at least looked at my post as I know they are busy.\n\n24 hours after original post I comment that I will now assume the worst about them because its been a day and they haven't gotten back to me. This promptly gets me a mute for 72 hours so I cannot talk to them for 72 hours. \n\nOf course this last comment I could see as breaking the rule of not giving the mods sass, but they hadn't gotten back to me in a whole day. I was a bit irritable.\n\nSo I would like to know if I'm being an outright asshole to the mods before I continue pestering them once the 72 hour mute is over.\n\nTldr: sucks, read the whole thing.",

      "description": "My friend is a 1st-year film major who has wrote the script for a short movie (\\~30 min.) that he is planning on shooting over the summer.  I am a 2nd-year student at a different university.  I am not a film major, but I am a film buff.  I have already committed myself to help with the movie when we come home during the summer, and perhaps play a major role.  My friend is adamant in shooting it using Super 8 film.  He has estimated that the choice of film (including development and what-not) to be roughly $2,500.  This cost has only been communicated to me.  I'm not sure if it is accurate.  This is where my issue takes place.  I believe the movie should not be shot on film.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend has made it clear over the past school year about how he is against shooting on digital, and believes the \"true filmmakers\" shoot using film.  He is even hesitant to watch movies such as *Roma*, because he believes that it being shot on digital is an insult to true cinema.  I do not know where these viewpoints originated, and why they have to be so extreme.  I have talked to him many times about the option of shooting on digital, but he is stubborn and this only seems to fuel his drive to shoot on film.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as I know, he hasn't taken any film-centered classes.  He has mainly taken required non-major classes, and other art classes.  As I previously stated, I am a film buff, but I know nothing about shot composition and lighting.  Shooting on film, while it looks nice, still won't look cinematic or good without some proper knowledge of cinematography.  This is my reasoning for wanting him to shoot on digital, and therefore save thousands of dollars.  I know he already needs a digital motion picture camera for school, and the cast consists of just our friend group.  Since most of us won't ask or want to be payed, it would cost significantly less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has already hinted to me and some others that he'll need major financial help with this movie.  He comes from a relatively poor household.  While I am far from rich, my family is well off.  I do not want to contribute any money.",

      "description": "Basically in December of 2018 my partner at the time and I were pulled over my the police when they found two bongs in my car. My ex (with literally no prompt from me whatsoever) took the blame and ended up being arrested. I felt absolutely horrible about it and said that I would be willing to assist with some of the court fees. No written agreement was ever made, just a verbal exchange. We later broke up in April of 2018 after he had an abusive episode. He then went through basically a year's worth of court hearings (I believe there were four separate court dates) and later informed me that he had racked up nearly $2,000 (NZD) worth of lawyer fees that he wanted me to pay half of \"like I agreed\". He was NOT convicted.  \n\nI did pay half of the initial fine which was about $100NZD each. \n\nThe problem is this, I know that he has had multiple hearings/drug support meetings etc. but I have no way of verifying if he obeyed the requirements of the court system. I don't know if his notorious negligence lead him to be late and just generally cause a hindrance to him not being acquitted sooner, thus not having THIS much of a lawyer fee. \n\nMy friends absolutely don't think that I should pay him for anything but like I definitely feel bad about it! He did me an absolute solid by taking the blame. I'm trying not to write this from a bias point of view but this guy literally ruined my life. He stalked me for months after we split up I threatened to call the police on him numerous times and we KEEPS pestering me about this money and I don't think I should pay it?\n\nSo WIBTA if I didn't? Even if at the time I was dating him, I verbally agreed that I would pay some of it?",

She's also ok if I order takeaway with meat on. \n\nHowever the issue is that a couple of weeks ago we were talking about moving in together and she says \"well you'll obviously not be making meat in the house anyway\" which just took me by surprise and after talking about it a bit more (which turned into an argument) it turns out that when/if we moved in together that she expects me to not cook or eat meat in the house at all, even if we had separate pans, cooking utensils etc. Her reasoning is that \"I just find it disgusting, I'll never have it in my house, you can eat it at work but not in the house\" I understand relationships are about compromise and sacrifice but surely the compromise here is to have separate cooking utensils. \n\nI went from wanting to move in with her and progress our relationship to hitting this wall and thinking that one of us will just end up resenting the other if we are so opposed on this and one has to concede. I don't really want to convert to being a vegan as I'm a fussy eater as it is, and I don't believe that I should feel pressured into becoming one. So... AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for having trust issues?",
      "description": "So my boyfriend and I have always had trust issues. There’s several reasons why but I’ll give the big reason why. \n\nWhen we started dating he had a best friend who was always around him. She bought him things, made him food, texted goodnight/good morning I love you everyday, ate lunch with just the two of them everyday etc. I tried to not question it because I just assumed they were really good friends, and he even told me that multiple occasions. Saying she’s just a giving and friendly person. \n\nWell months go by and I discovered nudes on his phone from her, and text messages saying he felt something for her. Well I confronted him and he only confessed to the things he thought I knew. I asked if he had sex with her and he said no.  I even asked if he’s cheated before and he said he’d never do that. He then blocked her off everything. \n\nMonths later i felt something wasn’t right. I was a little drunk and told him he is lying to me. I berate him until he told me a truth. And then that’s when he confessed that he had sex with her in the past. We had a long talk and towards the end “if there’s anything else you should tell me nows the time”. And I always do this, I always beg for honesty and have always asked him for the truth. And then he says no. Everything is off his chest. \nI text her the next morning saying I knew (because he even had her lie to me saying they never did) we had a long talk, then I told both of them I forgive them. \n\nThe next day she told his ex that they had an affair while he was with his ex. They slept together several times while he was dating his ex. I was devastated again. First, he lies about sleeping with her. Next, I found out he cheated on his ex with the same girl and he didn’t even confess it to me. The ex was the one that delivered the news. \n\nMy trust issues blew through the roof. \n\nNowadays if something is bothering me I want to ask him about it because I really regretted not asking enough in the past.  If I don’t trust him I tell him I don’t. He’s really open to communicate that kind of stuff now. \n\nWell today something just struck a nerve and I called him out on checking girls out on Instagram. He told me that that accusation made him really sick. He got mad at me and told me that that’s not what he’s doing. But I know he’s doing that because he checks up on the same girls every time he goes on Instagram. But he just told me that “why would I ever do that, I already put you through so much” thing. And that I need to stop. I felt like my anger was really valid, because he accuses me of the same things. \n\nI don’t know. Things like that really annoy me and I always kinda feel a little inkling that he’s always looking at other girls or that he’s treating me wrongly behind my back. I want to be a good girlfriend with no trust issues but whenever I feel somethings not right I have to tell him instead of bottling it up. I just can’t hold it in anymore. But he wants me to atleast try trusting him but I do try! It’s just giving me a hard time right now. \n\n\nAITA??",

      "description": "So, for background information, me and my friend are both Juniors in highschool(17 y/o). We live in an upper middle class area in the US and most of the kids around here get there parents old cars or get brand new ones however, my friend and i both bought our cars with our own money. Mine is a way crappier model (2006 Chevy Cobalt) than his but has 80k miles less miles and while i like that my car gets me where i need to be he is obsessed with his Infinity. This led to me pranking his car occasionally, leaving boxes on it and stuff, just as a little prank. Well that all led up to today...\n\nFriend-F Helper-H\n\nSo yesterday H and I decided that since it is our last day before spring break we were gonna do something hilarious to F's car, we were gonna sticky note half of it. After about an hour or so H and I finished and we thought it looked great and it was an amazing prank, there would be no damage to his car and if the sticky notes left any residue I left a message on one of them that we'd give him 15 bucks for a car wash. F woild get out of school 4 hours later than H and I so we left and waited anxiously to get his reaction over text.\n\nWhen F saw his car I got a very different reaction than expected, F wasnt upset at all. All F texted was \"Very Funny.\" While suprised, I just thought maybe F actually thought it was funny and moved along. I was wrong.\n\nThe next day i go out and find my car with duct tape all over it, courtesy of F. I brought my parents outside to look at it and they were appalled. As we removed the tape my paint job was ruined, there were missing spots everywhere and it was overall ruined. I texted F that he went way over the line and F responded that i had it coming and that it wasnt as bad as what H and I did. I sent him pictures of the ruined paint job and he said i shouldnt have messed with his car in the first place. I proceeded to call him and argued (not going to lie i was yelling at this point) that he needed to pay for a new paint job and after about a minute of listening he cut me off. F proceeded to say that no matter what i did i never thought i was wrong and was a Perfect little cunt.

      "description": "While celebrating our NYE at a friends party, their couch unexpectedly broke. Now friend has a 9 year old son and after hearing my husband suggest putting a cinder clock under the couch for a temporary fix, he ran outside to get one. As soon as he comes back in with the cinder block he decides he’s going to fix the problem on his own. Awesome! My husband being the practical man he is, takes one look at the size of the block and the size of the couch and says it won’t fit. This doesn’t deter the kid, he’s bound to fix it and make it work. He’s struggling to make the block fit and my husband again says it won’t fit. Now other party goers are interested in what’s going on. The kid is obviously proud of himself trying to fix the couch and keeps trying to push the block under the couch. Husband is visibly annoyed because he knows it won’t fit. Kid tries to lift the couch to make the brick fit and struggles with the weight. Other people suggest my husband help the kid. My husband declines by again, saying the brick won’t fit and it’s going to make the couch un-level on one side. The kid pushes on without his help. Brick is currently residing under the couch supporting the break and couch seems slightly even now. However party goers are now annoyed at my husband because he wouldn’t help the kid-now in his defense he knew it wouldn’t and probably shouldn’t fit and wouldn’t actually fix anything. He’s already planning something else and mentions he’ll fix it later. Mother of said kid says  to let kid think he’s helped and my husband can actually fix it at a later time. I agree. Husband gets upset because he feels attacked by mother because he didn’t help the kid. Now he’s silent and obviously very irritated. Everyone goes about their ways and enjoys the night. Husband is still irritated. So I send him a quick message explaining that he shouldn’t stew on it, this was more about helping the kid feel like he’d fixed it and then hubby could actually fix the couch. Husband snaps back that he wasn’t raised that way “if something is wrong you still tell the kid good job” I agree and say that he’s not the kids parent, it’s not his place to get involved like that. He then goes on to say if this is how I plan on parenting our child (currently pregnant) we’re going to have problems. I say, I don’t agree with that parenting style and say that he missed out on an opportunity to teach the kid a lesson. Rather than telling the kid he was wrong multiple times, he could have shown him why he was wrong and then helped him figure out a better solution.  He goes on to complain about everything thinking he was a jerk ( no one outwardly mentioned this.) he did make it obvious he was upset and someone called him out on it but nothing was mentioned about being a jerk. I say “From a kids perspective you kid of were being a jerk, you only told him was wrong and it wouldn’t work multiple times. It was unintentional because you were being realistic but a 9 year old wouldn’t understand that. Besides everyone but you is over it” he then decides he doesn’t want to speak to me for the rest of the night. And rather than sleeping next to me in guest bed, he’s sleeping in the chair. As he’s getting up to go sleep in the chair I mention how he’s a grown man and he’s so upset by this that it’s ruined his night and he needs to let it go. I tell him the kid is currently laughing and spending time with his mom. Everyone is over it (because it’s really nothing) and he needs to let it go. He’s currently glaring at me from the chair. ",

She told me she wasn't comfortable around guys, aside from her ex that she was still best friends with, and at this point I was already considering breaking up. She lived around half an hour away, and I am an inexperienced driver, so that sucked too, but she said shed had been planning on moving in with a relative in town, which would have been 10 minutes away. She then informed me that she decided not to, and this is another factor in why I broke up with her\n\n\n Another week goes by and she texts me while I'm at work, and she tells me she doesn't know when or if she will be ready to have sex again, and asked if i still wanted to date if there was no sex.\n\nI told her I don't care about sex, but the fact that she isn't comfortable around me, and the fact that she rushed into a relationship so fast after the assault probably wasn't healthy, and I told her we should take a break so she actually has time to heal and process everything. \n\n\nShe said she was disappointed in me, and started being a dick to me.\n\nSo was I the asshole?",

      "description": "Long story short, a few months ago my friend bought me a ticket to an artist I don’t like so I could go with her to the concert. I did NOT ask her to get me the ticket, but she kind of insisted. She told me it would be an early X-mas present (this was in November) and to not worry about it, that it would be fun blah blah blah. I obliged and thought it would be fun.\n\nNow she is asking me to pay her back for the ticket ($40) which is like.... okay? Thought it was a gift? Whatever. And there’s more! She ALSO expects me to drive the hour and a half to get to the venue (both ways), bring the “equipment” (water, snacks, weed, etc), and be the designated driver. All out of my pocket when I NEVER offered. This is all when: she has a car, weed, snacks, and so on. \n\nNormally, I‘d be fine this if it were a concert I wanted to go to. But I hate this artist, I hate the venue, and I only loosely agreed to come so I could spend time with her (also, remember, this was a present at the time of purchase). She knew all of this when getting the tickets.\n\nTo add to the mix I am off all of my medication (for clinical reasons) and didn’t want to be around anyone, let alone crowds, in fear I’d have a breakdown or go off on someone. \n\nWith all this in question, would I be an asshole for leaving her?\n\nPS - a lot of other people she knows are going, so no, she would not be alone. \n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway, she doesn't use this subreddit but she knows my account name so I don't want to risk it. On mobile, plz don't burn me for formatting. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now, lived together for a year. She's been great, we fight sometimes but only about small stuff like miscommunication and tone issues. But recently we got into a major argument, and it doesn't seem like either of us are budging. \n\nAbout two weeks ago she let me use her laptop to play an emulator while mine was being worked on for screen repairs. I had to open up chrome to get the correct emulator and the tab she had some tabs open. Instead of closing them all out, I closed them out one by one to see if they were important to keep up, because sometimes she's in the middle of something and doesn't want the tab closed. \n\nOne of the tabs was to a camera feed of someone's backyard. I didn't know what to make of it. At first I thought it was a video she has paused, but then a person opened their backdoor and let their dog out, and I saw the time on the side of the frame read the exact same as ours. It freaked RIGHT the fuck out so I closed it. I didn't understand why she was streaming some random persons backyard. I kinda sat there for a second and tried to understand, but I couldn't come up with anything. It bothered me so much that I wanted to look at it again and see if it was just a mistake or something. \n\nI went in her history and I saw LOADS of similar looking sites. They're all just numbers, or numbers with dashes/periods. I clicked on a few to make sure and yeah, they're all cameras into homes and into businesses and parks. Most of them were bookmarked, but I couldn't find where she had those bookmarks stored. I was very uncomfortable and I gave up looking for the emulator, instead I went and talked to my girlfriend about it. \n\nShe got very defensive and told me that she just liked people watching. She told me that she knows it's a weird thing, but that you can find the cameras just by searching on Google (not sure if that's true). She made a big deal about how it isn't illegal, but I told that I don't care that it's not illegal, I don't think it's moral to spy on people. She told me to mind my own business, and that it's her hobby, and that she'll do what she wants on her own laptop. \n\nI know it's not my business but I have been trying to get her to stop looking through other people's cameras ever since then. I think it's fucked. We keep arguing, and she keeps saying that it's just \"her thing\" and that I don't have to do it, and she won't talk about it, and I shouldn't worry about what she does in her own time. But it fucks me up knowing that my girlfriend is legit spying on people. It's not just public places, it's private homes and one camera had KIDS on it. I hate that she does it but then again, she's an adult and she can do what she wants. She's not forcing it on me and I only found it because I was snooping. \n\nTldr: My girlfriend is spying on people through their cameras, and I really really hate that. I tried to get her to stop, but we keep fighting and she keeps getting more upset each time. Am I The Asshole for trying to make her stop doing what she's doing?",

      "description": "So I (17F) posted a girl on my Instagram story asking my followers if anyone knew where she got her jeans. The girl is very popular on Instagram and is over 18 but looks a few years younger. This guy swipes up on the post and says “cute young teen 😍” and I just ignore it because I’m used to seeing weirdos on Instagram preying on younger girls. \n\nHe texts again a few hours later and says he’ll pay for “me” and friends to send a video rubbing lotion on each others legs. Btw this was all on my finsta so I barely posted my face, that’s why he thought the girl was me. Anyways I ask how much just out of curiosity. I’ve heard of girls on twitter and on Instagram saying how they sell nudes and such. I even have friends who catfish nudes for money smh. \n\nSo the guy gets surprised that I even replied. He continues to say how he loves underage girls and he’d be willing to pay a lot for the video. He was offering $200-$300 which was sooo much money for me at the time. He said a lot of weird, pervy things that I don’t even want to repeat. \n\nI figured that this dude is a creepy pedophile and deserves whatever karma he gets, aka me scamming him. So we continue talking and he’s asking me to send pictures of friends to see who he wants to pay to be in the videos. Eventually he asks where “we” live and I randomly say Orlando. Guess what? He lives there. He gets all excited and starts spamming me saying he’ll pay all the girls to meet up. Also all of the girls I sent were random popular Instagram girls who were well over 18 with baby faces and such. He thinks the girls are 14-17. \n\nI told him that we won’t take cash first because were nervous that he’ll hurt us. He was so desperate that he barely questioned it and eventually money to my cashapp. Then, he asked if there were any more “hot underage girls”. Please don’t forget that the reason he wanted to do this so much was BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDERAGE. \n\nBasically, he was so thirsty that he didn’t ever ask for proof that any of these girls were real. The fake girls were supposed to meet him the day after all of this. I eventually came up with an excuse and he didn’t think anything of it. \n\nHe kept asking about more girls so I kept giving him more girls and you ofc you know what he did. Every time I came up with an excuse about meeting and he believed it. One thing he would say is how he thought it would be sexy to get head from an underage girl in front of the police station. Or to get head in the high school locker room. He continued to say weird stuff like this and how he’s never been able to talk to an underage girl (thank god.) \n\nI know it’s an asshole move lying for money but in this particular situation AITA? Like if it was a regular guy wanting of age girls then i feel like it’d be different but for him I feel like maybe he had it coming to him? Every time one of the girls couldn’t meet up he would say that’s his karma for wanting underage girls. \n\n",

      "description": "He doesn't have real OCD, he's just ultra picky about things. He calls it his \"OCD\" so that's why I'm using the term here. Here are some examples of when this has become an issue:\n\n- Putting the plastic sealers over our windows. First he just asked if I washed off the trim on the window I was working on, I said of course. That one didn't bug me one bit. Then, he wasn't outright looking over my shoulder, but I could see him walking slowly past the doorway and quietly scrutinizing what I was doing. I just got it done and moved onto the windows in my own room. When doing those, there was something about the paint that made the double sided tape not want to stick, so it kept popping off. I did the best I could and mentioned it to him in passing and he immediately asked if I wiped down the trim. I said of course again, this time I know that I was audibly annoyed. \n\n- Making food. I received a cast iron pan for Christmas from a good friend. When I showed it to him he basically started telling me all about how to use one and how to season it, all things that I already knew. I told him that I know all those things and I'll be sure to do it right. One night I was making steaks for us with it and I used the tip of my knife to flip the steak back over, he saw and immediately almost scoffed, \"you're using metal in that pan?\". I just told him that I'm being careful and that I knew what I was doing as politely as I could. Another one about food. He will sometimes ask me what spices I want to add to something, I pull a few things out and he basically watches the whole time. \"I wouldn't use that, I think that might go better in something else, this is what I would usually use.\" My reaction at that point is just to tell him that he can go ahead pick the spices himself. The same thing happens with condiments or sauces. \n\n- One example happened when I was doing dishes, he was drying things as I put them in the dish rack. He reached out and tested the temperature of the water to make sure that it was hot enough to do dishes in. He didn't say anything, I assume because it was hot enough by his standards. This one just felt almost disrespectful, it felt like he saw me as someone that wouldn't even know what a good temperature for water would be to wash dishes.\n\n- When we moved into the house, he did basically the same thing that he did with the window sealers but with spackling instead. I'd be part of the way through doing a room, and he'd come make small talk while scrutinizing the spots that had dried. Spackling usually takes two layers, especially if the hole was a bit bigger than a usual hole. He'd see one that had dried and caved in a little bit and mention that I needed to get that one again, not in a way that was like; \"hey, you probably know this already, but this one here could definitely use another coat\". But rather in a really condescending way like; \"You're coming back to hit this spot, right?\"\n\n\nThose are all the big examples. There are some other smaller things, like nearly criticizing me for smoking a bowl soon before dinner or having a beer right before bed. Or even how I organized some areas of our basement, basically where we have instruments, computers, gear for activities and such. It can just get super annoying, especially after a long day. I guess I'm not sure how to feel about this stuff; am I really doing these things in objectively wrong ways or is he just taking things too far?\n\n\nTL;DR: my brother is almost constantly scrutinizing the things that I do, especially in relation to work on our house or food, in a way that feels condescending.

Fridge space is at a huge premium, even despite several of us having mini-fridges to keep stuff like personal drinks or leftovers. \n\nThe newest housemate likes to cook his meals for the week, which is fine as long as we've all got the space we need, and I'm certain a week's worth of meals can fit into a small space; I've done it before. I open the fridge this morning to find a 6-quart Dutch oven full of his chili taking up a huge part of the bottom shelf.\n\nI was pretty annoyed and muttered \"*five people live here*\" to myself. We already have enough problems squeezing everyone's food in, and this isn't the only thing of his in the fridge; this is in addition to the tupperwares containing his meals and his other assorted perishables.\n\nI want to tell him that his giant-ass pot needs to be out of the fridge and the contents need to go into tupperware to be stacked etc. because we're really, really short on space, but I'm not sure if this is me overreacting.

I had already settled into my aisle seat (everyone else was as well), when one of the last passengers boarded. The passenger was a female, and she was being assisted by a female flight attendant. At this point, I was just chilling in my seat with my earphones in, only half aware of the situation. I notice the passenger attempt to raise her carry on luggage up to the overhead bin, only to drop it halfway. She tried again and couldn't get it up. I kinda look over (I'm in an aisle seat in the middle row, so there is another passenger in an aisle seat right next to me), he's watching and not really doing anything either. Then, the flight attendant says, \"can either of you GENTLEMEN help this lady?\" (I know I had my earphones in but I could hear her). I take one earphone out and stand up, and as I'm standing up the flight attendant grabs the suitcase, and easily moves it into the overhead bin, then proceeds to glare at me while she walks away. This made me feel really shitty and the entire flight I felt like I should've explained why I didn't get up earlier to help. Anyway, AITA here? ",

Since our store is so small we have to go next door to the university kitchen and use the equipment over there. \n\nIt’s a nightmare I have to live every week for about 4 hours. It’s always crowded and loud. But what really upsets me is that there is this one guy who always takes up space (2-3 out of the 5 tables, several pots, spots on the cooling racks, etc) including mine, to get his work done. I’ve found his food in my containers several times, my pans/food/utensils moved (even on the floor), and my stoves turned off, for example. \n\nThis weekend in particular I had a lot of stuff to prep so I used more dishes than usual. However, I was also cooking faster than usual and spaced out my work so that I wasn’t using a million spaces at once. I also usually take up a quarter or half of a table that’s in “his” space, but this time I was someplace different. I would say I was in his space for a cumulative time of 5 minutes in order to use a large pot. \n\nTonight my supervisor takes me aside and says that the guy complained to her,saying that I was taking up too much space and that I needed to stop. She admits that another supervisor present said that I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but apparently it was enough for someone to go behind his back to come next door, instead of asking me directly for more space (at least). \n\nI’m not really willing to slow down and cook one thing at a time to accommodate just one person (other people would ask if I was finished with one thing, and I would ask them, everything respectful) but I don’t really want to cause drama (he seems to be well known in the kitchen).

      "description": "Basically, my boyfriend of 3 years just started his residency as a surgeon this past summer and works in a hospital in the next town over. I had an appointment in that town last month and got to visit him at work for the first time. While waiting for my bf to come meet me at reception, I happened to see my ex (from 5+ years ago), he greeted me nicely, we exchanged small talk, and he went on his way. I didn't think much of it and went on to have lunch with my bf. I did not bring it up, thinking it's a big hospital and the chances of them actually working together may not be that big. I was wrong. About a week later, my bf sends me a pic of his surgical team posing with a young patient and my bf and my exbf were standing right next to each other (surprise, ex is a surgical nurse. I had no idea). My initial reaction was haha that's funny... and then I remembered how jealous my boyfriend can get. It doesn't happen often, but on the rare occasion he becomes the green monster, he becomes an obsessed maniac who needs constant reassuring that I've only got eyes for him. We've had discussions for literal days about how I will never leave him outside of him messing up big time. It can get tiring, but I deal with it because I love him and I empathize with him and I understand we can all get insecure sometimes. However, it does concern me how he will spend days or weeks worrying about his perceived volatility of our relationship, which led me to my dilemma. I decided not to tell him that he works directly with my ex because I was worried it would affect his performance. He is new at the hospital and I don't want to throw a wrench in an otherwise successful residency by causing him anxiety or anger whenever he has to rub elbows with the ex. I know he is an adult and he should learn to handle his insecurities in a healthy way, or at least leave them out of the OR, but I can also see how it may be difficult for him and I want to be able to protect him if I'm able. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not telling him? I've considered what could happen if my ex tells him first, but my ex seems to be in a great long-term relationship (by checking on FB), so I see no reason he would bring it up to my boyfriend. They don't hang out outside of work and I can't picture a scenario where the conversation would come up while they're on the job, so I'm kinda banking on it staying a secret. IMO, not mentioning it and letting my boyfriend complete his residency without this issue distracting him is a better alternative to telling him and potentially creating a problem where there wasn't one. Am I completely off base?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Normally, me and my girlfriend really don’t care about the noise. Live and let live, you know. However, recently my work schedule has had me sleeping during the day and working/doing things at night. I went to bed at 11am this morning, and woke up at 1pm to some abnormally loud bass boosted music from my neighbors below. \n\nI moved to another room in my apartment to try to get away from the noise, but it was seriously loud enough to be heard and felt throughout my whole apartment. Upon realizing this, it seemed like my sleep-deprived state caused some rage to take over and I stomped as hard as I seriously could on our floor. I know this it temper-tantrum behavior, and I normally don’t do that. But I can’t explain what was different this time and caused me to be so angry. Anyways, the stomping was so loud that I’m certain all of the neighbors in our building heard it, and our downstairs neighbors heard it too because they turned the music way down.\n\nAm I the asshole for allowing them to play music normally, not having complained about it in the past until now? I mean, they had no way of knowing I was trying to sleep, and they were playing music mid-afternoon, not at night or anything like that. I feel bad, and want to know if I could be the asshole here or if that behavior was warranted despite having not minded the music in the past. ",

      "description": "Some background information: my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year and a half. She has a son who is just over 2 years old.  I love him like my own and hope I can replace the dad that abandoned him and his mom. We have plans for me to legally adopt him once we graduate college and get married. Basically, we share a son.\n\nA coworker of mine is having a birthday party for his daughter who is about the same age as my girlfriends son. There will be other kids there and I thought it would be a great opportunity for him to socialize with kids his age and for everyone to meet my girlfriend and her son that I talk about constantly at work. So, I invite them earlier this week and my girlfriend said they would go.\n\nJust now, my girlfriend said that she wouldn't be going because she has a midterm she needs to study for. I completely understand, nursing school is hard, no big deal.. until I ask if I can still take her son to the party. She says no at first because she doesn't want to give up her Saturday with him, to which I respond wtf? How are you gonna study and play with your extremely active toddler? Not to mention I would only have him for an hour and a half at the most. She gets defensive and argues that she's never met these people before. But it's not like she was gonna meet them before the party when she was already planning on going? What's the difference? It's a child's birthday party.. it's a good environment for a child. Plus, I know these people and know they're good people. I would be perfectly fine bringing him with me. Why isn't my word enough? She's let me take him to my goddaughters birthday party by myself before, so it's not that she doesn't trust me. This led to an argument that ultimately ended with me saying that he's gonna grow up with crippling anxiety if she never lets him out of her sight. Now she won't answer any of my calls or messages and I'm afraid I've crossed a line. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "First post here, apologies if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nA few years ago, I (20m, at the time) was at a my buddy's frat house for New year's Eve. He is a friend from high school, so this party was at an unfamiliar college. There were about 150 people there. Besides my buddy, I didn't know a soul there.\n\nI was DDing, so I hadn't been drinking. I was making a trip out to a convenience store about 10 min away for some snacks and crap. It's around 11 PM, it's dark, and people were obliterated. Chaotic party. I'm getting into my car and a drunken knot of people approach me. Turns out they also want some grub. So they basically beg me to bring one of them. I oblige. As we're driving, Im making conversation with this hammered drunk girl who turns out to be a freshman, 19 or 18. It occurs to me how lucky she is that she didn't just hop into the car with a madman or lunatic. She doesn't have a phone or her purse, her friends don't know who I am or who I know at the party. If I was a bad dude, it could have been a bad situation for her. \n\nSo about 2 minutes away from arriving back at the frat house, I decide to scare her a little bit by indicating just how stupid her actions were. I told her that getting into a car with a stranger with no way of reaching her friends while she's hammered is a bad idea. I didn't touch her, get graphic, or give her any indication that I was a bad guy or didn't intend on returning her to the party. The simple act of alerting her to the danger she could have been in was enough to scare her though. I mean, think about if you were in her position, you'd get terrified if the driver started talking to you about danger. My intention was definitely to scare her, but not scar her for life.\n\nI know I could have waited till we were back and safe, but I wanted the lesson to stick with her.\n\nOnce we returned, she scampered off to find her friends and I returned to the party. Didn't bump into her or her friends again.\n\nAITA??",

Roommate D is the only male.\n\nRoommate A (for asshole) and B lived together for 1 year before we all moved into a townhouse together. Six months in, Roommate B elopes, moves out and leaves behind a couch that her family gave her. Roommate C replaces her. Just before the year lease is up Roommate A (for asshole) gets accepted to a college and needs to move. I let Roomate A (for asshole) and RM C talk me into letting her male friend move in, RM D. \n\nWhen RM A (for asshole) moves out, she flip flops about taking the couch and not. Neither of us paid for it, so she has about as much right to it as I do. She finally settled on not taking the couch, by responding to me following up with her weeks after she moved out by texting \"no need for the couch, thanks for asking\". \n\nFast forward 8 months later, I need to move out and find a replacement. I planned on asking the RM C and D if they minded if I took the couch bc neither of them ever used the living room and RM D said he had a couch in storage.\n\nThen I get a text from RM A (for asshole) saying that now that I'll be moving she wants her couch back. The one an old roommate left behind? The one you never paid for, nobody did? The one you left behind saying you didnt need it? \n\nI said no. The other 2 current rm's didnt care about the couch, they said as much. But I did. \n\nBtw this is the same chick who claimed the best room, claimed the monthly reduction for her portion of the rent (when we could've used mine, the $ off would've been larger and would've benefited all of us) *tried* to claim all of the space in the kitchen except 1 tiny cabinet for RM B and I to share, *tried* to claim all the space in the large hall closet except 1 shelf, *tried* to steal my pans (her response when I told her they were mine was \"well you have some red ones down there). \n\nShe and I had a lot of back and forth about the couch that got kinda ugly. ( she took it there first) She claimed that she left it behind for RM D bc she felt sorry for him. (Uh, he had one it storage, BS excuse). Lots of background story and bullshit there that would be too long for this post.\n\nShe got RM D to move it for her, who ended up actually being her EX, so the couch is gone. Which is whatever, I'll get my own couch. Just didnt want to if I didnt need to.\n\nBut am I the asshole for not just giving her the couch?",

      "description": "Six years ago I (30M now) had a relationship with this girl (29F now) for about seven months that didn't really work out. I'm not going to pin all the blame on her, but I know she was toxic and a negative influence in my life. I wasn't the best of boyfriends either, so I like to think we weren't the best match and split up somewhat amicably. I learned a little later she was pretty promiscuous during our relationship with multiple others so I felt absolved of guilt over how I may have acted during the relationship. Apparently she became pregnant near the end of our relationship but I wasn't worried as it didn't concern me (you'll see why soon). Anyways, we never kept in contact but we had each other on Facebook. Beside a post like here or there, we didn't communicate. She had her child, and went from relationship to relationship.\n\nLast June, she apparently got into a rough spot and got in touch with me. I have my own house, am single, I (used) to manage my own business when we were together although now it's mostly passive income (other people manage it for me). She tells me the child is mine and she never told me because she wanted nothing to do with me. I \\_had a vasectomy when I was 20 and confirmed after this news by having a motility count which only reconfirms things\\_. I never told her, I didn't think it was necessary as we both expressed a desire at the time to not have kids now or in the future.\n\nShe said she wanted to reconnect and she wants me to be a part of her and her child's life. Take responsibility, have a wonderful family, etc. I knew off the bat it was all bullshit but I played along. We \"dated\" for about a month, I got to meet her kid, and she expressed interest in moving in with me. I outright told her no but she was incessant, more or less threatening support payments without actually saying it outright.\n\nAnyways, it got to the point where I agreed she could move in with me. No paper contract. She was leaving her apartment lease as she couldn't afford it and scheduled to move in with me on September 1st. The day came and I never let her in. She called the police and I claimed to have no idea what's going on, I never agreed to this, this woman is crazy, etc. She hired a moving company, had trucks, all stonewalled. I don't know the events immediately after they all left but I know she's in a shelter now. Or was, it's all I could see before she blocked me on Facebook.\n\nWas I the asshole for stranding her for what she did? To recap, she was a serial cheater during our relationship and tried to pin fatherhood on me when it was impossible. She wanted money/a place to live/a life of no responsibility.",

It has a when you eat at “Jays diner” you have to eat the grilled oysters...you just do! Thing on the menu. To be honest I just wasn’t feeling it so I ordered my goto which is chicken tenders and French fries  and a coke.\n\nFiancé just stared daggers at me the whole meal. When we got in the car he just started screaming that I’m a little kid, I embarrass him, that I’m immature and he thinks my diet is like a stupid kid. I just told him I didn’t feel like seafood and he said that my family raised me to be a spoiled princess and he’s sick of my shit. We are supposed to drive through the night to San Antonio and I literally hate him right now and don’t know if I can do it. \n\nSo I don’t have to talk to him...please answer...AITA?",

      "description": "So a bit of background info: I have Tourette's and Anxiety, am currently in the process of an assessment for autism and very likely have OCD if it's not autism.\n\nGo to the very end if you just want want this post is asking for, but the rest makes it easier to understand why I said what I did.\n\nMy Tourette's have gotten really bad sometimes in my primary school, but that was years ago. However, I am still legally required to have a support teacher just in case my tics started getting very bad.\n\nThe person who was in charge of all the mental illness stuff was also sometimes there, who I will call Miss Wa. The problem is, they seem to sometimes treat me as though I have a learning disability... they sat near me and for a while didn't let me go out for lunch (that has since changed however which I am very thankful for)\n\nRecently, I told my main \"support teacher\" who I will call Miss Wo that I was being bullied (which I am putting in air quotes because a lot of the time she makes me more stressed and anxious then I was before therefore making me do tics MORE!) and it... did not go well.\n\nThey ended up following me between lessons constantly, not letting me out of their sight and then I get into trouble if I do wander off (even though I wasn't told that would happen!). \n\nIt got worse in P.E when, in the changing room, the bully threw my blazer which had my phone in it across to me after he stole my spot where my clothes was, making the first crack my phone has ever got.\n\nLearning from my mistakes last time, I didn't tell Miss Wo. I did, however, tell my parents. Which turned out to be a huge mistake.\n\nMy dad called Miss Wa and told her all about it... and wouldn't you guess what happened next week in P.E? They put me in the disabled toilet. Not the bully, but me.\n\nNow, I'm a complete germaphobe, which is one of the reasons my mum wants me assessed for autism. This disabled toilet had only a toilet, and nowhere else to sit or hang my clothes. I started hyperventilating and crying (please don't judge me for this, it really, really was absolutely terrible for me) about the situation.\n\nMiss Wo came in a few times after I couldn't change, and she just took my P.E bag away from me which I was crying into, and just took my clothes out of it and put it all on the floor.\n\nShe also said a little bit later \"So if you were in the other changing room, you'd be just fine then?\" And I, thinking finally I would be able to get on with the lesson, said \"Yes!\" but to my dismay, she responded with \"So you just want your own way then?\"\n\nI was not just stressed and anxious at this point, but furious too. I literally always go by the rules and cannot handle changes to the timetable or other things like that.\n\nAfter what seemed like hours, I still couldn't change and was still hyperventilating. \n\nFinally, Miss Wo got Miss Wa to come over. She started shouting at me to stop hyperventilating, and Miss Wo said \"I'm a professional, I know you can stop that\" when I couldn't. She also said \"You just want to be the boss\"\n\nFinally, what this post is actually about, Miss Wa said \"If you had such a problem with it, why didn't you just tell Miss Wo?\"\n\nAnd I blurted out \"Because I don't trust her to not make things worse after everything she has said and done that has made my anxiety and stress worse\"\n\nAITA?

      "description": "So I made a friend, we were pretty close. He was there for me after a bad break up and told me he literally wanted to be a distraction. So we started sleeping together and planned to have a threesome. We spent a lot of time together, went to New York and I even joined a band with him. He convinced me to start playing guitar and he had me out of the house and doing things. We were both on the same page that we were just friends, and nothing more. He is very anti-relationship and I found out he had about 12 other girls he was sleeping with. It rubbed me the wrong way, and I didn’t like the idea of being flavor of the day and risking STDs, because I have no idea who else he’s sleeping with. \nFast forward after a few months of us messing around and me being with him every weekend, I decided to tell him I didn’t want to sleep with him anymore and backed out of our planned trip to NY where we were going to have our threesome (which I was extremely obsessed with the idea of) \nFor multiple reasons. The ones listed, and personally I felt like I was catching feelings and I didn’t want to be put in a position where I’d get hurt. I also had a long time friend confess his feelings for me, and it had been mutual for some time so I kind of wanted to see where that might go. \nSo after the talk, he acted like he was ok, he hugged me and told me he cared about my feelings and that I’m a valuable friend to him. Fast forward a week later, I got a long nasty message from him telling me I was selfish for backing out of the threesome and I’m just going to get hurt time and time again from relationships and that no one will ever love me and I will be miserable. That I was weak and just like every other human being. He then proceeded to block me and I never heard back from him. \nIt’s been a few weeks and it’s still bothering me a lot. I truly did consider him a good friend and I feel like all the good memories we made were for nothing. I feel used. ",

      "description": "\n\nSo I started working in a warehouse with over 100 employees about a month ago. I pretty much talk and chitchat with everyone. This one girl was seemed more shy and reserved compared to other people. When I tried to smile at her or nod, I could never get any eye contact. I didn’t think much of it, until my co worker told me she was transgender. I thought it was a bit weird that she randomly just said that to me, but I thought it explained maybe why she was shy or quite. So next time I saw her, I wanted to try and talk to her, so I told her that I liked her pink hair (which a do). She was SO happy and her face lite up so much and she just started talking to me non stop about her hair. I was happy that I was able to “break the ice”. \nLast week my husband came and got me at work, and in the parking lot I was talking to her with my husband. When she left, my husband looked at me and asked: what the heck was that? \nI was confused and asked him what I did....? And he told me that he NEVER saw me talk like that to another girl. The “omg I looovvveeeeeeee your outfit ! Where in the world did you get it ?! You look so cute and adorable!!!” \nI felt really bad when he told me that, cause in that moment I realized that never do I talk to other people like that. Or talk about purses and makeup and super girly stuff and that I kinda change my voice when I talk to her. I didnt even realize I did that around her or why I do it. I don’t want to seem like an a hypocrite or something. Aita?\n",

      "description": "A little bit of background— I’ve been in a day treatment therapy program for the last few months, and got out about a month and a half ago. Needless to say, the transition back to school was rough, and I got the feeling that my friends didn’t like me as much as they did before I left. I’ve been feeling more and more like that, but to be fair I never talked to any of them about that feeling or asked what was going on. \n\nCut to a few days ago. I was feeling like no one liked me, and that my friends didn’t actually want to hang out with me anymore. Lunch that day was especially hard. I have chemistry 7th period with a friend of mine who is in that same friend group. We started talking and I began complaining about certain people. She was also participating in this conversation—some of the stuff I said was only to agree with her. The next day, I had a similar conversation with her about the things I didn’t like about some of my friends. Normally, I don’t like talking behind people’s backs, but I was feeling so insecure that it made me feel better in the moment. That’s not an excuse, but thats what the situation was. In fact, I didn’t even agree with or believe most of the things that I was saying, but I said them because they made me feel better in the moment.\n\nI had that conversation with her yesterday, and today everyone was really weird to me at lunch. I felt like something was off, but I didn’t say anything. On the bus home, I told me friend (also part of that friend group) that I felt like everyone hated me, and he replied with “yes, they do.” He told me that the friend I was complaining to had told one of the people I complained about everything that I said, without including her part in it.\n\nImmediately, I texted that friend, apologizing for everything that  I said. I explained to her that I didn’t actually mean it, and that I actually really respected her. I also explained why I said those things. She forgave me, along with another friend who I had also complained about, and they were actually really supportive, saying that if I ever needed to talk they were there.\n\nHowever, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a huge asshole. I cried most of the afternoon and barely got out of bed to babysit. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow because I don’t think I can face them. I know I’m the asshole, but to what extent? Should I feel as bad as I do? Hopefully this isn’t a SP. I’m not trying to make myself feel better, but I want to know if what I’m feeling is justified, if I have more apologies to make, and if I should go to school tomorrow.",

I don’t know.\n\nI’m a lesbian and I’ve been out to my family for a while. Though, sister is the one who outed me to my parents without my OK and sometimes makes rude comments about lesbian related stuff that I own.\n\nNow, yesterday morning she was laughing about something, and proceeded to make me listen to this one song. I didn’t even know who it was by until I looked at her screen where it said The Weeknd. I don’t really like this kind of music but proceeded to give it a chance anyway.\n\nThat was when this particularly lesbophobic verse (to me, at least) came up. It discusses attraction to girls being a phase and “fucking girls straight”. [I found the song and here are the lyrics.](https://genius.com/Gesaffelstein-and-the-weeknd-lost-in-the-fire-lyrics)\n\nI started crying on the spot because of how awful and violent that was, and tried to explain to her how, but she didn’t seem to care as I cried. Lesbians have a history of “corrective rape” by men, conversion therapy, just being doubted in general.\n\nI got really overwhelmed with the emotions and anger and told her that her music taste has always sucked, and she needed to find better people to listen to, morally at least. Apparently that struck a bigger nerve than I expected.\n\nThis really upset her and she went to go cry to our parents that I had basically “bullied” her. My parents got angry with me and told me to cool it, that I was overreacting, that I hurt her, that I was too sensitive. I just feel the most hurt in this situation…\n\nI have past experiences with men who have these kinds of mindsets and I remained feeling really awful throughout the day.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "On mobile etc.  \n\nThis fish has been sitting there for weeks.  It doesn't smell, but I just checked the dates on it, an it should have been used by 9/28 of last year.  It's still in it's packaging from wherever they bought it, but hasn't moved in months (apparently).\n\nNow, the thing is, there's an ok amount of room in the freezer still.  Sure, we need to stack lunches on top of each other, but it's not like the fish is taking up all of our space.  If I'm honest, it's annoying me more than anything.  No one's eating it, no one seems to care that it's here (except me), and I don't really think anyone should be eating it at this point, even if it has been frozen this whole time.\n\nSo WIBTA if I threw out someone's food, even if it seems like whoever it belongs to has forgotten about it?",

My wife and I were travelling and we stopped at one of our favorite places to eat. \n\nOn our way out I was approached by a homeless individual. He asked me if I could help him as he hadn't eaten in days and likely wouldn't again if I didn't do something. \n\nI told him that while I didn't have any cash, I'd be willing to take him inside and let him order a meal. He accepted and we went inside. \n\nI told the lady behind the counter that I was going to be buying for the gentleman behind me. This is the part that gets dicey: he ordered a fuckton of food. His bill was considerably more than ours was for two. I didn't say anything about it. I paid, he thanked me, and we left. But I couldn't help but feel somewhat like I was being taken advantage of. At the same time, I tried to consider he may be using that order for multiple meals. AITA? ",

      "description": "I've known my best friend, Ashley (fake name, obv), about 17 years. Her oldest son and my son are also best friends. I started a new relationship over the summer, and I also moved an hour away around the same time. Since I moved, we have been slowly growing apart.\n\nLast March, I kept her older son for a week while she went on a cruise with her husband and his job. I provided all of his food, and I had to adjust my work schedule to accommodate having him. I didn't mind at all, I love her son like he's my own child.\n\nIn December, she asked me to keep both of her kids over a weekend for a Christmas party out of town (I also had to provide food for the whole weekend). I was told she would be home around 4/5pm that Monday. At 5:15, I hadn't heard a word so I texted her. She was running late, no big deal. Finally, she got home around 6:30. I got no thanks for keeping the kids, no apology for the delay, nothing. I was pretty irritated at this point. She didn't even offer to pay for any of the food I fed her kids.\n\nTo the current issue. Her husband's company has another trip coming up in March. It happens to fall on the same week of boyfriend's birthday, and I'll be out of the country. She assumed I was going to keep her kids this time too, but I told her no. I told her I won't be babysitting for her anymore because she takes advantage of me. Now she's pissed off and not speaking to me.\n\nI'm getting pretty tired of it at this point. I've seen her drop plenty of friendships over the years because people won't let her take advantage of them anymore. It's exhausting. So Reddit, am I the asshole for not being willing to let her walk all over me anymore?",

      "description": "**My Background**\n\nSo, about a year ago, me and my SO decided to move across the state (roughly 4 hours) to take up what we thought was a good opportunity. I had, at the time, been wanting to get into real estate as a career, and the place I moved was kind of touristy and up-and-coming. So my thoughts were that I had the chance to make some big boy money for a bit while my SO was in college. Turns out that it isn't that easy. Everyone down here is a Realtor. Fucking everyone. So no way i was going to be able to make it in general real estate. Needless to say, I had a REALLY tough time breaking into the market down here and sacrificed a good credit score and a decently paying job to try and make i down here. \n\n**The Situation**\n\nWhen we moved, the idea was that my brother and I would go in on a house to flip. We found a good deal, and snagged it. The plan was that we would get a loan to help renno the house and sell it. My parents put it on a line of credit until we could buy it from them. Welp, turns out that thanks to the tanking credit score (brothers was shit too apparently), we couldn't get a loan, even a small one for repairs. So I was stuck there, floundering, living paycheck to paycheck (basically) and spent all of the money I had saved to move on bills and helping my folks with the mortgage. Bring us to this week. I spent the early part of the week talking to some realtor buddies about potential investors into the place. nothing on the table, just talk. After all, I am finally making decent money again, so I felt like it was time to get back at the house.\n\nTurns out that my parents and my brother went behind my back and made a deal for them to buy me out of the house. No one communicated this with me until the papers were signed. This had been going on for about a month. While I will get my equity back that I paid into the house (which i realize they are under no contract to do so, other than a verbal agreement), so that's something.\n\nI Realize that there is nothing legally I can do. The home was always in my folk's name. But now, just as things start to improve, I am being told that I have to move out in a few months after their deal closes. This puts me in a REALLY tough spot. If i am not here when my homes close, i don't get paid for them. And a lot of my homes are going to close in June/July (I work in new construction now).\n\nI called up the folks, who basically told me that because I don't call them enough. I laid everything out, letting them know how bad a position this puts me in and got answers tantamount to \"well, you should have thought about that when you didn't call us more often.\"\n\nAITA in this situation? I feel like i should be pissed about all of this, but also I feel like my family just kind of tossed me to the side on this whole thing without even thinking about giving me a choice.\n\nTL:DR: Family cut me out of a deal on a house that we had agreed on, and then claim that it is my fault for not calling them enough.",

I didn't have anyone too go with so I asked my friend if he wanted to come with me and bring his girlfriend however I said to him that if he wasn't going to go to the concert that he would sell them back too me for the price he paid (£20 even though I paid £22.50) which he willingly agreed too. Back up a couple of days from now he realises that the tickets are selling for £300+ and now suddenly he claims that the tickets are his and that he is going to sell them so him and his girlfriend can go on a romantic trip together. I have told him that he agreed that he would sell them back to me if he wasn't going to come with me to the concert and he states that they are his and he wants them now then he also said that his girlfriend will be really sad if she doesn't get the tickets, which is funny because he also said just two days ago that she doesn't know about the concert and that he had bought the tickets as he was keeping them as a valentine's present.

She also claims to know her own body, and says that she may even be infertile due to a condition she has. So she's pretty certain she won't become pregnant. She also says it wouldn't be an issue if I became a father at my age. She's upset about how I'm reacting, and maybe that's justifiable.\n\nMy argument: **I don't want to be a father right now.** I have enough going on as it is, and I'm just worried that one form of contraception won't be enough. My family would probably kick me out if my girlfriend happened to become pregnant, or she had an abortion. Neither of us can bear the thought of that.

We were all messaging each other what little snippets we had been told, so obviously I started a group chat so we could all talk and trade information together. My sister's were all dumbfounded we had not previously done it.\n\nFast forward a day and I get home from work, and get a message from my mum (56F) saying that I went behind her back and she was leaving WhatsApp because of me, essentially cutting off all contact with me. One of my lovely sisters told my mum, who has a fantastic flair for the dramatic and literally feeds off tension and drama at times, and has now decided that what I did was unforgivable. I have not been able to get in contact with her, and my dad (59M) is awful with technology/ there is no way she won't see me calling so won't answer either, even though we are super close and he probably thinks my mother is over-reacting.\n\nAll my sister's support me and still believe it was necessary as we are all concerned and can never seem to get one story.

      "description": "I met a cute guy on grindr and decided we should meet up. He is 20 and I'm 17 (and he knew that). Any way I say we should meet up the saturday at 14:00 he said sure but he would give a time nearer to saturday. D-day comes and he still hasn't sent a time and isn't reading my messages. He finally responds at night telling me he was sorry and that his parents dragged him along to another city so we wouldn't be able to meet up. \n\nI keep my composure and say it's fine and give him a second chance (telling him it's his last). Fast forward 1 week and even though we have a time (14:00) at 23:00 the previous night I got a message. I was asleep so I got it in the morning. The message was sent by a friend on his number telling me he was in the hospital for some sort of low bloodsugar. Along with it I got a pretty fake looking picture. Needless to say I asked if he would be able to meet. He says no and I ask what now? Then I said that I don't care and he sends a message along the lines of: \"If you're mad at a guy in the hospital, then lose my number.\" So I block him on grindr and WhatsApp and delete his number.\n\nNow I keep thinking I should not have snapped and I'm the asshole. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nSo we own and live in a townhouse in a capital city in Australia. It’s a lot of multiple townhouses in a row, with them on the end and us next door. We are the only one connected to the property that the owner wants to set up as an AirBnB. We have a strata arrangement but no official body corporate. They didn’t ask for permission or let us know other than a casual conversation outside.\n\nHis tenants have been absolutely terrible over the past two years we have been living here. Domestics a couple of times a week, loud parties into insane hours of the morning, using our driveway as parking, trash outside all the time etc. We put up a sign at one point stating that it was private parking at the point the driveway becomes ours and they tore it down and parked a bunch of motorbikes there. All of this is to say that I don’t think the owner really cares about who he has staying there - both sets of tenants were shocking and he lives in another state.\n\nI’ve seen what people can do to AirBnBs and while I’m sure most tenants are fine, I’m really worried that a rotating cast of dickheads are going to end up trashing the place or having super loud parties. We already had to put up with crappy neighbours and having a bunch of random people with no responsibility for the place in the form of a lease is freaking me out. As we are the only ones directly next door I don’t think the other neighbours are going to care much, but we have already had to deal with it for so long that I have no faith that this is going to be handled appropriately by the owner.\n\nI don’t want to start looking into the legal side unless I have to, and I want to give it a chance, but has anyone else had experience with this? Am I being a judgy NIMBY asshole by writing it off as a disaster before anything has happened, or should I just let it happen? There are AirBnB places everywhere so maybe I’m overthinking it, but the house is so connected to this place (wall to wall over two storeys and thin fence between backyards, shared driveway etc) that anything that’s going to happen is going to directly affect our situation too. So WIBTA by doing anything about it?",

I ran to a gyro place next door to grab a bite to-go. \n\nI get my food and go back to the Panera to eat with the fam. As I begin to nom, I notice my girlfriend and her mother staring aghast at me.

My girlfriend later brings up that I shouldn't have brushed off her feelings like that. \n\nMy girlfriend's dad then come in and agrees with his wife and daughter. So.

I'm in a kinesiology course that requires knowledge of high school physics and calculus, and being that I did well in those two subjects in high school, I'm cruising through the course.  Meanwhile, there's a classmate of mine who is struggling a lot in the course (lets call this person anon).  anon is also a co-worker at my workplace, so there's somewhat of a connection.  Seeing that I was doing really well, anon asked me to help him out with some problems at the beginning of the course.  I didn't really find any problems with that, so I helped anon out with some homework for the course.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to present day, and anon has asked me EVERY WEEK since the beginning of the course for help on homework and labs for this course.  I've been helping anon quite a bit at this point, but at this point I feel pissed off that anon repeatedly asks me.  Anon has told me that anon forgot everything from high school so that's why anon struggles, and I felt compassionate towards that.  However, anon never stops asking.  Recently when anon asked again for help, I wasn't feeling well physically, so I message him that I had a doctor's appointment and that I probably needed to rest for that day.  Anon sees the message and proceeds to ask me when my doctor's appointment is over and whether we can message each other instead to help anon with homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad for anon because anon is struggling in this course that is mandatory for kinesiology.  Also, I feel like I should help anon because anon is kinda friendly at work.  Yet, I just really want to go up to anon and tell anon to fucking stop asking me and go to the prof for office hours instead.  Should I though?  And AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr classmate / co-worker repeatedly asks me for help on homework for a course, even when I'm not feeling well and I tell him no basically.

Let’s call her R. \nA few weeks ago, R went on a trip overseas to visit her boyfriend. She told all of our friends several weeks before that she was going, but she didn’t tell me until two days before she left. (Everyone else assumed I knew since she’s my roommate, so they never thought to bring it up.)\n\nR bought the ticket herself and as far as I know, her parents have no idea she left. R’s parents think everything is normal and she is still attending class. While she was gone, she withdrew from all of her classes. Again, R lied to us, saying that her parents forgot to pay the fee and the school kicked her out. She told our mutual friend (M) later that she withdrew herself, so I found out through M that she had lied to me. Then, R asked everyone to pack up her stuff so she wouldn’t get charged a fee.\n\nR’s plane is landing tomorrow, and since she hasn’t told her parents anything, she can’t go home. However she doesn’t technically live in the room anymore, and she wants me to let her in the room so she can get her stuff (and she might be planning to stay here secretly, but she hasn’t contacted me except to ask me to do all of this for her). \n\nOur RA has told us that R can come get her stuff during office hours without any problems, but her plane doesn’t land until after 10 PM. \nI’m here on a scholarship and I’m afraid if I try to help R, I could lose my eligibility and then I wouldn’t be able to afford to pay for classes. I don’t want to bend any rules in case it backfires. AITA?",

      "description": "I'll start form the beginning. So back in 8th grade I met my current friend group. We'd all been friends before, but we never really hung out with each other a lot before. So this group consists of 4 of us, who we'll call Erin, Laura, Cassie, and me, Lillie. So I'd known Erin since kindergarten and Laura since 3rd grade, and Cassie moved to our district in 7th grade, but I never really spoke to her before because I was afraid she'd hate me (thanks to my social anxiety). So we'd all been hanging out when I started to notice something. Erin had been copying a lot of the things I do. It had happened somewhat gradually, so I didn't notice right away, but when I started carrying a purse around school, she started carrying one. When I declared my favorite color was red and wore it almost every day, she'd try and find any piece of red to wear. On the last day of school she dyed the ends of her hair purple and blue to match the way I dyed mine.\n\nI confided in Laura about this, who said that she noticed but didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to embarrass Erin. She agreed with me that it was kinda weird and creepy, but that I should just put up with it because imitation is the best form of flattery. But being the aggressive dumbass confrontational person I am I did.\n\nWe were in gym class and we're in ninth grade now, so this had still been going on. I was laying on the floor playing on my phone when she came in and laid right next to me, pulling out her phone and laying in the exact same position. Later we were talking with another group of friends and Erin randomly says \"I'd never want to live Lillie's sad life, that'd be terrible.\"\n\nI was pissed so I retaliated with \"if you didn't want to live my life so much you wouldn't act like me or try and dress like me.\"\n\nThe conversation ended there but another problem came with her. She started becoming incredibly childish and immature and generally annoying. We have a groupchat together where we facetime a lot and hang out. Cassie can normally never leave the house because she's always babysitting for her younger sisters and Laura can never get a ride anywhere so chatting on facetime was our only option if we wanted to hang out. Erin was always invited on to these calls but she almost never joined, and when she did she'd stay on there and be silent for 30 minutes an then leave. So this was over winter break and we decided we wanted to hang out. Erin wasn't on call when we decided, and we didn't invite her because she never even really talked to us. We hung out and posted on instagram that we were together and from that time we'd made a lot of inside jokes together. One day she brought it up with me and asked why she wasn't invited and I straight up told her. She seemed like she wanted to be included so I encouraged her to join the calls more often. She didn't, which I'll bring up again in a bit.\n\nSo anyways we were on call when Erin decided to join us. She sighed loudly and in a mocking tone I said \"gee Erin, whats wrong,\" trying to be funny. She said it was nothing, so I decided to ignore her because I wasn't going to chase after her. She later left the call and 10 minutes after she left the groupchat altogether. Cassie was kinda worried because just before she left the call she was making fun of her a little bit. But I told her that if it was anybody's fault it was mine. I teased her a lot for acting the way that she did and I guess it got too far. Cassie left the call because she felt like she was going to have a panic attack so it was just me and Laura. I spilled my guts out about how I knew that she was being dramatic and that she just wanted our attention and that I still felt guilty for being so verbally abusive towards her. She said that none of this was my fault and that even if it was it wasn't by that much. She agreed that she was being dramatic but she didn't know Erin well enough to form her own opinion on why she was acting this way.\n\nCassie was eventually able to get through to her and figure out what was wrong. Erin said that she felt excluded from our jokes and that we made fun of her a lot and it really upset her. Cassie is morally good so she apologized of course. Laura did to but she told me that she felt like it was unnecessary to apologize because she believed that she wasn't doing anything that Erin was accusing her of. When I was talking to Laura I said that if she'd just join the damn call she'd get our jokes, and it's not our fault that she doesn't want to make the effort to be our friend.\n\nAnother issue is that Cassie doesn't seem like she wants to stop being friends with Erin. Anytime the subject comes up she tries to get us to talk about something out. One time I blew up about Erin and everything that she was doing on a group call and Cassie straight up left. Cassie is really nice and has the best morals out of all of us so I understand why she still wants to keep her around, but I honestly feel like it's so emotionally and mentally draining to deal with her shit.\n\ntl;dr- My friend doesn't ever want to hang out with our main friend group and she gets mad when she doesn't understand the jokes that we made without her.",

This guy is my boyfriend's best friend, they've known each other for around 15 years now. I'll call him D. So D met this girl G a couple of months ago while she was travelling to our city, they hung out for a few weeks and then started dating. G then moved back to where she actually lives (it's a small town in the middle of nowhere many hours from our town)he goes to visit her a few times and a month passes. D then tells us that he's decided to move to small town to live with G and then promptly packs up and leaves. Am I an asshole for being angry that he's up and left all of his good friends of many years for a girl he met not too long ago? I mean it's nice and all that he's found someone he likes and he's happy, but at the same time I'm mad that he's left us all. That was a few months ago, he's come back once, but it was for work and no nobody has really seen him... I'm really conflicted about all this because I want him to be happy, but I also want everyone to be able to spend time with him. Most of us have no money to go visit him or are too busy with work or other commitments to make such a long trip. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "My best friend and I always hang out at his place since I live with my parents and he doenst have a car and has his own place (It takes me 10 min to drive but it takes him 45 min by bus). Since he doens't have a console I always bring my playstation, which is a hassle with all the wires and set up and shit but he's the only friend that wants to game so I'm fine with that) and we game at his place and smoke weed. He always buys the weed since I don't smoke unless it's with him. Sometimes I stay at his place and drive him to work in the morning since I dont have a job right now but sometimes I can't sleep and I leave during the night which makes him upset because he expects me to stay there even though I can't sleep. (His words)\nAnd he makes me pick him up from work or makes me hurry up other plans so I can pick him up from work if we have plans later during the day because he doesn't want to take the public transport.\n\nAnyway...\n\nSo the other day we were hanging out at his place and there was a huge storm and we had just smoked a huge joint. We needed to get some dinner and he said that I should go to the store and pick up dinner while he hung up the laundry. I said sure and just wanted a ready made chicken or something simple. He wanted to cook some soup with some other stuff that would have made a lot of mess. I reluctantly agreed to go out into the storm and pick up a few things which turned into a whole shopping list (which I paid for). When I came back he hadn't even started hanging up the laundry because he was just on his phone.\n\nWhatever...\n\nWhen I get back he cooks and makes a whole mess. After dinner he goes out for a cigarette and out of hapit I start cleaning up the kitchen. After the cigarette he starts hanging up laundry. I clean the pots and pans, load up the dishwasher, clean the stove and the kitchen counter and finish before he finishes his cigarette. When I finish I go to the sofa and wait for him to finish hanging up the laundry. He then looks and me and tells me that I forgot to clean the kitchen table. Me feeling like I've done enough say \"no, I'm not gonna do that, you do that, I've done everything else\". We start pickering about it but I stand adamant. He gets kind of upset that I won't clean up the table and I end up doing it because the mood was getting kind of awkward. He then puts on this smile which I hate and says \"thaaaaaank you\".\n\nBtw, he also made me clean up the kitchen while he watched, on my birthday...\n\nSo... Am I the asshole for not cleaning the table?",

      "description": "Throwaway to be safe...\n\nI would be among the first to vouch for Best Friend’s character. I'm not shy about the fact that he is an exceptionally kindhearted, giving, compassionate man. But I'm also not shy about the fact that none of those traits have stopped my disdain for him from growing. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for eleven years. He has known Best Friend for nine years. It's not like they even grew up together. They met through work, when Best Friend moved here. They're first responders. Husband and Best Friend have been inseparable since then. That's basically a literal statement. That's why I'm over it. \n\nHusband considers Best Friend family. Like, we've actually ARGUED because I've tried to stress that though Best Friend might be *like* family, he is not. A man that wasn't even present in our lives for our wedding or our oldest daughter’s birth can't be family. Don't get me wrong, I have my own friends, but they are friends. They aren't on the same level as my sister. I don't invite them to family functions. Our kids don't have close relationships with them.\n\nHusband and Best Friend are...too close. Before anyone says it, I am one thousand percent sure neither of them are gay. They just have a really weird enmeshed relationship. They have other friends, but none half as close as each other. Our kids (girls ages 10, 8, and 4) ADORE Best Friend. They have made crafts and drawn pictures and excitedly saved them for when he came over. They love playing with him. He's now their preferred babysitter over my sister, which the 8 year old has made known and hurt my sister deeply. He loves them as well and while part of me is glad the girls have so many adults who dote on them, it also makes me wonder what message we are sending them. My belief is family first. He's not family.\n\nIt's gone so far he even comes to holiday gatherings and Husband goes out of his way to include him. He's came to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter even year we host for probably the past five or six years. We exchange gifts (I grudgingly play along). He spoils the kids. He helps set up egg hunts, clean up, wrangle the kids, whatever. MY FAMILY ASKS IF HE'LL BE COMING IF THEY ARRIVE FIRST. My mother isn't even that fond of my husband and she just thinks Best Friend is amazing. This has always been so awkward to explain. The first year he came, or when extended relatives catch glimpses of him in pics posted to Facebook. “who's the redhead?” Well, uh, it's this guy Husband knows…\n\nHe even acts better than family honestly. I don't find it endearing, I find it unsettling. He plowed my mom and aunts driveways with the blizzard. He's helped us out numerous times with everything from home repairs to money to last minute childcare. What is he getting out of it???\n\nThe thing that has really been bothering me is Husband’s aunt’s funeral. It was a big fight for us. Husband was very close to her and wanted me to come along for moral support. The funeral was in another state. I simply could not do it. Funerals and death are overwhelming for me; I would have nonstop panic attacks. Husband was upset by this and said he couldn't do it alone. I apologized and said I couldn't help it, but I would support him as best as I could in all other ways. I thought it was done, until about three days before the funeral he came home from work and said BEST FRIEND WAS GOING WITH HIM. And he actually did! I was and still am so weirded out. What the fuck? Just two men in their thirties and three little girls? What did Husband's extended family even think? What did they say? According to husband no one even pressed about it after Husband introduced him, but I honestly don't believe that for a flat minute. I mean really, how would you react? \n\nBest Friend is taking my place now. Being my husband's plus one is too far. Just because I couldn't go, I feel he was way out of line. It's inappropriate. I don't think that just because Best Friend has a sob story past (abusive parents and brother he's estranged from, no other family, grew up in foster homes, boo hoo) that means we should somehow be taking up the slack. There's so much more. He consumes too much of my husband's time. Don't get me wrong, he's not neglecting me or the kids. I just find it inappropriate. They work together, then end up doing something out and about once a week or so, then he's at our house. Holiday dinners, birthday parties, barbecues...always there.\n\nI want to start separating ourselves from him. I think it's inappropriate and unhealthy for Husband to be so wrapped up in someone who, despite what he's said, is NOT his brother. I have tried being passive and slightly cold hoping he will get the hint but so far no luck. I told Husband this after yet another Christmas where Best Friend is the only non-blood related person to attend. Husband was immediately defensive and gave a hard NO. Said I was insensitive. Perhaps I could be a little more tactful, buy I'm almost ten years into this crap!! The truth is I want to slowly cut him out of the picture until he's an obscure \"\"relative\"\". They see each other at work, why isn't that enough? Just by those hours husband is close to seeing him just as much as he sees me in a week. When you throw in all the extra, it is probably more. He's changed my husband, too. Husband used to be the assertive, hotheaded type. He'd get into a fist fight if someone looked at him the wrong way. For the past several years since he and friend got really close he's left that macho stuff behind. He's much more patient and passive...just like guess who. I'm not sure what to make of it. On one hand I guess it's good, but why was it HIM that got him to change?\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep FAMILY pure and set a good example for our young children? I think I'm being reasonable. I've put up with this intrusion for long enough. They're lucky I don't demand a full and immediate ban of Best Friend at our house; I'd be fully within my rights to do so. Instead I'm trying to follow my heart with some compassion and my husband acts like I'm some blackhearted witch.\n",

      "description": "Disclaimer: This post is a copy  from r/Rant I posted a few minutes agoand therefore it’s structured as a rant...nonetheless, it’s accurate and hopefully not too biased. It was also edited a little, but I thought I should ask if i’m being the bad kid here. \n\nStart of post:\n\nI don’t know why my mom has such a huge issue with just respecting my boundaries. A group of strangers are going to come soon, and I’d prefer to not be a significant part of it. However, my mom has a different idea. \n\nShe thinks it’s acceptable to let strangers into my room, while i’m doing something else, just to go to my bathroom. Why? Because It’s the shorter path. God forbid our guests have to walk an extra five meters to go to the living room bathroom on the other direction. She knows I don’t ever want people in my room who I do not know. I’m uncomfortable with it, I always was. We have a grand fucking living room and a massive guest room that are practically attached as one massive room, and multiple bathrooms. WHY do you need to go into my room?!\n\nIf you’re wondering why i’m so defensive of my room, no it’s not dirty and messy. There are plushies there, tons of them, and my PC setup is decorated to the brim with plushies and stickers and all over it. I don’t really want strangers going in here, it just makes me uncomfortable. Even my family seeing this makes me uncomfortable as they’re kind of judgemental about it. Additionally, I always lock my door. I absolutely cannot handle the idea that someone might enter my room at any moment, even if it’s a family member. This is why I told literally everyone multiple times to knock the door before entering my room, just give me 3 seconds brace, it’s all I need. But that never happens. I always get a mini heart attack hearing my door handle suddenly and loudly opening, only for the person on the other side to be stopped due to the door being locked. I then ask who it is and i’m usually met by silence. I go and open the door and we go from there. WHY, no really WHY can’t you knock?! All I need is a little “ *knock knock*... OP? You in there? Need ya for something “, but instead you choose to barge in, as in all of my family. The only person here who doesn’t do that is my maid and my littlest sister. \n\n\nThis is why entering my room is something I do not want happening. I’m that kind of person, mom should know, I was like this my entire life but she tells me it’s “Weird” and “Bad behavior” . Excuse me?! I’m not the one randomly inviting guests without warning their children, then fucking just letting them loose in their child’s room all of the sudden. SHE ACTUALLY DID THIS IN THE PAST, I FORGOT TO LOCK THE DOOR THAT DAY.  I WAS JUST RELAXING, THEN DOOR SUDDENLY OPENS, STRANGERS.PNG . There were other lesser incidents where she kept knocking and saying “Come on OP! Come out now and say hi to the guests!” Even though I explicitly, multiple times, told her not to do that. I didn’t unlock the door. I just sat there in silence because I had literally no idea how to respond.\n\n\nNow, I was willing to go out of my room at some point to say hi and talk a bit to the guests, but mom instead insists on me wearing our traditional clothes (Kandoorah) and for me to just sit there in silence. She actually told me “Yeah you don’t have to say anything, I just want you to sit there the entire time.” \nI’m not doing that. \n\nI wore some nicer clothes and went out to my mom. I warned her:\n\n “Hey, if you try to force me out of my room i’ll probably just ignore you, so it’ll just be embarrassing yourself. I’ll probably come out at some point and say hi.”\n\nMom: Why aren’t you wearing your kandoorah?\n\n“?...Did you hear what I just said?”\n\nMom: I don’t want to hear what you said.\n\n“The information did go through though, right?”\n\nNo response as she goes into the bathroom.\nIt’s arguably rude to be talking to your mom like this, but i’m just so familiar with the situation. She’s gonna do something that she knows I don’t want her to do. I’m just trying to make it firm this time. So, i’ve decided. I just locked my room, and took some gadgets with me and i’m heading to camp in our outdoor shack (which is actually really cozy, I used it as a room for a while in the past). I’m good here, I have my switch, a few anime episodes downloaded, my phone, it’ll last me a few hours. If my mom tries to knock on the door for a while, i’m just not going to be there. I may or may not go inside later and say hi to the guests and talk for a bit. If mom asks me why I locked my room and left it, it’ll confirm that she tried to enter or get me out even though i’ve told her not to ever do that since the dawn of time. I’d respond with “I told you I wasn’t going to be in my room didn’t I? Before the guests came? Told you there isn’t gonna be a response, i’m not in there.”.\n\nEven though I do sound a bit anxious socially in here, i’m really not. I just have what I think are perfectly reasonable boundaries, and I need to be ready for interaction. I’ll be able to have comebacks if my mom keeps questioning me further, without making it too awkward.\n\nRant over, thanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hello r/aita. Throwaway for what I hope are obvious reasons. \n\nThis post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. He was raised as the true \"golden child\" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. We were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the \"wrong crowd\" and his life is in absolute shambles. He is 24 now and if I had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor's workshops, investment schemes and on and on. It could be a little less, it could be a lot more. The heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.\n\nMy brother showed back up in Chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was \"voluntary\" homeless. My mom couldn't handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would \"take turns\" hosting my brother so he wouldn't have to be on the streets (my mom's new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can't stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). So when I was told about this and when my \"turn\" first came around I told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, I had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  He wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. I have not seen him since and since I know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, I know he is still using. \n\nWell as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. He showed up at my house on Friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. I told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house OR I would buy him a bus ticket to Florida to get out of the cold. \n\nWell I don't think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket because what I know he thought was happening is that I was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then I would provide for him to come home. When I dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me \"when and how will you send the return ticket?\"  I told him there was no return ticket, take what I was giving him or stay in the cold.  He proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until I kicked him out of my car. I know he got on the bus, beyond that I have no idea what happened to him and I care even less. \n\n\nMy mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for \"great bodily harm\" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she'll introduce her to divorce attorneys. My sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn't sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn't taking my brother in anymore because her fiancé was sick of him. \n\n\nSo from the view of my mom, I am not only an asshole, I have apparently put my brother's life in danger. \n\n\nFrom my view and my sister's view we I have washed our hand's of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My friend and I were at a small kickback (maybe about 15 people or fewer there total). The kickback was hosted by a girl I had a crush on and had been talking to. Let's call my friend Emily and let's call the host Natalie. Emily knew pretty much everyone at the kickback (she also knew Natalie and was probably closer to Natalie than I was at that point), but I only knew a handful of the people there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the kickback, I was talking to a bunch of people (including Natalie) since I get social when I'm buzzed. I talked to Emily throughout the kickback too. Later on, I noticed Emily sitting alone and I was sitting on the other side of the room. I looked at her, we made eye contact and I made a gesture to ask if she was feeling okay. She nodded, so I assumed she was fine--I also didn't really see her drinking much during the kickback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA while later, Emily gets a phone call and leaves the house (I was sitting next to Natalie when this happened). Emily left and some of her friends followed after her so I didn't make an attempt to follow her as well. The people who followed her came back a couple minutes later and I asked them what happned. They told me that Emily got a call from her ex (Emily and her ex recently broke up but were trying to stay friends. They weren't on bad terms but there was still that weird kind of tension that's there when couples break up). I didn't see this as a big deal and Emily didn't appear drunk or anything, so I just assumed she wanted privacy when taking a phone call from her ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, she's acting a bit weird and distant so I ask her what was wrong. At first she was dodging it but eventually started the conversation by saying, \"Wow, you really are a 'hoes before bros' type of person.\" I was confused and asked her what she meant. She said that I'd rather flirt with Natalie all night than see if she (Emily) is okay. I got even more confused and told her that I wasn't flirting with Natalie all night--there were times where I was doing that, but I talked to a whole bunch of other people that night. Emily said that I didn't care about her when she left the house--I explained that it was because I saw people going after her and I didn't think she was drunk anyway. She then told me she was tipsy, so I asked her if she did anything dangerous when she left the house. To this, she responded that she just walked around the neighborhood. I got frustrated and told her that I didn't understand what she wanted from me--she willingly left the house and although she wasn't completely sober, she wasn't drunk enough to not know what she was doing. I didn't follow her because people already did and they came back saying she was on the phone with her ex, so I gave her some privacy. She made me feel like I chose some girl over our friendship, but I think she was overreacting a bit. We didn't make up after the fight and just basically said that we both expect different things from a friendship.",

      "description": "I am 19 (F) and I have dealt with an eating disorder for about 7 years now, it's gotten much better and while I don't consider myself recovered I am a healthy weight now, still slightly on the thinner side. I feel this is important to mention because Im very sensitive to comments on what I'm eating or comments on my appearance. To get to the point though, any time I go to grab something to eat my boyfriend always has something to say about it. I'll admit my eating habits arent the best but I hate the constant anxiety of trying to eat now because I know hell always have to chime in. He'll say things like \"I just want you to be healthier\", \"why don't you have this or that instead\", or give me a disappointed look if I grab something he doesn't approve of.  It's so frustrating and it feels more controlling  than genuine care about my health. He's not encouraging me in the slightest and is just making me resent him and want to eat what I choose for myself even more. I haven't asked for his help and now I can't eat anything without feeling ashamed or having to check if it's okay with him first and have to sneak behind his back to eat what I want to eat. We've gotten in some fights about this and he always think I'm the one being ungrateful and over dramatic. Please help me.. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Throwaway because my bf is on Reddit literally 24/7.\n\nOur relationship has been relatively smooth. Every month we’d have big arguments that stems from something smaller. Usually it ends it him saying he’ll try to be better.\n\nThis time, it was because I was ghosted by a client and can’t get enough money to buy plane tickets back to London. He kept offering alternatives and I can’t deal with it now. I told him to leave me alone if he can’t be with me some other way. He said he’ll leave me alone. Later I told him that I think I want to break up with him since I don’t feel like he’s someone who will stick by me through tough times. He said if he had known that it’s gonna be such a big deal, he would have reacted appropriately in the beginning. It hurt me even more because to me, it felt like he’s saying that what I feel doesn’t matter until it’s “serious”. \n\nTo be clear, I’ve told him that he should only change a behaviour if it’s severely impacting his life and to never change for me. He promised to change after most arguments we have not only for me but he sees a problem in them. Previous problems include heavy drinking and not being with me when I’m having episodes. This time, he apologised about not taking my issues seriously, and that he would like to work it out with me. I’m not sure now because difference in personalities and experiences, and that there won’t be much to work on because our issues are from a difference of personalities. I also feel like an asshole for pushing him so fast so far beyond what he’s used to and making it seem like he has to change to make our relationship work. So AITA? Should I stop this cycle and just break up with him? \n\nI’ve asked him and he says he doesn’t have any issues with me. He’s a pretty chill guy so maybe he just have low standards.",

      "description": "i’m already doing the school musical which takes up 3 days of a week. each practice takes 3 hours then i have to do homework, and i have a sexuality club on fridays. for a person that did nothing for a while, this already feels like a lot to me.\n\ni used to play softball last year, but i got tired of going and said i didn’t want to do it this year. (i said this in september) my dad said “we’ll see about it”. then i got into the musical and then that took up the days that softball games would be. my dad didn’t like this. so he talked to the head of the organization (for my town) and he realized that two other people (also in the musical) were having the same problem. so he talked to the head of a different town and they also have kids who can’t do softball because of stuff they have, so they made a team for us so we could play. this means i would be busy 5 days a week with practice on sunday, and i would  have to skip my sexuality club, the club that helps my mental health because we can rant about anything, and i didn’t want to do this because that’s too much + homework so i have no time to myself.\n\nAITA? can anyone help me explain why i don’t want to do this to my dad?",

      "title": "AITA: I am 'rich' but my boyfriend isn't, do I pay for things?",
      "description": "Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years now, we had a few little breaks and ups and downs but we've never cheated on each other, and so far he is my first and only. He is loyal and doesn't lie and has been there since the beginning. We both started out poor, but now I have $20,000 saved up in my bank and he still struggles to survive (we don't live together or share bills). When we got together when I was 15 (he was 19) from poor backgrounds and dreamed about getting rich and spending our lives together. He didn't work for that time period because of a disability but also because he's somewhat lazy, he used to try a lot in the beginning to get jobs but nothing ever came from them so he just stopped with time and stayed on welfare. \n\nRight now I'm 20 and he's 24. I'm in my second year of med school and have had a lot of well paid experience, scholarships and bursaries that I've saved money (as I still live with parents) and I will finish school with an excess of $20,000 in my bank, While I wouldn't call this 'rich' as he does it is still a nice financial position to be in. Meanwhile he tried to get back into education for a few years and failed, but last year it seemed like he had his shit together and got top marks and was admitted into college too on an Architecture BS.\n\nAs far as his personality goes he's pretty mature so now he just focuses on his work, but as far as his finances go he's still struggling to survive from bill to bill. He wastes a lot of money on ordering food and cigarettes, while I live a very modest life trying not to spend anything; although, he does still spend what spare money he has on me for presents and gestures but again I tell him that's a waste of money and he shouldn't do that. \n\nSo, when we go out for meals or we do activities together he says I should pay, that we should be a team and help each other out financially, essentially he says MY money should be 'our' money. He says this because we were poor together, and over time the dynamic changed slightly as I acquired more money and he did not. He wants us to act as a married couple and we DO plan to get married at some point in the future, but I don't think that justifies sharing my money with him right now.  \n\n\nI know the career path he's taking means he'll have a good income in the future, and at that point we may possibly share our income to pay the bills of the household, and I even mean to become a housewife at some point and live off of his wage while looking after our future children. I have never paid for one of his meals and we can't go on vacation together because he can never afford it, but I don't think I should pay his half of vacations we mean to spend together, or meals, or anything else just because I have money. I don't think it's reasonable that my money should be 'our' money, until we are on an equal footing financially. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here for not helping him out or paying for things, should MY money be 'our' money?  \n\n\nThanks",

      "description": "So I (29F) have been working for almost 2 years for my current company. I've befriended some of my co-workers, and I hold them dear. We get along good, sometimes i get made fun of, but i don't see that as a big deal since in my country this is a big part of the culture and I don't really mind. They're unconditional and are always there when support is needed. \n\nI am, extravagant, If I could say so, and when we started getting along they asked my why I was so weird, to which I responded with the truth: I am a highly functioning autistic person (Asperger's). I do have fixed interests and do not understand body languages amongst other things, but I have tried all my life to not let that stop me from being as normal as I can. But one thing I can't stop doing is to talk a lot (A LOT) about physics and entropy and astrophysics, and they bear with me. And I bear with them in those topics that do not interest me, although sometimes I just drift away and unintentionally ignore them but they also bear with that.\n\nThe problem was a few days ago, that I learned (by accident) that my boss, which resides in another country, will be visiting us next week. They hadn't told me he was coming because I also hold him dearly (he's helped and supported all of the team through tough times) and I tend to talk a lot about him. So they just said: that's the reason we didn't tell you, you'd just never stop talking about it. Just go on and keep talking about those other things we don't care about (physics and the other stuff). I know they probably didn't mean it to hurt. I just laughed along because everyone bursted laughing. But deep inside this made some sort of impact.\n\nBecause of this I am upset, but I don't know if I am overreacting or making a drama where there shouldn't be one. Tomorrow we were supposed to have a barbeque but I honestly don't want to be there. Am I overreacting? Should I just shake it off and go on? ",

      "description": "It was during the party we had for the 4th of July last year. My family and I had just moved into a new house, so my extended family were curious to see the house. And this is the first house we've lived in that had a second floor so it was exciting for everyone, especially all the small children running around the house.\n\nMy room is upstairs, and boy do small kids love to run up some stairs. \n\nI was sat with my sister and cousin on the stairs that face the door to the backyard so I was just sitting there enjoying the soccer game going on outside when I suddenly see like four children come running towards me and heading upstairs. The first one leading everyone was my small nephew, so I just stopped him and told him they couldn't be upstairs unless I was with them, also mentioning that they shouldn't be running up the stairs because they could potentially hurt themselves. Those stairs are very steep and small.\n\nAnyway, a couple minutes later, my sister comes up to me with my nephew in hand, and he's crying a bit, and she tells me that he only wanted to see my room because he hadn't had a chance to see it yet. I was a bit weirded out but I was like okay. We go upstairs and show him my room and my brother's room, since it's also upstairs. \n\nThen on the way down my sister says that she's gonna tell our dad what I did. I reacted to this with a wtf in my head because I literally had no idea what I had done. So I ask her what I did. She said that I was being rude to my nephew because I forbade him from going into my room, and that I had treated him horribly. Hearing this made me feel like shit because I love that child to death and would never want to cause him any harm or make him feel bad. \n\nLong story short, it turned into an even bigger argument than it should've been, shouldn't have even been an argument in the first place honestly but whatever. \n\nWas I the asshole for not letting him into my room? I do wanna add that kids had already been in my room that day and made a bit of a mess and I was tired of it so it's not like I didn't let them up there for no reason. ",

She's is extremely  shy, has the biggest heart in the world, works very hard and takes things easy. I have really high hopes for the relationship. \n\nShe had just visited my hometown for the first time. Met the parents at a restaurant. She was very quiet during dinner which I expected but overall the dinner went well in my opinion. My folks didn't ask her many questions but I encouraged conversation. I took her home and spent a couple days in her town with her.\n\nWhen I got back my mother was waiting for me and requested that we talk. I knew from her serious tone that the conversation wouldn't go well. She expressed concern that I was seeing a \"disabled\" girl.  This girl, in her own words,  isn't \"book\" smart. I have found that I need to explain some pretty common phrases to her because she doesn't know them. She told me that she dropped out of High School and even when she was there she had an IEP but has held down multiple jobs and doesn't seem to be disabled to me. She definitely has had a rough past but what millennial hasn't at this point. I guess during dinner GF was rocking back and forth and my mother called it stimming. I see what she is talking about but I never got the impression the girl was autistic. I felt like she was attacking her without even giving her a chance to get to know her. I tried to talk this out with my mother but it ended up in her just walking away without saying anything. \n\nAITA because I am upset with how my mother talked about her? ",

      "description": "My husband and I are disagreeing over this. We're having a kid soon and justified some expensive baby purchases for the short newborn phase by saying we'd sell them afterwards. We looked up resale prices on a couple different sites, then bought items that are nice and have decent resale value. All in all, we expect around $1000 for these items. \n\nSister in law just found out she's pregnant, and my husband would like for us to give everything to her. I don't think we can afford this, and last month, my husband was talking about how we are going to have to really cut back to afford childcare. Also, they make more than us and can afford to buy it new or from us (at a discount to the secondary market). For context, we're all looking at buying cars. We're looking for a used CRV, and they are looking to get a Tesla Model X. I think we should ask them to contribute if they want our stuff (and they already asked for it, assuming it was free). Husband says that's not how his family works and that we should just give it to them. I point out that we've always been more generous than them in gifts, but he says that's just how it is with big brothers and little sisters. He says he'd give the shirt off his back for them. I say that would be fair if they were in need, but they have plenty. \n\nI've offered a couple compromise solutions (we'll pay for 2/3, they pay for 1/3, we'll split the resale proceeds accordingly after everything is done being used; or we ask them to get us something we'll need and call it awash). Husband refuses and says I just don't understand.\n\nAITA here? Husband keeps saying I'm being selfish. I think we shouldn't give gifts we can't comfortably afford. \n\n",

      "description": "So my partner and I have lived at this apartment complex for about 1.5 years now. We were traveling for the holidays and got back on Jan 1, the day rent was due, but as a completely innocent slip-up forgot to pay rent. This was totally our fault, and when I was at work the next day I saw an email reminding me that the rent was late and that I owed a $75 late fee. Well, I was legitimately late so I figured I'd pay the late fee no questions asked. I went to pay online later that day and found that all online payments were blocked. Then I started getting some scared/hysterical texts from my partner saying that we were being kicked out -- they'd come by and issued a hard unconditional eviction notice stating we had to be out in three days, and the eviction would not be overturned even if we paid.\n\nI thought this was completely ridiculous given that we'd been perfectly responsible tenants for 1.5 years and this was just an unintentional slip-up. Besides, how could it possibly make business sense to evict us when they've got \\~6 months of rent left from us? I literally had over 100 months' worth of rent in my checking account alone. I sent an email asking if they could reinstate my ability to pay online and they refused. I sent a follow-up email asking if the eviction would be rescinded if I brought a cashier's check by the next day. They didn't reply.\n\nI just sort of lost it and got livid. I figured they were bluffing, but the lack of reply made part of me wonder if they were serious. I spent the evening researching all my legal options. I went and got the cashier's check the next morning, brought it by the office, and just was so mad I think I was about to shake. I didn't actually say much. I didn't yell or really raise my voice. I just showed it to them, said, \"are we good?\", they tried to play it nice and said that the eviction is voided. I demanded that in writing and signed on the spot, because the notice they gave us was unconditional, meaning it's not automatically voided by paying rent. They wrote up a letter then and there and signed it. Twice before giving me the letter they tried to take the check, but I told them, \"once I have it in writing.\" Once I had read the letter, I tossed the check onto the desk and walked out with the letter, without saying anything or acknowledging them in any way.\n\nI've never really had this sort of interaction with anyone before. I am not one to normally lose my temper. I've been reflecting on this for a while trying to figure out if I overreacted. I think it was the \"unconditional\" part of the notice that had pushed me over the edge -- that made it feel less like this was a \"pay or we'll evict you\" thing and more of a \"we're evicting you\" thing.",

      "description": "So, when my wife and I got married she wanted to keep her last name for personal reasons. I had no issue with this and, as far as I knew, neither did my parents. Our two sons have both our last names hyphenated. However, when we receive anything from one of my parents (they are divorced so it's separately) it will be addressed to the family as just my last name and nowhere is hers listed. My father also never uses our sons full last name and uses my last name as a nickname for our oldest. This has been going on for many years and it really bothers my wife as we have been married for twelve years at this point and they are both fully aware of our names. \n\nAnyway, we recently got a Christmas card from my dad and it was addressed using only my last name as the family name. So I decided to just directly address the issue and called him. He seemed to be upset that I had asked him to include my wife's name and to use our sons full last name. He also said that now he would need to return a gift that he got us which was a customer tree ornament that had the family name on it (just mine and not hers or hyphenated). It turned into a bit of an argument and then what seemed like an annoyed apology. Then I call my mom and it went very similarly but she ended up crying.\n\nI feel like this should not be that big of an issue for them to acknowledge her name or our sons proper names when referring to our family but apparently it is. I don't think I'm being an asshole... Am I?\n\nTL;DR.  Asked my parents to include my wife's name and sons hyphenated last names and made my mom cry.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my dead dads hunting knife that’s rightfully mine?",
      "description": "AITA for wanting my dead dad’s hunting knife? \n\nOver a year ago, my father passed away quite suddenly in a car accident. My two sisters(34 and 22) and I (23) were informed of his death and immediately went to the sheriffs department in the city where his body was being held in a freezer until our choice of a funeral home was able to make the drive down to remove his body. The officer who was on the scene of the accident handed us some of the belongings my father had on him in the event of the accident. Items included: his wallet, and his favorite hunting knife which was attached to his belt. \n\nAfter arrangements were made for the removal of my father’s body, we made the drive back home, where my sisters and I would decide who got to keep our father’s hunting knife. \n\nWe eventually decided we would all three draw sticks for the knife. The longest stick got to keep his knife. I pulled the longest stick. Therefore the knife was to be mine. My eldest sister (34) requested that I let her borrow it for a month so she could do some hunting of her own with it. A year down the road, she still has it. I trusted she would give it back so I didn’t bother hounding her about it. \n\nWell, the last 7 months, she (my eldest sister) has gone through such a personality change. So drastic that even other family members have commented on it. To save time describing her new personality, I’ll make it short. \n\nEldest sister lost a lot of weight, gained confidence (great for her!), is glued to her social media accounts where her ego is fed, guys talk to her and she becomes enveloped in trying to please them, has multiple sexual partners, has STD scares, pregnancy scares and things alike. I bring these things up because she used to be the exact opposite of what I just described. The old sister I used to know would never do the things I’m about to describe as she had much more self worth for herself. \n\nWell, Last night I was at a local pub and bumped into my eldest sister there. She has a thing now where she likes to show out for the guys at bars and do as many push ups as she can on the bar floor. No surprise that is what she’s doing as I ran into her there. She eventually got kicked out of the pub for being violent with a bartender. No surprise for that either. I end up walking her to her boyfriends truck to make sure she gets there safely. I buckle her up and then she lets it all come out:\n\n“YOU’RE A MOTHERFUCKER FOR NOT WATCHING MY KIDS THE OTHER NIGHT SO I COULD GO HUNTING”  I am baffled at what she just said to me. I reminded her that I told her why I couldn’t watch her kids. That I was out with my friend having a few drinks. I was not physically in a state to babysit for her as I was intoxicated. She then added on that I am “not a happy helper”, which is a lie. I made sure she got to the vehicle safe and buckled up. I was more than happy to help get her home safely. \n\nShe then brought up our father. So I found the situation fitting to finally ask her about his hunting knife. She snobbishly said, “OH! The knife I use when I hunt all the damn time?”. To which I replied, “Yes, the knife I won fair and square? That’s the one I’m talking about.” \n\nShe then proceeded to yell at me saying, “YOU DON’T EVEN HUNT. YOU DO NOT NEED IT FOR ANYTHING!” I’m infuriated by this point. I replied, “That’s not the point. The point is that I won his knife fair and square. That was the deal we made.” I shut the car door and left in tears. \n\nAm I the asshole because I have no use for my father’s hunting knife? Am I the asshole for wanting to take the knife away from my sister who puts it to use?",

      "description": "Hey Reddit! I casually collect Funko Pops, which if you don't know, are tiny bobble head vinyl figures that come in a box. I posted an ad with a picture up to a Facebook BST group looking to sell or trade some of mine. \n\nThis guy, let's call him Bob, messages me on them, offering to trade a rarer one for some of mine. Along the negotiation process, he changes the offer half a dozen times and low balls me at every avenue. OK, that's fine, it's just part of doing business person to person and happens all the time. We finally agree on four of mine for the one, plus ten bucks on his end. When we meetup, he casually \"forgets\" to give me the money until I remind him before he's about to leave. OK, that's a little shady but I'm forgetful as well, so I think nothing of it.\n\nA few hours later, he messages me back saying that one of the Pops I gave him was wrong and admits it was his fault for not confirming after changing the offer so much or checking them during the trade. Initially, I was willing to refund him the $10 or undo the entire exchange, but he kept insisting on just swapping that one for something else of mine higher valued. \n\nWhen I refuse that, he also points out that one of my Pops were \"not mint,\" due to a tiny dent on the front of the box that was clearly shown on the initial ad picture and I had never noticed before. He was basing his argument on an offhand question he asked earlier of \"Are they mint condition?\" to which I just replied \"Yup.\" Bob then blows up my phone with messages saying I was a liar and a scammer, and at this point I get really ticked off, tell him to fuck off, and block him.\n\nI later found out from mutual friends that this guy reported me to the group's admins and made a public post calling me out as a fraud, posting an extremely close up picture of the dent and a screenshot of my messages cussing him out. Obviously, everyone is uninformed and hops on the bandwagon, telling me I was an asshole and I should return the entire trade, which I now refuse to do because he is crybaby and making a mountain out of a molehill. Now I know I'm stubborn, but am I really the asshole in this situation?",

The house in question is in town East Jesus Nowhere, about an hour commute from both their jobs.\n\nSo my friends who me and my SO have known since middle school want to buy a house. Specifically the house owned by female friend's grandmother. The house is in a remote town in our state, and is about an hour from their jobs. They both went to the same 4 year college, which left them with student loans to pay back. Hers about $50k and his $60k. \n\nThey have already applied for a loan from a bank to buy the house. With all the payments for the mortgage, their car loan, utility bills, insurance for both their cars, house insurance, heating, gas, groceries, and student loans they end up with about $280,000 of debt. Which is way more then income coming in. Female friend is losing her job soon and has yet to find a new one, and male friend works at a water plant. They could possibly survive, but they have irresponsible spending habits. Female friend dropped $120 on makeup just because she wanted too, and male friend regularly splurges on MTG booster packs, sometimes $100 - $120 at a time. Now I understand treating yourself, but they buy these things, and then bitch they don't have money.\n\nSO and I have tried to politely tell them that maybe it wouldn't be best to buy the house, as they both know and mentioned they could move out of state to use their degrees and make more money. The other day I finally snapped at female friend and laid out the basic facts that with their income to debt ratio that they wouldn't be able to afford to keep they house and would end up losing everything. She and male friend insist they'll be fine and if they lose the house they'll be fine, and refused to listen to me and SO.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

We haven’t been able to meet for quite a while and were planning to do so this weekend. Unfortunately, one of our friends was overseas and I had prior commitments so we tried to arrange it in the evening, because if I didn’t go as well we’d have had to cancel. Fast forward a day or two, my commitments were cancelled and I let them know I could meet them earlier in the day instead, and we agreed to do that. But fast forward again to the next day when we were supposed to meet, I woke up with a really bad throat (half of my speech were whispers or zombie-groans, so it’s not just my voice being raspier or scratchier), and wanted to skip out. \n\nProblem was that they were there early, and told me to go regardless and that I could use text to voice or hand gestures, and asked me just to go regardless. I feel pretty bad about having to skip out last minute but I also currently have trouble swallowing and cannot speak at all to anyone given how bad my throat is, and just wanted to stay at home until it got better.  I told them I was going to be late because I wanted to see a doctor, and they proceeded to tell me not to go and just stay home after if I was only going to turn up in a few hours (presumably due to waiting for the doctor and the travel time, since I lived a lot farther than they do from each other). \n\nAITA? I get that the group wouldn’t have been able to run without me (and previously I ended up missing a session because I couldn’t pull out of a commitment a few sessions ago, though they made their own arrangements to accommodate my absence), and we spent a lot of time to plan this especially since our schedules only recently freed up, but I genuinely didn’t want to go because I couldn’t speak at all and felt like I wouldn’t have been able to participate properly anyway given how I can’t communicate in a game that requires you to do so as well as I want to, and that I wouldn’t have enjoyed it that much because of how sick I was - so I felt like they were prioritising themselves over me.

      "description": "Me and my bff have been through a lot together. A few extremely heated fights but I love her to death and would do anything for her. We go to a really small high school and are only freshman who are trying to stay out of drama. \n\n2 nights ago I got sent a dick pic on snap chat by some boy in my class. I didn't want it, I didn't ask for it, I just kind of opened up my snapchat and it was there. I was actually pretty upset, but laughed it off trying not to make a bigger deal about it then it was. I told a small group of people who I thought I could trust. One of them actually ended up telling my whole bus (about 7 people like I said a small school) I was really upset and begged them not to say anything. The said they wouldn't and I moved on with my day.\n\nMy bff wasn't answering her messages, so I told her in person near the end of the day. We had math with the guy and my bff sits right behind him and was making fun of him THE ENTIRE CLASS PERIOD. Never actually said anything to him besides pulling on his hoodie and saying 'hey' while giggling, but spoke loudly enough that he could hear her. I told her to stop and she would, for about five minutes. The boy who sent me the dick pic specifically asked me not to tell anyone which I half agreed too so at this point I felt awful. I go to art class which is my last class and 6 people come up to me and ask about it. I'm upset, to say the least. \n\nApparently, my best friend told a huge gossip, and her other friend I'm not close with even though I told her not to tell anyone. I send her a bunch of texts saying basically what the heck why would you tell people, and she responded with 'this isn't my fault at all, you told people too your whole bus knows sorry it happened though.' That's all she had to say. The gossip she told ended up filling in the rest of the class on it and making fun of the boy who sent that dick pic to me.\n\nI sent her this super long paragraph basically saying I didn't tell everyone on my bus someone else did and I was angry about it. I also said that there's a difference between other people and her because I trusted her so much more. She left me on read for hours. I texted her late last night and was like 'i don't know if my messages didn't send or you're just ignoring them and we aren't talking anymore'.  She finally texted me back 2 hours later with this massive guilt trip saying that it isn't even a little her fault and that she doesn't need this from me right now and she's so stressed out and stuff. She also said that I shouldn't have told people that were going to tell other people. EVEN THOUGH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. So now we aren't talking and I'm super mad at her but she says I'm the asshole for being upset with her cause it's my fault it got out.\n\nSorry for spelling errors and grammar mistakes I'm worked up rn.",

      "description": "I will be using simple terms so that people who aren’t familiar with the game will still get the gist of what is going on. \n\nI’m from a much higher level than my friend, but made a second account to play with them. I play an off-tank on my main account. (Think of it as off-white vs white. Same class, different roles.) They are best with a damage character, but their confidence is lacking and they often won’t pick a damage character unless forced to (everyone else picked tank, off tank or healer). Usually this means they wind up healing.\n\nThey aren’t a bad healer, I’d say above average for their level. But they are a FANTASTIC damage player. They make mistakes like anyone else of course, but our games shine when they play damage. \n\nOut of maybe 50 games we played today, I would ask them to play damage right off the bat maybe 30 of them. Of those 30, they actually chose to play damage 5-6 times max. That meant they were often healing or tanking. This left me in a bad spot as an off tank.\n\nBecause I am from a higher level, when compared to people at my friend’s level? My mediocre tends to be on par with their good-great. Tired of asking my friend to play damage only to get rejected, and tired of having to try and churn out damage as non-damage characters? I started playing damage myself. Every few games I would offer to play whatever role they were playing so that they could damage instead. Almost every time they refused. Eventually I stopped asking.\n\nSo we arrive at our last game of the day. Another duo in our team automatically takes both damage slots. They pick...bad characters. Bad for the map, bad when taking into account the rest of the team and bad as far as their ability to output damage. I play along and fill the empty off-tank role. \n\nTurns out that not only are the damage players picking bad characters, they are actually bad at playing them. I try to up their chances by going a third healer. We lost the first of two rounds and the duo makes the same picks again at the start of round 2. I finally bite the bullet and go third damage. I pick the best damage character for the situation....this happens to be the damage character my friend plays the most.\n\nI did not ask my friend if they would go damage. I FELT that \n\n1. I had asked them many times that day and they clearly didn’t want to play damage \n2. I was worried they would feel pressured or that I was being obnoxious \n3. Often? When the situation is dire they will go third damage, knowing I will swap around to facilitate this.  They had the entire first round to choose to do this and did not. This, even though I had switched to a third healer in a silent attempt to encourage them.\n4. After picking third damage I waited silently to see if my friend would ask me to get off so that they could play that hero.  They didn’t. Later I found out that they had “resigned” themselves to a loss and as such weren’t paying attention to who was playing what on our team. \n\nThe second my friend realizes that I have gone third damage as their character, they ask me why I am playing them. Not why I am third damage, but why I am playing their character.\n\nMe: “Because I knew if I asked you wouldn’t.”\n\nObviously, this was an assumption on my part. For the reasons stated above, I really didn’t think they would do it. We needed it. I did it. \n\nThey were livid. In their mind, I should have asked them to play damage verbally. I conceded that I could see why they felt this way and maybe I should have. I gave them my reasons for not doing so and was promptly told my reasons were asinine and stupid. \n\nThey felt I was “holding it against them” that they refused to play damage for the bulk of the previous games, even when I asked them to. That my attempts to get them to play damage in the past matches were “irrelevant” to me asking them to play damage in THAT match. They also implied that they “couldn’t” go damage in past games because I was playing damage. This, despite the fact that I would often ask to switch roles with them. \n\nFinally - and this is where I wonder about my potential asshole-ness? They said it was wrong of me to pick “their” character. I told them I didn’t think there was anything wrong with this.\n\nThem: “I’ll just play (a character I play) or (another character I play) and then you can be upset at how shitty I am at them.”\n\nMe: “That’s fine? I don’t mind you playing characters I play. I know I’m not the best at (my friend’s damage character) but it was what we needed and I didn’t think you’d do it.”\n\nThem: “and how did that work out for you?”\n\nMe:  “Well, I WAS the last to die...”\n\nThem: “Because of me!!” (Remember, they were healing.)\n\nMe: “I’m not saying I did the best job, but I didn’t think that you would switch to damage.”\n\nThem: “Did you ask?”\n\nMe; “No, but I told you why I didn’t and you told me they were stupid reasons.”\n\nThem: “Because they were!”\n\nThis wouldn’t upset me in this scenario or even at the start of a fresh match. But by my friend’s admission, this is what upset them the most.\nSo, please tell me:\n\nAm I the asshole for choosing to play the character my friend normally plays?",

      "description": "Some background. I'm 14 years old, and have had my dog since it was 3 months old.  We go on the same walking path ever since I got him, and nothing like this ever happened to us. \n\nThis happened a few days ago. I went out for a walk with my 2 friends and my dog (which is a 1.5 year old German shepherd), like we usually do, but this time, as we were about 5 minutes into our walk, (keep in mind we're walking on somewhat of a narrow sidewalk, so we have to basically single file line our way through until we get to the wider road.) There was a stray and very aggressive dog wandering around. We were very worried as to being attacked by the dog,which could have been rabid, and my German shepherd potentially being injured or infected.\n\n The dog, which we will call AD, (aggressive dog) comes charging at us, obviously going for my dog which we will call MD (my dog) and tries to go for his face. He gets my dog in the back (no idea how). AD is a medium size, probably mix breed, slightly smaller than MD, but very feisty dog. As AD has a very strong jaw grip on MD's back fur, fight or flight kicks in and I...kick AD in the face. It whimpers, lets go of MD, and then runs away.\n\n I love MD to death, I would do anything for my best bud, so I couldn't let him get injured. On the other hand, I also felt really bad for AD moments after, seeing AD whimper and run away, as I'm a very lighthearted person. The friends I was with, all retreated a couple metres away. And they saw everything, which was an event of about 15 seconds, and said that I shouldn't have kicked AD, and that MD was obviously bigger and capable of defending himself. I also told my parents when I got home and they said that maybe I shouldn't have kicked AD but somehow pulled AD away from MD? \n\nAfterwards I went home, got my dog some water, and immediately went to the vet with my parents and told the vet everything that had happened, got MD checked, (fortunately no wounds or blood, didn't even break skin.) The vet brought the same argument to the table as my parents. I'm really lost here, and don't know what was the right thing I should have done? Please no rude comments. I'm sure someone agrees with me? ",

They broke up so she had to move back home with myself and my mom and took the cat with her. \nNow she’s planning on moving out and doesn’t want to take the cat with her as it’s hard to find an apartment that will allow cats.\nI told her today that I don’t want to look after him and she she was not happy.\nShe says he loves the area and thrives being able to be able to go outside and it wouldn’t be fair to move him to an apartment. \nI do love animals and I have in the past looked after her animals after she moved out (2 chinchillas 1 of them died while I was looking after them which was a bit traumatizing) but a cat is a lot of responsibility. \nHe also peed on my bed a few weeks ago while I was asleep in it and I had to spend almost €200 on new bed clothes and covers. She never apologized for this and never offered to pay anything to help.\nI feel guilty if I don’t agree to take care of him because it will be much harder for her to find a new place but also she should of thought of this before she adopted a cat.\nSo am I an asshole if I don’t want to make things easier for her by looking after the cat? \n",

      "description": "My girlfriend was at her parents place today having dinner. Her sister and the sister's boyfriend were also present. My girlfriend was watching Queer eye on TV with her mom when they sister's boyfriend made a comment about there only being 2 genders (male and female) and that their goal is to procreate. My girlfriend took offense and told him that that isn't true and people can be different. He didn't budge from his position.\n\nShe called me afterwards, pretty emotional, to tell me about this event. I fully agreed with her that she was wrong. What annoyed me is that she kept calling him \"fucking dumb\" which prompted me to say that she may have changed his mind if she empathized with him more. With this I mean that his upbringing may have been very negative towards LGBT and non male/female genders. \n\nMy girlfriend got even more upset saying that she just wanted to vent rather than have another discussion with me. Never was my intention to get her upset, it simply was to provide another point of view. \n\nI'm genuinely not sure if I'm the asshole here so I'm interested in your opinion.  ",

Basically my parents got divorced a looong time ago and when my dad got remarried he made the mistake of marrying a huge bitch who after 8-9 years of living with me decided she didn’t want me in the picture anymore and my dad let her send me away to my grandparents house. I haven’t spoken to either of them or my stepsister in over a year and a half and then about a week ago I saw my dad in a restaurant. The thing that freaked me out the most was that when he saw me he asked how I was but I didn’t want to be in the conversation so I gave him very short answers. The conversation ended and after I got my food I left and took it to go. The worst part was how much anxiety this gave me and how nervous and scared I was. I’ve had anxiety about this happening for a long time and then when it finally did I didn’t know how to handle myself. I kept thinking about how I could’ve handled it better and felt guilty for not wanting to talk to him since he looked very sad and angry. Anyways AITA for not wanting to speak to him?\n\n\nTL;DR- saw my dad after a long time of not having any contact and tried to get out of the convo as soon as possible. Felt a little guilty afterward and don’t know why",

      "description": "The other day my wife had a minor scrape in the car park (car vs wall) and it left quite a few deep scratches along the back passenger side of the car. My first reaction was to be pretty pissed, because it's a relatively new car and was previously in great condition. I was careful not to show my frustration though when she text me a picture of the damage, I confirmed that she was OK and I didn't make a big deal about the cost or the damage, even though I am admittedly pretty pissed off about the whole thing. I figure that the less I think about it the less ticked off I will be.\n\nShe took the initiative and sent pictures of the damage to a local spray shop and they've quoted roughly $550 to repair the damage. She's also taken the car to the dealer directly as the car was booked in for a service with them on Monday, and she told me they said they'll email me with a quote. So far so good.\n\nWhen I got home tonight I told her I would forward her their email so she could compare it with the spray shop and to go with whichever she preferred. She looked at me like I'd come into her house on Christmas and pissed on her kids. She asked me why I would forward it to her, that she knows nothing about cars (or how to drive one, clearly) and then accused me of trying to punish her by making her deal with it all.\n\nI told her that no, I did not want to deal with it and that I would like her to sort it out.\n\nSo I'm sat here on my own while my wife has gone to cool off because apparently I'm an asshole for asking her to clean up her own mess.\n\nSo...

      "description": "I'm currently trying to reflect, and looking at my past, i have a alot of things i want to see in a new light.\n\nThis happened about 1 and a half years ago. At the time i was in the middle of a volunteer project.\n So, at the start of this year-long project, we were assigned teams which were supposed to stick together and build booths to teach basic science concepts to children. This was only one part of this project, which had various other activities a volunteer could do aswell. So, at the end of the first and only mandatory group session, we were told to keep our booths until the group leader organised a session outside the centre (as the science centre was closing for renovations during school break) and were supposed to improve our booths whilst volunteering for projects outside of the centre. So, at the start, it seemed okay, did a few more sessions alone while there where no group sessions. Additionally, i was not contacted at all by any group member during this period of time, and correctly assumed that they did not need the part of the booth i was given to keep (about 6 kg worth of art supplies and assorted papers and decorations) and also (incorrectly) assuming  that no group sessions were planned.\n\nCut to about 3 months later. It is a friday evening, and suddenly, i am contacted by none other than the group leader that had not contacted me at all (at this point, i had practically given up on doing anymore group sessions) who added me to a group chat with all the other teammembers which had been created a year ago, almost immediately, i had just discovered that they had actually been communicating through out the months just that i had been left out, and even went to several previously unknown group sessions! So, I  thought that after this long hiatus, they would be looking to plan another group session, or maybe update me on what had happened.\nInstead, the first communication was *****(me) please come tomorrow afternoon and meet us at ***** library to pass us the booth items. I had to immediately refuse, seeing as i had a paid swimming lesson the next day that afternoon, which i had also told while discussing with them about when we could not make it about the first time we met and that library's location was at least an hours journey from my home. I apologised at first, thinking it was possible to reschedule or compromise to a closer place, and was immediately scolded by them and insulted as a useless teammate only a mere hour after they had added me to a group which i had never known existed as they 'had planned this for months' and that i was 'not contributing' to events i were not informed of. Which they also failed to tell me about. Even when we were working with each other in close contact for a MONTH. (Planning the first mandatory group session plus building booth)\nAnd to add a cherry on top, she also attempted to report me to a teacher in charge of liasioning with the center, which sided with her at first, then learned of her just leaving me out for almost half a year only to add me back for the booth(pretty sure i would never have heard anything of her otherwise) and pretty much just told me to pass him the stuff on monday when i could make it. I stuck to individual work from then on, and returned the booth items at the time the teacher said too.\nTo conclude, i don't really regret putting my foot down and refusing to carry a ~6kg heavy plastic box to them on a 2 hour round trip and also wasting money on the regular, prepaid swimming class i had, but am i the asshole for wrecking their plans?",

She didn’t seem excited so I figured it was shock and she’d come around. She was there for me some during the pregnancy- I had a scare one day and she came over to sit. \n\nShe’s short on money so husband and I planned on paying her to watch our dogs this week. She watches them fairly often and sometimes just asks to because she misses them. She was excited to keep them. \n\nAnd then my water broke and all she said back was “I’m sick”. Even though we had plans the next day and had been texting all day. Out of the blue sick. I thanked her for telling me and not getting baby sick and really believed her at first. But almost a week later I’ve asked her how she’s doing twice and she hasn’t asked me how I am at all. \n\nDuring the pregnancy it was something we barely talked about because I could tell she had little interest. We still hung out at least once a week. Little interest was fine with me during it because I felt like she wasn’t just treating me like an incubator like so many tend to do. But now I’m thinking it’s deeper and I’m really resenting not even a “how are ya?” When she lives five minutes away and we had set plans in place for how she was supposed to help. \n\nWIBTA for just not texting or reaching out again?

Therefore I've told her that she isn't to talk to me about her eating disorder at all because it's inhibiting me from my own recovery, and that I do not want to hear about any of her food related issues.\n\nI'm her only friend, and she has nobody else to vent to about her issues, but they trigger my eating disorder heavily.

      "description": "I grew up in a society where it was taught that you should bend over backwards for any family at any cost. As an adult, I learned about abuse and mental and emotional health and I soon realized that everyone was wrong about having to break your back for family at any and all costs. For a few years I have maintained a healthy distance from the family members that do not try to have a relationship with me; my sister being one of these people. I have tried multiple times to mend the relationship with my sister, however, she has predetermined thoughts about me and every time I'm around her she treats me like an enemy. I have addressed this with her but even after I addressed this, things did not change. I know I'm not perfect and there is plenty to dislike about me but she has never given me a chance. I am a completely different person now and she's never cared or put in any effort to try to change that. \n\nA little history: my sister is a stranger to me. Growing up, she was never around. She was always getting into some trouble--running away, sneaking out, drinking, in and out of juvenile hall, etc. So, naturally, I do not care too much about her and I can say that I do not actively love her. I don't wish ill upon her but I also don't want to spend my limited time on her. \n\n I get a call tonight and it's my sisters boyfriend--who I have no relationship with for so many reasons. He starts telling me about whats been going on. Apparently my sister has been in and out of the hospital, she had \"heart failure\" and is \"feeling like she doesn't want to be here anymore\"--here being Earth. He then starts going on about how he knows that things have not always been good between the family but that we all really need to pull together to \"show her that she's loved\". \n\nI don't know if this seems shitty to admit, but I don't want to use my limited free time to tell a stranger that I love her so much and blah, blah, blah. There is nothing anyone can say or do to pull someone out of this, so why should I tell her these scripted lines that she knows are lies? I'm sure her boyfriend has good intentions but I don't think it's okay to put that kind of pressure on people. I couldn't--simply because I didn't want to--tell her the things he wanted me to. Instead I let her know that I was aware that there was nothing I could do or say to make her feel better but that I was here for her anyways. I also told her that she can't get any better if she doesn't decide to help herself. Maybe that's not helpful, but I think spitting lies is worse. \n\nI don't know Reddit. Do you think I'm the asshole here?",

      "description": "I'm at the DMV to get my out-of-state car registered. I finish my application and I am waiting for my number on the screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I see this couple watching their son((&lt;1 yr probably) play. At this time when I chose to take a seat, there were multiple open seats (even consecutive ones) , but I saw that the family didn't chose to grab any and were focused on their son who was playing -- he was running from one end to the other end. As it started getting busier, a lot of those seats started being occupied, but there was one open seat right next to me. The mom decided to sit on the floor right in front of me. I would have offered her a seat but since there was an empty right next to me, I thought she preferred to sit on the floor and watch her child. The dad, meanwhile, was watching his kid from far away. The mom started spreading all her shit she was carrying in her bag with no concern that she was blocking me. I later found that she couldn't speak any english and I thought it was more of a cultural thing than anything else.\n\nNow the dad comes to me and says \"can I have the seat?\" in a demanding tone. Now, I would have given up my seat if he had asked politely, but his demeanour was such that he deserved to have any seat he chose just because he has a toddler and that he had the moral authority to do so. He and his wife clearly chose to not sit when there were seats available and now that his wife marked her territory in front of me, he wants my seat and the seat next to me. I didn't know whether he was asking for himself or his wife and pointed to the empty seat right next to me and said you could sit there.\n\nHis face gets red and he starts looking around for seats and then finds some seats on the other side of the office. While passing me he says \"He is not an American\" twice loudly so I can hear. Well, I am brown and an immigrant (legal).  I give him marks for guessing that, but I didn't say anything back. \n\nDid I deserve that? Am I the asshole for not giving up my seat to a person and his family who feel they deserve to sit wherever and whenever they want to in a DMV office?",

      "description": "Hi reddit. I’m in a situation that just has me feeling shitty all around. \nSo basically, some background. My boyfriend may be a father in a couple days. It’s a long story but before i knew him, 9 months ago, his “ex,” got pregnant, but she doesn’t know who the dad is because although she has one child already that’s around 6-7 years old, she was told she couldn’t have anymore and she was having sex with him while cheating with another guy that she had been with for 4 years and she ended up pregnant while she was having sex with both men. \nSo i guess in conclusion, there’s a 50/50 chance my boyfriend is the dad, and she’s due any day now but my boyfriend is mixed and pretty dark and her boyfriend (same one that she had been with for 4 years) is white, so we’re definitely gonna know who’s it is when it comes out. \nMy question is, Am i an asshole for not knowing if i still wanna be with him if it does turn out to be his? My thing is, she’s really messy. She’s already disrespected me a lot and she hasn’t even met me or talked to me, only about me. I have never talked to her, not even 2 words, so already i see that she’s just bitter towards me for the simple fact that i’m with him. She also is just an all around shitty person (and that’s not just coming from a place of bitterness) and i know that if it’s his there will be a lot of problems in our relationship because of her and her pettiness. Although she has her man, she still tries to see my boyfriend and she also tries using him for money. He wants to be in the kid’s life and i’m glad, because growing up i didn’t have much of a family and i’m all for that—but as much as i love him, i just don’t know if i want to be a part of all this and take on being a step parent and put myself in the middle of the whole babymama-drama mess. \nI’m torn between “a step parent can be the best thing to happen to a child,” and “it will hurt at first, but things will be easier if i leave now.” Part of me wants to be happy &amp; supportive, and go buy baby clothes and all the works, and go to her as a woman saying hey, i’m here and i’m a part of this and i’ll be really glad to work with you if you’ll do the same, if it turns out to be his...but part of me is just kinda bummed out because i know it would never be that easy and if i’m being honest, i’m just too insecure of a person that i would end up stressing about it all the time and i’m at a point in my life where i just feel like my own happiness and peace of mind comes first in my life. \nIt feels so selfish to leave over this because nobody has ever treated me so good and i love him, but i also know that staying is going to put a lot more on my plate and i’m not sure if i’m ready for that. \nAm i the asshole here?

      "description": "Well, some are calling me an asshole for this, but I am not sure.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for one month officially, and in that time he got kicked out of his friends house, to which I said he could stay at my house, honeymoon phase and all.  He also lost his bank card, so he was staying with me rent and bill free plus living costs until he got paid, to which I have not seen this money yet.  Naive, I know.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I found out that I was pregnant, and had to arrange an abortion.  He wasn't overly supportive, and when I got upset would say 'it won't matter in a few weeks'.  I came back home to my parents this week because I felt smothered and wanted time away to try and do my essays whilst dealing with crippling morning sickness and emotional strain about the whole thing.  On the day of the abortion (only two days ago), which was twenty minutes away from my house where he's staying, he completely forgot about it.  When I said I was in hospital and couldn't talk, it didn't even click and he assumed it was A&amp;E.  He blamed it on the fact he had worked the rugby weekend; as had my best friend and I heard from her first thing that morning.  He said he was tired and tried to make me feel guilty.  I had a really rough time and ended up with injections in my ass and a drip because I couldn't keep the medication down, but he simply blamed me for not updating him - I was in hospital all day slightly preoccupied - when he hadn't even asked.\n\nSince I found out about the pregnancy my rationale flooded in about our living situation, and I advised him that since he had a flat in another city, maybe he could use it to commute to and from work in my city because I didn't think it was healthy that we were living together so soon.  He immediately agreed and has had two weeks to organise it, but tomorrow is the day he has to go (also because my parents are furious) and has completely flipped.  He is saying that I have made him homeless and he is having a mental breakdown, has no one to stay with and nowhere to go and is now refusing to talk to me.  He insists that he is going to be 'streeting it' for at least a week.  I am really concerned and feel like a massive arsehole.  I feel so responsible and my one friend says that I can't do that to him, whereas the other says that he is guilt tripping me and will likely find somewhere to stay amongst his 'friends all over the UK' and what about his flat?  I am at a loss, and feel like such a twat.  AITA?",

We both go to colleges on opposite sides of the US. \n\nAnyways, the last couple of months have been kind of rough for us. But, we've gotten into a routine of FaceTiming every night. He's busier than me usually throughout the day, or I'm just more responsive to texts idk but FaceTime is important to us because it's when we get to finally talk \"face to face\" and have just some alone time. (if you're in a ldr you get it) \n\nAnyways, this week we've both been especially more busy (job interviews, midterms, all the things that come with college) and both agreed we wanted to talk alot tonight to catch up and such. My bf started ta-ing this semester and so I'd been texting him when his shift ended asking to FaceTime because we'd planned on doing that. But, he responds half an hour later \"I'm staying late\" \"there's alot of people here the hw is due tomorrow\" and then I just get frustrated/mad at him and eventually say that I dont want to FaceTime anymore tonight.\n\nI'm not mad that he is TA-ing and helping students, it's more just the fact that we'd planned on talking tonight, but he just blows it off. Also, I cancelled on some plans tonight with a friend to do a case competition because if I didn't then we wouldn't have had time to talk. I'm mad that it feels like (and I've felt this for a while)  I'm willing to push aside my plans more than he is, for our relationship.\n\nSo, AITA?",

I genuinely believed before the fall semester started that I would be cooking fairly often. Unfortunately, laziness led to me eating out for almost every meal. As time went on, I would stop going on grocery runs because I literally never ate at home.\n\nNow, it's spring semester and my schedule is actually extremely busy. I only eat out. I'm refusing to go on a Costco run to buy food from a list for my roommates. I stated that if we planned meals ahead of time and I would be guaranteed to eat from it, I would be happy to stop by a market before going home and split ingredients for it. I also said I'd be happy, as always, to split anything else we need around the house. Otherwise, I can't just buy groceries that will be consumed by everybody else but me. \n\nI'm currently being told that I'm causing purchasing food to be a financial burden for everybody else and not being a good roommate or friend. I don't get how splitting groceries, assuming we all eat the same amount of food, even saves us money in the first place. That's not even the case, as two of my roommates, the ones complaining about it, eat disproportionately more food than me or my other roommate. \n\nI genuinely want to know, am I missing something here?",

      "description": " I was a member of a guild in an mmo. The leader was a huge piece of shit for a number of reasons, of which I don't have time to go into detail here. Anyway the leader pulled some shit and it caused an exodus of players from the guild. Most of which, were my close friends. But one member, the leader's wife, was an incredibly close friend of mine, i considered her like a sister, call her S. After the exodus, I stayed for her. I stuck through it, and reached out to those who left, got my raid group back, and was able to play with everyone, I spent time with S and spent a little time with the other group(at this point we had only raided once). But once she found out I had another group, the following conversation happened\\*:\n\n\\*Typed into a Screenshot because would take to long to edit out private information: [https://imgur.com/a/0lfZyVw](https://imgur.com/a/0lfZyVw) \n\nAnd we left it at that and we went back to normal the next day. This did, however cause me to breakdown in the middle of class, and I had to go home for the day. Now today, THIS conversation happened: [https://imgur.com/a/xOJq0ne](https://imgur.com/a/xOJq0ne)\n\nRed is me, Black is her, White is just other general stuff. This made me break down a second time. I really felt like I was being guilt tripped and manipulated, so I went to a friend, and we decided it was best for me to just leave because this drama was going to kill me. S didn't take it well: [https://imgur.com/a/lINgKNX](https://imgur.com/a/lINgKNX)\n\nThis whole experience has been heartbreaking and even though everyone I've talked to has said I did what was best for my sanity in the long run, I still feel horrible for what I've done... I need fresh eyes on this.\n\nReddit, please help me figure this out.\n\n\\- Angel\n\nIf you see something in the post or screenshots that can reveal identities, lmk asap so I can edit them. thank you.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my best friend her study habits are terrible?",
      "description": "My best friend and roommate in college (senior year) is a dedicated student who spends basically all of her free time studying. Sometimes it gets on my nerves because she'll act like I'm being inconsiderate when I ask if she has time to watch a movie or something, like how could she ever take a few hours to chill. She is constantly studying but never getting ahead in her work. Based on the amount she studies, she should have perfect grades, but she never does as well as she thinks she should. I personally believe this is because she has ineffective studying habits, such as copying all concepts down in quizlet and overanalyzing everything she turns in to the point she takes much longer on an assignment than I think anyone should.\n\nMy friend and I are very different on this front. I have nearly perfect grades, but I spend much less time studying because I believe I have found study tricks that work so I'm spending less time being more effective, rather than spending an entire day being only slightly effective. She often chalks this up to a difference in our personalities and learning abilities, but I disagree, I think she could change her study habits and benefit. So, the other day, I came home and she was clearly stressed and said, \"Why do I feel like I'm constantly studying but I never feel like I get anything done?\" She asked, so I just said bluntly, \"If you want me to be completely honest with you, I think it's because your study habits are ineffective,\" and I explained my reasoning. She started tearing up (she was clearly already drained from studying all evening) and I tried to explain what I meant and tried to give her suggestions of things to try instead of her current ways. \n\nIt is hard for me to watch her spending so much time with little academic payoff, so I thought my honesty would help. Ever since then, she has barely talked to me, and when I bring it up she says she's fine and she's not mad. I can tell she hasn't tried adjusting her study habits. I'm worried maybe I was a little blunt and maybe it's not worth trying to change your study habits in senior year anyway. I'm overthinking it now because I'm very unconfrontational and I've never really done something like that and I just want to know, am i the asshole? ",

So F has a history of being a general not-so-good person. He often lies and cheats others to get what he wants. Ex. Lying about wanting a relationship with a girl when he just wants sex, getting himself stranded in random places and forcing his friends to pay for an Uber etc, but, in H’s case, he was the only person who didn’t bully him in high school. They share a lot of the same humor and interests, so I let it go for the most part. But then F stole a very valuable thing off H (worth about $50, but to us starving college students it’s basically luxury). He then lied about it, deceived H so he could use it as long as he could, lied about losing it, then went back on everything and returned it. He has stolen small amounts of cash before. I’m worried he is using H and my relative wealth and he just wants to see what he can swipe and get away with. He doesn’t have a job, a diploma, and is on probation for drinking and heavy drug use as a teen(witch he could never convince H to do). I told H he should drop F as a friend, but H is very very forgiving and doesn’t want to lose a long time friend.( I should mention he has other friends and I have never asked him to drop a friend before despite disagreeing with some of his choices) AITA for heavily requesting he stop seeing this person? (I am okay with them continuing to be friends, it just bothers me a lot and I bring it up frequently.)",

I used to be a fan of the show when I was a teenager, but interest faded as I got older. I went on Facebook to thank her and the conversation went something like this:\n\n**Me**: Hey, just got your gift in the mail. I appreciate it!\n\n**S**: You're welcome. I didn't know what else to get you and I remembered you used to watch that show a lot.\n\n**Me**: Yeah, I did. Not so much now. But thanks anyway!\n\n**S**: Wait... so, you don't like it anymore?\n\n**Me:** Nah, not really, but it's the thought that counts, right?\n\n**S**: I can't believe this! You're telling me I wasted my money? If you don't like it, pay me back what I spent on it!\n\n**Me**: Wait... you're saying you want me to give you back the money... that you spent on my *birthday gift*?\n\n**S**: Yes. It's not fair to make me pay for something you don't want.\n\n**Me**: Well, I don't mind sending it back to you... but I'm not paying you anything.\n\n**S**: I don't want it! Just refund me the money since my gift was wasted.\n\nThe conversation goes back and forth like this with both of us getting more and more frustrated with each other until I eventually just turn off the chat. We didn't speak to each other for a few weeks after that.\n\n(**Edit**: I know that I opened the can of worms by saying 'thanks anyway' it's just that I didn't know how else to make it clear I was no longer into that show so she wouldn't get me Gargoyle related gifts again in the future)",

      "description": "Okay so the title probably makes me sound like a huge asshole. However my best friend was murdered 2 years ago on January 10th by another mutual friend, whom he lived with, over drugs and money. His body was not discovered for two days, January 12th. For the past two years my \"friends\" have decided to \"honor\" him  by throwing a huge party on January 12th. I  do not have a problem with this whatsoever, I think it's a good thing to have a get together and see everyone and remember our friend. The issue I do have is that this event always involves people doing lots of drugs and getting belligerently drunk. Which of course also leads to drama and fights at this event. I have said in the past multiple times that I think we should have a more formal event and make it more about our friend than the party. This year, I was not invited to the event, despite the fact that I was this person's best friend and that we spent nearly every day together for 4 years, we lived close to each other in the same small town. I was upset about this because there were tons of people invited who didn't even know or were friends with, our friend who passed. I have had no ill words with anyone in my friend group ever, I have been nothing but supportive of them and have always been there for them. I was very hurt by not being invited. I probably wouldn't have went anyway because I disagree with how they \"honor\" him, but in my eyes I feel like I was the only person excluded form the event. Even people they knew couldn't go or didn't want to go was invited, except for me. I was really upset with them and confronted them about it. I expressed that I felt that by memorializing him by using drugs and alcohol was not appropriate, considering he was killed over drugs, and using them in his name to honor him was disrespectful. I expressed that his parents would not want that, which I know them on a much more personal level than anyone at the party, since I spent a lot of time with them. I also expressed that if our friend knew his fate he would not want everyone to be using drugs. I also expressed that if they want to honor him then they need to make something of themselves, rather than indulge themselves on drugs and alcohol, and learn from our friend who passed mistakes because he doesn't have the choice to do that anymore. If he could speak now that's what he would want for us. After I told them this I was repetitively told I was \"fucking retarded\" I was a \"dumbass\" I was a total \" judgement piece of shit\" and that I better \"watch my shit. After this I told them that I never wanted to be included or be a part of anything that involved them ever again. So this leads to my final question. Am I the Asshole? Because I have sure been made to feel that way.",

We live together, and we have a 4yo daughter. I was waiting forever for him to propose. So I was really excited when my sister told me that my boyfriend asked her which kind of ring would suit me and he sent her some pics from Tiffany's. I was super excited and hyped and I kind of guessed that he wanted to propose on our anniversary.\n\nThe day comes and I'm really excited. We went out for a romantic dinner, got back and when we were watching a movie he suddenly got down on his knees and asked me if I wanted to marry him. I said yes and then he showed me the ring. It was not even a new one. It looked old and the stones looked average at best. When I asked him about that he told me that his mother gave him her ring.  He told me that it had a great sentimental value since his father was the only man his mother ever truly loved. His father is no more, and his mother gave it to him. \n\nIt's all sweet and cheesy but it doesn't look great. Also, I don't want the begining of my new life to start with a second hand ring. When I told him this, he was very upset and told me that he never thought I was so materialistic and he just left. He's not even answering any of my messages or calls. Was I wrong? AITA?",

      "description": "Genuinely want some opinions as I’m confused about what i really feel about this. \nSo i was on instagram a lot recently and came across 8 business pages in the past 5 days that, along with listing their opening hours, specialisation, and other information, they also added “Black owned”.\n\nI thought about why a customer would care about this info, particularly a black customer (because i suspect this was for their benefit more than anyone else) and a couple of reasons came to mind, all of which felt discriminatory. \n\nAnother thing that came to mind was whether other businesses had ever declared themselves to be “White owned”, or “Asian owned”, or anything else, even something like “Gay owned” etc.\n\nIt feels weird if I’m being honest. And, as long as I am being honest, i feel that if someone put “White owned” on their business page, this may create problems. \n\nI’m not quite sure how to put how i feel exactly in to words at this point, because well, I’m not completely sure tbh. But I do feel that theres something not quite right. FYI I am not white or black. I’m asian.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I’m of Hispanic descent and my name reflects that. It’s a 4 syllable name and has a heavy accent and rolled “r”s. This makes it very difficult for English speakers to say correctly. To get around this I go by a nickname. My nicknames, while certainly unique, is only 2 syllables and requires no accents or special pronunciations. It’s an easy name to say. Let me also add I love my name, both my name and nickname. My name is a hand me down name from my great aunt who died in Mexico when she was 5. My nickname came about after I was first introduced to my older cousin. \nOnto the story, this is my second semester away at university. I took all 8am classes this semester and I always find it easier to get up for classes when I’m going to breakfast with a friend. With that in mind I accepted when a girl who lives on my hall invited me to go to breakfast with her everyday. I said yes.\nSo I’ve been going to breakfast everyday with this girl for over a month, and we’ve known each other for six months. A few weeks ago I realized it wasn’t just her lisp when she said my name, she didn’t know my fucking name! What the actual fuck? She’s heard my name, my name is written on my door, and did I mention WE’VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SIX MONTHS?! \nSo I corrected her kindly the first time. \nThen she did it again a few days later. I was a bit annoyed but corrected her again.\nThen today, she did it again! It’s not even a real name she keeps calling me! It’s a totally made up name. I got frustrated and didn’t sit with her at breakfast. When she tried to sit with me I politely told her “not today, thanks”. I know I hurt her feelings but we’ve had this conversation over and over and it’s crossed from forgetful to disrespectful.\nBut what do you think? Am I over reacting here? Or is she just not listening to me?\nEdit: \nWe’ve gone over the pronunciation of my name multiple times. She can say it, she knows it, she has a very slight lisp that probably has more to do with her retainer than anything else, she does not have a hearing issue. I didn’t ghost her, I met her in the cafeteria and when I walked in she said my name wrong. It was 7am I was tired and frustrated. I went and sat alone. When she went to join me I said “not today, thanks” to her face. I wasn’t hostile or rude in tone. I messaged her after breakfast and asked her to please work on saying my name properly as her not knowing it after six months was hurtful.",

I've run away about 2 and a half months ago to live with my boyfriend and his family, who are now almost my family in-law since we're now engaged. \n\nMy mom has stalked me and his family, threatening us and saying that I have ruined my younger sister's chances of marriage in the Middle East and that I have disgraced my family because I choose to marry an American who is Mormon and not a rich Arab Muslim with a respectable family name. That I have slandered my family name. She continues to make threats to cut off the rest of my family from me (I love them very much) and spreads gossip about me saying that I am the abusive one and manipulative one. \n\nI suffer from C-PTSD due to her sexual, mental and physical abuse of me. My sisters claim that I abandoned them and that I should have stayed and taken the hits for them. \n\nI've reached a breaking point and feel like exploding and just cutting off contact and sneaking to see the rest of my extended family in secret without my mom knowing. But this guilt stays inside of me saying that my mom loves me and that I'm an asshole for disobeying and for running away and to go home and just get my mom's approval.\n\nAm I the asshole like my guilt says I am?

      "description": "I had known a guy for about a year through various programs and summer camps and had become really good friends. We shared multiple interests and hobbies so we naturally got along.\n\nHere’s the part where it went downhill. So we both go to a summer camp every year, that’s where I met him. So a year after meeting him, we’re back at the summer camp. He keeps telling me about all these issues with school and his friends, saying nobody wants to talk to him, he has no friends, etc. So naturally I listen and put my input in and try to hear him out, but I keep thinking back to all the times I’ve hear him brag about how he’s super popular and everyone in the school is friends with him. So I don’t know how I feel about what he said. Moving on, later into the camp he ended up getting a super minor head injury, basically he fell 2 feet off a hammock (I measured the distance). He goes to get it checked out and just keeps talking about how he needs to leave and that he’s got a concussion. Now past this point I’m being filled in on details by my other friends but what presumably happened is that, because his parents wouldn’t take him home for his “concussion” he decided to say he was *killing himself*. He went around with a rope on his neck saying he didn’t want to be alive, and later said “I don’t care about anything, as long as I’m dying I’m happy”. There were a couple more minor incidents too, but that’s the main story?\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking he’s lying and looking for attention? I genuinely can’t believe him.",

      "description": "First off, I'd like to apologize for possible bad grammar, for I am on mobile.\n\nMy birthday was a couple weeks ago and I was allowed to throw a party for the first time since I was 10. My parents put a 10 person limit on attendees; I thought it was fine since I don't have many friends anyway.  However, while inviting my friend, Zafrin, a girl we'll call A heard and thought she had been invited. I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't correct her. I just simply told my parents that an extra person would come and they didn't seem to mind. \n\nSome background information, A is the richest girl I know and the most spoiled. Her house is double the size of mine and she buys 2 lunches everyday along with the one she packs. She also loves the fact that she is in higher math class than me despite me not wanting to go higher math class and having the grades to. One memorable quote is when I tried to help her on homework she looked confused on, she told me \"The math is a little too complicated for you, I doubt you'll get any answers right.\" I found out later I was right on most the questions. Despite her spoiled lifestyle, her mom won't let get her a dog for some reason, so when she met my dog, Tank (he is a black lab who is around 6 feet when he stands) she was excited. She immediately started calling him, \"my doggie\"  which I was kinda annoyed with but wasn't vocal. I recall making a joke, \"You call him your dog when you pick up his vomit.\" \n\nWhen the other guest arrived we all decided to so bad karaoke ( singing off key to songs we found funny, it's really fun) A wasn't very pleased, she told us that the songs sucked, missing the point of the game. During Mine Diamonds, I realized she had finished her pizza besides her crust. I told her she give it to Tank because if she throws it a way he'll just dig through the trash. At first, she sticks her arm out horizontally making Tank see her. He starts to walk towards her and she then starts walking in circles, making sure he is following. I see this and tell her not to taunt him because he has arthritis and we don't like putting pressure on him for too long. She would do it again until I corrected her, once more and repeat. I thought on the 10th time she understood and stopped taunting him. However within a second she is standing on top of a chair and counting to taunt him. My dog jumps and starts to make yelps in pain. At this point, I was really upset and grabbed the crust from her hands and gave it to Tank. I immediately told her, \"Don't touch my dog and actually listen to me or else  you might hurt him. Is that really too complicated or is math the only thing you can do.\" She immediately looked like she was about to cry; I realized I said I was sorry and it just blurted out. She forgave me but some people have been calling me an asshole. So I wanted more opinions. ",

      "description": "I initially wrote a very long backstory, but realised that you probably didn't want to read that much, so I tried summarizing it. \n\nMe and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for 1 year and 2 months. Half long distance half not. Started out not long distance. After the first three weeks of us dating, I cheated on him. (I acknowledge this makes the asshole scale lean my way entirely). There's actually a lot more to the story, but that's the important part. Obviously I've regretted it massively and he did not deserve it. I wish every day I could've taken it back. (If anyone does want to know the full story you may PM me). Understandably, he was very angry at me at the start, which frankly never really went away. \n\nOn top of this, the men I've slept with before him (3) have all been of different races. I'm white myself. He's a good guy, but he's got an ego and can be quite racist. He says that the fact I've been with these other races and I thus, must have very low standards, bothers him, because \"it brings him to that level too\" and he feels embarrassed of it. During our entire relationship, I've had to endure a LOT of judgement from him. If not about the cheating incident, about who I was with before him. I admit I have very low self esteem and perhaps have settled for men, thinking no one else would be interested, so I am fairly embarrassed of it. Admittedly I wasn't before I met him, because I didn't have the prejudices of these races, but I've realised that I perhaps was a bit desperate back then. \n\nComments I receive from him to this day, range from (after me saying there weren't any good looking people in the office I work at, after he asked) \"I wonder what they must look like then, considering your low standards\" to (when I mentioned something that was gross, a toilet or something) \"You found that gross? But you fucked an *insert race here*\" or to way worse during an argument. Both of which were completely uncalled for at that instance. I tell him over and over how I hate the way he talks to me, it feels very disrespectful and judgemental. \n\nHis reasoning often leads back to how I hurt him with the cheating incident and how he gets triggered because of that and then takes it out on me. I have tried to be understanding, but it makes me feel terrible every time it happens. Now here's where I ask.. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry at him for saying these things to me? Am I the asshole for thinking that, after one year, he can't still use the hurt from the cheating incident as an excuse for saying (unrelated) mean things to me?",

      "description": "*PLEASE READ*\nBackstory: \nIt has always been my mother and I for as long as I can remember, my father was abusive. August 2018, she started dating him and every weekend since they’ve seen each other. It’s come to the point, where he sleeps over two nights a week. ( of course when I asked her not have him overnight my request was deemed “manipulative” mostly because it didn’t match hers  and was overridden) (to be quite honest their relationship has put me in a bad mental state, I feel so alone ) I’ve put up a fight and pleaded with her, but it didn’t work and now we are where we are. \n\nSo February 27th is my birthday, I had a family dinner and birthday party. I asked him not to come to any, but no. Even though, my therapist said it would be best that he would only come to one of them, but my mom refused.  March 1st is my birthday party. I don’t have many friends as I’ve got social anxiety and find it hard to make friends. The friends that I didn’t invited backed out all but one. So I asked my mom if the person coming to my party could sleep over and she said yes. And then asked if her boyfriend could not sleep over that Saturday (ONE DAY OUT OF TWO)  and she said “no we would talk about it when she got home.” I knew what was going to happen as it happened when I asked if he could only go to one of the events, she would come home and argue about it and the result would still be in her favor. \n\nSo I went to her boyfriend and asked if couldn’t have to stay the night. He is very understanding and nice. He got me a cockatiel after my bird died and a bike for my birthday. I don’t have a problem with him.  He said “No problem”\n\nWhen my mom found out she was furious. \n\nI don’t really know anymore. I know I shouldn’t of asked him, but it’s supposed to be my night. Its my birthday party after all and it’s just one night.  She’s controlling everything, all the guest are her friends and Im only bringing one. Every time I ask  someone I know in real life, they say I should  be happy for my mother. I’m really looking for your answers please answer, while writing this I’m crying and holding my cat. It’s helped calm me down, it’s weird I know but sometime I feel my cats the only one that loves me %100 and is the only person that would never screw me over \n",

      "description": "Before getting into this I want to say that I love my best friend with all of my heart and it truly is hurting me to do this so I need to know if I'm doing the right thing. \n\nI met her 5 years ago when we were on the high school drill team together, she was a freshman and I was a sophomore so there's already a small age difference. Anyways we clicked really fast and were almost the same person, hanging out every day, always having fun, getting into trouble, normal high school stuff because we're teenagers right? It wasn't until she finally graduated and the first incident happened that I started to see that she wasn't, what I perceive to be, a good friend.\n\nSo she introduces me to her friend who she has known since childhood, we'll call him Jake, and I start to really like him. Him and I talk for a bit but he's going to college in another state so it fades pretty fast. During the summer Jake is back in town and my best friend and I head over to his place to hang out with his friends too. At this time my best friend already has a guy she's been seeing so when Jake and I start flirting and catching up she just encourages me. A few weeks go by and Jake and I are talking just about everyday but nothing too serious, I tell my best friend this and I'm all giddy because he's just so cute and so funny blah blah blah. Well something happens with the guy she's been seeing and he breaks things off with her. She really liked this guy and so she's absolutely distraught and ends up going to Jake's house and they fool around. The very next day she comes over and tells me everything and apologizes profusely. I get understandably upset but after a few days we talk it out and I decide it's not worth losing our friendship over, him and I were never anything official or serious but she did know how I felt about him. Overall my decision to forgive her.\n\nI think this will be the only time this ever happens but I'm wrong. A year later we work together so we have a lot of the same acquaintances. One of my guy friends brings over his best friend who we'll call Aaron. I meet Aaron before my best friend does so while we are hanging out I'm texting her about this guy saying how cute he is and I really like him. No surprise when she finally meets him, he likes her instead. But her and I make an agreement that since I have a crush on him it would be wrong for her to go for it. Well you can guess what happens here, anytime we hangout he's always next to her, sitting with her, even cuddling her in my own house in front of me. She blatantly tells me how he's always facetiming her and texting her and snapping her meanwhile he rarely responds to me. Eventually she gets bored of him because he's got a lot of issues so she starts ignoring his texts and such and I'm left trying to explain to him what happened meanwhile I know I dodged a bullet because he really was a bit crazy. Either way I pretended none of it bothered me because I thought it's just a boy why would I let that come between our friendship. But the more I thought about it the more it wasn't sitting well with me.\n\nThis is when I start to notice that she kind of takes advantage of how easy going I am. Little things start to pile up and I notice overall these few things.\n\n1. Anytime we go out to eat (which is often) I am always the one who's expected to pay. Even if it is her idea to go eat or she says \"I'm hungry I wanna eat here\" I end up paying because she doesn't have money. I usually joke around and call myself her sugar mama but overall I'm kind of getting tired of it and I've mentioned it to her before. \n2. I have gotten her 2 jobs and she's been fired from both of them due to her lack of proper work ethic. This not only looks bad on me because I recommended her, but now if any of my other friends need a job, they wont be taken into consideration.\n3. Anytime she gets a new boyfriend or love interest nothing else matters. She literally drops off the face of the earth until she wants to hangout with me because either they broke up or he's busy. I've never done that to her and even when I have a boyfriend I always make time for my friends because that's what you do.\n\nI haven't seen her in 3 months and every time she makes plans she bails the day of to be with her current boyfriend. Neither of them work or go to school and they live together at her parents house. It was her birthday last week and we made plans to go to this party to finally see each other and lo' and behold, she cancels on me to hang out with her boyfriend. This time, I snap. I finally tell her after thinking about it I've decided I don't want to be her friend anymore. We get in this big long talk and she's begging me not to cut her out saying she's sorry she wants to fix these things, I'm her other half and she can't lose me. I tell her I'm sorry and I love her and even though we have had more positives in our friendship than negatives, the negatives simply outweigh the positives in this situation. I tell her I hope she grows and matures and really if she does I hope we can reconnect but as of now she's not being respectful to my time and my feelings and I'm tired of it.\n\nSo reddit please, AITA? Or am I making the right choice for myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm currently in college and living in a 5 person apartment with friends that I have known for multiple years. We have a co-op program at our college so we have to change who is living in the apartment based on who leaves each semester. One of my friends, John, decided last semester that he was going to get a co-op out of state, meaning that his room would need to be filled, or a random person would be placed into it. I knew a friend, Derek, who had met my current roommates a couple times and was looking for housing for the next semester, so I told him about it. Derek was very happy to live with people that he knew as he had lived with random roommates for his first 2 years of college. The other 3 roommates were happy that they were not getting a random roommate. \n\nFast forward 3 months, John has now gotten an offer for a co-op near our apartment and decides that he would like to stay. I tell him that I have another friend, George, who is looking for a roommate to live with in a double. John says that he would like to stay in his own room. The problem is that Derek has already signed his lease and would need to tell the leasing department that John can stay in his room, and Derek would be okay with either living with random roommates again, or with George, who he doesn't know, and the double would have higher rent. John told Derek that he would like to stay in his room, to which Derek replied with \"I'm sorry, but no, I've already signed my lease and paid my deposit. I'm not going to be living with random roommates again.\" Now my roommates are upset with me that I didn't try to influence Derek in any way by telling him that they wouldn't be happy with him living here, as he is the reason that John can't stay. Am I the asshole?",

Asked if I was a confused butch, the lefties \"corrupted\" me, etc. I gave her a warning to stop and thankfully she did.\n\nWe had a few people from certain countries join she doesn't like (because political issues of a country she's interested in has--an American who is a nationalist for a country she has no ties to), so she would go out of her way to criticize them and argue with them. Over nothing. And claimed that Greece (yes, Greece) was up to something nefarious because they come first in the Olympics. Anyone who disagrees with her reads propaganda. She spent a good hour, I guess, bashing the country (I wasn't online and neither were the mods).\n\nThis turns into a big issue so I stepped in, told her to knock it off. Told her she's on a final warning and if she doesn't quit, she's banned. She tries to start an argument a little later on about inactivity (we're mostly exhausted adults who have kids or school). I give her a mute. She blames her period.\n\nMy breaking point in banning her was when I opened up requests and commissions for writing. I laid out, as I usually do, what I will/won't do. Two of these: major age difference and rape.\n\nShe requests specifically those two things. I decline and offer something else. She gets mad, accuses me of playing favorites, I'm a sensitive SJW and she should be allowed to talk about rape regardless of if it's triggering. I'm just \"oppressive\".\n\nSo, she has her little tirade and I banned her. I informed her she's been banned and come back within a month to see. Three days later, she writes out a suicide note, creates a new Discord account and links it. The note blames me.\n\nShe's banned, I blocked her. She harasses my friends and mods, constantly misgenders me, says that I'm ableist because she has autism (did not know this), says that \"I'm too sensitive\" and she should have realized \"I wasn't ready for such mature things\" (it's no secret I was raped), etc.\n\nAnd she began to tag me and link me anti-transgender things, \"studies\" on tumblr, I block and report her every time. She's recently claiming I'm harassing her and one of her friends is spying on me. All I've done? Block any accounts that are related to her that pop up in my notifications, moved certain accounts elsewhere, left the mutual interest, etc.\n\nMy friend explained to me that she has autism, so some of her behavior can't be helped but that feels like an excuse? I have my own behaviorial issues and I try to keep them in check (I do have my days where I get snappy and a little paranoid but I try to talk it out in a healthier manner, etc).\n\nAITA? Are we both? This feels stupid tbh.",

      "description": "I know it sounds bad but hear me out.  Obligatory apology for being on mobile. \n\nSo I live in a fairly small apartment complex that has one entrance and one road. When you enter th one road will loop around the entire complex and spit you out the same way you came in. \n\nIn the comments section for extra delivery instructions I've put: \" After entering the complex  take a right turn, soon the road will force you to take a left turn. After that left turn my building will be the second building on the right.(BLDG 7; APT 10)\"\n\nI've ordered food twice and each time the driver hasn't been able to find my apartment. When this happens they call me and have me wait outside while they drive around looking for me. The last time I waited 5 minutes for him to come around. I don't mind waiting but when you keep in mind that my apartment complex is small and it only takes about a minute or two max to drive all the way around the loop means that there's a good chance he called me before he even got inside the complex and had me wait outside. \n\nI tipped the first guy who delivered food but not the second. Now after thinking about it I've decided that in the future I'll only tip my driver when they can at least locate my building. Especially since I gave them -what I believe to be- good instructions. \n\nSo AITA or WIBTA if I follow that new rule for only tipping if they call me once they're outside my building and then I come down to get it. Or am I socially obligated to tip even though they make me wait for them when I've given them instructions? ",

      "description": "Little bit of background, joined a site maybe July last year? Putting up an ad with my email wanting to learn more about worldwide cultures and just generally find it interesting meeting new people. I stopped using it around September because I just ended up getting weird requests from older men which wasn’t what I was after at all (I knew it was a risk from the start) \n\nI’m from the UK (23F) then around beginning of this month someone else from the uk (21F) we had a really nice conversation just about general life, films etc so we ended up exchanging numbers - seemed legit and non weird. She mentioned she suffered from anxiety and doesn’t really have any friends other than her cousins who she’s close with. She said she found friendship in me and I was easy to talk to (I’m pretty down to earth so I get that) this was nice...\n\nAll went well until last week when she began messaging me about her neighbour (67M) about she woke up after a party with him at her feet (holes ripped in her tights by her toes and her shoes removed). I mentioned how that was weird, she then always spoke about feet and him, “winding him up” for his birthday with a voucher for “a hand job and spanking”. I said what if he actually cashes these in? She said “I can’t let the birthday boy down” - I let it be, hey who am I to judge about her sex life. You do you hun. \n\nThen things got really weird when she said how she wanted to give the same vouchers to her step dad but including other things like face sitting. I started to feel uncomfortable and she continued saying how “when I visit her” (this was never discussed or arranged) Her step dad will be my foot slave. She also has another penpal (37M) who she kept referring too, when she said about all four of us having a sexual time together. \n\nI just stopped replying. I couldn’t take anymore, it made me feel uncomfortable. No matter how many times I kept mentioning my boyfriend and how I’m not into any of this. Trying to get the conversation back on track to the previous nice conversations but she’d always turn it back into this. I ghosted her and it’s been 3 days. I get relentless emails and messages until this morning when I got one saying \n\n“Hi (37 M penpal) &amp; (me) - delete my number, I’m having mental health problems and can’t deal with this world anymore” \n\nAm I the asshole for leaving someone who needed help because she made me feel uncomfortable? \n\n",

I hate being herded like cattle to a room with no windows that I can't escape. I hate feeling like i'm in elementary school again. I think lock down drills are degrading and I hate them. I'm an adult and I feel like I should get a choice. So I planned to sit in my car during the drill. \n\n\n\n\nThe drill happened at noon. In between my 10:30AM and 12:15 class. So I walked out the front door towards my car. On the way to my car I was confronted by what seemed like a barrage of security staff and quality of life management members telling me to go back to room whatever. To which I said \"no thank you.\" I didn't get in trouble or anything, but it seemed like the staff members were pretty peeved that no one was taking it seriously. They even sent out a strongly worded email informing us that we should be taking the drills way more seriously.\n\n\n\nI feel like I know what to do if there were an actual school shooter. I do feel moderately bad for whatever staff members were being graded on the performance of the school. But I still feel like I did nothing wrong because, as I said to the staff, \"I'm an adult, no thank you.\"",

      "description": "Throwaway for privacy. \n\nThis is an old story from when I was in a friends-with-benefits relationship with a guy who turned out to be an abusive prick, but he’s not the one in the title. I’ll call him A. The title refers to his ex-girlfriend. I’ll call her B. (I’m a guy, btw.)\n\nBackstory: The way I got involved with my ex-FWB was very wrong; he cheated on B with me. Theirs was an open relationship, and I was attracted to A, so I thought, “Why not?” They had limits—his ex was okay with manual stimulation: oral and penetrative sex were off-limits. We went further than that. (B was a childhood friend of mine, which makes it worse IMO.) I fully realize I’m 50% the asshole (50% because it takes two to tango) in that scenario &amp;amp; I cannot even fathom cheating ever again, and I haven’t. \n\nAfter I confessed to B that we had cheated (I needed to tell her the truth; I hate lying and felt awful for her), she and A had a constant on-and-off-again relationship. \n\nTheir relationship was toxic even before A cheated; they were very codependent. (I’m talking “B posted an old video of them kissing on her public Instagram the day after they broke up the first time, saying she hated life without him and that she was crying &amp;amp; A replied in a similar manner” codependency.) B was verbally &amp;amp; psychologically abusive, whereas A was mostly psychologically abusive (manipulation and gaslighting—he did the same to me &amp;amp; took advantage of my mental illness to convince me that I was delusional). \n\nB would text me often. She has a traumatic past &amp;amp; tends to masochistically engage with people who have hurt her, so I tried to minimize contact as much as possible once I realized this. She shared intimate details with me, including that she was in love with this guy she called her “muse” and considering moving in with him. She later had sex with him. This was during a time when she was back together with A. \n\nI was still into A (hadn’t realized he was toxic yet), so when B dumped him &amp;amp; made him promise to never talk to me again (threatening him with punishment if he contacted me or I contacted him) since “she didn’t want him to move on, especially with me,” I flew off the handle and said she was controlling him &amp;amp; had no right—especially since they were broken up. I went to bed fuming. \n\nThe next day, I shared everything on social media she’d told me not to tell A, since he followed me &amp;amp; if I contacted him directly he’d be punished (plus I was pissed). I didn’t include insults in the post; her actions spoke for themselves. I admitted that I had cheated in the post as well. \n\nB then blamed me for her heroin relapse (I shit you not), amongst other awful things. She moved away shortly thereafter, &amp;amp; I cut off A a few months later. \n\nAITA for exposing her publicly? At the time, A called it immature, but everyone who saw the situation firsthand supported my actions. I’m kinda expecting an ESH response but I really want to see the nuance of all your answers. ",

He asked me if I am getting engaged and I said yes, I plan on proposing while I am on vacation. I gave him no other information, not the where, the how or the time,  only that it will be while we are on vacation. She snoops through my phone a couple of weeks later and comes across this text, she apologizes but is now insisting I propose elsewhere because the surprise is ruined.

      "description": "I work in retail and am scheduled every day until Xmas eve. I am confident that no one will be able to cover my shifts and my store will have to seek outside help from another store in our district, which still may not be enough. If I am hospitalized I could and probably should get fired for leaving during the holiday season when they need me to work the most. My coworkers are important to me and I don't want to let anyone down.\n\nMeanwhile I am battling bipolar disorder and the state of my mental health  is heading south very quickly. I am worried that I will not be safe if I don't go to the ER, but I feel like my coworkers will hate me if I end up in the hospital since it will cause a lot of trouble at my work. Would I be the asshole for going to the ER for instead of sucking it up and working through the holidays?",

(Ok, so I admit I guess I sound like a baby or whatever possibly) but I feel like it doesn't stop.\n\nLike, I feel as though they find it funny that my family and I have to work our asses off to pay the rent and car insurance and other bills, pets etc\n\nAnd my parents are absolute troopers. Dad is pushing 70, beat cancer twice, retired on and off, stapes in his head, and been to hell and back practically, and he still works his ass off every day for us to survive. He won't give up else we are on shitty social security checks or unemployment.\n\nMom and I have a job at a retail store together because fuck what people think.\n\n\nSo back to my original question.\n\nWould I be the asshole for telling my friends they're lazy entitled assholes who need to actually work for something?\n\nShould I keep my mouth shut (like I've been doing)?\n\nThanks!

I knew about all the stories and rituals but it seemed all childish ironically coming from a child. I would always ask \"why am i doing this, why does god say these things, why, why, why\" i wanted more answer but there were none that satisfied my curiousity, unless I died and faced God himself, then i could truly believe all the fictional superficial stories. And ive dreaded everytime it was mentioned in the family or some ritual was happening, going to church was the worst. I see through most of the bullshit. Why do people believe so much in this yet still think skin whitening products actually work. I want this nonsense out of my life to give me more space to think about things more important. Ive been living this lie for 20 years (24m) now. Ots would hurt my grandmother and grandfathet so much if i just came out and said ive not cared for any of this all this time. Im sick of it, im sick of trying to believe in this. i really dont like this religion anymore im done hearing all the same nonsense ove and over again, its the same thing every day. jesus this jesus that, virgin birth dying for sins. its bullshit. before i though its somethings adults tell children to behave but now its gone too far. i want it out of my life.",

I have a project due tonight at midnight. I wrote 3/4 of it, and did all the research because no one in my group has responded. When I saw them in class today, they all said they’d work on it tonight. But, obviously they haven’t. Now, I have it in pretty good with my professor. I’ve taught his son, and been a TA for him when I had time. If I told him they didn’t do any work they’d all get immediate 0s. (I’m 99% sure he’d do the same for anyone but 100% sure he’d do it for me). I know if this happened with my students, I’d want them to report it to me, but at the same time I know failing sucks.\n\nI’m extremely sick right now, but powered through the work anyway. I don’t feel like anyone has an excuse for doing 0 work and therefore they deserve the 0.

      "description": "So... I've been planning on having my friend - lets call him Gary - come up to visit me in the city where I attend my university. He's been asking if he can come up for about a month and I've been telling him I'd love to have him come up. I said we'd play smash bros. and go to D&amp;D club which happens every other Tuesday night. This week was the week he was planning on coming up to stay with me since this week is when D&amp;D club is having a meeting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the problem: I live about 2 hours away from my hometown where Gary currently resides and there's a pretty large snowstorm set to hit my town. In addition, last week one of my other friends decided to visit and this weekend my girlfriend came to visit. Understandably, I'd like some alone time, and I wouldn't like Gary to drive in crazy dangerous weather conditions. I told him we should just postpone his visit up here until 2 weeks from now until D&amp;D club meets again. He said he was totally fine driving in snow and he'd still like to come up if I'd have him. I told him that I wouldn't have a clear conscience if I had told him to drive up and he ends up sliding off the road and ended up in a ditch somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell before I told him this, he seemed fine and was getting back to me quickly but after I texted him and told him we should get a rain check on the visit, he's said all but 2 words to me in the span of 5 hours. After the text, he said \"ok,\" and then recently I sent him a meme on discord and he said \"cool.\" This is extremely out of character for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like a bad friend shutting him down after we had planned this for a while but I just want to spend one weekend alone and I don't want him driving up in a dangerous condition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that it might've been better for me to just tell him that I wanted to spend a weekend alone but at least this way his feelings are hurt less right? I still don't think that he should drive up while the road conditions could be terrible. Most weather stations are advising others to stay off the road if at all possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know, AITA?",

I told her if it's just them I want to go too but she said I'd ruin the trip because I have no interest in camping/stargazing and I would make Mark feel like a third wheel.

      "description": "Hi, so me (18M) and my best friend we’ll call K (17M) have been friends since about first grade. We’re now seniors in high school and for the past couple of years we’ve been playing video games with his dad we’ll call P (48M).\n\nP has always been a hard-ass but that’s his personality and stuff and I understand it. It’s his generation I believe and we still have a lot of fun playing video games together.\n\nSo recently my friend K, had gotten his (ex) girlfriend pregnant, and this has put a lot of stress on him. We’re still in high school but he’s been missing school very frequently. Now last week, P had decided to punish him for missing school so much.\nGood, I was completely with P for this. Instead of doing the normal punishment, he is forcing K to play a with him, every time P gets on. So we were playing one day and K said he would rather have his entire PC taken so he could get his homework done and things and P said no this was his punishment. In my eyes, this is P forcing K to play a game with him, using the punishment as the way to do it. I feel like he’s being selfish, forcing K to play this game when he literally said he would rather do school related things. This had made K extremely mad and agitated constantly and obviously no one was having fun except for P.\nSo yesterday I got a text from a girl he’s been talking to that we’re both good friends with, and she told me that he has been very depressed lately and had wanted me to know about it. He said he thought his father saw him as a disappointment and all that, and so I had decided to let P know because I figured he would at least care to let K know he didn’t see K as a disappointment.\n\nSo today he messaged me back after I had said “Hey, I think you should lay off of K for a little bit. He’s just going back to being depressed apparently. Up to you but our friend said “K like he thinks his dad sees him as a disappointed, and he’s slacking school and he just feels different.” So P said “that’s life dude lol, sometimes you have to do what don’t want to that’s the point, he is being a disappointment” and I see where he’s coming from about that’s life. But I don’t think he’s trying to help K to NOT be a disappointment. He’s always been like this, where he doesn’t really get involved and he thinks he should be alone on this stuff. We kept arguing and I said “I was suggesting you deal with it so if you don’t want to then GTFO.” So he said GTFO out of what, and I had said this conversation. And he said that I had started the conversation so I said ”because I thought you cared” We argued more for some time after this and I ended the conversation with “Like dude, the only reason I told you this so you would lay off just a little bit. You deserve whatever comes your way. I warned you” \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, and since then I've thought a lot about it and can't figure out for myself if what I did was right or wrong, as I dont know if it was me being mad I got rejected or her really leading me on.\n\nI was friends with this girl after she broke up with someone I knew (who I am friends with now, but wasn't as much back then) and asked me about the things he was saying about her to our friend group at the time. I tell her some stuff but the conversation quickly turns into us talking about hobbies and stuff, shows we like, etc. Snapchats were exchanged, numbers, and we started talking a lot, and I mean a lot. Within the first few days of having our first conversation. I felt like we had a really good connection and hadn't really felt in the same way with any other girl I'd met before then. We talked frequently for several months, every day and constantly, with both of us reciprocating, she would snapchat or text me right after school got let out, etc. As you can see where this is going, I developed feelings for the girl, and thought it was going really well, until one of her friends told me she liked someone else, which I was like okay, fair enough. I shot my shot not long after that, and got rejected, which I was ok with, we were still good friends. It was at this time I asked if she might ever have feelings for me, as I didnt wan't to be hoping for anything in the future, to which she said she wasn't sure. I was ok with that in the moment, but we kept talking more and more, and I got upset when she asked me to take her to do something and after I said I would, she said she was joking and wasnt being serious, knowing full well that I wasn't (this conversation was done over text btw). I got upset over this and told her I needed a break for a while as I still had feelings and such, and needed to relax, and we agreed. I dated one of my other friends for a couple of months (in which I started talking to the girl again after about a month of not talking, we apologized to each other, etc.) Eventually, me and my girlfriend broke up after a couple of months for reasons not related to the girl, and I found myself drifting back to having feelings for her. This was at the end of the school year at this point, in which we started talking at the very beginning, only not ever talking extensively during the break period. At one point another of her friends told me she was spreading rumours about how I was constantly asking her to do things outside of school, of which I had only done maybe 3 or 4 times max that entire school year, most of the time in a group, and that she was telling people I was desperate (even if it was true, she didnt need to go around telling anyone that). I ended up texting her about this, saying that I had heard what she had said, and that I was upset with her over telling people A. The lies and B. That I was desperate, with me telling her that I was fine being friends with her, and that I wasnt going to make any moves or anything on her at any point. She then asked me why I kept talking to her about my feelings for her (only ever talked about my feelings for her one other time half a year ago when I had asked her out), to which I asked her why shed say something that insulting to me, with us getting into a big argument and her eventually handing the phone to her dad, who just told me to stop texting her, sending a picture of himself from the phone to let me know he has the reigns at this point. I apologized to him and said that it wasn't my intention to hurt her, etc., then blocking her on everything and not talking to her again, even until now.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "(Throwaway acc because my younger sister knows my real acc)\n\nSo im 18 and on social assistance as well as disability(cant get a job because I have severe anxiety) and get $1000 every month. $250 of that goes to my mom as rent since she cant pay bills without it(she is in huge amounts of debt and struggles to pay bills every month despite having a very good job) this morning she asked for money because her work is sending her out of town for the night. I said \"ok how much\" to which she replied \"$100\". I then asked her if she would pay me back and she looked at me and started going off on how she pays for my food and my phone bill(ive offered to pay which she said its fine). Then ends with \"yes ill pay you back.\" Like somehow I shouldn't expect her to pay me back?? \n\nThe reason this made me mad is because she is constantly making comments about my dad(they are split up, dad lives on his own and also has a well paying job) when I give him money, saying how I shouldn't that he shouldn't be relying on me. but he pays me back.(usually gives me more than what he originally asked for). \n\nBut now reflecting on it I feel like an asshole.

      "description": "...yeah.\n\nI’d like to warn that this post contains details about physical punishment and the resulting affects of that on me.\n\nContext:\nI’m a teen, living with parents and sister. I’m diagnosed with low spectrum autism. I hate to divide autistic people by functionality, but it is worth mentioning for this story that I am very high functioning and often indistinguishable to someone without autism. I am able to articulate my needs, emotions and anxieties accurately and calmly for the vast majority of the time.\n\nSo, I don’t love my dad. I don’t necessarily dislike him, I just don’t love him like family. I believe this is because of events in the past.\n\nHe shouts often, which is extraordinarily difficult for me to cope with because of my autism, since I’m severely sensitive to sound and too much exposure with little to no break can cause me to go into a full mental shut down. Not fun - especially when school’s involved. To be fair, he used to shout a lot more and louder, so he’s improved in that respect. However, I’ll still go into shutdowns too often for my liking. It now happens 1-2 times a month.\n\nIn addition, he used to hit me. Regardless of your opinions on hitting children, I felt traumatised by this. It usually doesn’t affect me, but in those shouting fits my mind will flicker back to when I was a child and I felt utterly powerless. This makes me feel as if I’m going to die, and I will freeze in fear. I vividly remember being in the car, saying I couldn’t go out because I was near shutdown and “could I please stay here while you do the shopping?” and him yelling and hitting the wheel. I genuinely felt like I was about to get killed (however irrational that may seem - but mental illness doesn’t care about rationality most times) and my stress was such that my mum had to pick me up from about an hour’s distance away.\n\nAs a result of all this, I’ll give him the cold shoulder when I really can’t stand things. In shutdown or when I’m otherwise emotionally vulnerable, I’ll refuse his company by telling him (politely) that I need time alone right now. I want to emphasise that I do not lose my cool in this situation, and at most come off as cold or rude.\n\nHowever, I see my dad has been upset by this. I’ll see him visibly upset (never crying or near such, rather he looks dejected and slumped over) and I do believe it’s contributing towards his stress which eventually causes him to lash out. I feel awfully guilty, but sometimes I feel as if I can’t let him into my life because he stresses me out. As such, I don’t love him, but I recognise he’s an otherwise good person. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: I have had a severely rocky relationship with my dad, and I don’t “love” him. AITA?",

      "description": "She’s using nail polish to decorate her crafts. Her work station is in the same room as my computer, and I really don’t want to breathe the fumes in because they’re literally toxic and just not pleasant to breathe in. I would move, but my computer is a desktop and I would have to lug the entire thing (including the desk) into my room. I’m considering doing that, but I don’t want to be chased out of “my area” and holed up in my room all day (I use the computer for everything). She’s already taken over another room in our house which I have no problem with, but I’d wish she’d use that room or her bedroom to paint. I asked her if she could paint somewhere else, but she said she could only paint there (despite having a desk in her room). She said she’d open the windows, but it still smells really strong when she paints. The entire upstairs smells like nail polish now (the room I’m talking about is an open room) even with the fan on. The fan is pretty small though, and only one window is open, so after I’m done posting this I’ll open up more windows and turn on our other fans. But I want to ask her to move again, because I don’t think it’s fair of her to chase me out of my area when the fumes are harmful and she has other options. WIBTA for trying to force her to move?\n\nbtw, I’m 17 and she’s 18, and we live with our parents. A couple of months ago she used a super strong toxic glue to make something, and when I asked her to do it somewhere else she blew up on me, so I’m hesitant to start another fight if I’m in the wrong.\n\ntl;dr: sister is painting with toxic nail polish near me and won’t move. I can’t really move and the polish is stinking up the entire second floor. WIBTA for forcing her to move?",

      "description": " I'm going to start this off by saying that, I already feel like I am partially in the wrong, but I'm not really sure about another part (I'll explain this more in the story). Also it makes me feel really sick to write this because of our age difference, but even though I do like him that way, I really love him as a person and as a friend, and I feel horrible that I ruined our friendship. Now that I've really sat down and thought about it with a clear head, I'm ashamed of my feelings and I know I should have never told him about them.\n\nSo I'm a 17F and I have a crush on an 15M. I've liked him for several months (probably around 6) but because of our age difference I never flirted with him until he flirted with me. I also want to mention that I am autistic (he is too but very few people know aside from me), and I've never really talked to boys that much, all of my friends growing up were girls. I didn't know until after this happened that sometimes guys flirt with girls they are friends without actually wanting to date them.\n\n The flirting (at least I think it was) was stuff like calling me cute, winking at me, running his hand through my hair, smacking my butt etc. Because I'm autistic, I asked my friends if he was flirting or not because I wasn't sure, and they said it definitely was. I'm not saying this to try to put any blame on them though, I just want to make everything that happened and why it happened clear. \n\nDespite the voice in the back of my head telling me not to, I decided to tell him how I felt. I tried to tell him in person last Friday, but my nerves were too bad. Due to that I sent him a snapchat that said \"Hey. What I was trying to tell you Friday is that I like you. I have wanted to tell you for a long time, but I didn't want to ruin our friendship.\" \n\nWell my worst fear came true. He never replied. I don't know if/when he opened it because there is a failed snap in the way and I obviously didn't want to send it after that. I can strongly assume based on his actions that he did open it though. Not only did he not reply, but we lost our streak (I didn't send one the next day and neither did he). He has avoided me at school the past 2 days. I haven't tried to talk to him. Even though I don't blame him, in way I wish he would just say something.\n\nI honestly can handle being rejected and being called a creep more than just being avoided. I want to clarify that by upset I don't mean that as mad. More just I wish he would say something. I'm really mad at myself, and I hate myself for telling him, but at the same time I think it's probably more healthy for him to no longer be friends with someone older that has feelings towards him. I didn't even feel guilty about my feeling until after this happened, which I think makes it worse. I did think about it, but I didn't feel the same way about it that I do now. I also want to say that I do not feel like he should say something, it's just that I kind of wish he would.",

      "description": "Okay, Im a 19 year old college student that lives with my mother. My mother has recently broken up with my stepfather after they had a huge fallout and after a huge episode, my mother kicked him out.\n\nRegardless, it's been a few days after and now I'm going through this cycle of my mom grieving the relationship and coming to me multiple times per day to talk about it for a good 3 hours per \"session\". At first, I didn't mind at all and fully understood, but over time, I would be woken up in the middle of the night when I had class the next day, sat down immediately after just coming home from school, or even while I'm working on homework or studying to be brought into the living room to talk about everything and the same things over and over again. Some stuff discussed, I just am not even comfortable hearing about in general. I've started to mention this, and it sorta worked in a minor way.\n\nJust today, I was woken up at midnight after studying and coping with my OCD flareup to my mom having another moment of her breakup anxiety, so I listened to her for a moment, went out with her to the living room and stayed with her for a bit. After a fair bit, I decided to go back to my room because honestly, it's late and I'm just not really up for being out and around people where there a bunch of reoccurring thoughts and worries in my head. \n\nMy mom noticed this and asked if I could sleep with her on one of the sofas for the night. I was really torn because on one hand, she's going through a lot from the breakup but on the other hand, I just really had a lot to think about and wanted to go back to my room for personal comfort. In the end, I told her that if she had another rise of anxiety that she could go to me in my room, and that I'd genuinely rather be in my roo.\n\nI'm being really serious when I say that this is eating me up on the inside. I feel like I'm just being absolutely selfish. Am I an asshole for not staying in the living room?\n\n",

He passed away many years ago, and that was his favorite place to eat. My mother-in-law foots the bill as part of the celebration and everyone in the family that can attend is always welcome. Sometimes people bring friends and it is never a big deal and we all celebrate a great man. This year, we had 3 of the 4 of my mother-in-law’s kids and their families come and had a wonderful time. My wife took a picture and posted it to social media to honor her dad. The unrepresented kid (I say kid loosely as she is over 50) took exception to this and flew off the handle because their family didn’t get an invitation and were purposely excluded. It is an open invitation, and she and all her children are adults with working phones. AITA for not reaching out to them and explicitly inviting them? Or should they know they are welcome  (since they have been every other year) and take the initiative to just come? I didn’t get an invite and I showed up, so maybe IATA for a different reason.",

      "description": "This post might be a bit long.\n\nHere’s some background: \n\nI (15F) am currently taking algebra 2 and am one of 3 people in my class that actually understands or passes anything. \n\nA lot of the time, the teacher will go over a lesson and we will have to work in our assigned groups to solve a couple problems based on the lesson. Sometimes the fastest group (with correct answers) gets candy. \n\nIn my class are about 8 people I know and talk to maybe once a week in school. I definitely wouldn’t call us friends but we do talk and joke around occasionally.  Anytime my teacher mentions something about group work or a group test, these people will look at me and say, “Um _______ can sit over here!” while pointing at a seat next to them and laughing.\n\nNow, I am happy to help people on stuff and I have given answers to these people but, some of the people expect me to cheat and give them all the answers all the time.\n\nNow for the real story:\n\nYesterday in math we were going over a new unit and, like always, I am one of the only ones who learns anything. \n\nBecause are class is one topic ahead, our teacher gave us a worksheet that she would count as extra credit for our unit test if we finished before the end of class. It was a pretty straight forward sheet and we had to do all the even problems 1-20. We had already gone over a couple during the lesson and we had about 30minutes of class left.\n\nI was sitting at my table with one other person (the rest of our group was absent).This guy I’ll call Tom is known for being bad at school and generally not paying attention. On our last test he got 2/64 right.\n\nI was going through this worksheet and then two of Tom’s friends came and sat at my table. Our class was really low on attendance and we are already a small class so I was the only “smart person” there at the time. \n\nThe first guy I’ll call Dan is one of the people I occasionally talk to. He always tries my patience and never pays attention when I try to help him. The other guy I’ll call Jake, is worse at math than Tom. He purposefully shouts out random answers thinking it’s funny. He is in algebra 2 and algebra research.\n\nThe first thing these guys say is, “Hey, can you give us all the answers.” \n\nI just kind of stare at them thinking how they have the audacity to ask that since they never pay attention and the teacher would know that if they had all the right answers, they were cheating. \n\nI asked them if they even tried and they said no. \n\nI told them to let me finish the problem I was on and then I would help them, not give them the answers. They start talking and being a bit rowdy. I asked them to stop and they just looked at me like I was being rude.\n\nAt this point, our teacher had said at least 4 times we are doing even, she had written it on the board and said to right it on the sheet. \n\nI was almost done when Jake says, “Are we doing odd or even?”My response was basically that he can ask someone else or just pay attention next time. \n\nI am on the very last step when Jake starts to mutter stuff under his breath where he knows I can hear him. Saying things like “I don’t like rude people” “why you being such a b***ch” \n\nI finished the problem while saying “I don’t like ignorant people who don’t pay attention and expect to people to give them all the answers and cheat” \n\nJake starts saying that he doesn’t care if he learns. “It doesn’t matter as long as I pass the test.” \n\nThen I ask him how he’s gonna do that if he didn’t learn any of the material that’s gonna be on the test. \n\n“I don’t know. Cheat, I guess.” was his response.\nDan was laughing the whole time.\n\nI said, “Well cheat off someone else cause I’d rather not” and moved onto the next problem.\n\nHe starts his muttering again and I just ignore him. \n\nDan says something along the lines of “great, now we’re gonna fail. No one else has the answers” I don’t know if he was saying it to me or Jake.\n\nI am working silently when Dan, Tom and Jake steal each other’s papers. They are being more rowdy and I just go and sit at a table by myself. \n\nThe teacher yelled at them and all of them kept glancing angrily at me like I did something.\n\n\nThe whole situation was dumb and I don’t think I owe it to them to sit there and deal with that. My friend said I overreacted and should have gave them the answers and none of that would have happened.\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hello! I’m not a native speaker, so sorry for eventual mistakes. Also I’m writing this on my phone.\n\nA little background - me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over a year now. When we started dating, he was working very irrlegularly, worked for one company for a month, got fired, worked at a different place for two weeks and quit, and after that he stopped working or even looking for a job for whole two months of summer, while I was spending 10/11 hours at work each day, no free days (I’m a horse riding instructor, and summer is a very busy time in my field). He worked a month in september, just before we left to work abroad. We came back at the end of january, and most of the money we earned went into our car and renting a new place, since we want to move to a different city in February, and we did. He found a good job in his field(he’s an electrician) almost right away, while I had some trouble, since I can’t really work as a horseriding instructor at the moment due to my arms injury, and I don’t have a lot of experience or education otherwise. Since my boyfriends work was well paid of, he told me to take my time and find a job that I would like. Unfortunately, in middle of march he was let go, and our situation became pretty bad, as we didn’t really have any money then and hoped for April to be better thanks to his salary. When that happened, I immediately took the first job offer I’ve got, and he found a job at a local restaurant few days ago, so we will manage, but money will be pretty tight still.\nSome time ago, my boyfriend mentioned wanting to go to a concert of a band he liked along with his friends. I supported the idea, thinking that we’ll be on a better footing when the time came. Well, the time came and we’re currently living on money borrowed from my parents, and today he tells me he’s going to buy a ticket. I pointed out to him that the ticket for a concert, along with train tickets will take a good quarter of what we will receive this month, and told him not to whine at the end of the month that we have no money(he tends to get very angry about it). He told me to fuck off, and that we would have no money not because of his spending, but as an effect of me not going to work two weeks earlier so I could make a full month.\nI’m feeling pretty hurt as I have never had any pretences to him while he wasn’t working and I was basically sponsoring him, but I also know that our situation was different back then, as we only paid half of what we’re paying now for our flat, so I also feel very guilty for not going to work sooner, especially since I would end up with an equally shitty job as I did now. I’m feeling pretty conflicted about it, so, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My younger brother (22M) and his ex girlfriend  (20F) ~ let’s call her Hannah ~  dated on and off for 2+ years. During their time together, we became relatively close. I’ve never bothered trying to become friends with previous girlfriends before because they never got to the point of being *serious* with each other, but once my brother and Hannah seemed to be getting serious (meeting each other’s families, spending the night at each other’s house constantly, etc)\n\n\nA little over a year ago though, my brother and Hannah broke up and it seemed to be for good this time. I was incredibly sad about this, since it felt like I was losing someone I actually saw becoming my sister. If I’m being honest though, breaking up was probably the right thing. She was too good for him and he wasn’t emotionally mature for that level of commitment, so it was for the best for them IMO.\n\nMy brother is my best friend and I would do anything for him, I practically raised him after our parents separated and we’re absent for a majority of our childhood. So even though I absolutely adored my friendship with Hannah, I asked my brother if he would be okay if I remained friends with her.\n\nInitially he said yes, so Hannah and I continued to meet up weekly for lunch, catch up, etc. Tried not to bring up my brother unless she wanted to talk about him, and I tried my best to keep my relationship with them separate as much as possible. After a few months, he told me he wasn’t comfortable with this and asked me to stop seeing her. I messaged Hannah saying I might need time away from our friendship, since my brother wasn’t comfortable with it and she understood.\n\nNow it’s been about 10 months since I last saw her at this point, but recently I’ve gotten back into the habit of grabbing coffee before work at the coffee shop Hannah works. It’s also right next to my office. \n\nI’ve been seeing her briefly 3 times a week and we catch up here and there, and I obviously miss having her as a friend. She’s reached out asking if we can catch up and properly hangout one of these days and I said yes.\n\nI haven’t told my brother yet since I fear he’ll get mad at me for doing this, after he specifically asked me to stop being friends with her. At the same time, it’s been almost a year and I feel like it’s unfair for me to stop being friends with someone because of someone else, even if it’s my brother and he’s my best friend.\n\nI do plan on telling my brother I made plans with Hannah before I actually meet up with her. Am I the Asshole if I choose to continue my friendship with her again, if even after all this time, he says he’s not okay with it?\n\n",

We’ve been together five years and she’s literally my best friend.\n\nWe live together in a smallish  house and her family are a very big part of our daily lives. For example her parents and siblings (with children) can quite often be found at our house and everyone lives on the same street (think “everyone loves Raymond”)\n\nshe also has a medical condition that makes sex very uncomfortable for her which flares up from time to time.  Between this and the ever present family we don’t really have a sex life.\n\nI cant really get any personal time because we’re so comfortable around one another that it’s not a big deal to share the shower in a non sexual way (my girlfriend and I that’s is).\n\nI feel guilty about wanting sex and knowing that she feels like less of a women for not being capable of doing the deed\n\nWe’ve talked and It’s very clear that sex isn’t something that is going to be common in our relationship, but that’s not a deal breaker. Like I said ,I love her and have never met anyone I get along with so well.\n\nI don’t want to hurt her feelings, by even suggesting that I’d rather sleep with someone else because it’s not the case. She would be my preference every time.\n\nI find myself avoiding porn because I get worked up very easily and have had wet dreams several nights in a row. A couple of nights ago on the drive home from work I took a detour to a secluded spot just to relieve myself solo. \nI have a very hard time not fantasising about coworkers and I’m easily agitated lately. \n\nIf I was to hire someone, with the express purpose of release, being safe and discreet, then I feel that that is somehow better than a hookup at a bar.\n\nTo be fair I’m probably not going to go through with it. I wouldn’t even know how to get in contact with a sex worker. I just feel so guilty and frustrated to be nearly 30 and unable to scratch that itch. \n\nTLDR, I’ve been doing No nut November intermittently for a little over 5years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nSo  small background, I'm a fairly new DM &amp; I run a small homebrew  D&amp;D campaign online. It's run on a discord server with a fair few  people on it, one of which is the target of this story. I was quite new at the time, and very nervous. \n\nIt  was the 10th session of the campaign, and in the last session, we had  finished going through an 'arc' of sorts for his character, with him  shedding his patron connection and becoming a sorcerer (as I said,  homebrew). Before this session, I was hyping up a boss fight with a  warforged gunslinger (basically a robot with a gun), but I had expressly  stated multiple times that this boss, should he win, **Would not kill.** With this in mind, what this player (I'll call him B) really surprised me.\n\nThe  session started with the party seeing this boss taking over a small  village, one that was important to B's character, and actually had his  character's mother in (we agreed on this beforehand). Before the session  properly started, I decided to give my players a bit of time to prepare  for battle, I even made it so I couldn't see what they said on B's  request. When they come back, B tells me he's going to spend the entire  party fund on dynamite, then bomb the village. I was surprised, but  thought it was extreme enough to be funny. Oddly enough, only half of  the present party seemed to be into it (I learnt afterwards that one was  uninformed (M), another didn't know what they meant (L, and another was  against it (P)! so it was 2/5 in favor).\n\nSince  I thought he was going to end the fight immediately with an explosion, I  decided to forgo the combat encounter I had. Yeah, it was dumb, but I  was trying to make the session tailored to what the players did. Then B  approaches the village, and instead of using the dynamite, starts  insulting the boss and throwing out spells. I didn't roll initiative  because I thought he was going to just bomb them as soon as it started.  He then starts insisting I roll it, and suddenly bursts out laughing  saying 'I GOT YOU' and he (and the other player who was in on it) say  that they lied. I nervously laughed it off, and tried to get back into  the spirit of the session.\n\nI  honestly couldn't get it together that session. M was now ranting  through text (they didn't like using the mic) about how this was unfair  to do to a new DM, P started apologising in DMs saying 'I had nothing to  do with it', and the others were just rolling with it. I couldn't keep  track of anything that session, the throwoff just messed up my mood too  much. Eventually, they won after 2 hours of battle, and I decided to end  the session there, since I was in a state where I just couldn't  continue. Afterwards, I talk to my players in DMs, B in particular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinued in comments because this is too long.",

Today my girlfriend grabbed my phone and started typing all this stuff to him that I rely didn't want to say to him because to be honest, I don't care what he does on a personal level. I told her to give me my phone back and called her a brat. She threw my phone back at me in the car and was pissed that she didn't get to do what she wanted to do and not what I wanted to do. So am I the asshole in all this? ",

      "description": "So a little bit of backstory:\n\nI'm young (19 M), working my first full time job as a bricklaying apprentice coming straight out of high-school after I graduated. I'm about a year into the apprenticeship, and I'm beginning to not enjoy it. I work with two other people, my boss (53 M) and a 4th year apprentice (23 M). The 4th year, let's call him John, is finishing his time as an apprentice in 2 weeks and just announced he'll be moving on to a new job because he \"needs change\". Fair enough, I don't blame him. My boss seems to think John is a piece of shit for quitting on him. The problem is I've been considering quitting to do something else for the past month roughly. I've had it on my chest this whole time and haven't really mentioned it to anyone other than my girlfriend. I can't see myself ever wanting to be a bricklayer for life. I'm miserable through the week because I'm waking up forcing myself to go to a job I hate.\n\nWith John leaving within the next few weeks, I now feel like I'm obligated to stick around and sacrifice my happiness just to save my boss having to do EVERYTHING on his own (and trust me, it's a bitch of a job with 3 people, let alone just one). I'm not going to quit on him without knowing where else I want to be first, but would I be the asshole for doing so before he finds another worker to hire?",

      "title": "AITA for asking my roommates girlfriend and child to move out?",
      "description": "This all happened months ago while I was in graduate school. I was living with a buddy (let’s call him John) of mine in a 3-bedroom apartment and we had a spare room. A fellow graduate student needed a place to stay and asked me if I knew anywhere for him to stay and I extended the offer that I had an extra room if he wanted to stay with us (pending Johns approval). John and the new roommate spoke and John approved. \n \nNew roommate moves in and about a month or so after his girlfriend starts visiting us on the daily and staying over. It wasn’t much of a big deal. And then said girlfriend begins to bring her child over (2-3-year-old girl) who was a sweet kid but not a situation I wanted to be involved in or have around the house. We recently had a new dog that I was fostering (with approval of the roommates) and I wasn’t sure how he was with kids yet. \n \nAnyways, one day I’m showering, bathroom and bedroom doors closed and I walk out of the shower, put my towel on and the kid opens the door to my bathroom after going into my room. This made me uncomfortable due to the fact that I barely knew the mom and child and with all the crazy shit happening in the world I didn’t want to be accused of anything. This kind of set uneasy with me as I didn’t want to be responsible for a child being around my house as a graduate student who was still drinking and partying every now and then or cursing around the house. It just wasn’t a good place for a child in my opinion. \n \nThe new roommate ended up leaving to work in another city for the weekdays and returned on the weekends. His girlfriend and child were staying at the house with us while he wasn’t there. \n \nTo end the story short so I don’t drag it all out anymore, I told my new roommate I wasn’t comfortable with the fact that we had a kid running around here and that it made me uncomfortable being here when they were all doing their family thing in the living room and kitchen or that she was here when he wasn’t. I felt like a stranger in my own home. He didn’t get where I was coming from and said he didn’t think it was a big deal and nothing came of it. I called him again a few days later and said that I didn’t want them to be there anymore and they had 2 weeks to find a place to go. Nothing happened with that as he didn’t take me seriously. I was tired of going back-and-forth and him not respecting where I was coming from and how it made me feel uncomfortable so I contacted our landlord and asked her if she had any advice. She informed me that it was against the rules for her to be there anyways and that I was not in the wrong. I told her that I would talk to him and make sure that they were moving out because she agreed with me that it wasn’t safe or a good place for a child to be. They eventually moved out but I still felt like a dick even though I knew it was the right thing to do.\n \nAm I the asshole for making them move out?",

Our lunch break is already pretty long, an hour and a half, and we and our work hours are 8 hours in total including the break. So, I totally understand where he is coming from.\nHOWEVER... I have always taken my lunch break and napped in my car instead and just ate lunch after work. Eating mid work always makes me very tired for the second half. Today boss was walking through the parking lot during lunch and walked by my car and saw me napping and knocked on my window and proceeded to make a big fuss about how I was sleeping in my car when I should be at work. I explained that I was on my lunch break and that napping helps my productivity more than eating but, he just left me with, \"Your lunch break is for eating and you should go back to work when you are finished eating not when the lunch break is over.\" Am I the asshole for taking a nap instead of eating lunch?",

      "description": "This happened ~1.5 yrs ago. I had known this guy for years. He was my older brothers best friend since middle school, a long time family friend. The guy, Tom, was 29 at the time. I had just turned 20.\n\nMy brother and wife(Alan/MegaBitch) came to town to visit our mom. Tom came to hangout as he did whenever Alan came to town.\n\nTom asked my brother if he could ask me out. Alan said yes, so Tom and I went out a few times while Alan was still in town.\n\nIt was discovered during the trip that megabitch was cheating on Alan. I took it hard. Alan didn't deserve it. I had even officiated their wedding. My brother and megabitch left, they ended up getting divorced.\n\nAfter a few dates, Tom and I slept together. We were both adults and we both wanted to, so why not? He was really good at it, we had amazing sex.\n\nHe was coming to stay with me a lot after that, bringing stuff over and leaving it at my place. Buying me groceries. I thanked him and told him it wasn't necessary, but he said he didn't want to eat all my food. He also bought a jumbo pack of condoms and left it in my bedroom.\n\nI told him before we started sleeping together I would not want to be exclusive bf/gf unless things started to get serious.\n\nA few days later, I'm talking to my brother on the phone, trying to help him through a very hard time in his life. He tells me, \"Tom told me you took his virginity. Wasn't expecting that.\"\n\nTom had told me he only had one girlfriend before me, but I didn't know he would be a virgin at 29. To clarify, I wasn't judging him, but to find out from my brother?!?!\n\nI decided to have a talk with Tom. I reminded him that I still wanted to see other people, and I felt I had lead him on, because it was obviously very serious. He didn't care if I saw other people as long as he was my main guy. An open relationship. I asked him why he would be ok with this.\n\n\"Because I'm in love with you.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say so we just laid there until I told him that I didn't feel the same way. He said it was fine and that I may grow to love him. THIS WAS TWO WEEKS INTO SEEING EACH OTHER BTW.\n\nIn the meantime, he kept generally doing things you would do in the honeymoon phase of a realtionship. I've been there when I've felt head-over-heels for someone.\n\nIt terrified me. I didn't feel the same way at all. I liked him but had been hoping for something casual. AND I TOLD HIM THAT. I felt because I had taken his virginity he was immediately incredibly attached to me.\n\nHe came over mid December. He had bought me an early Christmas present, a massage table and when I saw it, I felt such pressure and broke it off. He was angry and cried. He took his stuff but left the massage table. I tried to get him to take it but \"It was a gift.\"\n\nWe haven't spoken since, but I hear he is engaged now. My brother said I made Tom realize something was missing from his life. I didn't care he was a virgin, he just got way too serious too quickly.",

      "description": "Never liked my Dad much.  He is compelled to rant about politics at every chance, including throwing out the racist N word. Chronic complainer, know it all. Discussion with him is not my interest.   We've always lived in the same places, couples miles apart. \n\nI help him with his many requests, including transport to a variety of specialist doctors so he can achieve his goal of living to 100 (which he discusses daily).  Included repeated trips out of state, meaning I have to leave my wife several weeks a year.  And fixing his house and all sorts of related things.\n\nHe remarried 30 years ago, younger foreign woman for sex (English second language). At this point she prepares his meals, but little else (she is generally ineffectual).  I take him to most of his appointments, help him with all paperwork.  They don't talk much any more; he increasingly sits home alone now that he can't drive anymore.\n\nMy pending inheritance (moderate) does create some obligation.  My deadbeat druggie sister and a nephew are getting part of his money, both live in another state; never done anything to assist.  Stepmother is getting the largest chunk.  I assisted in his business in decades past, so some of that compensation is earned.  (the inheritance was all hashed out 8 years ago; it is not debated)\n\nMy wife and I have health issues also.  And concerns.  We can't visit our grandchildren out of state because I now need to be near my Dad at all times, in significant part because of my highly ineffectual stepmother can't step up.\n\nIt's been a long road--nearly a quarter of a century since my Dad first began needing medical care at 70.   He's had some serious medical issues but is still going fairly strong.  No end in sight, really.  He might outlive my wife, who is in poor health.\n \nI find the whole situation depressing and tiresome, sorry to say.  Might be different if I liked my Dad.  I'd like to reduce ties, less time on social visits, less participation on medical trips.  But I'll probably continue the status quo--unhappily.",

During those three days however, since she has the other 4 days to do whatever the fuck she wants, I expect to be able to use my dorm. I am extremely easy going and now I found out probably too much so. After the winter break, I came back to my bed already made and I was like \"oh okay cool thanks\". I'm local and it saved me time because I didn't have to move my shit into my room again. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago, I come in and her friends stuff is completely moved in and then it dawn's on me, she made my bed because it's actually her friends shit. I realized she has moved her friend in. I at first let it slide but I can no longer sleep in my dorm because her friends in my bed and then about a week later i find out that they are doing drugs, at least weed and Coke and constantly have alcohol all over our dorm. \n\n So I reported her last Friday for the drugs and for moving some girl into our dorm. The girl is forced to move out and my roommate has been written up for violating multiple rules. She is on the edge of being evicted (also due to an incident in the beginning where she had alcohol poisoning and had to be taken in an ambulance from the dorm because she wasn't breathing, she's supposed to be in AA, so another rule broken. I wasn't even in the dorm at the time.) \n\nShe is angry at me because she has to pay fines now, they notified her parents, and she might get evicted. If she's evicted, she might have to leave as she can't afford to live anywhere else and won't be refunded.. however I pay the same amount of money she does to only live there three days and I was essentially kicked out of my own room when her friend was living there. She has 4 days to do whatever she wanted and she thinks I was unfair.. she didn't even ask if she could move her friend in.\n\nMy roommate is blaming me for possibly having to leave college and for her parents finding out about her drug use and for fines.. I said it's her problem not mine. AITA? ",

      "description": "[tldr on bottom] One of my best friends since childhood, let’s call him G and his sister K. \n\nG and I are slightly less close now, but mainly because we went to different colleges and only get to see each other maybe once or twice a year. With that said G and I talk at least monthly still (text or call).\n\nK  (1 year younger than us) has always been super flirty with me, and has been since we were all in high-school together (I’m a senior in college now). She and I always vibed well, and I remember thinking back then that we’d be great together, but I would never want to do that to my best friend. \n\n\nFast forward to last year when I was at their family xmas party. We were all drunk and high and K was giving me very clear signals (laughing at everything I said [even when not a joke], asking me to dance with her, and touching me a lot [even not dancing]). I can’t say I didn’t want to make a move on her then, but I still didn’t because I consider him one of my best friends.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago, the most recent time I saw G in person, he told me that K said she’s “always wanted to hook up with me.” G continued that by saying K thinks I’m the “nicest and cutest” of G’s friends and she thinks I’d be “a great boyfriend.” I didn’t ask for the context or anything, and with so many confused thoughts running through my head, all I said was, “haha that’s nice of K.” And changed the subject. \n\nToday, I just got invited to their xmas party this year. I thought about last years and then about what G said to me last time I saw him. I’m not sure if he just said it to me factually or if he was hinting he’d be okay with it.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I made a move on my best friends sister?\n\n\n\ntldr: I’ve known my best friend and his sister my whole life. He basically told me she has a crush on me, but I don’t know if that’s his way of saying that he’d be okay with she and I happening. WIBTA if I attempted to engage in consensual relations with her?",

      "description": "Back story, we are moving house on Friday, this happened tonight. \n\nAs our lawns have been going insane we decided I should go straight home to mow, rake and whipper snipper for the handover. The wife will pick up the three kids (2, 5, 9) after she finished work so I can do the needful. Neither of us cbf cooking. \n\nKids end up with pasta bake and the wife suggest Thai. She explains that we can buy two mains and eat them for lunch the next day (as we wouldn't eat a whole one each).\n\nThe wife always gets fish cakes and I wasn't feeling like it so asked if we could have chicken satay skewers instead , entree\n\nWife makes the order, we all head down the road and I pick it up.\n\nTake away order:\n\n- Chicken satay skewers (x4) (mine)\n- Fish cakes (x4) (wife's)\n- Yellow chicken curry. (wife's)\n- Red duck curry with lychees. (mine)\n- Large coconut rice. (wife's)\n\n(I'm keto/paleo so I don't eat rice)\n\nI didn't really care what the restaurant lady was telling me I just wanted my food now as I was insatiable.\n\nGet in the car and didn't realise the wife had ordered fish cakes so asked if that was right. Wife tells me she doesn't like chicken skewers, that she will eat them but doesn't like them so she got fish cakes. \n\nWalk in the door, give the kids their pasta bake and the wife is dealing with fussy kids. \n\nI unload the entries and smash one of my chicken skewers. I'm in heaven. I don't care what's happening around me right now, the house could be fire IDC.\n\nThe wife comes over and asks to try one of the skewers  so I shit stirred her saying she didn't even like them. She eats 1/3 of one of the skewers and walks away saying it's good, prefers when the sauce is on the side. \n\nThis is where things get grey around food etiquette between a wife and a husband.\n\nI've always been under the impression that if the SO consumes a part of your meal (e.g. one of four skewers) even if it's a bite or half or three quarters they have taken ownership of that food. It's officially off limits.\n\nAITA time...\n\nThinking we are sharing entrees I open the white styrofoam box containing the fish cakes (yes these are absolutely not keto, idgaf) and smash one in seconds.\n\nThe wife looks at me in disgust... \"Did you just eat a whole one?\" \"I told you I wanted two tonight and two tomorrow for lunch\".\n\nI'm just stunned... I tell her that I had three skewers (including hers) left and that I thought we were sharing. I don't recall her saying it was for lunch but I'm a grade A selective listener.\n\nShe proceeds to storm off to the bedroom leaving her entire meal in their containers, and the kids with me. Lots of pissy remarks ensued (e.g. stuffing your face, selfish)\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nMaybe I just don't understand food laws between a man and a women, correct me pls.",

But I do feel like if you're in a public place, such as a restaurant, you should be considerate of how other people might not want to hear that sort of talk, especially if it's about a sensitive topic. \n\nMy other family members are the kind of people who don't really have a filter and eagerly speak their mind on anything and everything. Sometimes this is a good thing, but they also don't really know when what they're saying offends someone. Sometimes they get angry when they're told to quiet down. \n\nTheir cursing isn't quite AVGN-tier, but it is enough to make me feel embarrassed and worry that people are looking down on us as \"trashy.\" They are rather loud people who liberally sprinkle conversations about politics, religion, etc. with vulgar references to everything ranging from Jesus' penis to vomit to scat fetishes. \n\nI get pretty frustrated by all this, but am I being overly sensitive?

      "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend’s stepdad about my boyfriend’s little sister’s weed usage?",
      "description": "Throwaway account. I’m on mobile - sorry in advance for bad formatting. \n\nSo my boyfriend’s little sister (let’s call her Madison) is 12 years old. We get along really well - she’s like a sister or cousin to me (I’m 19) but in the last year or so she’s changed a lot. She’s hanging out with a bad crowd and has recently started using weed pens. We always tell her she shouldn’t be doing that, etc, and her mom knows about it too, but she refuses to discipline her. We’re in a legal state and both my bf and I use weed recreationally, but when we’re talking about a 12 year old that’s a whole different story. Madison is also failing the 8th grade because she refuses to put any effort in school. \n\nMy boyfriend’s stepdad has been kept in the dark about this issue (which started a few months ago) until I brought it up tonight in a conversation with boyfriend and stepdad. We had been talking about Madison and how we were all worried about her, so it’s not like it was out of the blue. Stepdad was completely taken aback to know that she was actually doing weed, shocked that he didn’t know any of this, and vowed to get involved with the situation but not say it was me who told him. \n\nWhen bf and I were alone, he got very upset at me and said that I shouldn’t have brought it up at all - that it wasn’t his place to intervene and it sure as hell wasn’t mine. He said that his stepdad couldn’t keep secret who had told him, and that now Madison and their mom would hate me when they found out. (That also sucks because I cut contact with my own family for being abusive, so they’re kind of the only people I have... but that’s irrelevant here because what’s done has been done). \n\nI told my boyfriend that I was worried about Madison and that’s what takes precedence. Because clearly her mom wasn’t doing anything to address the situation - to the contrary, she enables it and even rewards poor behavior. I felt like I needed to say something and it was unfair to keep his stepdad in the dark when 1) he might actually be able to intervene and do something, and 2) he’s invested a lot into raising her for 10 years and I feel he deserves to know - she’s like a daughter to him. \n\nNot sure if it makes a difference, but I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years. So while I’m not sure if I was out of place, it’s not like I was stepping into the family dynamic after only a few months. \n\nAlso not sure if it makes a difference, but my bf’s stepdad is also Madison’s stepdad - they aren’t biologically related - but he’s been a father figure since she was 3. \n\nSo, AITA for informing my boyfriend’s stepdad that his stepdaughter is using drugs? Did I overstep my place? Or did I do the right thing? ",

I used to watch a lot of the Dick Van Dyke Show, the Honeymooners, What’s Your Line, those sort of shows. Since most of this stuff is streamable, we sometimes watch a few episodes. My husband told me he has a problem with me showing her these shows because he doesn’t want her to be influenced by those old ideas of how people should be. I understand what he’s saying, but I told him that I’ve explained to her that the shows are old and that women weren’t always able to be so independent as they are now.  I’ve told her that she’s so lucky that she can wear whatever she wants and be whoever she wants. He doesn’t think that’s enough, however. My husband has proposed a ban on all the older shows and movies, but I think that’s a bit silly, especially since she likes to watch them, and I think it’s a kind of teachable moment. I think it’s better to have conversations with her about the content than to just eliminate it entirely. Writing this out feels kind of dumb, but my husband is legitimately pissed at me, so am I the asshole?",

      "description": "sorry for my bad english since this happend a few hours ago and in probably still stoned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for context: we are with a few friends in my apartment. One person was there i invited aswell cuz for my other friends and to have more than 3 people. one of my firends brought space muffins (my first time im stoned) and the guy I invited aswell lets call him jack got a bad trip and puked my house under and my poarch that I share with other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nafter two hours my friend starts noticing jack is feeling bad from space muffins and tells him to lie down on my bank.\n\nthen one - two hours later he feels well enough to sit. me and my friend we're trying to order kebab and just as he wants to order jacks body decided tot throw it all out. after three times I tell the mongloid to move his ass to the bathroom becuase i don't want more potential damage from his puke. as time progrest (2 minutes) I felt more and more rage coming and if my friends didn't stop me there would be serious harm to jack because i was cooking. then out of anger I yelled at him: \"move your ass out of this house 3, 2, 1\" and becoming more angery the longer the sentence. he moves his ass out. it was 2 oçlock afternoon and winter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen to heroes of my friends helped me calm me down(lets call him arthur) and the other two cleaned it up(Thank fking hell they we're there i could not cleaned that shit bro) and really praise them that they helped. as arthur calmed me down we went over some solutions: he couldn't drive his car cuz stoned and feeling bad, sleep on my couch, sleep in his car, find a person that can pick him up or a taxi ( or maybe an ambulance to sleep the night at the hospital) I made it clear that i don't want him in my house no conditions as if he is pukking again i have to clean that mess which is dont like and potentialy have to check if he is not worsening and more.  Then arthur asked jack to try and call someone to pick him up. and arthur tried to tell me if im down to let him stay in my house if really needed and kept telling him no, no way. before he had the muffin he shouldve decided what if im going bad and how do i get home if i cant sleep at yin's apparently he didn't do that. So i tell arthus if he can't find a person take a taxi or sleep in his car im not helping jack anymore. im not the biggest fan of jack and to help him while he puked in my house was no option for me all i care for was that my house was clean(thank fking hell again for them). arthur did tell me about being low body tempature hypothermia iirc and maybe that he doesnt have to sleep in the open potentially and told him if he really needs to find shelter he can use the hallway i share with the upstairs neighboor. I couldnt provide sleeping stuff aswell cuz i hadnt had a spare and wasn't willing to give mine up for jack. so the other option after not finding a person to drive him was a taxi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso my other friend jeff says \"my mom can pick us both up\" (jeff was also carpooling with jack) so that is taken care off and he doesnt have to call an expensive taxi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after my friends cleaned everything(we cant praise them enough) for me me and my friends sit there waiting for jeffs mom to come. she arrives jeff packs stuff from jack and him that were still left. arthur and onyx where still here and we watched some memes on yt. then they leave and help me with throwing out the thrash with pukeremains and clean the poarch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most bad i feel is to my friends, they helped me alot and the first few minutes i treated them as shit. i yelled at onyx to let me through(I wanted to go to my bedroom to calm down but my sleeping room is next to the bathroom. and onyx was probably afraid i was going to hurt jack) and yelled pretty hard at onyx and that if arthur, jeff or onyx we're to puke i wouldnt mind giving them the couch to sleep on. and that they had to help jack and me not just jack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArthur, Jeff and Onyx if you ever get to read this im so sorry how i reacted to the situation and ecspecially you onyx \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njack if you get to read this: I could've handeld this better and not went full ragemode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr : jack puked in my house after feeling bad from space muffins, I yelled at him to get out of my house into the cold and couldn't care less how he got a sleeping place / came home.",

      "description": "So for context, earlier this week my SO and I decided to swing by Taco Bell for dinner. I had some random combo meal and my SO got that new Double Chalupa box. You know, the one with the Platinum Xbox One X and white Xbox Elite Controller. (Xbox One X standard goes for $499 before tax. Standard controller goes for $149) I paid for the meal and we head home. About an hour later I notice the stixker on the side of the box. Normally we just ignore the codes because chances of winning are slim to none and sge was about to throw it out anyway. So I text the code and what do you know? I won!\n\nThis moment of enjoyment was ended quite abruptly when she began ask me what I wanted to do with it. Saying, \"You paid for it, what will happen with it?\" I've never been a huge fan of Xbox and when each generation comes out I usually stick with ps4. But for free? I'll give Xbox a chance. So I told her I'm gonna keep it. Wich proceeded with about an hour of her yelling and arguing with me. All because she wants to give it to her brother.\n\nNow normally I'll listen to her and actually consider what she says. We are in a relationship afterall. But her brother? He's like 12, plays on an Xbox One S (the one just prior to the X), with one of those third party rubbery controllers made for call of duty and plays on a $1000 projector his dad bought him. Not only that, all he plays is Fortnite. Which is one of the least hardware demanding games out there. Giving him this console is a huge wasted opportunity because it provides the best for all games and he'd use it on the free one. \n\nSo, am I the asshole because I don't want to give an Xbox I won for free to a kiss who already had everything he needs in terms of an Xbox?",

On big occasion there is these teenage discos that are held for under 18 to go and enjoy as a way of enjoying a night out in a safe place legally(legal drinking age is 18). Her and her friends always like to go to these and this will be the first one shes goin to while we are dating, i understand that she will be somewhat drunk like most of theother people there but she argued previously that nothing would ever happen and i trust her. Im not a big drinker i never see the point in getting drunk because you womt remeber the fun you had if youre drunk so i tend not to drink alcohol often. My parents are also very strict and dont let me go out at the weekends when my friends from school go out to nightclubs and stuff so i rarely interact with my school friends outside of school.(even tho my friends who are also 17 still go with fake ids and stuff) we are doing our mock exams last week and this week coming for our leaving Cert(State exam) in june. Ive been very friendly lately with some nice people and was invited to a houseparty the friday we finish our mock exams(the teenage disco my girlfriend is attending is also on that night) so i said id love to go but my girlfriend cant she will be busy. I told my gf this yesterday and she has been very annoyed with me because of it. She said she didnt want me to go and that something might happen, i was adamant that i woukdnt let amything happen and i said that if i can trust her why cant she trust me. She replied that it wasnt me she didnt trust but the other girls that will be there that will be drunk,im not very attractive btw and i havent had many friends for the most part of the last couple years at school because i was annoying and people didnt like me so i was super excited to go but i couldnt believe my gf didnt trust me.  I told her that if any girl tried something with me id push them away because i love my gf a lot. She gave me the most sarcastic ‘sure’ ever to that and i replied that i hoped she enjoyed kissing guys at the next disco. AITA for still wanting to go to the house party even though my girlfriend said she trusts me but doesnt want me to go?",

      "description": "Ok, So I know the title is confusing but this is gonna require a lot of explanation, so I'll put the TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically there's this girl who I'm friends with (we'll call her TJ). She's a pretty odd character, and we're decent friends. There's rumors of her having a mental disability but as far as I know, she isn't officially diagnosed, and just acts strange for the thrill of it or whatever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one day she invites me to a live stream on Instagram. I join and pretty soon, challenge her to the titular 20 dollar Smash Bros. Ultimate money match. At first, she's completely against it, calling me evil and stuff, but then she slowly warms up to the idea and pretty soon she wants to take the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you might be wondering why this is on AITA, but she has told me she's never played the game and she might have a disability, but she's now vouching for the game. On the one hand, I don't wanna extort money from someone I know will be an easy stomp, but on the other I don't wanna turn her down, given she's been talking smack (that she'll beat me, your average pre-game trash) and a part of me wants to prove her wrong. WIBTA for taking the match?\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for taking a 20 dollar smash bros money match against someone I know won't win?",

      "description": "\"Cindy\" and I have known each other for over a year and been dating for about two months.  we are not quite bf/gf but we've slept together. We are not fwb because I think we're more intimate than that.  She works at an entry level job in finance that doesn't pay much. I, on the other hand, am relatively well off compared to her. She is estranged from her parents and refused any help from them and her relatives are barely getting by so she is on her own financially. Every month after rent, car payment, and other expenses she has barely any savings left.\nShe is very motivated to take the CFA exam but doesn't have enough money to pay for the registration. The last thing I want to see is someone I cared about not fulfill her career potential due simply to not having an extra $1,000 laying around, so I paid for the exam for her. I noticed that she's been really stressed out lately and it turns out studying for the exam plus lack of savings is really getting to her. I found out she only eat one meal a day, she said it's to keep her figure but I think it's also because she simply can't afford to eat more. I also found out she is studying for the exam by only reading the text books and watching lectures on youtude - serious test takers would supplement their study with notes, exam videos, practice exams, and access to questions bank from say, Schweser. So I pay $2,000 to buy her the materials plus sign her up for the exam prep classes. On top of that, I also pay for her rent ($1,000) for one month hoping to de-stress her from her financial situation and help her focus on her study. Which, to her credit, she has been studying very hard for, from what I can gather.\nNow, I'm not the only one who noticed her stress. To help her, her bff is flying with her to a beach town for a long weekend getaway (Cindy said she will be bringing her books). Now, here is the thing: her bff comes from a very rich family and is paying for her plane ticket but they are going to split the airbnb. Bff also likes to live it up, she booked a tri-level townhouse by the beach just for the two of them. The cost for three nights comes out to just over $2,000. \nCindy texted me about how expensive it is and how she can't afford to pay for it but she really wants to go. I get the feeling that she wants me to cover the tab. I texted her back that it doesn't make me feel good when after I covered her rent and exam expenses that she turnaround and splash $1,000 on three nights in a luxury Airbnb.\nShe replied that she won't go. But then after one day, she said she will go and if I won't pay for it then she will find someone else or another means to do so. She said she is accustomed to certain luxury because 1) she is a germaphobe (this is true) and the townhouse is clean to her standard (not sure how she'd know that). 2) her ex is rich (also true) and spend money on luxury and on her so she is used to having nice things.\nI refuse to do it.

      "description": "AITA as I asked four times for my neighbour to stop parking badly and blocking my assigned parking space? \n\nMoved 1.5 months ago. Neighbour started parking stupidly a few days in. Left a friendly note after a while as was getting increasingly worse. \n\nCan't get to drivers door sometimes. I'm worried she's going to hit my car. \n\nShe also tells her friend use my space or block me in.\nOther neighbours complained as she blocks all our access sometimes.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/KwOTaYO\n\nHad to get Management involved after going to speak to neighbour face to face led to her friend giving me 20 mins of verbal abuse and threatening false accusations of me damaging their cars to get me in trouble . Witnesses and evidence so im fine. \n\nLogged with police after a second similar harrassment incident with Neighbours parents, they were waiting for me to get home from work. \nPolice don't want to take action just yet as it may escalate further. \n\nManagement company have given her a final warning or they'll end her lease and evict her. \n\nRetaliation: \n\nNeighbour claims I'm harrassing her by asking her to keep moving her car and that I'm making her ill.\n\nOn other side of my space is the empty turning circle in our very small car park. She thinks I should leave her room as she's too ill to manoeuvre her car properly and just doesn't like driving ....and take up space in this turning circle. \n\nI wouldn't completely block it if I did. \n\nBut I'm being called petty for starting a dreaded \"parking war\". I've been polite all the time. \n\nIve asked before and after these incidents for bollards or to reassign my space, but Management said no. \n\nI hate my new home and dread going back to it. Have I brought this on myself ? \n\n\n",

      "description": "So this situation happened a couple years ago\n\nA couple years ago me and 2 friends got a 3 bedroom apartment in a different city. Me and Jay moved there to go to school in that city, but Fred just wanted to use the opportunity to live cheap and put some money aside, which me and Jay didn't have a problem with.\n\nNow, at first everything was good, me and Jay didn't have to work because we had worked hard to put money aside and\n\nbe able to just focus on school. Fred also had money aside, so decided to not work for a while too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow few months down the road, problems slowly began, he was running out of money but didn't look for jobs. So me and Jay literally had to pressure him into applying for jobs, so in our free time me and Jay had to drive around with him for him to even go apply for jobs. \n\nCouple weeks like that and finally he gets a job, so we dodge a bullet here. His job was 15 min away on foot, but it paid 16$ an hour, which is fucking great when all your monthly expenses add up to a mere 600-700$. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 weeks into his new job and he started missing days. He ended up losing the job. His mom ended up paying his expenses for a month. So once again we start pressuring him to go find work, because we're students that only have a certain amount saved and we can't pay for his shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when everything went downhill, he was addicted to league of legends, playing until 3 - 4 AM and raging every time he died punching his desk and all that shit. Me and Jay had to wake up at 7 AM for school every morning which made us have a problem which him yelling. But to be honest to biggest grippe wasn't the raging it was the fact that he wasn't looking for work and bills were coming up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe end up having to pay his rent, and his portion of the bills for the next month. So obviously we grab him for a talk and tell him this wont fly. He listens, finds another job in a week. Few mornings go by and his boots aren't there, so we're breathing and once again we think we good. One morning I was looking for the nail clipper, Fred tended to keep shit in his room so I go to check and he is in his bed with his boots in his room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's make a jump in time, 2 months of bullshit follows where me and Jay have to pay again for his part\n\nSo here's the part where I don't know if i was an asshole, we grab him and tell him : \"we're done with your bullshit, you have 2 weeks to find a job and start paying us back, or we throw your shit out and you deal with your own problems\"\n\nNow most will say this was justified, however it was pretty apparent that Fred was depressed and having dealt with depression myself I know how daunting the feeling is (even though i still work).\n\nHe ended choosing to leave.\n\nSo was I the asshole? could I have done something differently?

      "description": "This past weekend my wife and I were hosting both sets of parents for my daughter's birthday. For two of the three nights they were in town we ate dinner at our house, which was nice because we could just chill and take our time eating. However, the last night my daughter asked if we could go out to her favorite restaurant. I won't name it here, but it's a national chain with a country theme. (Don't judge, she loves the games).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, 6:00 PM on a Sunday is a really busy time and the wait times can be really long. My parents, who showed up first, get our name on the list and are told 45 minutes. No problem, we can fill that time checking out the gift shop. Well, 45 minutes comes and goes. We ask where we are on the list and are told \"you will be seated next\".  From that point on there are at least 5 different parties that get seated before us. No big deal, but we waited an hour and at this point everyone is hungry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe server proceeds to tell us that the kitchen is backed up and we should expect long wait times. Wow, okay, let's get our orders in now (since everyone had plenty of time to look at the menu during our hour long wait). Some of our meals get delivered within a reasonable 20 minutes. Emphasis on \"some\" - half our table was served while the other half was en route. 5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass. 15 minutes pass and finally my father-in-law has had enough. He gets our server's attention and demands to know when the other half of the party will be served. We're told \"it's being plated now\". 20 minutes pass. 25 minutes pass. At this point my father-in-law is furious and asks to see a manager.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother 5 minutes pass and still no manager. This is the proverbial straw that breaks my mother's back and I can tell something is about to go down. She walks up to the kitchen and demands to talk to a manager. Now, I'm still back at the table trying to distract my daughter (who is still oblivious to the building tension at the table - gotta love those free crayons and drawing pages!) so I ask my wife to go make sure things don't get out of hand. I see the manager come out from the kitchen and talk with my emotive mother for a few minutes then she walks back to our table shaking her head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, now 40 minutes after the first half of our table was served the rest of our group gets their meals. I cut into my chicken and the center is a distinct raw pink. Game over, now I've lost it. The next time the server comes by I point to the chicken and say I've lost my appetite. By now, everyone (except my daughter) is upset and just wants to leave. While my family is finishing their meals, I pay the bill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up tipping the waiter \\~15% because I don't have the heart to blame him. But the manager failed to try to resolve the issue and was basically MIA during this entire situation. I was secretly hoping the cashier would ask how everyone was, but that never happened. I just paid the bill and gathered my family to leave. As we were walking out, my father asked how much I tipped and as I told him the rest of the family heard and everyone was upset that I tipped at all!  It wasn't the server's fault it took an hour to be seated, then another 45 minutes for the full group to be served. But, clearly, the restaurant was at fault. What else could I have done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - group of 8 waited over an hour to be seated, then another hour to eat, and my meal was delivered under cooked. I  tipped 15% and my family was mad I tipped at all",

      "description": "Throwaway here.\n\nBackstory : I, F26, am currently looking to get back into illustration and design jobs as after my bachelors some  years ago, depression made me drift off. Worked in fast food for over two years and then a voluntary year as a basic paramedic with the red cross. Nothing that had anything to do with my \"work in video game industry\" plan young and naive me had laid out but work nonetheless so that I would not be unemployed.\n\nMy parents have since given me the impression that I am not gonna get a job in the field and while it is hard to find a job if you are not among the best, my main problem there was that I could not muster up the energy and spirit to get my shit straight and set up a portfolio and applications that looked usable. \n\nI have improved a lot in that regard due to my bf whom I met half a year ago.\n\nMy parents, however, after years of watching me try and fail and struggle to stay sane, still give off the vibe of not caring or knowing what I do which blows my mind. \n\nTold my mum that several times that I am not going to write childrens books, she still thinks that the couple famous childrens authors are the only one who have ever written books, ignored me telling her of the thousands of books  published each year that go barely noticed and despite having told her multiple times, thinks works like Harry Potter have been made overnight. \n\nMy dad still fails to realize that illustration and graphic design can be wildly diverse.\n\nMy mum likes to shove her opinion down my throat and acts incredibly sulky to downright mean if you start to argue with her. The only person untouchable to her is my sister in law to be who recently gave birth to the first grandchild in the family\n\nMy dad just gets super insulting and accuses me of being too picky, a lazy millenial who will never get a job this way, running away from my problems etc.\n\nBoth my parents have been in the situation of not having to deal with the job market or applying for jobs for the last 35 decades as he is a military guy and she is a housewife wo curses on women choosing both career and children. They still think you can hand write a page for your bio, walk up to a companies boss and get the job starting the next day.\n\nMy mum made me dislike my sister in law due to shielding her from any criticism and hailing her as the poor child from a mean, mean family. Sister in law is 30ish, well off inheritances and never had to worry about getting a job or a flat and because of having the kid, is a saint.\n\nWith that said, I don't feel like I could stomach the upcomming baptism of my nephew in may.\nTalked with my brother about it and he is understanding as he and the other siblings know how stuck up and stuck in time my parents are.\n\nAITA for not sucking it up for a family event but not wanting to go to me nephews baptism?\n",

      "title": "AITA For Wanting My S/O To Pay For A Cat?",
      "description": "Pretty self-explanatory but here's the backstory anyhow:  \nI'm a huge animal lover, I foster cats, and have one of my own. We found a farm kitten a couple of weeks ago. It siblings didn't make it and I really wanted to help the lil guy out. He looked like he had an eye infection and possibly a respiratory issue.   \nI brought him home in a box with my s/o and my s/o automatically fell in love with him. The kitten is about 4 1/2 weeks old so I had to get a dog kennel, lock him up and separate it from my other cats (currently fostering one and have one of my own). I bought him all kitten food, toys, etc. \n\n  \nTook him to the vet and thankfully, there was no respiratory infection, but he did have an eye infection. I had to get the check-up by myself, pay for the check-up, eye meds, and flea application, along with that I had to take the other foster cat into a different vet the same two-hour span. After having the cat gawked at for an hour, felt around, and medicated I realized I forgot my credit card - turns out I actually lost my credit card. Thankfully the vet let me off with a pass since I go there for my cat. I still have to pay for it. The total came up to $100. \n\n  \nMy s/o has since named him, told people that it's \"ours\" and obviously everyone and their mother tells me that it's adorable and my cat would \"love to have a friend\". This cat is tiny, I mean really tiny. My cat is big, not a huge team-player in the sense of this-is-my-mom-you-don't-cuddle-her-I-do. The kitten plays with the foster more-so too (since they're closer in age). \n\n  \nI'm worried about a couple things including the future of this cat. 1) he's a *kitten.* I bought my own cat when he was a year and a half and I've had to pay for all his stuff and it hasn't been cheap, but worth it because we have this special bond. I foster cats because I want to do my part with helping but, don't necessarily want any more cats...\n\n  \nI've expressed to my s/o that they have to commit to this kitten and that as it grows up it'll cost money. I know my s/o is pretty loaded when it comes to money; I, on the other hand, have about $200 in my savings and slide by due to bills and spending habits (I'm getting better I swear). There's a couple of other issues such as we don't live together, don't share expenses, and this kitten is currently residing in my apartment with me and the other two cats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have the ability to foster this cat until needed, I really don't mind that. He is absolutely adorable as well. We plan on moving soon to a more expensive city and it's going to be tightly spaced as well (his plan). And I don't think he realizes it's hard to find a place that accepts animals let alone two in a crowded room.\n\n  \nI'm in my early 20s, live by myself, have a decent job (but not enough hours currently), go to school full time, etc. My family does not help out with my bills (including schooling). I've mentioned to him several times about the $100; \"I really don't have this kind of money right now\" \"this is a money commitment\" \"this is your cat, not mine\" and even went down to: \"We should split bills if you want the cat.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone is telling me to keep him because he's \"just too cute\" but I know better. My mom has done this with plenty of dogs and now has 4 in her suburban house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl:dr  Found a young kitten, paid for the vet bill ($100), unsure if I want to keep it, s/o wants to but hasn't helped me out.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an absolute dick, I rarely ever ask for money, but I backed out on getting an older cat earlier this year due to financials and went back to fostering.\n\n  \nAITA for wanting him to pay off the bill for this cat and the future bills since I don't necessarily want to take it in forever? At least halfsies on it would be fine! I'm just currently overwhelmed and Christmas is coming up too. Should I keep this cat?  \n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I went to the phone company’s business center to report a disruption from almost 3 weeks ago. I would have reported it sooner but it was the holidays and we were busy. **So I lied by saying I already called and have yet to hear from their techs.**\n\nRep gets busy. Of course it’s not in their system. Of course the rep will try to look for it. And of course the rep will try to escalate it.\n\nMy girlfriend was seething.\n\n**WHAT SHE SAW:**\nShe called me an entitled POS for making the rep look for a non-existent ticket. She accuses me of being an unfair, inconsiderate and lying bastard. That all I care about is money. That I have zero respect for customer service staff. (She’s a customer service rep.)\n\n**WHAT I SAW:**\nIf you have dealt with customer service before, chances are you would have encountered missing tickets — either the last rep did not create a ticket or it’s simply lost in the system. **I played that.**\n\nI did not raise my voice nor did I sound threatening. I was as courteous as I can be. I had no beef against the rep but I want to be credited for unused service. I work my ass off for those hard earned doubloons and I expect to squeeze every cent out of those. Had the rep been at risk of getting a deduction, I would not have pulled that stunt. But it’s the company who will be providing compensation, and I got zero fucks about their coffers.\n\nSuffice to say I do not feel remotely sorry about that. Am I wrong?",

      "description": "I've been steaming since my bachelor party 4 days ago. My friend of 25+ years who I've lived with before and supported through all sorts of personal and marital issues was asked to plan my bachelor party 2 months ago. I feel it's kind of an honor to ask a friend to do this. Long story short he made one reservation at an axe throwing place for our group of 8 at 1PM. He had a family situation with one of his kids and the morning of had to bail on the party. I understand that aspect as I put family first. I texted him during the axe throwing and asked what the rest of the plans were. He said \"that's it\" followed by \"you probably should have known how busy I am and picked someone else.\" I was shocked that not only did he not plan anything, he didn't TELL ANYONE THAT HE DIDN'T PLAN ANYTHING until the party started!!!! I felt humiliated and embarrassed in front of the rest of my friends, and I could tell it made everyone feel awkward as we had to throw together something last minute and try to not let the awkwardness ruin the vibe. We made the best of it but it was weird. I told him he embarrassed me, and I couldn't believe he would let me down like this. Still have not heard from him since. This is a good friend for years and years. I consider(ed) him one of my closest lifelong friends. I am 40 he is 38. AITA?",

      "description": "Last year I was in university, so couldn’t really afford to give her a great Christmas, so after starting a new job this year where I could afford it I decided to treat her a little. I went slightly over budget on what I was planning to spend (my budget was around £250 whereas I spent £350-£400 over the course of around three and a half months).  Her mum asked me to tell her what I got her so she doesn’t get the same as me, so I sent her the list, and she told her. This led to a bit of an argument and her getting annoyed I spent that much (she has spent around £300 on me). I understand that we have other priorities to be saving for, such as saving to move in together, and saving for a car, as well as a couple of holidays we have, and I don’t feel like the amount I spent is unwarranted as she asked for a lot of the things I got and I feel like the others are quite meaningful.\n\nSo AITA for spending more than I should have? I know she isn’t in the wrong for this and is entirely justified saying what she did but I just wanted to give her a good Christmas, maybe in the process I lost myself a little and got carried away?",

I plan on attending college, but staying at home rather than living on campus. My dad is a very controlling and doesn't really let me do much. I pretty much go to school, home, work. I rarely get to hang out with friends, go on a drive, or just go get fast food. I feel like if I move away he will still try to control me. He doesn't think that I could live on my own or have the confidence to do things without reassurance, but that's totally false. \n\nMy cousin, who is also going to be attending college and staying at home, has offered multiple times (too many to count) that I could live with him and his family. We're all very close and we've dreamed of being roommates since the 6th grade. I feel it would be beneficial to be able to experience more things and be able to choose what I can and can't do, even of there could be possible consequences.\n\nThe school year ends in May, and I really want to get a whole headstart and talk to my Dad about this before it's right around the corner. My aunt and uncle, second family of you will, are totally on board with it. I just haven't told my dad about it. So, would I be the asshole if I wanted to live with my aunt and uncle rather than my dad and stepmom? \n",

Then she goes “I was using the timer on the microwave to know when to take my chicken out of the oven and now I’ll have no idea!!!” REALLY loud and angry and then walked away to her bedroom where she then slammed door. Lew and I didn’t say anything because we were in shock by how mad she got over it.

So after it all happened we talked and realized that she could’ve :      \n\nA.

      "description": "I’m am currently 21 years old and mid last year I decided to quit my job and join the Army. It’s had its ups and down but I do really like it here and don’t regret my decision to join. \n\nShortly before I left for basic training, I opened a new checking and savings account with a new bank and set my mom as a joint owner. I did this because we’ve been having financial issues for a long time and I didn’t want her be unable to pay her monthly expenses. She was on section 8 but due to something I don’t really want to explain here, she’s off and has been trying to get back on with little success. I said she could take what she needed if she was ever short on rent before leaving and that was that. \n\nFast forward 2 months and I’ve graduated basic training. I went in as an E-1 so I was making around $670 every two weeks. I checked my bank account and noticed I only had $200 saved up. This upset me a great deal since I was paying my own debits back and planned to wipe out anything I had left with what I had earned.  But I decided not to bring it up since it would ruin mood of family day. \n\nNow we’re about 4 months later and I’m about to graduate AIT. I’m making that good E-2 pay, $844 a check on average and I have currently have $168 in my account.  My monthly expenses total $400 max a month (Phone Bills, Credit Card payments and anything extra I need in a month). The rest she has been using. In all I’ve spent at most 35%-40% of everything I make and have little to show for it. I’ve talked to her about how this affects me since soon I’ll be moving to a bigger base where I’m pretty much told I’ll need a car to get around to here I’ll need to be. (Cheapish and used, I’m not dumb in that regard). \n\nUpon graduation I should take home about $2500 subtract the $650ish I may be using in that time. But if she keeps using my money I may not see any of it. \n\nTo give context since I didn’t add it in, I lived with my mom and 16 year old sister who works hard in school but doesn’t work a job or have an income. She probably won’t be getting one soon either since transportation where they live isn’t great. \n\nMy mom has said she’s been looking for a 1 bedroom apartment but that’s all she’s said about it. She currently works and is driving for Uber for extra money so she not being lazy. \n\nThe reason I ask this is because I care about them and their well being but I can’t take care of myself and prepare for my future if this keeps up. \n\n",

      "description": "So tonight we're hosting Christmas party and we've planned that it would be time that me and my family spend together, in comortable atmosphere. But now I've learned that my Mother and Father plans on inviting our neighbor, that I know I won't be comortable around. The fact is she most probably spends holidays on her own as her father died last year. I know that I am asshole for the somewhat lacking of empathy but hear me out. This person has history of visiting my sister once and asking her private things like when was her last period, and has she been with someone intimately, mind I remind you that our families aren't close despite sharing ancestors (she's daughter of my grandpas sister). The other thing is hygiene. Even when her dad and mom were alive they lived in constant mess, and she did barely anything to help out around home. The smell isn't pleasant at all.. She never worked entire life even though she's in her 40's. When we helped her out in past she'd exploit our kindness often. Like when my sis went to help her out buy new washing machine, she'd want to save some money from delivery and asked her to help her lifting it even though it was way too heavy. Or other time when my mom gave her lift to town she'd expect them to drive her on daily basis. \nI openly told my family that I wouldn't feel comortable around her and they replied that they wouldn't either. I've sugested that instead inviting her we could take some food and pie after dinner to her, but my parents are religious and will probably end up inviting her. I just want to know amita? ",

I just feel like such an asshole every time I say no to playing with her. \n\nI have work, school, gym, and other relationships to maintain. I try to even it all out but I find that oftentimes I don't prioritize her enough. I try to fit enough time for her as possible but it's really hard. For example sometimes I'll cut down my gym time from 1.5 h to 45 mins so I can be with her for a little bit. \n\nOf course, I am not calling her the asshole in this situation. It would be my other family members that are constantly pressuring me and making me feel really guilty for not having her as my number 1 priority. They are not the most pleasant people, they often call me bitchy for not playing with her for a couple days. And they even tell her that I don't love her enough to play with her which just makes both of us feel terrible. \n\nI am just wondering if I should be the one making some changes here. Also we are Chinese if that makes any difference. Family is pretty important in our culture. \n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday I posted in my town’s “memories” Facebook group asking if anyone had any old photos of my house. It was built in 1898 so I’m sure it’s gone through many changes in its long life time, so I wanted to know what it has looked like in the past. Cue some asshole telling me, “definitely haunted!!” and continuing to comment about it and tagging someone who’s previously lived here, after I told them I don’t think it’s haunted and want to know nothing about that bullshit. We’ve lived here since September and haven’t had any creepy feelings or weird experiences (and believe me, if it was haunted we’d have probably heard it by now— I can hear my husband walk across the upper floor step by step when I’m downstairs). \n\nEarlier today, I was at work and someone else sent me a message on Messenger, telling me about how some couple lived in the basement (which is unfinished and not even remotely liveable currently, nor does it look like it’s ever been liveable) in the 1980s was on drugs and stomped their newborn baby to death while their 2-year-old watched. Like why the FUCK would you message someone about something like that, ESPECIALLY after they explicitly expressed no desire to hear any negative things about the house? So I became angry and told them to go fuck themselves and mind their own fucking business. They told me, “there’s no need to be rude” as if they weren’t being supremely rude by sending me the message in the first place. So, AITA and was I actually rude for telling them to fuck themselves?",

Recently my brother expressed an interest in learning some basic piano/keyboard stuff for songs that he writes as he’s a songwriter which I was all for and I gave him one of my old keyboards I don’t use anymore. The keyboard wasn’t bad by any means and would suit his needs well. I myself own 2 pianos, one being worth £2000 and the other £1500. I paid for the majority of the pianos with my own money (my parents paid the rest off as I got them when I was younger and didn’t have a job). Now where the problem comes in is that he repeatedly keeps sneaking downstairs and playing my pianos when I’m not home when I have told him to not do that as a he has damaged one of them in the past and I just generally don’t want him playing something I paid so much for. I snapped at him today because he accidentally deleted some important recordings I had on my electric piano and tried to pretend it wasn’t him. He has multiple £800+ guitars that I wouldn’t even think of touching without his permission so AITA for shouting at him? ",

      "title": "AITA? Dog-Sitting Gone Wrong",
      "description": "Sorry, I couldn’t think of a better title. And this is really long.\n\n\nMy brother and his wife often go on trips throughout the year. They have 2 young kids and 2 dogs. His wife texted me asking if I could spend time at their house to watch their dogs for the weekend. My parents (who live up the street) are always watching their kids and hate their dogs. I assumed they were asking me because they said no, so I said it’d be no problem. I had plans that weekend, but nothing major, so I canceled them, unbeknownst to my brother and his wife.\n\n\nHer text was brief asking me to stay at the house with them because they didn’t want them alone all day and all night, and after I said yes, there wasn’t more info than a “thank you”.\n\n\nMy brother called me up the next day and said thank you and something about the alarm and leaving me money for a dinner.\n\n\nFriday rolls around and I was supposed to cover the dog’s dinner that night. However, my sister wanted to hang out with me as I’m not normally in town (I live 50 minutes away). She said she would feed the dogs before I got there and then we’d be able to hang out. For reference, my brother left around 4 after being home all day and the dogs were fed around 6 and my sister stayed until 7:30, at which point she blocked them in the kitchen for the night.\n\n\nI went out to dinner with my sister that night, stopped over at my brother’s house to check on the dogs around 10, let them out and spent some time with them. I noticed he left me some money on the counter for dinner. Too nice, I didn’t need to be compensated, I was just doing them a favor. My mother earlier in the day mentioned that my old bedroom in the house was empty and that I could crash there. So I walked up the street to crash there for the night.\n\n\nWhen I woke up, my mom asked me if I wanted to have breakfast with her sisters at the house. I fed the dogs at 7 am and hung out until 8 am. Then went back up to my parent’s for breakfast. \n\n\nI planned on spending the rest of the day doing schoolwork at the house while hanging with the dogs. After breakfast, I get a phone call from my brother and you can tell by his voice that he’s frustrated. He says “What’s going on? Why are you up at Mom and Dad’s?” in an exasperated voice. I told him I fed the dogs breakfast and that Mom asked me to have breakfast with them, a bit of questioning in my voice because I was confused as to what was going on. He then asked me why I didn’t sleep at his place last night and why my sister fed the dogs, still seeming frustrated. I tell him that my sister said she could feed them dinner and that I checked on them but mom offered me my old bed, so I slept up there. I’m starting to feel defensive, but only because he’s sounding offensive (Worth noting, he has smart cameras all over his house and gets notifications for the alarm being set/disengaged, so he knows what’s going on at all times, hence why he knew that my sister fed the dogs and that I wasn’t at their house)\n\n\nRight after I finished explaining this, he blows up on how “The entire point of you watching the dogs is so that they’re not alone at night. If we wanted them fed, then we could have just had mom or dad stop in and do that. The whole point of watching the dogs is being there to watch them, not up the street. What the hell are we paying you for?”\n\n\nThe tone in his voice is cutting. I feel tears start to well up, but anger boils from inside. “Well, you guys never said that! You never told me sleeping over there was make or break for it. I only got a text from #WifesName saying that you’d like me to spend time at the house to watch them. Also, I never asked for money or knew I was getting paid for this.”\n\n\n“First off, I *TOLD* you that we were going to pay you over the phone the other day. Don’t even try that. Secondly, #WifesName’s text said that ‘we didn’t want them alone all day and all night’ so it should be apparent that we expected me to sleep there. If we would have known, we would have gotten someone else who could have done the job.” That last one hurt.\n\n\n“You said you were leaving me money for dinner for one night, not $40. And I read that as you didn’t want them alone ‘all day AND all night’, they haven’t been alone all day and all night, and they won’t. I just didn’t know you meant you wanted them to be watched 24/7. You guys spend more time away from them when you’re home and I planned on spending the rest of the day with them anyway. But now you’ll never know because it’s not even past 9 am on Saturday, and I’m already being chewed out on doing a shitty job. I’ll go down right now and hang out with them.” I was getting bitter.\n\n\n“Don’t even bother. I’m going to get someone else to take care of them. This is the last thing I wanted to deal with while on my vacation.” He does this. Guilt trip. Though, it is his vacation, I feel bad that he’s worried about this while he shouldn’t be.\n\n\n“Are you serious? I canceled plans and drove down here just to watch your dogs and you’re going to cancel on me because I wasn’t unconscious in the same house that they were unconscious in? When you literally never told me that was a requirement! That’s so ridiculous.” I was getting exasperated. \n\n\n“I’m sorry that you feel that way. Don’t act like you didn’t know we wanted you to sleep down here, Mom and Dad could have done what you’re doing.”\n\n\n“I didn’t know! Where would I have slept?! We never talked about it. Did you just want me to post up on the couch? Did you wash the sheets on a bed for me? I expected we’d talk about this if sleeping there was the expectation. Mom hates your dogs, I expected she either said no or that you didn’t want to ask her *yet again* to help with them.”\n\n\n“That’s so ridiculous. Why wouldn’t you ask us where to sleep if that was such a big question?”\n\n\n“Because I didn’t know you cared! I had no idea it was this big of a thing. I would have just slept down with the dogs if I thought it was that important to you guys. It wasn’t communicated effectively.”\n\n\n“Well, I thought it was. Either way. I’ll be getting someone else to watch the dogs. Keep the money.”\n\n\n“I can still do it, I’ll sleep there tonight. I don’t care about the money.”\n\n\n“I’d rather you not. I don’t need these complications.” \n\n\n*click*\n\n\nEventually we made up and moved on like brothers do. We both decided we were acting childish the way we blew up at each other. We *rarely* fight as we get along really well. But I always wonder if I was just way off base, if they should have explained things more, or if we were both being dumb.\n\n\nAlso, I tried to explain the situation as best I could. It is my point of view, so keep that in mind that it probably has natural bias and backstory that my brother didn’t have. ",

      "description": "My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks and i posted a status on my facebook asking who’d like to go out with me for my birthday. I also made a post on my instagram saying that nobody probably wanted to go out with me for my birthday and i was gonna be at home lonely. Low and behold two of my really good friends, we’ll call them Amy and Jan for the sake of the story commented on the facebook status asking when and what were doing. I decided karaoke and maybe a few drinks. So its a done deal got plans set for my birthday.\n\nNowwww i have another friend named “Beth” who left a comment on my instagram post. she just commented a skeptical emoji face on the instagram post along with the words hmmmmm, kind of implying she was there if i wanted to go out with her. \n\nA little back story on Beth: she used to be my best-friend and we have some history together (3 years of friendship). Our friendship ended at one point over a number of things but the main reason is that she tried to steal my current boyfriend. She’s always had to be the center of attention or dominant female in our relationship. I dont do well with these types of people, i dont care to compete especially when i dont view things in a competitive mindset. We both were involved with the same friend group and she was one of main reasons i left. I was the only other girl in the friend group and her need for constant validation from our guy friends and constant attention really started getting on my nerves. She would think it was jealousy when it was really just me getting irritated. She was so self centered that at one point she got mad that my boyfriend and i were hanging out without her and she was angry we weren’t working around her schedule to all hang out together. \n\nI stopped talking to her in oct and we reconnected at the beginning of this year around April. I kept my distance and i only consider her an acquaintance now. Shes always trying to hang out with me and I’m just not feeling it anymore, i know she wants things to go back to the way they used to be but i just cant bring myself to get close to someone like that. Shes been making advances by trying to be my gym buddy, trying to plan a time and day of the week to hang out every week which doesn’t really work with my schedule as it is sporadic. In a way I’ve mostly been ghosting her.\n\nIm afraid if i invite her she’s going to once again make everything about her when it’s my special day. Shes going to find some reason to start unnecessary drama and I’m just not here for it. She clearly wants to go and knows I’ve been avoiding contact with her. AITA for not inviting her?",

We had an argument over that story and she defended herself saying she should be allowed to socialize or post anything on her social media and that I should not be controlling her.

      "description": "posting on a throwaway account for sake of anonymity.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend and I were supposed to watch a movie and we had plans to sometime this week but we never set a date. Well, earlier in the week, my cousin expressed interested in watching it with me because he liked the trailers, the characters history, etc. And not to mention that he paid for us to go eat one more than one occasion so it was more than fair.  So Wednesday night, my cousin and I go see the movie, it was meh, and we go home. Once I sit in my car waiting for it warm up, I sent him a brief text warning not to waste his hard earned dollars on the film. Later on in the week, said friend and I get into a discussion over the film and he correctly deduces that I've already seen the film based on what I was saying (critiquing the length, direction, things like that) and he becomes upset that I went and saw the film. I point out that while, yes, I may have seen the film, it doesn't mean that I said no to him and that we could still go. He mentions that its fine now, but that it was cold of me to do so. I scoff and roll my eyes. After a few hours I was thinking that maybe I could've communicated it a bit better but I still feel weird that he said that even though we could still go. I don't know? Am I The Asshole? ",

      "description": "Alright, buckle up, this is going to be a bumpy ride. Let me provide some background and context before presenting myself to the court.\n\nMy husband and I have been friends with another couple for years. They are what would conventionally be called best friends. We are godparents to their sons and have done our best to always be there for them. However, things have changed and not for the better over the years. \n\nInitially, when we began hanging out with them and getting close, husband and I were newlyweds and generally up to doing whatever, whenever. We were not exactly responsible with money and functioned on the mindset, \"the bills will be there tomorrow.\" we would drop everything to hang out and they were at our house or we were out with them 4-6 days a week and they would be in our home until 2-4am on work nights. Being new godparents, we also would drop everything to help with our first godchild if it was needed as well. \n\nOver time, we realized this wasn't a healthy mindset. We started to want to get our shit together. Being in debt isn't fun. So we started saving money and paying down bills, going out and spending money less. We explained to them and they didn't seem to like it, but they didn't end the friendship over it. Then because the schedule of constantly entertaining until late hours was burning us out, we started setting healthier boundaries with how many days we would have company and how late they could stay. It wasn't malicious, but it needed to be done. This started clearly to bother them.\n\nIt is important to add here that I have SAD/MAD/ and PTSD. Earlier on in the friendship, I was on proper medications that helped me with being able to function. Once my husband and I started trying to conceive, I got pulled off all the things that worked and put on medication that left me in \"maintenance\" mode. Over time, my anxiety and depression have really spiraled and I have become more withdrawn. I have profoundly apologized for this and stressed it was not personal. This has gotten worse since we got pregnant after five losses. I am high risk and can't really leave the house and I am also in my last leg of my Master's program and the epitome of no life. Keep this bit of information shelved now. \n\nSo, as you can see stressors we're starting to take place in the friendship. This couple can't stand to be at home and we are now trying to balance out work and personal lives. We are also trying to deal with grief after recurrent miscarriages. We thought our friends would understand that we are hurting and need to process these feelings. They don't. \n\nOnce we finally got pregnant, the final nail in the coffin came down. I was watching my godson for them when they went to work, I did it for free because they are our friends and I love my godson. I told them I would do this as long as I could. My doctor had different plans, about 12 weeks into my pregnancy, I got put on bedrest and was told that chasing a three year old around wasn't good for high risk pregnancy. So I had to tell them the time had come and I couldnt watch him anymore. I gave plenty of notice and felt like shit about it. They never set up a backup plan and then when we told them, they flipped out on us. They said it was last minute and said we were selfish. \n\nAfter that, the friendship has been off. Even after our second godchild was born. My anxiety and depression have been through the roof and I haven't really reached out to anyone, I feel like a burden when I do. My husband works all the time and he's exhausted when he gets home. We are both in our Master's programs and I am due to give my thesis defense about three weeks after my child is born. There are not enough hours in a day to spend with each other, much less anyone else. We have invited them over to hang out but money is very very tight and we have had to turn down out of state trips or spontaneous double date nights. \n\nThis brings us to now. They are supposed to be the godparents to our child. They have shown no interest in the baby or anything involving the baby. It hurts. She always seems annoyed or put off when I reach out, so I stopped. They found friends that go out a lot and in the process have dropped years of friendship to kind of rub in our faces they don't need us. We knew things would change once we started trying to get our shit together. We didn't think that this would be the result. \n\nThen last night her husband was texting with mine and said she had no friends here, very pointedly. That he had few. My husband said we were here if they needed us and we were sorry that we have been busy and cannot go out as much. This spirals into an argument that everything we say is an excuse. That a high risk pregnancy, work, and school shouldn't stop us from having a life. Then they say that anxiety can't control someone's life and nobody is ever that depressed all the time and that we are pregnant now and should \"get over our losses.\" They said we are no fun and if they continued giving their honest opinion that we would end the friendship. \n\nThey worked in mental health, she has a degree in psychology. Of all people I thought they would understand how crippling anxiety is when you can't take the medication for it. We didn't just drop them as friends, we just said they couldn't be over every night til the crack of dawn and we couldn't spend money that needed to go to bills and the baby, especially after I had to quit work for the pregnancy. My heart is hurting and talking to them isn't an option. I am willing to admit my wrongs and try to fix them, they refuse to do that and it won't ever get resolved because they don't ever believe in apologies or working issues out. I never thought trying to do the right thing for the future would make them feel like this and want to just drop us. If the shoe was on the other foot, we would support them and come up with things to do that didn't require money. \n\nThank you in advance for reading this post. It's long and I am sorry. So at the end of the day, AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "Howdy! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been moving out of my old house all week long, and finally taking the last load.  I have a 1-ton van fully loaded with boxes and misc stuff .  I've got a Car (also with stuff in it) loaded on a car trailer that i'm towing.  I'm in the right lane with my cruise control set to 65.   This was the speed limit for the road. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's an elevated on ramp  that's  a hair over a 1/3 of a mile or a .55 KM  .  that onramp is down hill and has an excellent view of the highway . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell a car is driving down the on ramp and directly next to my trailer and he decides to also go exactly 65 .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits very light traffic, no one is in front of me or behind me for at least a 1/2 mile , there is a car to my left mostly ahead of me.   The car to my right makes no attempt to speed up, or to slow down.    My total van+trailer+car weight is easily 11,000 pounds probably closer to 12K .    speeding up from 65 is more of an idea than something that happens, and the last thing you want to do while towing is slam on your brakes.       So i just kept driving on cruise control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe Driver next does nothing at all to merge and he ends up on the shoulder.   at which point in time he discovers he can apply his brakes to slow down and merge onto the highway.     immediately after that  he figures out his car can also accelerate and he speeds up to get next to me to give me a 1 finger solute. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo people honestly expect someone towing should be the person speeding up or slowing down so that they can merge zero effort?

      "description": "Some things you need to know:\n\n1. This is a throw-away account.\n2. I was recently diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and I just started taking meds but they probably won't work for two weeks (take that information how you will.)\n\nMy partner and I have been together for almost two years. It's been rocky, partially because of them, and always blown out of proportion because of my (previously) un-diagnosed BPD. They have wanted a dog since I met them--not, actively advocating for one, but it would sometimes come up in conversation. I wanted one too, I grew up around dogs and cats, but we live in a small apartment and as I've learned over time, stress is a trigger for me.\n\nIf you don't know much about Borderline, basically it involves identity issues, extreme mood swings, impulsive behavior, fears of being abandoned, self-isolation...blah blah blah. Anyway I was feeling really \"up\" and decided we should go to the shelter and buy a dog. So...that's what we did.\n\nDon't get me wrong, despite being a high energy breed, some separation anxiety, and being a medium sized dog (kind of big) in a small apartment, it's a great dog. Very smart, easily trainable, loyal, hasn't caused any harm or damage when left alone. Basically it has a ton of great traits and there is no reason to not like it.\n\nHowever, that fleeting really-fantastic mood has worn off and reality has sunk in. We have a dog. We've had a dog now for a few days and honestly, I'm exhausted. I work full-time and don't do well working full-time either. (Stress is a trigger for me.)\n\nBasically, I really regret this decision. I feel stressed already at work, and now I feel stressed at home. My partner said they would be fine taking the dog out every time it needs to be let out, which makes me feel a little better, but I still feel stressed. My home should be my home BASE. Now, with a dog in our tiny apartment, I have to listen to unwanted sounds, verbalize that I want to be left alone, keep an eye out for bad behavior if the dog is alone in the other room... It's like a huge distraction and disruption from what was once a peaceful place for me to come home and get personal projects done.\n\nWe still have days left on our \"trial period\" with the dog which means we can return the dog if things don't work out, but obviously I feel super guilty. I'm just having this immature rude awakening that I don't actually want a dog in this tiny apartment and I feel shitty because I'm the one that set everything up while feeling high on good emotions. I've had dogs before so I already knew about the work required in caring for one, but I didn't realize how much it would negatively affect me.\n\nMy partner knows that I'm unhappy about this decision but doesn't want to return the dog. I honestly don't even want to be at the house anymore and I think it's going to negatively affect our relationship too.  \n\n\nAITA for wanting to return the dog? What would you do?",

      "description": "My stepdad was diagnosed with ALS  a while ago and it made me question my relationship with him. I realized that there was a lot of resentment, grudges, and aggression. I felt that it wasn’t a healthy bond, and I wanted to remedy it\n\nI was heading to a family dinner and my girlfriend was dropping me off. She went inside to use the restroom and my stepdad got upset at me over that because he thought I invited her to eat with us, but she was only dropping me off. He started to get weird about his decision and tells me to go fetch her back to the house, so I did \n\nI met with my grandma, a few uncles, and my stepdad’s friends that he invited over \n\n\nAfter dinner, I asked if I could talk to him so we moved into a private room. I told him that I felt like our relationship together is strained and asked if he’d like to spend time with me on the weekends. He doesn’t reply to my question and instead brings up other unrelated topics he’s been upset about (like my gf entering the house). I tell him that I wasn’t talking about that, and that I wanted a better relationship with him but he starts to bring up other topics, which made me feel like he was trying to avoid answering \n\nI felt disheartened and that he wasn’t listening to me. he started to get more angry the more I told him that I felt like he wasn’t listening, so I got really anxious and told him that I was going to leave the room. He demanded that I stay, so I lingered for a little bit next to the door. I felt like his tone was getting more aggressive and it spooked me out, so I said sorry and left \n\nI headed for the front door as quietly as I could and didn’t say goodbye to anyone because I was about to cry\n\nI stepped outside and was going to head into the car but then I hear my stepdad shouting across the house, “OP! GET OVER HERE! NOW!” and I freeze up because I got scared and started to cry. It was embarrassing for me because everyone who was at the family dinner was paying attention to what’s happening. He continued to shout for me to come back into the house. I didn’t move and stood there because I didn’t want everyone to see me crying, so he came over to me instead \n\nHe looks at me and says, “aren’t you going to say goodbye to everyone?” and I felt bad about it. Then he said “You can’t keep doing this. Go.” and then he went back into the house\n\nI felt really bad about walking out, I don’t know if there was something else I should’ve done. AITA?",

      "description": "I feel like a dick. But here is the deal. When my husband and I met, he was very active, worked out all the time, ate well and was involved in a lot of outdoor activity. I’ve never been a fitness buff or anything, but I have always been in shape. We got married and had 2 kids and we’ve been married 7 years and I love him, he’s my best friend, he’s an amazing husband and father, but he has gained like 75 pounds since we got married and lost all muscle tone and I just have a hard time finding him attractive anymore. We still have regular sex, we still get along well. But I find that when I look at old pictures of us I get really sad cause I miss when he had muscle tone. \n\nI get that he is busy with work and the kids but I feel like he doesn’t try. I’ll watch him eat cake and just feel physically disgusted by him eating calories. I feel like if the roles were reversed I would be so hurt by that! But I feel like the part that makes me an asshole is that I don’t really have to try to keep in shape. I do yoga and I try to eat semi-healthy but mostly my metabolism just keeps the weight off of me. I’ve weighed the same since high school (5’5” 120lbs), even after two pregnancies and I feel like if I did start to gain weight I would do something about it but I can’t say for sure cause I’ve never had to so maybe if it was hard for me like it is for him I would also just kinda give up on it. And I feel like he is such a loving person that he would never have these thoughts about me that I’ve been having about him. \n\nI don’t say anything mean to him about it, I make occasional comments about being concerned for his health, and the other day I showed him pictures from our honeymoon and been like, “oh look how young we looked before kids!” Hoping he would get the hint but he didn’t seem to. He talks about going back to the gym sometimes and I looked up nearby gyms and compared membership options for him but he just never went.  I don’t know if at this point in marriage I’m just supposed to be okay with not really being turned on by my spouse. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I've been getting closer with this person this year (let's call her V),  and while we've had some happy memories, there's a lot of incidents that make me wonder if this friendship should be ended.\n(Please don't judge her too harshly, we're in middle school and she's a good person. I wrote this more to question our personal friendship, not to drag her as a person.)\n\nShe's affectionate with loads of other people, not just physically, but nice to them and always happy to see them. With me, however, she's curt and I feel like I can't make any mistakes around her or she'll act annoyed and act like I'm a burden. \n\nI also feel like she doesn't act like we're friends unless the situation we're in puts me at a disadvantage. My \"friends\" play a \"game\" in which they like to steal my drink (sparkling ice) under the premise of it being \"bad for me\". And while I enjoy the attention I sometimes get while I try to get my drink back, that's the only time I feel like I'm a part of my friend group. Today, they presented me with an ultimatum: get my drink back today and they stop stealing it, but I lose the little attention I would have gained from the game. I know that to most people it seems obvious to accept my drink and end the teasing, but I'm worried that that would mean that I just lose any opportunities of being included in stuff with the group.\n\nI'm rarely the center of attention in the group, and I'm often rarely even included in the conversation, which is why I'm worried about accepting their offer. I also know that if I tried to distance myself from her, our friends would definitely pick her over me. They don't dislike me, they just prefer her.\n\nWe've had a couple of fights this year but nothing major, but I feel like we've just been tense and distant for a while. For example, I'd initiate texts asking how her weekend was, or things like that, and she'd just leave me on read for no reason. She also refused to let me follow her on Instagram and doesn't follow me back, so it stings when she's out there leaving sweet comments on my friend's posts when she won't even return my texts.\n\nShe also seems really hesitant for just the two of us to hang out and doesn't seem to want to hang out in group things with me. I'm not even sure if she's trying to do this, but I'm curious if it'd be more beneficial to me if I just ended the friendship. I don't want to do that unless I really have to, as my current friendship with her is just slightly tense but mostly quiet. \n\nPlease remember that we're middle schoolers and that my friend isn't necessarily a bad person, so it wouldn't help to post insults about her in the comments. I posted this asking for advice on my current friend situation. ",

      "description": "So I recently posted about my co-intern, who I had a disagreement with. Needless to say, we left it unresolved. I haven't spoken to him or seen him since (except about 3 days ago when I walked into the building and he was sitting in his car). \n\nI had suspected my co-intern of messing with the software on the station/server I was using for the past month. I have confirmed today through the software support line that indeed, the software can only act up if another person logs in. There being only 3 interns (including me), and the other person is my good friend, the only logical person is the other intern who hates me. \n\nSo to explain: AL (good friend), Y (intern who hates me). AL and I have issues with our software. She'll have it first some days because she'll change stations after Y leaves the office. I come in right after Y leaves by a few minutes. I'll log into whatever server is free. On days that she changes out, she has issues first, but it will immediately happen to me next. On days that she doesn't, it happens to me only. I figured out that when you log into the software when someone else is on, you can see the preparer's name (I work with tax software) at the bottom of the software page. This is the part that gets me: Y never has issues with his software and AL never has issues when she working with him. (Everyone knows everyone else's schedule. If AL isn't working with me, she's working with him).\n\nNeedless to say, this makes me inefficient at work and slows me down when I could be done with a tax return 20 minutes earlier. \n\nIt honestly pisses me off and since I have confirmed it 100% (I don't want to accuse anyone unless I know 100%), I want to talk to my boss because now it's not just personal. It's affecting my work. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told my boss about this issue? ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years, and ever since I went to college the relationship has begun to fall apart. It was really hard at first and I could tell that she was having just as hard of a time as I was. We would both do our best to drive up to see each other, and we would often take turns every other week. However a few months later she made a new friend and ever since then she stopped making an effort to see me, and I could definitely tell I was becoming less of a priority to her. \n\nShe started hanging out with her every single weekend and never decided to come see me. \nHer excuse was that she doesn’t have enough money for gas to come see me, yet it’s only a 30 minute difference of a drive from her friend’s house. We eventually went on vacation during winter break, and we definitely had a lot of fun. But during the night and sometimes during the day she would barely give me any attention and would only talk to her friend over text. I even noticed that she was way more excited in her texting with her than she ever was with me. \n\nA month later she finally decided to come see me. I was super excited and I finally thought she was still into me. But as soon as she came up she went to my bed and slept the rest of the night and didn’t spend a single second with me. Over my 2 years she would never stay up late with me, but I found out she would often stay up until 2 AM with her friend. \n\nJust last week her grandfather passed away, and I was doing my best to comfort her over text until I was able to come up for break and do a better job of comforting her in person. Apparently I wasn’t doing a very good job of comforting her though. We didn’t hang out that Friday because she said she would be too sad, but she promised to see me on Saturday for as much time as she could before she had to go to work. \n\nI woke up on Saturday finally excited to see my girlfriend after 2 months, and I find out she went to breakfast with her friend without telling me instead. I immediately felt horrible and I really felt that I wasn’t a priority anymore. She didn’t get back until 2 and decided to invite me just 3 hours before she had to go to work, meaning I would only get 2 hours to see her. For me, this was the breaking point and I decided to break up with her. An hour after I did this she said she had to see her friend in order to be comforted, and she told me it was ridiculous to break up with her over sometime like this, especially due to the timing of her grandfather’s death.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nMy current work situation is a bit complicated, but I'll simplify it the best I can. I am a full-time employee of Company A. Organization B is contacting me from A. B is using me to fulfill their contact with Organization C. Essentially, I do work for C. C is paying B, B is paying A, and A writes me a paycheck. C pays B through a blanket contract. B pays for me more directly.\n\nAround August someone from C reached to interview me for a position in a different group within the organization. I interviewed and was told that it could be a few months before they got their ducks in a row. December I got the official offer and began the onboarding process. This process stalled due to external factors. It will be a few weeks at least until I have my start date. But I have met the team and done all I needed in order to start. This is happening, it's just a matter of when.\n\nSince December, I've been asked directly on multiple occasions if I'm happy in my position and plan on staying for the foreseeable future. A asked if I thought B would try to poach me because they've had issues with that and want to be proactive about keeping me. Meanwhile B is allocating funds for their option year with A and wanted to make sure I was staying before putting funds into the contact to cover my salary. C is also planning a lot of long term projects around me. But I understand that's just the nature of leaving a position and that there's nothing to do about that.\n\nEvery time I've been asked, I have told people I am happy in my position, I don't plan on moving from my current city, and that I will let them know when my employment plans change. All of this is technically true. However, I can't help but feel like the asshole here. Especially when it comes to B who is being very direct and has money involved.\n\nSo who's the asshole? Them for asking, me for lying, or is it just a bad situation all around?\n\nTL;DR My employers don't know I'm in the final steps of onboarding a new job. I keep getting asked if I'm leaving so they can put money into my contract. I tell them I'm not leaving when I know I am. It's getting to the point where I have to tell them before I have my start date or let them put money into a contact I know I'm abandoning.",

      "description": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI currently work for a relative of mine in the hospitality industry and so far my experience here has been pretty bad...mostly cause the relative is a bit of a hardass and this is not my area of expertise at all. I'm trying to find a different job behind my relative's back but it's hard finding someone to cover my shift considering the other employee who helped me quit because of how my relative treats her employees. Since the only other person who has had experience working in my position is my cousin, I asked her to cover my shift while I go to meet a potential employer (and honestly I need a bit of a break since my only day off is on Mondays). She agreed to cover me so when I asked my relative to get off work early, I informed her my cousin would be coming in for me. My relative then proceeded to ask who was suppose to pay her. In my past job experiences, I have NEVER had to pay an employee out of my own pocket to cover me. I'm not sure if it's normal for people here or if it's because I work a \"manager\" position but I did not expect I would have to pay for her shift. It could honestly be because the business is not making a lot of money right now so my relative can't afford to pay her...I'm getting desperate in finding a job cause of my work situation so I'm willing to pay her just if it gives me an opportunity to get out of here permanently. But part of me thinks it's not really my responsibility to pay her...I personally think my relative should pay her since she owns the business. Would I be the asshole if I ended up not paying my cousin to cover my shift? Am I in the wrong to think my relative should be paying her instead?",

      "description": "So my friend comes over a few times a week to smoke weed and watch cartoons. I often make food and we sometimes hookup. Recently we’ve been discussing taking our relationship to the next level but we decided it’s a conversation to best have in person. He was supposed to come over yesterday but got a sudden job interview and had to cancel. He could’ve came over after the interview but he turned his phone off and forgot? Well I dismissed it because jobs are important and he could’ve just came over today. (Side note this is last day he can come see me as my dad is getting surgery and will be at home with me for the next month) I told him to set an alarm so he can come over early and we can spend the day together before my dad gets off work at 2. Well he slept through the alarm and when he finally did wake up he said he wanted to go do his taxes before he came over. I got upset saying we don’t have a lot of time and taxes aren’t even due until April, he can do them literally tomorrow. He started calling me a child saying I don’t understand responsibility and that you do what you need to do first before you chill with someone. I got upset saying he doesn’t even need to do his taxes today and he’s wasting valuable time and got so frustrated I said fuck it I don’t even want you to come over anymore I’ll see you in a month (since for some reason I’m not allowed to go over his house) he than went on a huge rant calling me a irresponsible child, and brought up my father’s abuse saying I deserved it and I don’t do anything and I don’t understand what it’s like to be an adult. (I’m 20 years old, have a job, take care of all the cleaning and shopping for my house, take care of two dogs and three cats, including feeding and cleaning their litter) I got so furious I told him I never want to see him again and blocked him on every form of social media. Two hours later he starts spam calling me from an unknown number and when I finally answer he yells at me saying I’m acting like a child and he would’ve been over by now. He knows my dads abuse and calling me a irresponsible child are super hot buttons for me, and that I suffer really bad depression and suicidal ideation that are linked to my dad belittling me by calling me a child and than verbally abusing me (used to be physical but that’s another story) I really feel like he shouldn’t have said those things to me and if he actually cared about me he would’ve just came straight over and worried about the taxes tomorrow. Or am I the asshole for getting upset?",

So he just completely ignored my question? thats not what got to me upset, its the fact that hes asked me for favor before 3 times infact if were gonna count and i atleast replyed cause i felt i owed him that much and itd be rude not to. 2 out of 3 times i helped him it just upsets me the fact that the one time i reach out for help i couldn't even get a response. I ended up walking 20 mins to work while i was sick throwing up (thankgod i didn't throw up there or on my way home) in like 5-6 inches of snow. I feel like i was entitled to atleast a response but maybe not, maybe i was overreacting shouldn't have gotten mad cause he genuinely doesn't owe me anything? \n\nSo Am i the Asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to sleep on my wife’s side of the bed?",
      "description": "I rewrote this post entirely because many things were unclear.  \n \n\nTL;DR My wife and I have a good marriage (4 years). I sleep on the left side of the bed, and my wife sleeps on the right side. I feel like I need variety in my sleeping arrangements to sleep comfortably, and so I have asked to switch sides of the bed every few months. My wife doesn’t want to switch.  \n \n\nGrowing up, (8-18 years old) I shared a bunk bed with my brother. We both wanted the bottom bunk because it was better, so we would compromise by swapping off every 6 months. In college, I would frequently change whether I slept at the head or the foot of the bed, and sometimes I would even sleep on the floor. When I moved into an apartment (in college still) I sometimes slept on the communal couches. In the summers, I would sleep on roof of the building (and once on the sidewalk) despite my summer allergies. All of my life pre-marriage I have been changing my sleep arrangements and now it is ingrained into me.  \n \n\nOn the other hand, my wife feels like she needs consistency. She feels like she needs some things to be hers, and one of those things is her side of the bed. She feels like switching sides violates that need.  \n \n\nIn our first year of marriage I slept on the left side. Then we moved residences and I was able to switch to the right side of the bed. We switched without talking about it - I wanted the right side and my wife didn't care (because we just moved). Then after another year we moved to our current location and I again switched. Both times, I don’t think she even noticed.  \n \n\nNow we've been living in the same residence for 2 years and I'm getting antsy. I've been sleeping on the left side this whole time and I still am. After the first year of living in our newest residence, I started (once every two months) asking if we can switch sides of the bed. In response, she asks to keep her side of the bed. She has tried to compromise by switching for one night, but it's only one night and we only did it twice. She tried to compromise by sleeping in the living room with me, but it was also only once. We have a guest bedroom and we have slept in it 6 times in our 2 years living here, but we can't do it anymore because we have a friend renting out our guest bedroom.  \n \n\nAs for some solutions:   \n \\-I just spoke with my wife and she does not want to rearrange the room  \n \\-My wife said that it was \"fun\" to sleep in the living room, but that we'll never do it again. She doesn't want me to sleep on the floor, on a couch, on an air mattress, or anywhere that isn't the bed. 1. She says it's weird to sleep anywhere other than the bed and 2. She can't sleep well without me  \n \\-I cannot sleep upside down because I have GERD at night, so my bed must be at an incline\n\n What I ideally want is to switch every 6 months, but I'm open to different time frames or ideas\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Okay I have this friend I'm going to call Jess.\n\nJess and a friend who is basically like a sister to me started dating. \n\nI was kind of scared because last year she had talked crap about us to a friend, but that friend later told us what she done. We talked crap about her aswell and started to ignore her because we didn't want it deal with her.\n\nWe started to forgive her, until I started to hate her. My sister like friend began to tell me how her girlfriend Jess started to ignore her, I kept telling her to confront her about it.\n\n\"She started the relationship, so she gets to end it\" I then talked about it to the friend who told me that Jess talked crap about us.\n\nApparently she still does talk crap about us, and had started to ignore her girlfriend on purpose because \"she doesn't like the way she treats me and another friend\". I began stating how childish that is.\n\nThen I was told that her dad hates us, this is because we made her sad. We made her sad because of a conversation we had in a hallway.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't really like childish people, and I think the music teacher hates you for what you did last year\". Me and her girlfriend being childish people felt extremely hurt.\n\nAnd the \"music teacher hates us\" part was because we stopped helping making play decorations. We started to find it boring and I felt like I was holding the group down, so I made up excuses not to go.\n\nJess also states in the hallway \"(Friend who told us she talks crap about us) is fine, he has a reason, but you guys just kind of ditched us\".\n\nWe then told her how we felt about that situation in the hallway. Her father hates us now. The friend who told us she talked crap about us had apperently been told not to trust us by her because we would ditch him in the end.\n\nI want to confront her, but I can't help but feel guilty in someway.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "On mobile yada yada...\n\nMy husband and I have been together basically our whole lives. All our firsts were with each other. He’s super affectionate, I’m not as much so, big difference in how love was shown by our parents. \n\nNear the beginning of our relationship we toyed with the idea of MFM threesomes. We had 2-3 encounters which went well, we would use that as fuel for dirty talk. However we didn’t indulge again. \n\nFast forward a few years later and he was having a full blown affair, when I found out he left and we separated. A few years after separation, he told me the only way to win him back was to be a hotwife more often as I had become so boring and cold that I pushed him away. I could either continue to watch him from afar with the (affair) girlfriend or try to make him happy and have him come home (we have kids). I made my bed and chose to please him, become a better wife and a better hotwife than his girlfriend. (The girlfriend found out about his fetish and ran with it.)\n\nNow a few years later, I’ve indulged his fetish. I feel like it’s his now since it’s become boring for me and it’s so hard finding guys that make the cut. Sex with him and I is fucking awesome but he’ll only be in the mood if dirty talk during the act is about me hotwifing. \n\n\nSo on to the judgment: \nAm I the asshole for breaking my promise of indulging his kink? \nAm I the asshole for thinking that a marriage and kids is more important than a kink?
