      "title": "AITA because I think my roommate owes my friend an apology?",
      "description": "I had some friends over and we were having some wine. My roommate was holed up in her room as usual. She came out and asked us to keep it down, which was fine! One of my friends asked her to join us. She said she doesn't drink. We were all pretty tipsy at this point and kind of teasing her, inviting her to have a drink. She screamed that she was an alcoholic. My good friend blurted out, \"how can you be an alcoholic if you don't drink?\" And my roommate said: I don't know, how can you be a man if you have a vagina? My friend is trans. Everyone was stunned and she stomped off back to her room. It kind of harshed our whole vibe and my friends left not long after. \n\nI absolutely think she should apologize for what she said. Everyone agrees with me except her. She said my friend shouldn't have disrespected her in her own house and because *I* did not shut it down, as she felt it was my duty to check my guests, she said what she did. We've been arguing about it and she refuses to budge on her stance which basically comes down to \"you receive the energy you give\", which is a fucked up bastardization of \"treat others how you want to be treated\" her philosophy is she treats others how they treat *her*, or how she perceives they've treated her, in this case. Still, I don't think it's okay, I don't think lightly ribbing someone gives her an excuse to be transphobic in return. I told her she needs to apologize and she says the whole situation was *my* fault for not controlling my guests better and it would have never escalated to that point if *I* had stepped in. \n\nSo, I ask you, AITA?",

      "description": "Coming up with a good title for this one was hard tbh. Apologies for poor grammar\nA friend of mine has a Nintendo Switch with an ahegao face skin on it (if you don't know what that is, look it up) and he brings it into school (high school) all the time and plays on it constantly where everyone can see. I frankly find it disgusting and upsetting to see everywhere I go and this specific friend already has a reputation for being a creep. I tell him, often, that I find it upsetting and creepy (maybe not in the nicest way possible). My boyfriend pulled me aside the other day and asked me to stop mentioning it because it's hurting the friends feelings and getting personal. I said that I would stop making a particular joke about it (he would play with the joycons and I'd ask him to wash his hands) but that I wouldn't stop mentioning it until I had to stop looking at it. My boyfriend says I could just ignore it because my mentioning of it irritates him, but I feel like in this situation, my friend's want to display his skin is more important than my comfort. He says I've made my point several times and nothing has come of it and he's tired of hearing about it. I said I was tired of seeing it. I am not the only person at our school who finds it uncomfortable either. I'm just the only person who's mentioned it.\n\nAITA? I really do feel disgusted when I see the skin in such a public setting. It's not that I'm prudish, I just think there's a time and place for everything and school isn't the place for that. ",

      "description": "So this argument between me and my friend F. actually happened a little over a week ago but I had no idea this sub existed until today. To understand the issue we had you need to know that I'm technically considered disabled, both due to various chronic illnesses as well as due to being blind on one eye and visually impaired on the other. I am not however mobility impaired. The visual impairment disqualifies me from driving any vehicles so one of my friends usually drives me when I have to go to the city for some reason, in this instance for a new pair of shoes as the soles started to separate on my current pair. F. had to go to the city to run errands anyway and invited me to come along, which I was very thankful for. \n\nWhen we arrived in the city there were a lot of people and the parking spots near the shoe store were all taken except for one disabled parking spot. The next open parking spot was two blocks away. F. thought that we should park on the spot reserved for disabled people because, after all, I *am* disabled. I on the other hand was very insistent that we park the two blocks away and just walk to the shoe store since, while I am disabled I am not in fact mobility impaired and think the special parking spots should be reserved for people who need the additional space for their mobility aids. Not only that, I also felt uncomfortable because I thought people would stare at and judge me because you'd have to look very very closely to notice that there's something wrong with me. I do not look disabled. We had a short argument in the car, she said I was narrow-minded and ornery, I responded that I couldn't morally take up a parking spot that wasn't meant for me and didn't want to be shamed by people... Long story short, we parked 2 blocks away and walked. \n\nNow it's not like that made a dent in our friendship or anything, as soon as we left the car we both moved on but she was jokingly pestering me about it this morning and I just want to know whether I'm the asshole in the situation for making us walk 2 blocks because I was afraid of people judging me or if I was justified in asking her to park somewhere else. My friend knows how thankful I am for her help as I tell her so often, and neither of us had or have any ill feelings towards each other about the argument. It was more of a friendly squabble anyway, we're not the type to actually fight or make a big deal out of stuff like that. I just want to know if I should apologize to her and behave differently next time.",

      "description": "This has been on my conscience ever since I feel really bad. This happened a few weeks ago and I need some opinions. I don’t want anyone close to actually know so that is why I am posting this here.\n\nBackstory: My friend and I have been like best friends ever since middle school and I have seen his house and the conditions he lives in.  He is not living in a bad condition, but (I don’t feel comfortable saying this) lets say he is unfortunate (I don’t want to go into detail).\n\nOk so this is where it starts:  \n\nThere are these sophomores on the bus where my friend and I used to ride (until he got kicked off). We are freshmen. They were always up to no good (from what I have seen), but never really did anything in sight of the driver. Anyways, so they bring a cigarette and/or vape one day and use it secretly. Me being traumatized by my parents over the years that drugs are bad for you, I tell my friend that we should probably move up front. He insists that it is ok and that I should not be a “wuss.” I accept it, and just try to ignore them. I notice when they are vaping/smoking that they keep in the smoke in and just leave it be. My friend keeps on being obvious at staring at them, and they offer to him to try to vape. I’m thinking “he is obviously going to say no” but was I wrong. He tries it, and I feel infuriated.  I move down one seat (the juniors were in front of us) and stay there and ignore them all. When we get to school,  I let everyone get off (including them without being obvious by pretending to get something out of my backpack). I make no eye contact with my friend and he just passes by. I don’t know what else he did, but thats all I saw. Then, I talk to the bus driver to tell him what happened, and he asks for names. I tell him the names of the 3 juniors that were mainly involved, and with little hesitation, I tell him my friends name.\n\nFast forward to lunch the next day (he was not on the bus), I find out (by him telling me) that he has been kicked off the bus. He was called to the front office and they called his mom the day before. His mom is at work and no one can pick him up, and I start to feel really guilty. She is practically forced to come for her son while she is working. He is obviously really down when he tells me this (at lunch the next day) and the more I think about it, the more I feel guilty and hurt. I see him being brought to school by her mom while I know she should be at work since really early in the morning. She works really hard and it just hurts me the more I think about it. \n\nSorry if this makes little sense. I’ll take any criticism.\nShould I have approached the situation differently? Like talked to him about it? He obviously needs the bus to get to school and home. BTW I don’t know how he does not suspect me but I guess he believes I would never.\n",

      "description": "There's a kid (Edward) who sits next to me and brings salad to class every single day in a plastic container. And everyday, he takes a little packet of the ranch, drizzles it on top, closes the lid, and ... begins shaking. Edward goes to town on that salad like it's a maraca and it's LOUD. He won't stop for at least 10 minutes, and I've timed it (with occasional brakes that only makes it that much more annoying when he starts again). And to top it all off, he starts cronching on that salad for the rest of period when we have lunch the very next period. It's the shaking that gets to me more than the crunching though. \n\nI've asked him to stop. I've asked him to just drizzle it over like a normal human being. I've asked him to mix it in the container with a fork like a slightly less normal human being. But he won't and he claims \"it tastes better this way.\"\n\nA week ago, I was extra pissed since I failed my stat test the period before, so when Edward began his ritual again, I kinda lost it. I picked up my water bottle and started vigorously jacking it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdward paused for a moment, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nMe: \"Shaking my water bottle.\" \\*shake shake\\*\n\nEdward: \"Stop it.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\" \\*shake shake\\*\n\nEdward: \"Stop it! You're mocking me.\"\n\nMe: \"What? No, it tastes better this way.\" \\*shake shake\\*\n\nEdward: \"You're an asshole.\"\n\nMe: \\*shake shake\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery since then I've begun shaking my water bottle whenever he shakes his salad. He gets pissed and calls me a dick, but he's stopped shaking his salad the last few days. Mission was a success, but do my methods make me an asshole?\n\nNote: Our teacher won't let us change seats because I need a better reason than, \"we don't get along.\"",

      "description": "Okay so my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year and a couple days ago she asked me if she could marry someone else. Naturally  I needed more context because though we have our issues (see my r/relationships post for more info) we are in a good place right now. \n\nNow for the context. Her friend's relative is in danger of being deported to Venezuela and pretty much his only option to stay in the United States is for him to get married. So her friend asked her if she would be okay with him marrying her long enough to obtain citizenship. However she does not want to take a break from our relationship to do so, she is willing to continue to date me while being married to him.\n\nWhen I told her that I don't want to become a mistress in a relationship that I have been in for almost a year, she claimed that though we would still be dating, she would just be married to him and learning enough about him to prove the marriage is legitimate and keep him here. She says that everything would be fine between the two of us but I am still not comfortable with the idea. \n\nI should also mention that I have not met the friend or her relative so I cannot say if he is a good person. And my GF has been friends with her since high school (we're sophomores in college). She has not met the relative in danger of being deported.\n\nSo AITA? I don't think I am but the more she brings it up, maybe I'm just being selfish and should just put my feelings aside.",

      "description": "So basically, my dad likes to scare us/ startle us and one day he woke me up from a nap by slamming pots and pans together over my head. He's a strong person, and it was excruciatingly loud. Ofc I woke up and took out the trash (he woke me up cause i needed to roll out the bins). Later in the day i noticed my ears were ringing. Then, as I lay awake in my bed trying to sleep; I heard this drilling noise. I realized it was coming from my fan. So I turned off my fan and that was that. The next day, my fan sounded like a siren; the pitch dropping and going back up; endlessly. It was really scary. The more I thought about the sirens, the more it appeared in everyday noises. The wind sounded like a siren. Our fan did. The bathroom fan. I asked him to go to the doctor but he refused the first few times. Eventually, I was convinced I had some form of schizophrenia and confided in my parents. His first reaction was laughing; but then he realized i was serious and gave me some advice/ told me i shouldn't go to doctor because I would be labeled.  Anyhow; I kept researching and found something called *Diplacusis* that made sense; and you can treat it with a special type of sound: Pink Noise. After I listened to the Pink Noise, I took off my headphones and my ears were normal again. It was great. I need to listen to it every few days; but for the most part I'm better. Anyhow, AITA for still being mad at him for not helping me through it? He thinks it was a joke and I'm taking it way to seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he's a pretty good dad, despite all this, I just wish he had some remorse.",

      "description": "First post, also on mobile. LONG POST.\n\nSo she gets us to babysit her cat for 2 weeks.\n\nWe told her that she'd have to deflea and deworm him b4 he came over, all of her animals have fleas because she usually had barn animals in her apt, she told us that she did and so kitten comes over to stay with me.\n\n2 weeks turns into 3, then a month and then 2 months l8r and my apt is in the middle of the fleapocalypse, I'm spraying carpets, bathing cats, washing everything and I think my cat is going crazy so I take her to the vet to check for feline sensitivity and I find out that she's not crazy she just has EXTREMELY BAD FLEAS PLUS WORMS AND AN ALLERGY. My fam has 5 cats, so this kitten has infested my house with fleas when he had supposedly been DEFLEAD AND DEWORMED. So I had to fork up the $625 to get the topical deflea and topical dewormer for 5 cats.\n\nThis lady didn't abide by our agreement, my cats did not have fleas or worms prior to her kitten arriving in my apt, so I sent her the bill explaining everything and why she's being charged for it.\n\nAs expected she flips out talking about her anxiety and how much stress its causing her and that she doesn't deserve it and I'm just like okay look you can't rub some rosemary on your cat and rinse him off that's not how parasites work.\n\nShe goes on about how I should've told her b4 and how it's unfair and im like it's my cat I don't have to tell you when I'm taking her to the vet as she's not yours. I trusted you and u f*cked that up so now u get the bill. Next day she comes to get her kitten which I also bought meds for, he is looking healthier since staying with us.\n\nShe agreed to pay it but that she'd need time to come up with the money which I said ok that's fine. About a week passes without hearing from her when she texts me saying \"I've talked to every1 ik and they all agree with me tht since u didn't give me a heads up on taking ur animal to the vet that I should only have to pay $320 bc I price matched the meds u got and I could've got it for that price.\"\n\nI didn't want to deal with her, ik tht she sues ppl when she doesn't get her way. So I just told her yeah that's fine, it's about half of the amount so whatever. She says awesome and that she gets paid twice later that week so it shouldn't be a problem. \n\nCut to now and she still hasn't paid us back. She's called when she knows I'm asleep asking to hang out, she stopped by my sisters work to try and get free water for her car, and i think I might have to let my husband handle this which I dont want to do bc he is a petty person and will get police, law suits, the whole nine yards involved.\n\nI'm currently pregnant, a disabled veteran, current national guard member, and I lost my job in December so money is tight right now. I understand it's difficult to pull money out of the sky but I've given her plenty of time.\n\nWIBTA if I just let my husband handle this and AITA for expecting her to pay at least half?",

      "description": "This happened yesterday.\n\nI went out clubbing with my usual group, and Friend A decided to bring a girl along, and specifically asked me if Friend B was present, who is known for snatching (taken) girls away.\n\nI say no, she's his to pursue, we won't interfere.\n\nDuring the evening I learn from him that he tried his luck with that girl 2 times already, and she rejected him both times.\n\nAfter carefully asking the girl what the deal between them is, she told me he's 'just a friend', while rolling her eyes, then later told me she's not interested in him romantically.\n\nI notice that friend A doesn't make any moves whatsoever, so I tell him that he should get to it if wants to make something happen, and ask him if he's sure that we really shouldn't interfere. He says no, we should keep off her.\n\nThe girl starts showing clear signs of interest in me, and before I did anything serious, I wanted to ask him again. He (now pretty drunk) tells me he doesn't care anymore, do whatever.\n\nAlrighty then, I isolated her, and in order to not be a douche only made moves when I moved her and me out of his sight, etc.\n\nObviously he knew what was going on, but didn't say anything.\n\nI took the girl home with me, which he also definitely saw, we walked to the cabs together.\n\nHe still gave me a brotherly goodbye, made plans for next weekend and didn't mention it today, but I could tell he was hurt by it.\n\nReally not sure here. IMO it's fair game if the guy doesn't make *any* moves whatsoever, and the girl is clearly not romantically interested in him (she even told him that very evening, in a very polite way), but on the other hand bro code is bro code...\n\nVery curious to hear your stance on this!",

      "description": "I will preface this by saying I am upset and on mobile so I am sorry for the grammar/formatting issues.\n\nSo let's start at the beginning, when I (24f) was younger (around 7 or 8 I believe) my mother married my stepdad and I went from an only child to having 2 older (step)brothers. One of them is 4 years older than me, the other is 8. Soon after we got all moved in and settled the eldest's, we will call him Bob's, attitude towards me changed, he went from a protective, fun, new big brother to very short tempered and downright mean. Soon the \"mean-ness\" got worse and eventually became physical....in every sense of the word. Long story short mom and I eventually left and things got much better.\n  Fast forward to last year. My mom had since  remarried and was trying to leave her current asshole of a husband, so I moved her in with me and helped her get an apartment of her own. She was very down and depressed and reconnected with her previous husband. (note: I had no issues with my step dad at all, only his children ) They hang out sometimes and talk and all is good on that front....now we get to the messy current situation.\n  So I live in the Midwest US and it's still pretty dang cold out. Well earlier today while talking to my mom she mentioned how Bob and his wife were asking about homeless shelters in our area because he had already gotten frostbite last week and wanted somewhere warm to stay.(I feel I should add they are homeless by their own stupid meth fueled choices) Well I gave her the info I knew about local places to get some help, she thanked me, and that seemed to be the end of the conversation. Then I get a phone call about a hour ago from my mom asking for some advice, she wants to let them stay with her for a night or two, or get this, SHE WANTS THEM TO STAY IN MY APARTMENT!!!!! My mom, myself, and my boyfriend all have apartments on the same floor of the same building so I spend a lot of time across the hall at my boyfriend's apartment.\n  I flat out said no, no way, hell no, nein, non, NO. I told her if they show up I will call the police and have them removed from property. Now she is acting like I am some kind of heartless garbage person because I won't open my home to a person who not only physically,mentally, and sexually abused me as a child, but who has been arrested and convicted of drug charges multiple time and freely admits to using. \n  So am I really being the asshole here for not wanting them anywhere near me or my family?

      "description": "Merry Christmas Everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I am writing this to validate my predicument for calling, and continuing to call, the police on my noisy neighbors. A little background, we both live in homes separated by a street, so there is roughly 50-70 feet between our homes. The neighbor in question has a really good base system in their home, which is the problem. When they crank their music up, I can hear it very clearly. So clearly that it is louder than my TV, My Dishwasher, and washing machine; the majority of the time, it can be heard over all three combined. They play this music randomly all throughout the day, sometimes in the morning(7am+), the afternoon, the evening (5-8PM), and late at night (11PM+). I've tried noise cancelling headphones, ear buds (32db noise reduction), and even my gun range headphones, but nothing drownes the noise out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got fed up with listening to their music in October 2018, so I walked over to tell them to turn it down. The nighbor answred the door and told me to get bent. Frustrated, I walked back to the house and let it slide. It happened again twice more, where the music was too loud and I walked over to tell them to turn it down, only the second and third time, I was greated by a different person who seemed nicer and was willing to comply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, I am not willign to walk over there everyday to tell them to keep the noise down, so I finally got the police involved when the incident happened on the 4th time. I ended up having to call the police 3 more times for them to have a car in the area while the music was playing. the music then stopped for 2 weeks, but it has returned yet again (surprise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are no \"pieceful times\" in my county, I can technically call the police and submit a noise complaint at any time, which I plan to do (when it is too loud). Am I being a dick for resorting to this extreme measure to have piece and quiet, given the volume of the music and the space that separates our homes? Also, after so many complaints, the police will start issuing $1,000.00 fines. ",

      "description": "A few weeks ago my group of friends rented a cabin for a vacation trip during winter break. 4 different couples were going plus a few single people. Most of us were coming from different cities as we were all home for break, so like 4 different cars all met there at different times. \n\nMy girlfriend and I drove by ourselves, plan was to all get there at 1 then go grocery shopping. Pretty much everyone else is running late and we're stuck locked outside with one other couple for maybe an hour and a half. No big deal, we drive into town and get some food. While we're eating our friends start talking in the trip group chat we made, one of the girls (coming with her bf) had been sleeping on a couch the last week and asks if itd be ok if she can have one of the beds. Totally reasonable, no issues. Then another girl (also coming with her bf) sends a screenshot of one of the beds from the airbnb saying \"(bf) and I call this one\" followed by another screenshot of another bed saying \"(first girl) told me she wants this one\". My girlfriend and I are reading it laughing like, seriously? We're calling beds? Someone in the chat says something along the lines of can we just figure it out when we get there but conversation shifts to getting groceries and things and it gets dropped from there. \n\nSo my gf and I are slightly annoyed. We had already talked about being fine sleeping on couches if we had to, that where we slept was not a big deal, but calling dibs 2 hours ahead of time just seems childish. We go back to the cabin and are able to go inside this time since its past our check in time and check out the place. Of course the 2 beds our friends have called are the only 2 private rooms, the rest of the beds and couches are in open living rooms so you'll be \"sharing\" the room. \n\nSo one couple who called a room shows up next and is unloading. After a couple minutes I make a comment about them knowing the layout of the place and calling the private room when no one else even knew what it looked like (they had booked it on airbnb). Admittedly saying anything here made me an asshole, and I should have just let it all slide rather than make it into a big deal. Slightly blows up with them saying that they did the work renting it and so shouldn't they get to choose the room? Thats fair and I'm fine with them having it I'm just annoyed we had to play the dibs game with it instead of just figuring it out when we got there. \n\nAfter talking I totally made it sound like I thought my gf and i deserved the room cause we were there first, which is not at all what I actually felt but I let it die to avoid starting it again. So I understand that I came off as an asshole, but am I the asshole for being annoyed at them calling rooms? \n\nTLDR: group trip to a cabin and 2 hours before people arrive couple friends send screenshots of the specific bed in the cabin they \"call\". The 2 that are called are the private bedrooms and the rest are in shared rooms. ",

      "description": "So about a month ago my high school had to close down one of the male restrooms because they kept catching students (mostly freshmen) vaping in that specific bathroom. So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works. [Reupload because I'm new to reddit and forgot a proper title]",

      "description": "Lindsey and I have been best friends for a decade. She's a lovely girl inside and out, and unfortunately has some self-esteem issues due to an emotionally abusive mother. \n\nThroughout our friendship, Lindsey's weight has consistently yo-yo'd. She would go on diet and exercise kicks for a few months, lose 15-20 pounds, and then quickly gain it all back. Every time she did, her awful mother would rag on her. Lindsey would come to me for reassurance that she's not the obese failure her mom has told her she is, which almost always included her asking, \"You'd tell me if I reached that point, right?\" I reassured her that she was fine the way she was and that she could count on me to tell her if she ever reached that point. \n\nWell, that point has been reached, and I don't know what to do. On the one hand, her weight has reached a point where I am starting to get concerned for her health. On the other hand, I know her mother is still harping on her for it, and I worry that having her best friend agree with her mom will crush Lindsey. \n\nTL;DR: Best friend of 10 years always said to tell her if her weight got out of control. She has reached that point, but I'm afraid to tell her because her emotionally abusive mother has destroyed her self-esteem. WIBTA if I was honest with her?",

      "description": "In advance, sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile (also throwaway because friends know my account) \n\nSo first off here's some background information. I'm a high school student and around the last couple of weeks of December last year I came out to my parents as bisexual. They did not take it well to say the least and my mom spent 3 hours questioning me and asking how and why I was bi and insisting that it was a phase. The following week my dad wouldn't even talk to me and was extremely serious. My mom told me that I would not be receiving any Christmas present from them that year. During this time I felt miserable and seriously considered taking my life. They ended up giving in and gave me a Christmas present and things started getting better over time since we would all ignore the issue and not bring it up. \n\nFast forward to today, I'm in the car with my mom as she's driving me to school. We were listening to music when out of nowhere she asks me I still liked the girl that I had told her I liked when I came out to her (I'm a girl). I shook my head, not wanting to bring up this conversation. She kept insisting and asked \"So yes? Why are you ignoring me? \" I told her that I no longer did and she wouldn't take it for an answer. She once again asked and I raised my voice and told her again that I didn't and asked her to stop asking. She said she wasn't sure because it seemed like I was avoiding the question. I stayed quiet. She then proceeded to say \"So have you changed your mind about it then? \" in reference to me being bi. This was my breaking point and I raised my voice even more and angrily told her that I don't and won't ever want to discuss my personal life with her so she should stop asking. She said to me in the same tone that she was my mother and that there was no one better to talk about it with. I stayed quiet for the rest of the ride. When she dropped me off at school I got out and she said bye I love you as always but I got out of the car and ignored her and walked to class. \n\nA little later I texted to ask her something and there was an obvious distance. We usually say \"bye love you\" at the end of the conversation but we didn't this time. \n\nNow I keep thinking about how I reacted I can't help but think about me upsetting her and making her cry (she's told me in the past about how I make her cry when I raise my voice at her and disrespect her). Looking back I acted very childish and I feel like a total asshole. From my mom's perspective she was probably just trying to be involved in her child's life but I can't forgive her for \"changed your mind\" comment. I'm very conflicted right now and I think I might have been in the wrong here. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off one of my closest friends in college?",
      "description": "So some backstory. There are 5 friends in this friend group. We've been together for 6 months. We all love each other, and Me, Friend A, B, and C, who are all boys, 18. Then there is the Friend F, who is a female, also 18. Friend F comes from a traumatic background, as she had a five year-boyfriend who broke up with her a year before college resumed. She's bipolar and her dad was in a serious car accident about a week ago.\n\nShe came into our group because she liked friend B, but friend C also likes her and would do absolutely anything for her. She had sex with Friend B over winter break, and she got pregnant. She aborted the baby, as she was convinced by both Friend B (who said he'd support every decision she made) and her own conviction. Friend B and Friend F have been estranged ever since. Friend F is on good terms with me, most of the time anyways. Friend C has pretty much been kissing up to her ever since. Friend A and I are bystanders and usually watch the drama, but it has been a bit too much, and today I spoke up.\n\nThe day before yesterday was my birthday, and I spent a whole damn hour comforting her and attempting to help her talk to Friend B about her feelings, and when it came down to it, she hyperventilated and ran out. I asked a mutual friend who knew absolutely nothing about the situation about what we should do about Friend F, to which he replied, I should cut her off from the group. Armed with that and common sense, I texted in the group chat, without Friend B and Friend F, that we should totally cut Friend F from the group because of her toxicity, and that she can still talk to us but not the friend group as a whole. Friend C told her that he would continue talking to her, but he agreed that we should take her out. Friend A talked to me in person and echoed the same result. \n\nA few hours later, while I'm chilling with Friend B and A, Friend F comes to the door and tells me I'm a fake friend, and that I fucking hate her, which I don't. I fumble around trying to explain myself to her and she punches me in the chest and goes away. Friend C coddles her in his room, and shows her more of what I said in the group chat. At this point, I felt like I didn't have to explain myself to her, as I had laid out my issues with her then and there. She and Friend C, after a while, come to the room, and Friend F basically assaults me and nearly breaks my laptop. After crying for a few minutes, she tries to talk to me, and calls me a pussy for not being able to tell her in real life. As I try to explain to her that I wanted to sit her down and talk about it, she throws a shoe at me. Friend B, fed up, kicks her out of the room. \n\nDevelopments are still ongoing, but AITA for saying she should be kicked out.\n\ncxz ",

      "title": "AITA for not inviting a lifelong friend to my wedding?",
      "description": "Definitely a bit of backstory required here.\n\nAs I'm sure you can tell by the title, a lifelong friend of mine (we'll call him Jack), isn't being invited to my wedding. Jack has always been extremely nice to me, almost to a fault, but has made some really poor decisions over the last 3-5 years or so. This has in turn has lead up to an increasingly distant friendship between us.\n\nOne of the first reasons I was hesitant to invite him was due to his ongoing issues with another close friend of mine that will be at our wedding. We'll call him Steve. Without going into too much detail, Jack cannot stand Steve over some pretty juvenile and petty shit from years ago. Not that Steve was 100% in the right to begin with, but Jack has taken his \"hatred\" for Steve way too far. Threatening him, assaulting him, showing up at his house in the middle of the night, some REALLY crazy shit. On top of that, they have been in and out of legal proceedings because of it. Steve has tried to just let it go since he doesn't want to ruin Jack's life/future, but Jack continues to test his patience. The final straw was last time we had friends over to our house, Jack followed Steve outside and threatened to kill him, which caused a scene and ultimately tarnished what little rapport he had with my soon-to-be wife. This alone was enough to decide that inviting him to a wedding that they would both be attending was probably a bad idea, but unfortunately it does not stop there.\n\nI still talk to quite a few mutual friends that Jack and I have, and from what I have heard, he has recently became re-involved with cocaine. This includes selling it to friends and trying to talk his friends (and their spouses) into sneaking off to do it with him. Let me be clear, my fiancee and I do not do drugs in any capacity, so that is 100% off limits for us. I am definitely not trying to be DARE Officer Dan here, but there is a pretty obvious line between casually smoking weed and slamming rails of coke.\n\nAll of that being said, I still can't shake this feeling that I am being an asshole by not inviting him. I've known him my whole life and he has always gone out of his way to be a good friend to me. And I know that if I ever needed a place to stay or a shirt on my back, he'd be the first person to give me both. But on the biggest day of my life, surrounded by family and friends, I can't risk him getting drunk and emotional and hauling off on Steve, or taking bumps in the bathroom while a family member is trying to take a piss in the urinal next to him. Even if he was on best behavior, I feel like both me and my fiancee would have to have our heads on a swivel and be alert to what he was doing and where he was all night. And that doesn't seem like a very fair compromise for us on our wedding day.\n\nAITA here? I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat afraid of the fallout with him too, considering the drug abuse and his continually deteriorating mental state.",

      "description": "I stopped talking to him since September after a short outburst (basically me telling him how selfish he is) and I plan to not talk to him at all anymore.\n\nI cannot really process why I just got so fed up with him. He is just so fucking narcissistic to a fault. Even though he has work of his own it’s like his earning is not enough that he takes so much from my mother, to a point that I have to be urged by my mother to actually mediate between them. He would constantly tell us how we are too dependent of him when I don’t even get anything from him. \n\nI also hate how he would manipulate the situation to make things convenient for him. Example, he lost his key. He would borrow my mother’s card (that you need to present to enter get out of our place easier) even though we will go out too later, because his logic was my mother and I were going out together anyway BUT HE FUCKING KNOWS that you have to show the card individually to get out. So in the end my mother and I had to go the the farther gate to go out while he was able to get out of the shortcut easily. Another example is he would invite us to join him shop or something because if he invites us that means he would have someone to buy things for him (which is my mom) and he would have a companion before he meets his friends there. So once his friends are there already we are out of the picture real quick.\n\nAnother thing that made me really furious was he tried to make a birthday gift for our grandmother “shared” so that he won’t spend anything because he knows that I already have a gift for my grandmother. To think that he maxes out his cards all the time for leisure trips, I just can’t understand how he cannot give a few bucks to buy a gift to a relative. And if he doesn’t want to then why not don’t give anything at all?\n\nI also notice how he would make all conversations about himself. Every conversation in the house would just be him flexing about things he has done, whether he passed the language exam, his boss was so pleased at him, his photos were great,  his cooking is delicious, he’s going to a trip to wherever. He’s literally the personification of Instagram. I am not really the talkative type and I kinda understand if people would not talk about my interests (philo, psychology, math) but he does this to freaking everyone. He would just stop talking until he gets to be the main topic again. \n\nAnd recently he’s into losing weight, and he really did lose a lot of weight so he became even more proud of himself again. But as someone who has suffered from an eating disorder (Binging, purging, over exercising) I know what it looks like. But unlike me then he was very vocal, or at least he doesn’t know what’s coming out from his mouth anymore. He keeps on denying he tried his best to lose weight and he just did because of a trip, he would always make fun of my mom who is now fatter than him, he would always say things like “Eww carbs.”, “Yuck that’s so unhealthy”. And I don’t know if everyone else in the house is affected but I fucking am because I experienced worse than him. It really shattered my self-esteem (spec. since it was an after-effect from an abuse) and like I am just recently trying to build myself up. Now I don’t do fasting anymore, I eat when I am hungry and I am not beating myself up with too much exercise. But I don’t know, I am so conflicted because he did lose weight. So am I really doing the right thing? Because even though I already got into a normal weight I still have a lot to lose and taking it slow makes me feel like I have to catch up to them. Even my mother is kinda into dieting already. However I learned that doing so much restrictions can backfire on your body and I’ve experienced it too but my brother seems to not experience that even 2 months in and he’s still the narcissistic, likeable bitch that he is. So do I just have no willpower? Am I the wrong one here? I don’t know, it seems like he has his life sorted out anyway because of how great his life is. Maybe I am just jealous?\n\nHe was kinda trying to talk to me during Christmas, like when I asked my mom he would answer or basically just fit himself in the conversation but I was like “Bitch, not today” basically. So I just ignored him. Am I the asshole? My mother is telling me to reconcile with him already but I think it is much better to cut off communication because I don’t think anything fruitful would come out of our relationship anyway. From what I see we just have different ways of seeing life and it’s much better if we just don’t talk.\n\n\n",

      "description": "[Backstory from another thread to keep this focused, tl;dr near the bottom of linked post](https://np.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/a7ne4x/advice_just_found_out_that_my_mother_53_devoid_of/)\n\nI was originally going to try to anonymously inform the guy's wife and let it resolve on its own, but as time has gone on I've started to feel resentment towards my mother for putting me in a situation where I have to choose which parent's trust to violate. Plus on some level I feel like I need to stand up to my mother and support the man who has put up with her bullshit for the past twenty years.\n\nOn one hand I think informing him is the objectively right thing to do, in a void where my parents are identical mannequins and don't have a daughter, but of course that's not the fucking case. On the other hand my step-father has temper issues that might result in physical and/or verbal abuse to those around him, who would be my mother and possibly also my sister. I'm going to be out of town, spending Christmas with my partner's family, so there's also an element of potential assholery due to me making that phone call from a safe distance while my little sister has to deal with the fallout. It's really just the most unfortunate timing, and I'm not sure if it's worse to do this before or after Christmas. I might inform my brothers, who will be much closer, so that they can rescue my sister if need be.\n\nAlso sorry if this is completely the wrong subreddit for this kind of question. I'd appreciate suggestions for other places to ask, if any of you have any, aside from the one from the linked backstory.",

      "description": "Alright I live in a shared apartment with 3 other strangers. All the rooms are rented separately on different leases. That being said I am at the wit's end with one of my roommate's behavior. I won't go into full detail because we would literally be here all day but what I'm dealing with right now is she has moved two men into her room with her which is probably 8'x9' at best. Seemingly none of them work. All three of them are at the house 24/7, they seem to never sleep. Cooking, showering, going in and out of the house, milling about at all hours of the day and night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've come to the conclusion they have to be on and/or selling drugs as they have visitors in and out and only leave for periods of a few minutes at a time. Not to mention they do crazy shit like walk around the apartment nude, shit with the door open and naked, take multiple hours at a time in the bathroom running the water, wash and fry smelly ass shrimp at 5am on a Saturday morning. I'm fucking losing my mind. I have 3 months left on this lease and I don't know what to do anymore. I work a full time job and free lance gigs on the weekend nights so I'm gone a lot ans still their constant bullshit is driving me over the edge. All I can think to do is inform the landlord that she has moved in multiple people that aren't on the lease?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould that be totally shitty and I should just mind my business or  reasonable?

      "description": "I (17m) have been together with my SO (19f) for like 3 months right now. I'm having so much fun with her and love spending time together, but this week we've had one of our biggest arguments yet. I was telling her about my plans for the night: my friends and I were planning to go clubbing and they invited some girls that used to go to our school. My ex was one of these girls. We've broken up about 2 years ago but are still on good terms. No hard feelings from either one of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I told my gf about this and she lost it. She doesn't feel comfortable with me hanging around with exes and simply didn't want me to go. I was already out and didn't think much of it. The next day I just didn't feel good and decided to call her. She told me that she just doesn't want me to hang out with exes, no matter who's with us. I tried to explain to her that there's nothing to worry about and I would never do anything out of line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI completely understand that she's not 100% comfortable with me having drinks with only her, but with other people there? Come on, we've been broken up for more than 2 years and there's nothing between us now. I tried to be understanding but I just can't grasp it right now. I can't be with someone who feels comfortable dictating who I can('t) hang out with. Sure she can be uncomfortable and we can work through that, but she still insists that I never speak to my ex again.. Would I be the asshole for dumping her? It's not about this single situation in my opinion, I just don't feel comfortable with my girlfriend deciding these things.. I had a chat with my closest friends and they are evenly split about this and I really don't know what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I have a talk with my gf and tell her it's not her job to tell me who I can/cannot hang out with? If we can't see eye to eye on this, I'm not sure if our relationship would work. ",

Whatever, I have a busy weekend anyway I’ll watch it on tv like I usually do. \n\n1030 last night my sister calls me and asks where I’m watching the game.

I get off the phone and my wife says “your going to the game?” I told her yes excitedly and she immediately gives me shit. She says “wtf, your such a fucking asshole. We were supposed to do the bathroom”. I explained that they were birthday presents and that she should be happy for me. She then accused me of setting it up so she couldn’t go. The honest truth is I wanted to go with her and I was bummed out I couldn’t secure tickets for us to go but wtf. \n\nShe then told me she had a chance to go with her uncle but didn’t because she knew I wanted to go. I see right through this, she’s trying to manipulate me. \nI told her that all the hypothetical situations she’s throwing at me are irrelevant and as much as I would have liked her and I to go I have no control over what just happened. \n\nI refuse to let her guilt me and I’m going to the game although this argument is draining and has taken away from the experience of the game, almost to the point I say fuck it it’s not worth it.

Even though I didn't want to, I agreed so that I could play. They proceeded to either baby me throughout the game, or be condescending towards me wanting to learn the game partially on my own. We ended that game awhile ago, and since then, one of the other friends had stated in front of me to another, third party friend (who is not involved in the story other than this instance) that I didn't like the game because I wanted to learn on my own.\n\nI of course, contested this with the fact that he isn't me, and that I enjoyed the part where I was playing for myself, and he just stated that I was wrong. This became a negative experience for me, and I haven't played much since this instance, except for the most recent game.  \n\nAnyways, me and friend one are playing the game when friend two joins the chat. He wants us to leave our game and join his game, even though we're invested to the point of fighting the Societ Union. His argument is that it would be more fun with three  players. We respond how we are having fun with our current game, not being babied and how we dont want to restart, but how he's free to join us mid game. He complains about this for a bit, and after about 10 more minutes of him complaining on how rude we're being, and stating how he has done this so much in the past for friend one, he joins and plays with us for about an hour.\n\nThe next day, me and friend one are continuing the game when suddenly friend two and friend four (because friend three was earlier in the part where he accused me of disliking the game) join our chat. Friend two asks if we could leave our game so that they could play with us. I say no, and tell him that he and friend four could join our current game. This starts him and friend four on a rant about how it's rude how we don't include them, and ignore our possible compromise. They leave and I once again, think it'll just blow over.\n\nAbout 2 hours later, both me and my friend take a break from the game. I had some food to eat, and friend one had to do something. I go into a separate chat while I wait for him, so I can play a different game and not hear background noise. Both friend two and friend four join my call and ask, and I quote: \"Have you finally divorced friend one?\" I say how I'm just waiting for him to come back so we can keep playing, and they sit around saying how it's stupid how I wont include them.\n\nReddit, AITA for not including friends two and four in our HOI4 game?",

      "description": "Three primary people: P, C, N, and me (I'm a guy btw)\n\nMy (used to be) group was chatting with each other in a voice channel on discord and for almost the whole time one of my friends (she is P) was doing makeup. Left a little earlier than everyone else and when I came back the call ended and everyone transitioned to the group chat on Instagram. \n\nWe kept talking and later P posted a picture of herself done putting on makeup. No one reacted and that's when she said that she felt like she was getting attacked because no one said anything. At that point I started my comment (I talk in multiple small texts and not one big one sometimes) and in the middle of it, I rethought if I should say it and stopped. At that point everyone already saw it and 2 people encouraged me to continue (including P) and C told me to shut up, which I wanted to do. \n\nThey kept telling me to speak my mind until the person that said to shut up gave up (it went from 2 against 2 to 1 against 2). At that point I said that she was acting like a attention seeker (I did not call her a attention whore at that moment) or as many other people have said in the past (she has many enemies she did not ask for) an attention whore. At that point she started to use sarcasm (you can't really use sarcasm over a text bubble but in this case it was obvious) and how it was great to be called an attention whore again. I felt extremely bad for doing this and wanted to look to someone else I trusted for help. I talked to N.\n\nAfter talking about this to said person, N decided to confront P. N used the screenshots that I sent her to help her understand the situation and in the group chat, P said that there was a Snitch. I told N about this and asked that she doesn't mention me (I told her this before also). Sooner or later I get found out. I get asked to leave the chat, and I did without an argument.\n\n At this point I feel even more guilty and afraid something could possibly happen to me tomorrow at school (she is decently high on the popularity ladder) from the fact that I've heard rumors that P has ordered people to jump others but didn't want to believe them. I might ask a different subreddit what I should do. But here I'm asking, AITA?",

      "description": "My GF's brother is hard pressed at the moment, his car has broken down and needs to be sent to a shop to be repaired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have 3 cars at home, 2 of them being mine. (I don't really need 2 cars, the 2nd one is a manual I'm trying to learn and practice on.)\n\nWe agreed to let him borrow the manual car for 1 week, whilst he sorts out a temporary car for himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week goes by and he says that his insurance is wasting his time, hasn't sorted him a car and hasn't processed his request correctly. \n\nHe asks to borrow the car and use it for another week. Didn't really want to, but agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it reaches Sunday morning of the 2nd week, and I ask my GF to ask him when he was going to return it? \n\nHe says **\"1-2PM\"**. \n\n(Keep in mind, I am asking her to follow it up as I don't really talk to her brother much, and I'm really only doing this whole thing as a favour to her, not him)\n\nAnyway, 2PM goes by and my car isn't returned.\n\nI ask her where it is, she says **\"he's been busy and said he'll return it tonight\"**. Bit annoying, but ok, that's fine.\n\nAt around 8PM, Car's still nowhere to be found. \n\nI ask her to follow it up and txt him, she says **\"he's having dinner and will return it after\"**. Slightly irked at how late it is already, I just say **\"urgh, ok\"**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10PM goes by and my car isn't there still. I ask her nicely to call him and find out where it is. She ignores me and carries on watching her TV show. \n\n2 Mins later I go back into the room and asks if shes called him, she says **\"no,he said he'll return it soon\"**. Irritated, I ask her **\"do you see the time?! It's 10PM!**\" She just sits there and laughs and tells me to **\"chill out!\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis pushes me to the edge and I start raising my voice. I go off and ask her **\"why do I have to keep following up about my OWN CAR?!\"** . \n\nIs it not common courtesy to return a car at a reasonable time? Do I have to explicitly state a time for my own car to be returned? I got so heated that I slept in the guest bedroom as I can't believe I'm being made out to be the bad guy for asking about my own car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 5 mins later, the car returns and she says sarcastically **\"Your precious car has returned!\"**. \n\nThis pisses me off even more and I just ignore her for the rest of the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? I thought it was common courtesy to return a borrowed car at a reasonable time, without having to explicitly state it has to be returned before 10PM...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - GF's brother borrowed my car. Extended a 1 week borrow to 2 weeks. Car was returned super late which pissed me off and escalated into an argument and me sleeping in the guest bedroom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My charges got dropped because the police arrested me at my house an hour after the initial complaint and they had no proof other than an anonymous witness.  While I was in jail I called my gf and told her how sorry I was and she dumped me on the spot. She dumped me and started dating someone else a week later.  It hurt a lot and when I got out I wanted to just go and die under a rock somewhere.  So I went to treatment because having a flask on you 24/7 isn't normal and I wanted to die so I went. I found out I'm a real alcoholic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have been sober for 6 months and I go to AA 4 times a week and I am ok.  I recently moved into my own place again and have a decent job.  My ex texted me 2 days ago and she want to get back together with me. I love her but the fact she dated someone else a week after dumping me makes me feel I cant trust her so I said no.  She got really mad because she was willing to look past the DUI for me and I cant do the same for her.  I told her that she knew I was always half lit and she abandoned ship at the first sign of trouble for a new ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling like this?",

      "description": " \n\nI (M26) and my boyfriend (M26) have known each other 2 years, together 1.5. Shortly after we first met he was diagnosed with HIV. I've been on PrEP for years already and he started treatment/became undetectable very quickly so \\*for me\\* it's not a huge issue and his status isn't a factor in how I see him/how much I want to be with him.   \n\n\nWe both knew and talked about the fact he'd need some time to emotionally process his diagnosis and that he wouldn't feel comfortable having sex for a while even though in his head he knew there was no risk to me. However, 2 years after his diagnosis he still tells me he's not ready to have sex or do more than cuddle on the couch (we don't even make out; just quick pecks). I've regularly initiated conversations with him to \"check in\" about how he feels, how he's handling his positive status, and encouraged him to speak to a therapist to help him work through his feelings and blocks (which he has so far refused to do). I've told him I am always there for him, but understand if he's reluctant to dump all his emotions on me.\n\nAdditionally, he's still in the closet to pretty much everyone and despite asking him several times he's yet to introduce me to anyone in his life (meanwhile he's met most of my friends and been with me to my parent's house twice). Only \\~3 of his friends know he's bi, but he is not at all out to his work, majority of friends, or family. He's afraid of being rejected/disowned which I understand; but at a certain point he has to choose whether to live for himself or for their approval. I knew going into the relationship he wasn't out; but he also told me he'd work on coming out and so far he hasn't.   \n\n\nI've made it a point to address both these issues with him every couple months (at least) and every time he's told me he will work on things; but nothing has changed in 1.5 years. Around Christmas I told him that I was reaching a breaking point; I didn't feel it fair to set a \"deadline\" but I let him know that him still not being out to anyone, me knowing no one in his life, and the utter lack of physical intimacy were all getting really hard for me to deal with and I wouldn't wait forever. He told me he understood and that I was being very fair.   \n\n\nThree months have passed and still nothing has changed. I feel like I've been more than patient and more than reasonable and yet I can't shake the feeling that leaving would make me TA because in many ways our relationship is great. But, as a healthy gay man in my mid 20s I also want an active sex life and not to feel like my partner is ashamed of himself and our relationship by him lying about who he is to his family/friends and hiding me from them.",

I told him; look, i have cash, i'll give u whatever you need to not pay for unnecessary fees, he told me aight cool, i'll pay you back the moment i have connection(internet, somehow he didn't have it when he was visiting)  he told me he'd wire it the moment he'd land in the UK, thas half a week ago..\nHe still owes me in total 1k,.  #wibta if i ask him to wire the money i lend him last week straight away ?  Not talking bout the amount he owed me what i lend him for his business as i said before i dont \"need\" it straight away.\n\n\nI know he's gonna pay me back.. but it looks a bit.. meh now, don't have any more words to describe the situation atm..\n\nLong story short; I lend my friend money for business that i had no exact date to pay me back.\nLend him more money for him avoiding paying fees, \n#wibta for asking the money that i lend him recently back?\n\nI'm in quite of a pickle here..\n\n(Sorry for bad spelling here n there, its late &amp; i'm kinda drunk)",

      "description": "Hello all, \n\nPosting this on an alt account for obvious reasons.\n\nI work as a research chemist in a large research center. As you can maybe guess, people here aren't always the best with social cues, hygiene, etc\n\nOne of the older chemists that works with me on my floor seems to frequently make trips to the bathroom. From conversations with him, I know he is originally from a foreign country (this will be important later, maybe). Now the frequent bathroom trips aren't an issue (who cares), but it's his behavior in the bathroom that I take issue with.\n\nHe will spend upwards of 15 minutes grooming himself in the bathroom. This includes, but is not limited to: brushing his teeth, shaving, washing his face, etc. He tends to make a mess and take up space when doing this, but what really grosses me out is the sounds he makes when doing this. All manner of slurping and gargling noises as well as gutteral throat clears and spitting of loogies. It's a show. He also does this whole act regardless of whether there are others using the bathroom or not. I mention the fact that he is from another country because I believe cultural norms could be at play here, as well.\n\nSo my question is two-fold. \n\n1. AITA for thinking this is disgusting and should not be happening?\n\n2. WIBTA if I mentioned something to him?\n\nThanks",

      "description": "I need to use throwaways and different names for this. I'm friend with Vik who is an Indian American and one of my closest friends through college. Vik is in an LTR with Kat, who I know for the past six months or so, mostly hanging out with Vik. \n\nRight away I thought they were different people. Vik is definitely a guy who is intense about his education, money, and a lot of other things, but Kat is mostly just chill and a very down to earth person. Kat is also a yoga instructor (this is important, I'll get to it).\n\nKat comes from a more traditional Christian family who would like her to get married soon but Vik has been delicate about it. His parents are hard asses, and I can see why. She's confided in me several times that she and Vik see the day they get married, and honestly, while I don't see a lot of things in common, if they're happy, who am I to object, right?\n\nExcept, Vik started telling me several times in the past few months about how he mostly only enjoyed the physical companionship that Kat gave him. How she was \"his sexy white blonde girlfriend\" and how he felt sexy showing her off to his friends at his internship parties. Here's the thing .. he hasn't introduced her to his parents, and I know that he's telling them that she's not something for the long haul. I can't imagine his parents being in the dark otherwise. He also told me that while he tries to make Kat happy \"with marriage talk\", it's something he only tells from time to time so that they don't fight. \n\nI called him out a couple of times on this and he seemed to backtrack and be a little remorseful. He also seemed to say that he was just happy to have someone sexy and physically attractive in his life, not that he was fetishing her whiteness.\n\nBut I think he is and maybe denying that to himself. So I decided to share some of this with Kat. I didn't paraphrase him but I told her that he might not be serious about marriage and there's a chance he's seeing you as a prize to show off.\n\nAITA? I haven't heard of any fallout yet, and Kat said she'll talk to him about it sometime, but now I feel guilty I betrayed my close friend for someone who I enjoy spending company with (maybe I'm mildly infatuated, but I'm definitely being grounded) and don't want to see hurt. AITA and should I have just kept my butt out of their business?",

      "description": "I've been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for 6 years (we're both 18 atm). I loved her to pieces at the very beginning, and my love has only grown as time progressed. Admittedly, there's been some bumps along the road, but I'd like to believe our relationship is steady and happy. However, we've taken a huge hit this year in the form of domestic issues on her side. Apologies if this seems nonsensical or poorly written, as it's quite late and the dilemma has kept me sleep deprived for a few weeks now.\n\nHer parents are borderline abusive. Her father would demean her in every possible way he knew how to the brink of tears, take away her belongings and force her to work in his store for 9 hours every week day. On top of that, there would be violent arguments on a nightly basis between her mother and father, eventually dragging her into the mix. Before bed it became almost a nightly ritual for me to cheer her up before she slept, then check up in the middle of the night to ensure she'd fallen asleep. As a result of the bickering and constant blows to her self esteem, suicidal thoughts were constant and self harm wasn't rare. As our relationship continued her tendencies lessened, but it wasn't helped by her dad.\n\nIn March, he finally got kicked out by her mother, and things seemed to look up for us. However, things only took a nosedive from there. Her mom was even worse, berating her to worse levels, physically attacking her if she \"got out of line\", and is now meticulously trying to break us up. We went from daily chats to only week days, then down to Monday Wednesday and Thursday, and now only Thursdays.\n\nMy partner is almost always in a state of depression and it's become an uphill task to brighten her mood, usually taking most of the day, only to have her ripped from my arms the next morning. I beg of her to contact the authorities and just get this sorted out, but she downright refuses. Last week, we had the biggest argument of our relationship. The key points were as follows: I asked her to get help, she remained adamant in her refusal and said she's \"too afraid of her mother getting arrested or committing suicide.\" I asked her what her solution to the issue was, and she said she simply wanted to wait and see how things turned out. She also said that she wasn't being beaten constantly, so there was no point. I desperately tried to hammer in the point that abusive relationships never get better, and the last year was a pristine example of that, but she ended the conversation with \"All I want you to do is support me. I don't want to argue, please.\" \n\nI reluctantly agreed to support her, but still expressed my disapproval. Am I in the wrong for wanting to draw the line? I don't want to encourage her behavior with support, but I feel as though I'm the only person who would be willing to support anyway. I love her so much and I just want what's best for her, but it feels as though she can see the right way to go and is simply ignoring it to hurt herself. ",

She doesn't talk to him nearly as much as she used to before her and I were dating and I trust her enough to believe this is truth. Keep in mind I have always been a bit uneasy with him however as the relationship they were in for those two weeks was pretty sexual from my understand she gave of this guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday however she sends me a text saying she wants to visit her ex sometime in the summer for a week. By herself. And I absolutely flip the fuck out on her and tell her she can't visit him by herself for a week, certainly not across the fucking ocean either it's not like he lives in town or anything. I frankly don't care how much I trust her, it's him I don't trust. I've barely spoken to him in the last 7 months I've known my girlfriend so I have no reason to trust him.

It's not like I told her to cut contact with the dude, but at the same time this guy is suicidal and she's the best friend he has. I am completely conflicted as to what I should be doing right now. I can give more details if anyone wants, although I'm sure no one wants a transcript of the last 3 hours of our conversation lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to apologize either way, but its up to you internet strangers to tell me what exactly I'm gonna apologize for. Thanks in advance random asshole judgers. ",

      "description": "I (21) have been living with my best friend (19) for about 8 months now. It's been decent for the most part, always pays his rent, doesn't complain about noise, doesn't have random people over at all, and we're pretty good friends. My main gripe is he REFUSES to do the dishes. I am not exaggerating when I say he has done the dishes less than 6 times in the 8 months he's lived here. It genuinely pisses me off. He'll make food or use dishes just like I do but he acts like because I'm the only one that really cooks meals (which I always share with him or offer to), I'm the only one that has an obligation to clean our kitchen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's not just a \"oh he has a threshold, he'll do them eventually\" type thing. I've asked him as much a 10 times in one day to do them and he says \"in a minute\" and just keeps smoking weed and playing video games. I'll go out of town for a weekend and purposefully leave them undone and ask him to do them so I can cook when I get back, not only will he not do them, he will use more dishes and leave them on top of the old ones. Anytime I \"test\" his tolerance to filth I always lose, because he will let fruit flies, slime molds, and even fucking MICE propagate in the kitchen like it's no big deal. On the VERY few times I've seen him actually do them, he will just throw dishes away in the trash if he thinks they're too dirty, and leave the excess food waste to rot in the bottom of the sink. I've vomited before just cleaning out the rot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast time I'm making food he comments saying he might want some, I said \"only if you do the dishes\". He replies to me I shit you not with \"You don't do them that much more than me, and besides I'm the only one that ever finishes them\" which is utter bullshit (only reason he's ever \"finished\" them is because I do the bulk of them and leave like 3 bowls in the sink to soak). I'm to the point now where I am sick of this shit. I am tired of feeling like I live with a 9 year old and it's genuinely starting to effect the way I view him as a friend. I am considering him telling him that he's not allowed to use the kitchen anymore because he's not responsible enough to do so, perhaps even putting a lock on the kitchen door to make my point. Would I be an asshole for this?",

I don’t carry a purse, never have, I just keep my wallet and cellphone in my pockets. I don’t like being forced to be feminine. \n\nThe only hugely feminine thing about me is my hair. It’s not too long, but it’s about armpit-length and I hate it. Majority of my friends are male and we like to play sports, and just having to tie it back and brush it out of my face is a pain. My long hair is inconvenient and ugly, and it gets caught everywhere, and it sheds, so I want it cut to look androgynous. \n\nHowever, my boyfriend is very against my decision, saying it will make him upset if I cut my hair. He’s afraid of me looking like a trans person/looking like a boy. \n\nHe will say something like \"I support your decision\" and then two minutes later BEG me not to cut off my hair because he loves how it looks. He shaved his head almost two months ago without asking for my opinion, and although I did not entirely like it at first, he liked it and I grew on it. I told him he would most likely get used to my shorter hair, and he still wouldn't believe me.\n\nHe compared me cutting my hair to getting a face tattoo, when that's barely the case here. I've tried to tell him that hair grows back but he gets irrational and defensive, and says that he will really miss my hair and he would get sad if I cut it.",

      "description": "I was playing MTG a couple weeks ago at the card shop with my friends and about a dozen other people like I always do.  After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.\n\nWell last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone\n\n\"to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.\"\n\nEveryone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.\n\nWas I wrong to do this?",

NEVER AGAIN. NEVER WEAR THOSE SHORTS AGAIN.” i hadn’t even realized that my shorts had ridden up. he continued to (in public) chew me out for this, even though i hadn’t realized, and i was mortified. then i looked away and he started screaming at me to “GET OUT OF MY SIGHT. IM GOING TO COUNT TO TEN AND YOU NEED TO BE GONEEEE” and continued to scream at me like this, in the middle of a bar, while my sister fumbled to get me the room key. he kept on making vague threats about how if i wasn’t gone in ten seconds i would face consequences, so obvi i left asap. this type of (in my opinion, completely irrational) reaction is common with him, except normally he tells me i’m gaslighting him/being a martyr when i start to cry, but i left quickly so it didn’t show that i was upset. here’s where i’m the asshole in the situation: my family is wealthy. we are currently on vacation (where this is happening) and my parents are paying for my college and they take me and my sister lots of places, so i feel like i can’t really be mad at him?? so reddit, am i ungrateful, and AITA?",

      "description": "\nI (20F) have been flirting with this guy (24M) for just under two months now. The flirting is definitely mutual. We both are have low-key petnames for eachother, kinda more like possessive things, where he'll call me his girl casually or vice versa.\n\nHe lives in Europe while I live in the US, and we have an 8 hour time difference. I'm a full-time student and he works, making the time difference harder but we persist. I text him during my classes and he texts me whenever he can from work. We started off just flirting super over the top when we met through a friend, but now we talk daily for hours on end. We were video-calling a few weeks back, and his roommate basically assumed I was his girlfriend, which he didn't accept or deny. While I was on vacation for two weeks, I didn't talk to anyone in our groupchat except him. We exchange good mornings for both of our time zones and if we don't fall asleep mid-conversation, we say good night. He can sense when my emotions are off and will make sure I'm alright and not upset, and will stay up helping cheer me up. He puts up with my quirks and flaws, and is genuinely an amazing guy, almost perfect for me.\n\nI've had friends ask what our thing was before and I just answer vaguely, saying i don't know, we don't really have a label. I just talk about how I'm always smiling when talking with him and that he makes me happy. I also mention that I'm in no rush to label things because I'm scared that it'll fuck things up and that I'm happy with whatever. \n\nIn our group chat, another one of our friends, me and him were talking about little things that annoy us and one of his was labels, he basically said he felt they were unnecessary. So he didn't really say that explicitly to me, but knew I was on.\n\nWhile I'm fine without a label, sometimes I do wish we had one. I'm not the type of person to bring up the \"What are we?\" discussion and I don't think he is either. And even if I do bring it up, I'm scared of ruining our happiness. We joke about kids and marriage, because neither of us are ready for that yet, but neither of us are opposed to that in the future as a possibility. We joke and imply sexual stuff a lot but haven't done anything sexual. I personally shy away a little because I'm scared of oversexualizing things and ruining the potential relationship, but I'm not against it. \n\nHowever, we always talk about visiting each other and going on dates and dinners and cuddling, so I feel like this isn't just something small. I definitely like him and my friends can tell when I'm talking with him. He likes me back, he hasn't said it in those words but implies it heavily. Our mutual friend has basically said that we'd be perfect for each other and its not one-sided. My birthday and Valentine's day are both coming up and while neither of us really care about Valentines, I feel like clarity would be nice, but not needed.\n\nWIBTA if I brought up the idea of labeling what we have, after he expressed not liking labels?\n\n(sorry for bad formatting or anything, long time lurker, first time poster!)",

I don't have the details of the specific plan.\n\nWhen my youngest son was born they had planned to enroll him in the same life insurance plan. We signed off on the paperwork again and thought everything was all set. Recently, my MIL told my husband that the \"deal\" my older son received is no longer available, so they are considering other investment opportunities and asked my husband what he would prefer. We discussed it briefly and agreed that a 529 college savings plan would be appreciated. We have 529s for both boys, but other people can also open an additional 529 plan for the same child.\n\nAfter this conversation it made me uncomfortable that the boys would be receiving different investments from my in-laws. I was always raised to treat people fair and equitable. I asked my husband to ask them to change the life insurance policy they have for my older son to a 529, so that both boys would have 529s from their grandparents. \n\nI thought it was a reasonable request but my husband thinks that if I had the conversation with them about how they spend their money, that I would be an asshole.

      "description": "Throw away account. Lots of moving parts here so bear with me. Starting with background, originally from an Asian country brought up by a catholic faith. Lived there till I was 22 then got the fuck out of there to the land of the free and the home of the brave. Mom was a stay at home mother and dad worked in an oil field related industry in the middle east country. Only visited once every 3 to 4 years for a duration of 3 months and all he would do during that period is be intoxicated (reason being alcohol was not allowed there) and verbally/physically abuse everyone except my two brothers from my dad's previous marriage. Their mom committed suicide so my dad bought them up with some sort of \"pity-entitlement\". Then there is my sister, we are twins she would sometimes escape the abuse at times else she's treated like a princess being the only girl child. So you get the picture here I become the scapegoat when he was extremely intoxicated. My childhood was sort of rough because I was not allowed to socialize with anyone in my neighborhood, the school friends I had avoided me after school, etc so I have never developed any sense of having a long term friendships or social skills to this day. Add to that the brothers were constantly causing fights drunk in the middle of the night waking everyone in the neighborhood for some smack comments passed (even weeks) earlier. This would only happen when dad was not around. I guess now I see why none of my school friends wanted to do anything with me after school. Every time my dad would come back for vacation everyone else would get most of the goodies especially my sister and my step brothers. Hell he even got goodies (watches, clothes,etc) for my brothers' boss and their friends (till this day I have no idea why?). But when my mom asked for money to run the household he would bitch that he didn't have any. So my mom would ask my step brothers for some money which made them think they are the bosses of the house. That with their entitlement upbringing and the two of them and the smack comments would always cause fights late at night and my mom would basically be doing nothing but simply adding to the fuel to the fire by taking sides.\n\nMoving further a couple of years the oldest brother had issues finding a suitable partner (Geez I wonder why). Finally he got one and mom was not happy because of some BS reasoning. They married but no one from my family attend the reception after the nuptials. This caused him and his wife to be resentful and how they would cause constant fights. Yes they decided to live in the same tiny studio even though they had their own place. At one point I was thrown in a jail cell for questioning because the SIL falsely accused me (i was 13- 14 year old) for molesting her and attempting to rape her on behalf of my family because of unpaid dowry. No idea on how true the dowry request was. (Dowry = some asian cultures the bride’s family is supposed to provide money and material goods to the groom’s family in exchange for the bride in marriage.). Mind you these molestation/rape and dowry are considered very serious offence in the country I lived in. The cops caught on to her BS and let me go. Now that got him and his wife to be kicked out of the house. In the meantime while all this was happening my dad decided to make brother 2 the head of the household while dad is away and brother 2 becomes radicalized with the old testament shit because he is unemployed and starts imposing crap like tithing to the church, how we should live life per the book of old testament, etc. This eventually gets him kicked out too.\n\nNow I have almost completed my engineering with a year left and same for my sister with a generic arts degree. She finds a guy who also happened to work in the same middle eastern country as my dad. She decides to get married right out of school with no real life experience and possibly already pregnant. I decide to pursue higher education here in the US. But since I didn’t have any aid my sisters’ new BIL decides to help me out by loaning me the money for the first year. I worked my ass off working 2 different jobs, managed to get a scholarship and tuition assistant-ship from the school and was almost financially independent by the time the second year rolled around. In the meantime my sister has popped out two kids and decides to have three career path changes while still living my mom and the sisters husband has started verbally and physically abusing her. Dad retires and moves back home. My mom would keep calling me every week telling me how bad things are between the dads drinking and my sister husband abuse, putting me under stress of a situations halfway around the world which I have no control on. Once I graduated I paid back every single penny and then some, my mom then started making demands that I send her money on a regular basis to which I obliged.\n\nA few years pass by I have a girlfriend who is now my wife. Usual pictures of posted on social media and I was told I am defaming my family’s name and dragging it through dirt because she’s white, redhead, on the curvy side, comes from a broken family and not a catholic. My sister begins unwanted name calling publicly on social media and I have a heated argument with my mom over the phone. I stood up for my wife and I did not have any contact with my family for almost a year. Mom decides to initiates a with a phone call which I accept reluctantly ask about me and the weather in general and starts asking for money. No apologize of any sort just acted as if nothing happened. Hands over the phone to my sister. She did try to indirectly apologizing saying its against catholic values to date or have pre-martial sex and was “concerned” for me. Now I have been in the US living by myself for almost a decade I am not naive and I find that ironic coming from someone who dated a man more than a decade older than her pretty sure she had done the deed a long before she was married. A few months go by the unsolicited advice on relationships continue to roll in. I learn that my sister is a manipulative bigot. For instance she would brag how her friends’ significant other would come back with brand new Iphones and macbooks when they visit the US, thinks one of her friends is dumb for wasting money by running for charitable marathon, talking down on one of our relative who married a man who was significantly of a darker shade of brown and was went bald prematurely, etc Anywho my wife  and I are now expecting and were blessed with triplets. She would keep questioning weather we needed assistance in conceiving, asking for medical records so she could verify things with her doctor and keep blasting me with baby pic asking me to take printouts of it and post is around the house so our kids looks “cute” if my wife looks at “cute” baby pictures. And guess what she decides to have another kid too to match the three kids we would have. Sisters kid was born a couple of months later and as usual I am asked to give a lump sum cash amount as her birthday present. We ended up losing one of our child in utero 4 months into the pregnancy and the boys were born prematurely 2 months earlier. Instead of giving us space when we lost a child my mom and sister kept blasting our phones with the usual asking for medical records, advice and god related bs. Few months later were out of the NICU, we skype mom decides to yell at me for giving my kids pacifier, me having a beard and gaining weight. Again ironic coming from my mom who is morbidly obese herself. We learn that one of our child suffered brain trauma and is diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Giving that news to my mom made no difference and the usual asking for money began. With all the medical debt we are almost living paycheck to paycheck. What I am frustrated about is I see some of my friend who have moved to the US from various other counties to have parents who are supportive of their children when they have kids by coming down for a visit and helping around the house. We have none of that. My family never came over when I graduated or even I got married (because we got married on a beach and  did not have a traditional church wedding).\n\nWhat finally broke the camel's back for me was at one point we all at home were sick so we had a rough night and as usual my mom and sister blast my phone. I don’t answer. My sister calls my on facebook messenger I simply sign out of that When I woke up I find a message from my sister why I signed out of facebook instantly I responded that I was trying to get some sleep and everyone at home are sick. She sends me a nasty message trying to guilt trip me saying what if mom/dad went to sleep and never woke up?  I am like WTF???. Mom has still been trying to message me on various occasion like birthday, christmas etc but I have simply been stone walling ever since.\n\nFor those of you who have been here till now I truly appreciate your patience with this brutally long post although this is  AITA i think I needed to get this off my chest. My worst fear is that I even though I am half the way around the world I  pick up on this toxicity and end up becoming like my family members. I just want a simple drama free life. But with one of my child being disabled I find some days are hard and I get really angry at everything and everyone not knowing what my future is going to be like and i see myself becoming like my abusive dad. Am I doing the right thing by cutting my family off or am I being the asshole and I need some help ?",

      "description": "I know it sounds that I am... But read fully.\n\nI am a 20 M who is 99% of the time at home. I never liked cars or driving. I even got my license pretty late (unlike most people who get it asap).\n\nI work/play/rest etc in my room. I work alot, I am a programmer. I play video games when I don't have work. And I obviously can rest at home.\n\nI literally don't go out unless I have classes. And all my classes are like 5 minutes away from home... Walking! \n\nI do have friends. But most of them are pretty far away and I can't really hang out with them irl. So basically I hang out with them on internet but try to meet them up irl as much as possible.\n\nI got a car for my birthday last year. I know it's a super expensive car. I don't care about the money. I care about the reasons I got gifted a car. It wasn't my father being a \"good father\". \n\nI literally was angry when I realized I got a car. I never needed or wanted a car. I would literally like 50$ more than a car. \n\nThe real reasons that my father gave me a car as a gift is what makes me hate this:\n\n1 - He literally was called a \"good dad\" by all his friends and family. Although literally everyone in my family was like \"you got a car but actually your sister did\" (I'll talk about my sister below). Literally everyone knew I never wanted a car and I won't be using it.\n\n2 - he was forcing me to do \"manly\" stuff like how his friends sons steal their dads cars and beg their fathers to drive their car. (I know I am not a \"manly\" kind of person but everyone is different. other children liked cars etc but I liked different things. The things I liked always made me tons of money. The things I liked and did, always were technically more valuable.\n\n3 - my sister is pretty much all day long out. Usually comes home at night. She was having a hard time getting like 20 Ubers a day to get around. She got my father's car a few times. But guess what, after a few times that she got my father's car, I got a car! As soon as I got \"my\" car she started using it. It's basically her car now. I've driven my car for like 10 times. Even if I want to use it for some of my classes I have to ask her like a day before... Literally from the first day everyone knew it was just a fake gift to me.\n\nI am not even sure if I should feel like an asshole for feeling like this but I pretty much do. It never felt like a good act towards me in any aspect to me to be honest. \n\nThe car is basically mine in the paper works btw. So I can sell it if I want to I think. I always wanted to do it tbh but never really tried to tho. I feel like It'll be too much drama. \n\nLow-key I want to he the asshole so I know he tried to do a \"good thing\" in some aspect that didn't see.",

      "description": "My friend (Fake name will be Amelia) has multiple diagnosed mental illnesses. Looking back at it, my reasons for not wanting to be her friend, coincide with her mental illnesses\n\nI met Amelia 3 years ago and I thought that we were somewhat good friends. She acted like a good friend and put effort into our friendship. Now, because of her illnesses it feels as if our relationship has been thoroughly tarnished.\n\nBefore I am witchhunted, I want to explain myself\n\nAmelia isn't the best person. She lied to get me away from some of my friends, victimizes herself constantly, and is just constantly negative towards me. \n\nI did add the Mentally Ill part not for clickbait because I believe it directly links to our failing friendship.\n\nI feel as if she uses her mental illness as a personality trait. It is all she will talk about now. I am not her therapist. I am her friend. (I am not leaving her because I hate her, it's just I feel like our relationship is becoming toxic) I am down to listen to her issues, but her constantly just throwing it into my face is just, making me feel awful as well.\n\nI have 5 out of my 8 classes with her so I see her for the majority of my school day so she is a constant influence on my day. \n\nI really started seeing issues with her when one of my friends sat with her on the bus and didn't talk to her and Amelia blew it out of proportion and started saying all these awful things about my friend and attempted to really harm my relationship with my friend of 6 YEARS!!!!\n\nI brushed it off and continued with our friendship. We really aren't fighting or anything right now but, she got a bad fever and stayed home for a week so I was Amelia-less \n\nIf I am being honest, it felt great. I felt more open with people, I felt more positive, and it felt great. I feel awful that I think this way.\n\nI haven't really explained the mental illness part of me not wanting to be with her. I briefly mentioned it but, she just exploits her illnesses. She constantly brags about her panic attacks and undermines my issues. I just feel like my problems aren't important when I am around her. She doesn't really understand my issues???\n\nI have intense anxiety and an issue with people touching me. I am an introvert who only gains confidence from being around friends. She would put labels on me and just put my feelings below her. I just feel awful when I am around her. \n\nI am sorry if this is all over the place, I just wanted to pour my feelings out and get some opinions. I feel like I can't leave our \"friend group\" because I was told by the other two people that I am the 1 person who keeps the group going. I feel as if the group is going to fall apart eventually. \n\nAmelia was a great person and I just think she needs a friend who will be able to accompany all her needs. AITA for just wanting to leave our friendship?",

      "description": "So I commute to work everyday on the train, takes me an hour and 40 minutes each way, and costs me £5000 a year (that’s UK Rail for you). So I’m already pretty miffed about being on the train at all. \n\nI’m also a pretty big guy, 6’3” and broad shouldered, so I make a beeline for priority seating if I can. Purely because of the extra space, I would of course give the seat up to someone in greater need. It’s just more comfortable all round. \n\nOften however, I can’t get this seat. So I settle for a table (I literally don’t fit in a normal row, my knees dig into the seat infront). \n\nI will use today as an one example in what I feel is a series of bizarre coincidences. I’m early to the station, and the train is waiting. I get on and the train is pretty empty, but everyone has had the same thought as me and claimed the priority seats. So I sit at one of the literally dozens of empty tables and get comfortable. \n\nWithin 2 minutes, a guy that must have been 6’5” sits down opposite me and starts wrestling his legs in between mine to sit down. Why? WHY!? There’s so many more convenient places to sit. Literally whole empty tables, why would you sit opposite another person clearly pretty tall. Before you think “just move” I tried that. The same bloody thing happened, is the whole “birds of a feather, stick together” thing really true. Only massive people ever sit next to me and I can’t wrap my head around it, I’m starting to think it’s a conspiracy.\n\nSo AITA for thinking people are stupid for wanting to sit next/opposite me if they don’t have to? This wasn’t really for anyone, I just had to vent otherwise I was gonna start screaming at strangers on the train. \n\nTLDR - I’m tall, ONLY other tall people sit opposite me on the train. I hate it. \n\n",

They don't work, they live in a ramshackle trailer and rarely have a functioning car. About a year ago when their car broke down they started asking me for rides. At first only when they really needed it, to get groceries or to a doctor's appointment. I mostly always helped out, but then they started asking more frequently for less important things like to the liquor store. I started having to ask them for gas money, but couldn't figure out how to refuse, they can see that I'm home after all. Over the past year, they have also frequently asked to borrow lawn equipment and the occasional request for sugar, dog food, etc. \n\nIn August, they stopped for a while. I think they knew that I was out of town for a time and that I was busy with work. In October it started up again and I've ignored every call and text. When I drive by their house I smile politely, but don't slow down. \n\nI feel like I'm acting like a child, but I don't know how to deal with this situation.

      "title": "AITA for abusing induction loops at left turn lanes in traffic just to go first?",
      "description": "So for those that aren't aware, left turn lanes in my area have induction loops embedded into the roads. There will be one at the front near the crosswalk, and another one several car lengths behind. The idea is that if it detects there are lots of cars in the left turn lane, the advanced left turn light will go on. So in order to trick the traffic light into thinking there are a lot of cars lined up in the lane, I deliberately stop far behind the first car, stopping on top of the 2nd induction loop. When the light changes, the advanced left turn light goes on and therefore, allowing me and the car in front to turn left without having to wait.   \n\n\nNow the thing is, I'm always aware to see if a 3rd car is coming behind me. If so, I just roll up so that way the 3rd car behind me can stop on top of the 2nd induction loop. I try to be considerate like that, and roll up when necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when I told someone about this \"trick\", they got offended that I'm cheating the system and cutting the \"line\", when technically if there isn't a lot of cars in the left turn lane, I shouldn't force a left turn light just so I can go first. That's why they put the induction loops spaced out, and not on the 1st and 2nd car spots for a reason... What are your thoughts? AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Getting 2 Women at my office fired?",
      "description": " \n\nI'm 22 and been a sales rep at a software company part time since about 2017, after I graduated in June I was brought on full time to be a Account Executive (salesman). Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?",

He asked me if I could give him a ride, and I said yes because he had no other way to get home. I was frustrated because I had to cancel a meeting I planned a week earlier, and I asked him if he could pay for the gas to get to the airport and back. He agreed very reluctantly and stated that other friends didn’t make him pay for the same ride and that he viewed it as a slight to our friendship. After break, he changed his mind and refused to pay and says close friends shouldn’t have to pay. The money is only 20 dollars and doesn’t make a difference but it’s the fact that he agreed to pay but didn’t is what upsets me. So am I the asshole for making my room mate pay for gas??",

However, this past year they went through a bad breakup and which resulted in them developing large drinking and partying habits that has also caused them to loose focus of their studies. They don't do homework and have said they don't have any idea what is on their final (at one point even walking out 15 minutes into a final). I've tried talking to them about it but they always say not to worry about it and that they have it under control. Over the course of this semester, nothing has changed and I've started to get to the point where if I have begun to worry and that has resulted in me stressing out about their situation. Truthfully I want to cut them off because maybe it might show them that what they are doing is not working and that I can't support them anymore. Also worrying about them is just adding to the things I have to worry about myself. So WIBTA if I cut them off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Best friend is struggling in school, refuses to talk about it, and I can't keep worrying about them on top of my own problems.

We both want her to move to me and live here after we have sorted out her visa and i have gotten confirmation about my next job assignment. We agreed that frequent facetime calls was a good idea to keep our relationship alive and have good communication, we also text a fair bit. 3 days ago she didnt call me before bed like usual, no problem for me, i understand that people want their own time or are tired sometimes, i am aswell. The second day she said her roomate is sleeping so she dont want to call (wich has never been a problem, even talked loud and laughed before many times wich was no problem for the roomate becasue she sleeps really deep) i was feeling like this was an excuse for something, but i shrugged it off and went to bed. The third day she told me she was going out with her friends to party, i said alright have fun and please text me when you are home safe, she promised to do so so we could have a quick chat. I woke up in the middle of the night with no text from her so i try to contact her (way past bar closing times) but to no success wich made me worried something had happened. she then woke up later (around 6) and said ''sorry just passed out when i got home'', i texted ''what happened?'' wich she saw but didnt answer and went back to sleep i guess. Then at lunch the day after i get a little salty and tell her that its not okay to just blow off promises and that it made me worry like hell (not really a city known for peace &amp; love) and that i didnt ask for much, just a text. Then today she told me she was getting off the night shift early so she could get some good sleep, and i said ''Alright good, call me before bed so we can atleast see each other for a minute'' to wich she replied ''no im going straight to sleep im tired''. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like she doesnt care for the calls anymore and that its just excuses, its really not a hard thing to do, its usually very short calls but they do so much and its one of the only things that keeps the distance from feeling shorter for us.

      "description": "Hello, I'm forty y/o for the last few months my Step dad and my mom (both in their 70's) have been creating their wills. They have been actively polling the rest of the family about what they would want when they die. Stepdad specifically is acting like he's going to die next week like it's on the calendar. My step-siblings have been going through the house like things are on layaway. No really, they put color-coded stickers on things to mark what everyone has dibs on. The boys put dibs on their dads moose head, deer antlers, computers, tools, guns and truck. The girls put dibs on the linens, blankets, patio furniture, appliances, couches and the jacuzzi. Even the grand kids are eyeing the fire tablets, laptops, TVs and surround sound. \n\nStepdad has museum artifact quality spears, swords, crossbows and muskets. All marked with a sticker of a 14y/o grandchild.\n\nI dont hang out with the step-siblings that often, never really warmed to them. They proven to be callow, vapid empty shells too self absorbed in their avarice to realize they are horrible human beings. So when I was over for a family dinner they are fighting over dibs on things they just found out about like a plot of land in Montana and snowmobiles in storage. I say nothing but my parents stopped the whole conversation and pointedly asked me what of theirs I would want. I looked around, the place looks like a sea of polka dots with all the stickers and I said I didnt want anything. The reaction I got was stunned silence. The step-siblings were incensed that I didn't go through the house like I was shopping and said I didnt want anything because everything was already taken.\n\nThere must have been a prior conversation because I saw my mom smirking at my stepdad like I told you so.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hello all, as the title says, I came out as gay to my mother a few days ago, and she did not take it well. She told me I was going to Hell (she’s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn’t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it’s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it’s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would “never say anything to them” she definitely believes that what they’re doing is wrong and that they’re going to hell for it. One particular couple I’ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "I was in a clothes store in the mall when I saw a small table set up with a sunglasses display. Most of them were around $30, but the glasses I wanted had no price tag. I took them to the cashier, who said that I could bring her another pair of sunglasses and she would just use that price. When I returned to the display table, I noticed a small pair of bright pink kids' sunglasses, marked as $4.99. Perfect. I returned to the cashier, who said, \"I'm *pretty* sure these were __not__ the same price.\"\n\nWhile I was leaving the store, $5 poorer with $30 glasses on my face, the cashier said to her coworker loudly enough for me to hear, \"Can you believe what that guy did?\"\n\nIt made me feel bad.

      "description": "On my Snapchat a few months ago, I sent a message on my story for about 150+ people to see saying “Rb (reply back) for a brutal roast” then a girl replied back asking for one. I then thought about it for a bit and realised that she dated my friend for a bit and was kind of annoying after they broke up. She would always call him when she was drunk (she broke up with him), texted him a lot. And anytime she was drunk she would send a different group chat each time letting everyone know. And most times she wasn’t that drunk. \n\nSo when this girl replied for a brutal roast I said “the biggest attention whore I know” she responded with “ok” for the next 10 minutes I didn’t think anything of it then I get messages from her friends saying “how dare u call her a whore”  “you’re disgusting” “never call a girl a whore” and a whole lot of other stuff like that. \n\nI then felt like shit and apologised and said how she took it out of context, she just said “whatever”. Then her friend did a thing on her Snapchat story saying “reply back for a tbh (to be honest)” I replied and she said I was a dog and other bad stuff. I then realised I couldn’t win because they were so stubborn so I began to be an idiot and be a smartass  and argue with every point she made and provided evidence. \n\nOverall, the girl I roasted hates me, but the girls friend doesn’t mind me.

      "description": "Okay so, in college, first year I started dating my husband, he wasnt serious back then at all. He cheated on me with my friend (he more than made it up to me, 4 years later we’re married, very happy). That friend just happened to fall in love with him (he’s really charming, tbh everyone wanted him). So that friend hid this affair from me until 3 years later when I confronted her? I had known for a while cause my husband had told me long before that. When I confronted her,I told her I forgave her and I didn’t care about the past, she was being super defensive, I still forgave her cause I didn’t wanna cause drama in our friend circle, Cause I honestly didn’t care. After that, she just generally hated when me and my husband were together? She would tell me weird shit like he’s not worth it, and don’t be with him! (Let me add that she once came up to me before the confrontation, and tried to convince me that my husband, wasn’t in love with me and was actually in love with her). I ignored it. \nTowards our last year of college she started being even more weird (me and my husband at this point we’re super serious had made our parents meet and we’re talking about marriage) she would go to my other friend and bitch about the me and my husband. Which was ridiculous cause she acted like she was totally okay in front of us.Let me add that at this point she had been distant from everyone no matter how hard we tried to involve her she always acted like she didn’t care. Our friend group was really getting tired of her shit. After we graduated we had an engagement party like 2 months later and said friend also had the rep of getting too drunk and just wanting to party hard and puking everywhere and What not. I honestly didn’t even feel like she was my friend anymore, and nor did I want her to come to my party with my family and my in laws and get drunk and ruin the whole thing? So I sent her a message explaining everything that made me uncomfortable about her and how I think it would be better if we weren’t friends anymore (also she hadnt met me or talked to me since graduation). Honestly her energy and bad vibes were really affecting me. I told her everything nicely and she replied rudly After which I just told her I didn’t want her at my engagement because I don’t want bad vibes in my life specially at such a happy time. Then 9 months later when we were getting married, about a week before, she calls up my other friend (hadn’t heard from her since the last interaction) and starts calling me a bitch and what not and saying I ruined her life and stole all her friends (I literally didn’t care if anyone stayed friends with her, neither did I ever make anyone share my feelings about her or anything), and that I made everyone stop talking to her. I was shocked to hear such stuff! I always felt bad about not inviting her but I feel like I have my reasons honestly! Idk AITA here? ",

      "description": "I'll be honest.  I don't think I am an asshole at all for this, but several family members have started to give me shit for this so I figured I'd check in with you guys.\n\nDuring the winter holiday season my family gets together a lot.  Like we have a mini Christmas party every weekend between Thanksgiving and Xmas, and those holiday get togethers tend to be an overnight kinda thing.  So for about  2 months out of the year I spend the majority of my free time with extended family.  I love this, but as many of you can sympathize (I hope) this also involves a lot of my relatives getting into heated drunken political \"debates.\"\n\nI am incredibly uncomfortable being around my family when they get like this so I recently started leaving the room and finding something to do elsewhere while they fight so I don't end up an anxiety riddled mess watching it unfold in front of me.  It worked great until a few days ago when an argument about immigration started up and I stood up to excuse myself for a bit.  My cousin and uncle sitting next to me asked where I was going and I explained I was gonna head outside for a bit.  Got some weird looks, but that was about it.\n\nNext day I wake up to find a bunch of texts from that uncle, my father, and a different cousin saying it was \"rude and disrespectful\" to leave for long periods of time during \"family time.\"  I responded that I didn't like sitting around listening to them yell at each other over politics, but they say that is \"just what families do\" and I should \"get over it and stop being a snowflake.\"\n\nI'm honestly considering either skipping the rest of the holidays with them or only showing up long enough to see my younger cousins and my nephew that I love to pieces.  (He is so goddamn cute it kills me.)  I enjoy the majority of these events, but as soon as the alcohol comes out I feel like the odds of it staying pleasant go down dramatically.\n\nI am 99% sure I am not the asshole on this, but if there is a legit chance I am just missing some social norm here I would love to know.  Is this \"just what families do\" or am I in the right to remove myself from the situation when it does nothing but make me miserable to be around?",

      "title": "AITA - For not talking to my girlfriend about things I’m upset about in the moment they happen and for how I handled our argument?",
      "description": "\nTLDR at the bottom. \n\nThis was all articulated horribly and I apologize. If you have any questions ask, I’m sure I can answer them much better than what I have typed here.\n\nAlso if I sound one-sides let me know and I’ll try and explain her side of it better.\n\n\nHad an argument with my gf today regarding my tone, attitude, being rude etc.  Starting at the beginning so this might be long. I was upset about something completely unrelated to her. We were texting and I guess she noticed and called me. I don’t really like taking about stuff until I want to or until I’m ready to so I told her I’m fine. She then asked if I was mad at her, which she does frequently. I told her there was no possible way I could be, I was busy doing something else. it was obvious what I was upset at and she even mentioned what it was. I still said I was fine because it’s not something I was willing to talk about yet. She then said I was being rude to her because of the tone of my voice. I said of course my tone was the way it was because I’m upset but nothing was directed towards her nor was I being rude or mean. But apparently I was “rude” and I was “mad”.  She then called me out for not talking to her and telling her what’s wrong even though I talk about pretty much everything with her and if there is something I don’t want to talk about in that exact moment, I eventually do. What’s the issue? There is nothing wrong with me sounding upset I can’t possibly switch to a happier tone just because she calls me. I told her that she has to respect that i don’t want to talk about it right now. \n\nThe argument escalated she continued to accuse me of being angry etc and I will admit I started noticeably getting “mad” I guess but I quickly calmed myself and spoke in a neutral tone.  I do this because apparently my tone and attitudes in arguments make me an asshole and mean. I’m not saying I’m perfect or anything like that I know I get out of hand in arguments sometimes but not to the extent that she says. ANYWAYS.  I mentioned how her voice is when she’s upset which is occurs frequently and that I don’t take it as being rude or mean. Her response was that “it’s different”. I then asked her what did I say that was rude. She said “I can’t remember” I replied with “if it’s so important why can’t you remember it?” And she got tight and said I was mocking her? I felt I was being argumentative if anything?\n\nArguments  like this occur frequently because she takes whatever I say or I’m doing and assumes It’s about her in whenever it involves any negative emotion. A great example of this is when I had to give my dog away. I had her for like 6 months but I loved that dog. I was devastated as soon as she left the house. I didn’t want to talk to anyone and was feeling the shittiest I’ve felt in a long time. To the point where I was holding back tears. ANYWAYS, she somehow thought it was about her and said I was taking it out on her? I wasn’t even talking to her and could barely speak without my voice breaking. I definitely did not want to talk about this in that moment and definitely didn’t want to talk to anyone. Am I wrong for that? She says that I should just say I don’t want to talk about it but even that has caused problems before, on top of that it should be obvious that I don’t want to talk about it and why or how could I possibly be upset with her in these situations? (Before the argument happens) they absolutely have nothing to do with her, they have very obvious reasons as to why I’m upset and she knows how I am. She knows I don’t like talking about things until I want to etc etc. But still she somehow assumes me being upset has to do with my being mad at her? \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend thinks I’m always mad at her when I’m upset at other things. Even if the emotion is unrelated to anger. She also frequently points out that I talk to her in a negative way and that I’m rude even if I’m using a neutral tone or just being argumentative. A neutral tone that I’ve come to speak in because apparently how I normally argue is me being an asshole and mean. Basically I never win and according to her I’m somehow always rude, mean and mad at her. Even if i feel that way about things completely unrelated to her. ",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad when people compliment my rings?",
      "description": "So, a bit of backstory: \n\nI am a violinist, and I have played since before I can remember. I also have arthritis, the first major episode of which occurred when I was 14. Since then, it has only gotten worse, with occasional flares that sometimes leave me unable to walk, but it was always fine, because I had my violin.\n\nI went to college, and one of my majors was music. As time went on, I started feeling pain in my fingers whenever I played, but I usually just ignored it. Eventually, though, it got to the point where I lost the use of my pinkies. I spent my last semester relearning how to play my instrument, still in pain, without 2 of my fingers.  At this point, my fingers and hands and wrists hurt all the time, whether or not I was using them.\n\nAfter graduation, I completely lost the ability to play, it just hurt too bad. I spent two months searching for answers, for a solution to my pain; I was given restricting plastic casts, horribly painful cortisone shots in the nodes in my palms, even a round of steroids that made me increasingly manic. I had to go on antidepressants, because I was sinking into a terrible depression.\n\nFinally, a doctor finally realized that I'm double jointed, and the hyperextension was causing inflammation in my fingers, which was causing the locking and clicking sensations that were causing me so much pain. The solution was simple- custom fitted splints (interlocking silver rings) that prevent my fingers from hyperextending. I was fitted, and a few weeks later, the splints arrived. I put them on, and suddenly, I had the use of my hands back. Never mind the thousands of dollars in medical bills I would have to pay, or the years of pain that were now behind me- I could play again!\n\nFast forward to more recent times. I took on a temporary job in retail, which I'll be leaving this Saturday for unrelated reasons. At least 5 times a shift, somebody comments on my rings. Sometimes, it's a compliment, sometimes, it's a question, and sometimes, it's an insult. The latter happens a lot more frequently than you would expect.\n\nAt first, I just sort of went along with it, chuckling and saying 'Thanks!' in that cheery, fake, retail voice. However, as months passed, I became more and more frustrated by it, to the point where I started pointing out to customers who openly insulted my splints that they are medical devices I have to wear in order to avoid immense pain, if just in an attempt to get them to realize that insulting strangers for literally no reason is not okay.\n\nEven the compliments sting. I know they aren't meant to be hurtful, but they are. People compliment me on something that I did not choose, that I cannot change, that, to be honest, really sucks. They're complimenting me on having such debilitating arthritis that I cannot get through the day without these splints on my fingers, splints that have caused callouses and other such annoyances (for example, I can't pick up a glass of water without the entire restaurant turning to stare at the sudden percussion). They don't mean it that way, but that's how it is.\n\nThe questions are somehow worse than both. People inquiring as to why I wear these splints feels like a really personal violation. Would you ask somebody why they're in a wheelchair? Of course not! These splints look kind of similar to jewelry... in the same way that a wheelchair looks kind of similar to a chair. They are medical devices, and they're actually not that uncommon. But people asking about them is really uncomfortable, because I have three options: 1) Deflect the question, and potentially anger the customer 2) Lie, and potentially anger the customer (I'm a bad liar) 3) Tell the truth, and violate my own privacy.\n\nWhenever a complete stranger says something about my 'rings', whether it's an insult or a compliment or a question, it really upsets me. I tend to get short with them, just saying whatever I'm required by store policy to say, hurrying up to get the transaction over with. I'm not openly rude, or mean, or loud, or anything, just blunt and brief. I stop putting on the happy retail worker facade, and try to just get it over with. The only time I've ever gotten visibly upset was when a customer yelled at me about how 'you stupid millennials waste all your money on jewelry and other nonsense, no wonder your a\\*\\* is in retail!' I was shaken, and told the customer to have a nice day after the transaction was over, and asked if I could go on a break. I then spent my fifteen minutes sobbing in my car.\n\nI've had people grab my hands to look at my fingers- again, complete strangers, while I am working- or even try to take my rings off to look at them. That's quite rare, but still, immensely upsetting.\n\nI'm leaving retail, hopefully for good, but I'm still worried about my past reactions to people questioning my splints. When I'm out in the real world, not working, people have never asked me about them, except at places like jewelry stores, and at rehearsals, for understandable and legitimate reasons. I don't think this will be a problem once I'm no longer working at the store, but still, I am not sure if I'm in the right here for being upset.\n\nMy rings don't look like jewelry, really, because of the way they are fitted to my fingers (extremely tight so as to properly maintain my knuckles, not like rings), and because of their shape, and because they lack any ornamentation at all. Though I do understand the curiosity, I don't think it's an excuse to ask a stranger about it. To me, it's like asking someone why they have a cast, or crutches, or a hearing aid, or any other medical apparatus. It doesn't make sense to me that people should be excused for ignorance, because my splints are just that- splints. Medical apparatuses. And, why would you openly insult or question someone's fashion choices? Is it okay to criticize a tattoo, or to ask someone why on earth they need to wear those shoes?  That side of it doesn't make sense to me either, for reasons of common courtesy.\n\nI will have to wear these reminders of a time of incredible physical and psychological pain for the rest of my life, or I will return to that point of pain. AITA for getting upset when complete strangers point it out?",

      "description": "I noticed I had not seen a male friend of mine and my husband’s on any social media since the start of the week. No post, no comment, no likes since Sunday. He wouldn’t respond to texts either. My hubby is the one who primarily talks to him since I don’t talk to male friends without my hubby around. It’s my rule and my hubby hub hub respects that. Anyways, yesterday we finally got a hold of him and asked him if he was ok. Yes. Why did he leave social media. \n\n“Because of Valentine’s Day” he said. He does not like being on social media during Valentine’s Day because he thinks couples bully singles and shove their relationships down everyone’s throats. He also claims its just a “Hallmark holiday” that exists for the sole reason of making corporations money. Shit like that. It’s why he takes a social media break. \n\nWell, come to find out he muted mine and my hubby hub hub’s joint account (I don’t have one without him), and the accounts of other couples because we do nothing but brag about our relationship. I told him that our account is ours and we can do whatever we want with it. If he can’t be a supportive friend and be happy for us sharing our love, then he doesn’t need to be a friend of ours. \n\nHe got real mad at that because he claimed he doesn’t complain about Valentine’s Day, only get off social media. Me and my hubby hub hub told him that him not supporting us is the problem. It’s a silent way of complaining. Him muting us on social media is complaining. Him leaving social media for a week because of Valentine’s Day is complaining. It’s him throwing a temper tantrum because he thinks he’s a victim of something he’s not. \n\nHonestly, I’m glad he’s not in our lives anymore. ",

      "description": "It all started when me and a friend(Ronny) started a minecraft server. We had our own town named Pallet town and we made our houses together as one \"colony\". Other friends joined but more specifically a guy named \"7\". \n7 is in his own colony and is constantly mining the ground to have a massive underground base. Diamonds are his fuel source(relevant for later). Over time Ronny decided to disband from Pallet Town but our houses were still very close and I was upset so there was tension. \nIn comes friend \"bomb56\". He joined Pallet town with me and we built some more cool stuff. Tension had built in Pallet Town as Ronny wasn't very far from us and its possible that I was paranoid but as leader of the server I proposed a rule that you HAD to declare war verbally/over chat to make attacks on someone else, this might've been triggered by me logging on and seeing that my 3x3 redstone door was destroyed but this was 6 years ago so that could've been a creeper/dont remember.\nThe people of the server didnt like the rule but agreed. A couple days go by and I found that about 36 of my diamonds that I hid in a chest behind a painting(not the greatest hiding spot I know) were totally missing and since Ronny was the only person that was ever close to my house I became suspicious. I asked him if he took them and he declined but I didn't believe him. I asked him how many he had and he said something like 12. I went into the server files to check his ender chest and found that he had EXACTLY as many as I had PLUS however many he said he had, which would be 48 in this case and I took it as a sign of war, there was no way he didnt take the diamonds according to what I saw. \nI didn't tell Ronny that I found this information. Me and bomb56 planned to destroy his castle and started farming gunpowder for an entire day. Later that night we completely destroyed his castle while he was in it, killed him multiple times, and stole his stuff. It might've been the most enjoyable feeling ever( while knowing that Ronny took my diamonds).\nEveryone on the server hated me for my actions not only because I broke the rule that you HAD to declare war before any actions but also because it turned out that Ronny was totally innocent and our friend \"7\" is the one who actually took my diamonds for his mining purposes.I was just a coincidence that amount of diamonds that Ronny had was as close as it was to how many I lost. I was ostracized from the group at school for a good 2 weeks and ruined Minecraft for everyone. \n\n6 years later we joke about it but now we wanna know what Reddit thinks.",

My wife doesn't have direct deposit set up on her paychecks.

Luckily the money doesn't come out until tomorrow and we still haven't deposited her paycheck. I asked her to please drop it off before work or on her break so that its in the account before the bill comes out. She did not and isn't off until after our bank closes. I had just got off work and texted her that I would be stopping by to pickup the paycheck. When I arrive she is clearly hurt that I stopped by her work \"asking for money.\" Am I the asshole?

I pretended to have a panic attack to a worker who was bringing carts. Nobody stopped me, a loss prevention officer didn't tackle me to the ground. The phone has a 0% charge and seems to be wiped. I am going to charge it and see if it works. It does power on. Btw this isn't my main Target I go to. Was I an asshole? They weren't being sold, just recycled. Technically I \"recycled\" it.

      "description": "I placed an IKEA order for a couch, table, and 2 chairs, and paid for truck delivery (since we live in the city and do not own a car) for Saturday between 5-9 pm.  \nI received a voicemail call from the delivery service on Friday confirming the delivery time and my address. They said I would be called 30 mins before they arrived\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n• I received no call and furniture didn't come between 5-9 on Sat.\n\n• I called at 10 pm. got transferred 3 times the 4th person told me the driver signed off at 8 he wasn't feeling well I could rescheduled the delivery for 9-1pm on Sunday.\n\n• I was upset so I filled out a form and sent IKEA a complaint, saying I rescheduled but wasn't impressed they didn't even let me know and i had to call to reschedule after being stood up. Especially since I was paying for this delivery fee, and it wasn't delivered.\n\n• 8:09 am on Sunday I woke up to a call saying they are on their way and will arrive at 8:40. I'm excited, might be able to pull of this surprise, assuming they realized they screwed me and am dropping off my stuff asap :) i get up shower quick and get ready.\n\n• They never come. At first I thought I misheard him, maybe he said 9:40 and my half awake brain didn't process. Then figured maybe he called his entire list for that time window. So I wait.\n\n• 1:15 pm and no follow up call or furniture. I call customer service for the delivery company. They're closed on Sunday. So I leave a message, explaining the situation and politely inquiring about my delivery and when it should arrive, leaving my order number, phone number and name\n\n• 2 pm I call the phone number of the driver who woke me up that morning. ask for an estimate delivery time he says he will check and call me back.\n\n• 2 15 IKEA emails me back saying glad I rescheduled and to call a specific number for compensation once it comes. \n\n• 230 Dude calls me back. checked with dispatch, calling me was a mistake he doesn't have my order on his truck. I ask if he knows who has it or when it should arrive and he says its scheduled for 5-9 pm\n\n• I wait. that evening It still doesn't come. \n\n• 945 pm I call IKEA. With the generic 866-866-IKEA number on the website. No one answers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's Monday morning almost 11 am. I am at work. Will be calling IKEA during my lunch. I have been charged for the furniture and delivery service that I did not receive. I was given 3 false delivery times.\n\nI usually never complain to companies or about stuff and try to give, benefit of the doubt, to them in situations but this was a terrible experience and I am kind of expecting that they give me some sort of compensation. IDK what companies normally do but something more then just waiving the delivery fee would be nice (hell even receiving the furniture I paid for at this point would be just nice) but **Am I the asshole for expecting them to compensate me for this bullshit?**",

      "description": "I work at a major retail hardware chain in the US part time. I sell appliances. This has been an ongoing problem in multiple departments over the 3 years I have worked here.\n\nThere is currently a woman, “Erika”, who also works in appliances and a customer service associate, which is my exact same job title.\n\nPart of working in appliances is pulling appliances off of the floor and off of shelves for customers or for display or for deliveries.\n\nShe outright refuses to do it and plays it off by playing up the “I’m a tiny girl” act.\n\nSo I’m 20 years old and I hurt my back last year doing all of the labor in this department so I sent an email to my boss and he responded and literally said “women sell more” so he preferred me to be the one doing the lifting but he still wants me to be on the sales floor as much as possible because Erika still can’t even do all of the sales floor component of the job.\n\nSo I wrote and called into district management who called me and told me they’d talked with the store management and then the store manager talked to me and apologized and said we both had to do our “fair share”.\n\nOkay. So then today Erika asks me to get items down for her. I told her I no because I had my own work list from our boss to do and because I never ask her to do my work. She said, “I don’t know why you can’t do it, you’re being an asshole.”\n\nMy opinion is that if she can’t do the manual part of the job, she should be on a cash register, or not work here at all. Imagine a female surgeon refusing operate because of some bullshit like “that’s icky man’s work”.\n\nIt’s the principle of the thing. I shouldn’t have to do her job too just because she has two X chromosomes.  \n\nBut I am open to changing my mindset if I am the one in the wrong. AITA? Note that I said she was a tiny girl earlier, but she’s 1000% capable of doing the work and I’d be willing to get big things like refrigerators that she legitimately couldn’t handle. That said, Even if she couldn’t physically do it, that’s no excuse and she should work another job within this company, or somewhere else entirely. ",

      "description": "Ugh this whole thing is so petty, but please hear me out.\n\nSo the other day as I was heading home from work, I call up my fiance (let's call him Sam) to ask if he wants me to bring him anything to eat. He tells me that he's not at home and hanging out with some friends- I say hello to everyone (I was on speaker) and say I'll see him later then. Maybe 5 minutes later as I am driving, one of Sam's friends calls me and says something like \"Tell Sam to let me see his phone! He was going to show me something on his phone, but I joked that I was going to go through his phone and now he won't let me see!!\" Meanwhile, I hear my fiance in the background \"Say no!\" etc etc. So, obviously they're all being silly and just to poke fun I side with his friend and say stuff like \"Let her see it, be nice!\" Sam: \"WOW, really?? You're so in the doghouse\"-Mind you all of this (I thought) was all in fun, and not serious. \n\nLater that day when Sam gets home, come to find out he is actually legitimately upset that I didn't \"back him up\"/\"take his side\". He tells me \"When \\[friend\\] threaten to call you, and told them to go ahead and call because I just knew you'd take my side\" I tell him sorry I was just kidding around I didn't think this was a serious situation. Days later (today), he brings it up again saying things about how it hurt his feelings how I automatically didn't take his side, we're supposed to be a team, and he felt that our relationship was disrespected. I (once again) express that I didn't think the situation was that serious, this whole thing is ridiculous, I don't understand why he's so upset about this and I don't know what he wants from me. I also point out that I don't always have to \"take his side\" because we're allowed to have differing opinions. He claims it's not about always agreeing and that I am disregarding his feelings.  \n\nSo am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Hello all and welcome to my post. I recently been called an asshole and I really don't see how I would be considered an asshole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly let me say, me and my ex were long distance for about 8 months(according to her even though it was maybe a 30 min drive) and she broke up with me because she didn't want the distance and told me that she still wanted to be friends and when she did move down closer, which she planned on doing, we could try to date again. \n\nBut after about 3 days past of us being split i noticed her posting more about a new \"friend\" and them hanging out all the time. I didn't think much of it at first, until she messaged me saying that she still wants to be close friends(she empathized the close) and we may get back together if her situation doesn't change. I asked her if she planned for a change she said maybe and that she is talking to someone currently and i found out from her friend that she was talking to him while we were dating.\n\n For the past 2 days she has been posting how depressed she is and how guys are jerks and how no one will ever love her. I decided not to say anything about it because i feel like it is not my place for that anymore and i truly do not care for her problems anymore after everything and basically being the \"back up\". She has been calling me a lair and a asshole for not being there for her and ignoring her. ",

      "description": "  \n\nSo, today newish RGM pulls me aside in the morning along with the AGM, and I could tell I was in trouble, but I hadn't the slightest clue what it could've been about. Well, they tell me that my coworker/crush of a little over a year complained about me sexually harassing her. I feel it should be pointed out that this is the day after our new RGM has had one-on-ones with the staff to try to find/solve some under-the-hood issues that you don't noticed/don't have time to address mid-shift, with one of the questions during said event being \"have you noticed or had any problems with sexual harassment?\" Paraphrasing, \"It''s been brought to my attention that you've been repeatedly asking out coworker/crush despite her telling you no each time, and that is sexual harassment..\" and you get the idea.\n\nLet me just say that each and every time I asked (at least 4 times over 13 months.) she never gave me a straight answer. The most recent example being from two days ago, which went like this.\n\nMe: Do you have Valentine's day plans?\n\nHer: Hmmm, maybe. I don't know. Why?\n\nMe: Well, if you don't, I'd like to treat you to dinner.\n\nHer: Yeah, I know.\n\nThen I just kind of accepted the rejection - because that's what it was if history is anything to go by - as I'm used to by now and walked away to get back to work. She's not the first nor will she be the last, I'm sure.\n\nSo, yesterday being Valentine's day, I'd gone to the florist the day prior and bought just a rose and a card to write a little corny poem for her. I gave them to her when she came in that day, because whether she wanted to go to dinner or not, my feelings were the same either way. What mattered wasn't the outcome, just the simple idea that she meant enough to me to warrant a special gift on a day like Valentine's day. I didn't bring the date up again, I just gave them to her and wished her well and went back to work. Whether this was the last straw, or it just happened to be an unfortunate coincidence with the questioning and V-day is something I ponder, but is ultimately irrelevant to the discussion I suppose.\n\nIt was never my intention to make her feel like I was sexually harassing her; I often go out of my way to stay out of her proximity and keep out of conversations she's part of. Partially to give her space and partially because it's my own defense mechanism that keeps me from making an ass of myself in front of her. I honestly feel really conflicted with how this shook out, because on the one hand I don't feel like I did something wrong enough to warrant the penalty, but I don't feel like I'm absolutely faultless either. I definitely could have \"taken the hint\" or resolved that if she wanted to see me, she would have said yes/remembered in the first place. Truthfully, I wish she'd said \"No, I'm not/will never be interested,\" the first time so that I could have tried to move on instead of nursing a glimmer of hope in the back of my mind for the better part of a year.\n\nAITA for having hope",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay my husbands friend for studio recording time?",
      "description": "The title indicates that its my money but I'm going to state upfront that me and my husband have a joint account so it is our money. I make more money than him so he has a tendency to ask me about big purchases but I always tell him hey you don't need to ask me to spend our money but if you're unsure about the state of our finances feel free to have a discussion about it with me. That being said, here's the specific situation we're in now.\n\nSo my husband is in a band with his two friends (lets call them Tom, the drummer, and Jim, the bassist). They're not big or trying to become big, but they do play shows locally and have recorded music before and it's on Apple music and such. The recorded their first EP about a year ago and Tom has a best friend (lets call him Connor) who has a recording studio. Connor let them use the recording studio for free/helped record for the first EP. \n\nThey've been working on songs for their new EP and decided they want to record this one as well. A few weeks ago, my husband suggested to Tom and Jim that his friend Dave has a recording studio that he would let them use for free. Tom said that he didn't want to go behind Connor's back and use another recording studio so my husband and Jim said that's fine, they can use Connor's studio again. So they recorded this new EP last week or so. Then yesterday, my husband gets a text from Tom asking for $100 to help pay for the recording. Tom never mentioned having to pay but my husband still feels obligated because he doesn't want any issues with the band. I say obviously if he wants to spend $100 for this, he should do what he wants because again, it's not just my money. Then my husband asks what I think of the situation and what I would do. \n\nI think it was a super asshole move of Tom to not tell them beforehand that it would cost money. Yes technically we have $100 but we're in the midst of planning for a wedding (we got courthouse married and are having the reception in a few months) which Tom knows that we are doing, so money is tight right now. Also my husband took a new job that has potential for growth but was a pay cut from his last job, so again, money is tight. I told my husband that if this was my friend, I'd let them know that I think it's incredibly rude that they didn't tell me beforehand that I'd have to pay, that I would never do that to my friends, and I probably would stand my ground and say that I'm not paying for this. But again, I told my husband it's his band and if he really does want to pay them then fine but I don't think it's a good idea and kind of sets a bad precedent that we can just be gouged for money whenever and we'll role over and pay it.\n\nI feel like maybe I'm being a cheap asshole though? I know recording studio shit takes time and stuff so I don't want to make it seem like I don't value someone's time and help. But Tom already paid his friend and I think if he wanted us to pitch in he should have told us. And like I said my husband had a friend who said he would do it for free.\n\nTLDR AITA for thinking that my husband shouldn't pay his friend/bandmate for studio recording time because he didn't tell him it would cost money beforehand?",

Slowly over the last month I’ve came to believe that their mind was already made up and approached them about it today. They said that wasn’t their plan and apologized. We both now agree the marriage won’t work and is headed for divorce. They currently have a conditional green card based on their marriage to me. I did some brief research and it looks like divorce will not help their case for permanent status but as long as the marriage wasn’t a sham they should still be fine. They start talking about staying together just so they can get their immigration status and I said no way. They made the point that it would help me with finances. It’s true that it would be tough without them but I can do it. They start saying stuff like remember the good times, don’t I trust them, and that they would do it for me etc etc. I’m pissed that they would even suggest we pretend to still be married for another year. Am I being selfish? They said they couldn’t believe I didn’t at least sleep on it. Am I wrong to be so quick and stubborn on my stance? AITA?",

Keep in mind I have never given a hikey before and had no idea how I did. She was forced to tell one of our close friends and it got weird.  But the weirdest part was that she still would pretend like it never happened. Now it’s been 2 years and she has told her bf who she is still dating and we are still very close but I can tell we are continuing to drift. She seems to think that this is my fault and I should respect her choice to pretend it never happened and never speak on it again.

      "description": " \n\nFirst, duplicate account, because if I am  the asshole I'd rather process that hard truth quietly to myself instead  of having it lurk in my reddit history for anyone to see.\n\nSecond,  context: $Friend is someone I met in college. She has gone through a  lot of very traumatic shit, including an abusive household with parents  who on the regular manipulate her. I don't want to go into details on  all of that, but I do want to acknowledge that she comes from a pretty  toxic background.\n\nThird, TL;DR (put at the front, as per a recent LPT I saw):\n\n\\- I have a friend with anxiety issues that probably qualify as mental illness\n\n\\-  I have done a lot for this friend. Like, a lot. But the most relevant  are loaning her $2,000 and giving her a ride to work everyday and a  couch to sleep on nearly every night for two and a half months.\n\n\\-  I told what I thought was a funny anecdote about her at a company  get-together (she and I both work for the same company), which caused  her to become upset with me and accuse me of being a shitty friend.\n\n\\- I blew up on her.\n\n\\-  Recently learned that she told a mutual friend she was afraid of me,  but it looks to me like that she's using me as a scapegoat to avoid  responsibility for a financial obligation.\n\n\\-  Am I the asshole for blowing up? Am I being too hard on her?  Insensitive to her emotional needs? Or is she being an asshole for using  me? Throwing me under the bus to cover for her personal and  professional failures?\n\n\\- It's a VERY long read. It's a doozy. With months of things boiling up to a point.\n\nFourth, the story:\n\nMe  and this friend met way back in college, and while we are not and never  have been romantically involved we spent enough time around each other  that multiple rumors popped up that we were secretly cheating on our  respective S/Os. Generally, these rumors never bothered me because,  honestly, in college I was definitely the kind of asshole who didn't  give a shit what anyone else thought about anything if it didn't effect  me in an immediate and direct way. Looking back on it, I cringe. But  hey. That's who I was, and I try my best to own that part of my life-- I  don't make excuses for myself and I try hard to acknowledge when I'm in  the wrong. So part of me posting here is, I guess, checking to see if  I'm still that asshole.\n\nAfter college,  me and $Friend kept in touch. My S/O and I broke up for unrelated  reasons, and I ended up leaving the country for a bit after graduation. I  was pretty heartbroken and lonely, and yeah, I know leaving a country  due to a breakup is overly dramatic. So sue me. While overseas, I got to  missing a lot of my old friends from college, so I saved up my money  and flew $Friend to where I was along with her S/O.\n\nI  came back to the U.S. a little over a year later, and shortly after  that $Friend and her S/O broke up. I didn't get involved-- I was close  to both of them, and didn't want to be put in the awkward situation of  choosing sides.\n\nYears go by, and we're  thick as thieves. End up going overseas together again-- she lost her  passport, and the night before the flight I helped her find it by  tearing her apartment apart. It's a fun anecdote.\n\nShe  ends up getting with a new $S/O, who I've since become very close to as  well. Cool dude. Laid back, easy going kind of guy. I briefly ended up  with a new S/O, the Bad Ex who ended up cheating on me and spreading a  lot of false rumors about me. Luck of the draw, I guess. Now, maybe it's  because the whole time I was overseas no one I used to be super close  to ever reached out to me or even knew I had left the country, and that  HURT. So when my ex started spreading shit about me, that REALLY got  under my skin--- I had felt like I had finally built some real  friendships, only to find that people I'd known for years were willing  to ditch me in a heartbeat. Of those, I ended up getting an apology from  one of them-- he later found out through someone else that my Bad Ex  was lying, and sent me a message on social media apologizing for not  believing me. I don't know if he was the only one who ever found out,  the only one who ever ended up believing me, or the only one who was big  enough to admit he did me wrong, but I have a massive amount of respect  for the dude. My point here is that while I was an asshole, I am not  and was not the kind of person who regularly used or manipulated other  people to settle some kind of vindictive streak. (Which was the specific  thing I was accused of by my Bad Ex when she got caught cheating, and  will become relevant later) But, for all of those reasons, those kinds  of accusations hit a very sore spot for me.\n\nNow,  sometime later, I end up leaving my really shitty job and I get a new  job working at the same company as $Friend, on her recommendation.  Shortly after that, due to the death of my grandmother, I ended up with a  small inheritance. It was a lot of money, to be sure, but I wasn't like  ultra rich or anything like that. $Friend mentions, in multiple  conversations, how lucky I was to get this inheritance, as it would play  no small part in me paying off some minor debts. (I wasn't close to my  grandmother at all, and she'd been catatonic for the better part of  three years-- so this isn't a \"Fuck your grandmother\" kind of  conversation. It's very much a \"Wow! What a windfall!\" kind of  conversation.) And she also mentions how burdened she is by debt  herself. Now, I've got my own stuff I have to take care of, but I'm in a  much better position financially than she is. So these conversations  were REALLY uncomfortable for me, because, real talk, I didn't want to  share my money, and it very much felt like that's what it was coming to.\n\nFinally,  one night she calls me, crying and sobbing about how overwhelming her  debt is. She beats around the bush a lot, but I finally bite the bullet  and say, \"Alright, you know what? I'll pay for some of it. How much is  your credit card debt?\"\n\n$2,000. Not as  bad as it could be-- I had never owned a credit card, but I've read  stories about people who are in debt their entire lives. Besides, she  DID help me get my new job. Which I love very much. But I need that  money to pay for my own stuff-- my car, my new apartment, moving, etc.\n\nSo  I tell her, \"I'll loan you $2,000, but I want it back. Not all at once,  but in a way that'll help you out of this hole you're in. We get paid  weekly, so I want $25 per paycheck. If you can't do it sometimes, that's  fine. Let me know-- I'm not going to come break your kneecaps over it,  but I DO want my money back.\"\n\nShe  agrees, but under one condition: I do NOT tell her $S/O. See, he doesn't  know about the credit card debt, and a condition he has for marrying  her is she gets her debt under control. Until then, he tells her when  she brings it up, marriage is off the table because he doesn't want to  be blindsided by that.\n\nI think that's a little odd, but whatever. Their relationship isn't any of my business.\n\nAnd,  to her credit, she does uphold her end of the bargain mostly. There are  some months where she can't afford to pay out anything-- and generally I  tell her \"Not a problem, get it to me when you can.\" She ends up paying  about 1/3 of what she owes, and I was, truthfully, quite happy with  that. I'm not a mobster-- I'm not harassing her over this.\n\nWell,  one day, the tags on her vehicle expire, and she can't get the time to  go and renew them. How about we just carpool to work, since we live in  the same city, work in the same company? She'll split the gas with me.  Hell yeah. I'm happy with this arrangement, too. At first.\n\nBut  the thing is, it gets to a point where being around her is just a  constant drain. She's always depressed about something--- and I want to  be a good, supportive friend, but I need a break. But she's feeling  anxiety about her apartment because she hasn't cleaned in awhile and she  \"doesn't have the spoons to deal with that right now\", and then she  accuses our company's IT guy of sexual assault and her boss is breathing  down her neck about some paperwork that needs to be filed and HR can't  find video footage of the assault because (she says) IT guy must have  erased it and the company's quotas aren't being met, and her job is  really difficult and so on and so forth. And $S/O is absolutely nowhere  to be seen during all of this--- he's always busy. He's in the military  and about to deploy, so when he's not on base he's trying to get in as  much time with his other friends as he can before he ships off to not  see them again for a few years. And she's upset and anxious about that,  too. And I want to be a good, supportive friend, but $Friend is always  upset about SOMETHING, and I'm a pretty social person but I have  absolutely no time to myself.\n\nMy daily routine has become this:\n\n\\- I wake up, shower, dress, get ready for work\n\n\\- I carpool $Friend, who is usually on my couch, to work\n\n\\- I work.\n\n\\-  I carpool $Friend back to our city. Sometimes we drop by her apartment  so she can get her work clothes for the next day. She then returns to my  couch. Sometimes, she needs to run other errands, and I take her there,  too, because she can't renew her tags due to some technical difficulty.\n\n\\-  She stops paying me back for the credit card debt. Times are tough, she  says, and she's got no money. Do I have any idea how hard it is to be a  woman in this economy? (She gets paid about $3 more than I do, so this  comment annoys me. I ask her, on multiple occasions, where all of that  money is going. She argues that because she's in a higher tax bracket  than I am, she actually makes less than I do. I don't buy it--- I point  out that she gets paid more after taxes than I do before taxes. The  argument goes on in circles. I eventually give up and the $25",

She gives us the whole “it will be my responsibility and I’ll take of it” speech so gf agrees and gf daughters bf gets her a mini weenie dog. Fast forward a yr and she’s hardly ever staying here, leaves the dog that spends his days either barking or crying (not to mention using the hallway for a restroom) here while she goes and stays with her bf for days at a time and refuses to take him with her and won’t allow us to find him a home. I feel like I’m the bad guy for not wanting the dog here anymore because aside from being annoying he’s not a bad dog just needs some attention that no one cares to give him here. Gf won’t put her foot down and I’m reluctant to say anything bc I know it will come out of frustration and sound assholish. I honestly don’t know if it’s me and I need to just chill or I’m in the right, what I do know is that I’m not comfortable in my own home. So new reddit friends AITA??",

      "description": "I work at a small chain restaurant as a server/waitress. Some information to know before hand is the hours of our restaurant change between summer and winter. This is because we don’t make enough business during winter, to keep open later. During the summer we were open 11am to 9pm. During the winter our hours became 11am to 8pm. We posted it on our door about the change of hours, but our boss refuses to change our hours on google. (I couldn’t tell you why.) This has been a problem most winter and most people are generally understanding about it. Tonight I had a woman and her husband come in at about a quarter after 8, (I had not locked the doors yet because we still had customers in the restaurant finishing eating) and I apologized to them stated that we were closed. She looked around the restaurant saying that we didn’t look closed. I explained to her that our kitchen closes up at 8 and that the customers still there were finishing eating. She looked a little angry at this point so I apologized again, and asked them if they would like to order some ice cream. (The ice cream machine is shut down by the servers not the cooks. I hadn’t shut it down yet, and I felt bad they couldn’t order food, so I wouldn’t have minded scooping the ice cream for them.) She huffed at me telling me that she wanted food not ice cream, which I totally understood, but then she started raising her voice. I don’t remember her exact words but it was something along the line of “Online says you’re open till 9. This is ridiculous. The only reason we came here was because we saw it was open online. You seriously can’t just take one more order?” I apologized and explained why the online hours were wrong as kindly as I could. She got even angrier and snapped at me again saying about the same thing as before just louder. At this point I was so exhausted with the situation, I asked them to kindly leave. She was steaming, but left finally. I felt really bad afterwards for driving away a customer. I feel like this whole situation could have been avoided if I had just taken her order and taken the heat from the cooks. I’m not sure I handled the situation correctly. I’m worried they will tell people about the situation and that some people will get the wrong idea about our restaurant. \n\nTLDR \nWoman and her husband came in after close because our hours were wrong online. I wouldn’t take their order because the kitchen had closed already. The woman got mad and I asked them to leave. Probably driving away their business for good. ",

      "description": "My husbands best friend lives with myself and my husband and our toddler. The dynamic works well as we have known his best friend (let’s call him Tom) since high school. We are all in our late twenties. Tom has been living with us and contributing to the household for a year now. I have no problems with Tom as he is very considerate, tidy and financially contributes to me and my husbands mortgage. \n\nTom has fallen hard for a girl he’s been seeing for three months now. She’s nice and admittedly I liked her at the start. Lately however she’s been rubbing me off the wrong way. Her and I are very different, she’s a student who likes to go out and party, and I’m a mom. Our core values are different. Plus we just don’t get on. Superficially we are friendly to each other, but inwardly I know I just don’t like her. It’s not because she’s rude or anything. It’s because she and I have different lifestyles, plus I’m raising a small child, I don’t really want my child around her. She vapes and smokes weed (not around us or at our place) , and I don’t want my child around someone that does that. \n\nAnyways things came to a head, she is staying every weekend and I am over it. I told my husband to tell Tom that either he ends it with her, or he moves out. My husband became quite defensive telling me that toms girlfriend has done nothing wrong, that Tom is helping tremendously with the mortgage and that I’m the problem here. \n\nSince my husband wouldn’t have that talk I approached Tom myself. Told him I was seriously unhappy with her being here and that I think it’s time for him to move out. Admittedly he was quite upset. He decided to break up with her, he made it clear to me that it’s not my fault however and that he enjoys staying with us and will continue doing so for awhile. \n\nHowever my husband had a seperate chat to him, and Tom confessed to being miserable now that he’s stopped seeing this woman. I have empathy, but at the same time, I feel this is my family home, I shouldn’t be made to feel like this in my own home. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to give him the option to move out or not be with her. So AITA ? \n\nTDLR; asked my flatmate to move out or break up with his gf. ",

      "title": "AITA Not Believing a Friend's Reason for IG Drop",
      "description": "Sorry on mobile,  so please forgive any format weirdness. \n\nMet a friend 8 years ago through work when I moved to a new city, but became better friends about three years ago.  We were the kind of friends that hung out after work at our houses or going out with other coworkers.  We've hung out with each other's significant others all together.  I considered her the closest friend I had in that new city next to my spouse.  \n\nLast summer I had to move across the country.  Before I left she threw a party for me with our work friends and had a really awesome goodbye.  We were already IG pals (no FB for either of us)  and we also agreed to keep in touch. \n\nFor the first few months all was good,  we texted  each other several times a week about life,  my old job and how everyone was, how my new town and job were.  Then I noticed I was no longer able to see her IG account. I texted her and asked if something was up with that,  and she said another friend had said the same thing.  She said she'd add me back on her account.  A few weeks went by with nothing.  I felt awkward bringing it up again because then I thought it might be on purpose.  But then my spouse said just ask again,  and if sounds fishy then you know she took you off on purpose.  I agreed to do that. \n\nWhen my friend texted me next,  I texted back and included a question if she got her IG account fixed since I still couldn't see her name.  She then takes a day to reply.  She claims she doesn't really use IG anymore.  But I know this isn't true since we have mutual friends and she was a constant poster,  so I really think she's lying and purposely took me off but won't explain why.  My feelings are so hurt,  and now I'm rethinking how good of friends we really were.  I never replied after her message,  and she hasn't texted me again.  It's been almost two months now. \n\nAITA for not replying and in essence ending what connection we had,   or is she TA for cutting me out and just not being honest about it? ",

      "description": "Ok first off I don’t like sharing especially when it comes to my clothing. I absolutely hate it when my sisters wear my clothes especially without asking me or letting me know. If I see them wearing one of my shirts I won’t flips out or anything but I will let them know that I don’t appreciate it when they wear anything that’s mine. Not only that but my mood will flop as soon as I see them with a garment I own. \n\nSecond, my sisters have a tendency to buy things they don’t need like clothing they’ll only wear for one occasion and that’s it. I’m more of a comfort over fashion kind of person so I buy my clothes accordingly. I’m the one that owns more casual things then all three of my sisters combined and I do have a few formal dresses here and there but I don’t even wear their clothes for the reason that I don’t want them wearing mine and also because they’re style just isn’t mine. \n\nThird, one of them is very careless, let’s call her A and every time she burrows clothing from any of us she will give it back damaged or stained. For example she burrowed two pairs of high heels from one of my sisters B and one of the heels from one pair was broken like wth. The other looked like she walked on mud and then put the shoe on so now her freaking toe stains are on them they’re disgusting.  B never tells her anything because one she’s a pussy and very non confrontational so A burrows her T-shirt’s and returns them with sauce stains or stain them with Clorox from work that we can’t wash off. \n\nSo the point is that A came in my room yesterday and asked to burrow a shirt. At least she asked I guess but she picked my favorite T-shirt. It was white and definitely two sizes smaller than what she wears. I told her no but I was half asleep and she just took of with it. Once I noticed she had taken it I went to her room and confronted her about it and she was like “i thought you said yes” so I just rolled my eyes and told “ok whatever just fucking take it.” Later B told me that she didn’t wear my T-shirt and then I felt like an ass for not letting her burrow it. A later returned my T-shirt to my room and placed it neatly on the bed as if rubbing it on my face that i was mean for not letting her burrow it. \n\nI just don’t understand why tf they buy clothing they’ll only wear once and come and steal my comfy casual clothes that they definitely don’t even fit in.

      "description": "So I'm honestly feeling like shit here. \n\nI play magic the gathering, the multiplayer commander format (instead of 1v1, it's usually 4 players all playing each other). I was in a group with 3 guys. Let's call them Jack, Harry and Fred.\n\nFred was playing a newish deck that he hadn't played much, and was basically out of the box new. Harry was playing a dirty deck that would just control everyone else play, and Jack was playing a mid range deck (so not broken, but not weak either). I was playing my deck, that while not broken, can win combo style, and is protection/control (I like my stuff, dont destroy my stuff style deck). I'd worked hard on my deck, and I'm proud of it. \n\nHarry talks his game way too much. He encouraged Fred to win by hitting everyone, and Fred kills Harry and Jack. Out of spite, Harry destroys some of my stuff, knowing I cant retaliate, even though it didnt affect him. That's chill, I can get it back.\n\nAt this point Harry REALLY wants Fred to win. Hes saying stuff like \"this will be easy, just hit her and shes dead,\" and \"you can do this, you can win.\" I honestly would have just let Fred win at this point, but Harry was jumping around like a jumping bean, and getting on my nerves, offering to help Fred beat me (which is kinda a no no unless you're a new player). Fred was rejecting his help, and Harry's jumpyness was stressing both Jack and I out, and I think it was pissing Fred off too. Harry was also interjecting into things, commenting on Fred's every move, and trying to point out ways to beat me.\n\nThis is where I'm not sure if I'm the asshole. Cause I feel like one.\n\nFred goes to attack me, and I wipe his board. He looks defeated, since that was the way he was going to win. I didnt have to wipe it, I could have just let the damage through and lost. But Harry, the way he was jeering, it hit something inside of me, and I was tired of his bullying (in other games he targets me, because I have \"broken cards\"). \n\nI continue to stop Fred from winning until I myself win. Fred looked so sad and defeated and angry at himself. Harry was comforting him, saying that he did well, and that he would help him teach his deck. Fred refused, and I honestly felt like harry was being condescending. I left afterwards, because I felt like a monster. I apologised, and said he did do well, and that we learn from our defeats (hes beaten me before, and I learnt from those losses, which is why my deck has gotten a lot better). \n\nI feel so angry and sad. Am I the asshole for winning because someone else was taunting me and cheering on my opponent? He didnt deserve it. Harry just pushes my buttons, and I've been nothing but nice to him, but after tonight, I feel like a monster of the way I acted. ",

I think he is responsible and all, but why not disclose that info from the start? \n\nAnyways, my main thing here is that if you are going over to a friend’s house (in a decent neighborhood too) to hang out, why not just leave it at home or in the car? Or maybe notify your host that you’re packing? That being said, should guests tell their hosts they are carrying a weapon? \n\nThoughts, anyone? AITA?",

      "description": "My (21) brother (22) has constantly been a pain in my ass for entire life, and never takes responsibility for when he fucks up. We had a vacation for my birthday planned 2 years in advance just for four guys, including myself and my brother. We were only there for a day and a half when my brother drank to much, got himself hurt and had to go to the hospital because he tried to pick a fight.  One of my friends had to pay a hefty hospital bill for him, and when we got back to the hotel, they told us we couldnt stay, so we had to end our trip. No refunds, and we still had 5 days planned. When we got home, he gave me a shitty apology and didnt consider repaying me for the remaining days of the trip they we lost.  He had a drug test taken, which showed he had drugs in his system which he used as a pity move to act like he was innocent and wasnt his fault we got kicked out, even though he told me hes used hard drugs in the past. And because of that drug test, which he claims he got drugged (i dont really care if he did either way), thinks he was absolved. We share a car at  my house, and my brother usually uses it to drive to work. I told him a week in advance that i needed the car to pick up my gf because we had dinner reservations, but apparently that didnt matter to him because he decided to stay at his girlfriends house (whom he cheated on during the vacation), and thus we missed our dinner reservations.  He then crashes the car and starts flipping out people who want nothing to do with him, again deflecting the blame once he fucks uo. While ive tried to just ignore him in the past, ive become more abrasive to him and hes noticed. He always calls me an asshole if he doesnt get what he wants and one of these days i swear to god im gonna beat the shit out of him. So would i be an asshole if i reacted more cold and harshly to my cunt of a brother?",

      "description": "So my mom is friends with our neighbor for about 6 years anyways we had a plan to go to a small city today to do some grocery shopping. Our neighbor who I will call Jane, heard that we where going and my mom invited her along being nice. \n\nWe had to do some chores around our town for a bit before we left. \nWe eventually left about 2pm and the drive is usually 30 minutes long depending on the weather, 10 minutes outside Jane wants me to look at her phone to fix something so she leans forward to pass it to me. That's when I found out that she wasn't wearing her seat belt during the entire trip. \n\nI asked her nicely to please put her seat belt on, she said it was fine and my mom is to timid to really get into a fight. I assumed Jane put her seat belt on and paid no attention to it. Our first stop was Walmart after we get back out to the car she didn't put her seat belt on again and I didn't want my mom to get a ticket so I politely told her just to put her seat belt on so my mom doesn't get into trouble again she told us it's fine the cops wont see us, here I was getting a bit annoyed since I kept asking nicely. Later we head to the second hand store just to browse and again Jane didn't have her seat belt on but I ignored it because our next stop is only a block away.\n\nEventually we has our second last stop at another grocery store with a sale going on. We get back out to the car and Jane doesn't put her seat belt on again. I asked once again nicely to please put your seat belt on, Jane asked why the cops wont catch us, I responded I don't want my mom to get into trouble since all by law all passengers need to be wearing a seat belt to avoid a ticket and if we get into a serious accident my mom would be in serious trouble. Jane responded with she wont get into trouble everything will be fine. I just asked nicely once again to please put her seat belt on and Jane flat out said No.\n\nNow this is where my I lost my patience. I told her \"if we get pulled over my mom gets a ticket and if we get into a serious accident and they find out she wasn't wearing her seat belt she would get into even bigger trouble so please just put your fucking seat belt on\" only then she actually put her seat belt on and kept it on, I did say thank you and all I got was a whatever.\n\nAfter we got home I tried to apologize for somewhat yelling, Jane ignored me. Jane told me mom outside that she was mad at us. I know I shouldn't of yelled at her but it seemed to have worked. \n\nTl;dr: Jane wouldn't put on her seat belt, asked multiple time eventually got mad yelled at her, now Jane is mad at us.\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend has Sunday video game nights with his friends (we're all men) and play like Mario Kart and stuff.\n\nI'm not a huge video gamer, but I like playing from time to time.\n\nHis friends aren't particularly nice to me, they make uncomfortable jokes at my expense (nothing evil, just rude) and I don't like them much but my boyfriend doesn't have many friends and has a difficult time making them.\n\nOn this Sunday, I joined in, but left to get dinner out of the oven and when I came back I asked casually to my boyfriend \"did you miss me\" to which one of his friends replied \"we didn't even notice, just ignored you and kept playing haha\"\n\nI sort of brushed this off, but then after a while someone says \"we didn't think you wanted to play anyway\" which doesn't make sense to me because why would I be playing if I didn't? But from past events, I gather it was a sarcastic \"well you suck anyway so it doesn't matter\" kind of thing. (which is true I guess)\n\nAnyway, I said \"this is getting awkward, I'm going to get my work ready for Monday\" and left the room to do my own thing and they finished and he came into bed asking if I was okay and I said I was fine (half-true, feeling a bit shitty but not end of the world), but that I think his friends are nasty and that they don't like me around and it's best I just do my own thing on Sundays.\n\nIt means a lot for him for everyone to be together and get along,  and really important outlet for him. But I'm just really tired of his friends and do want to play games with him in a group because it can be fun when they're not making snide comments, but I don't want to listen to their snide crap. He has talked to them about it before, but it hasn't changed.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling him his only friends are assholes and being sulky over it and taking myself out of his only real social outlet when it matters much more to him?",

The next day, one of the students said “Oh, yeah, Katie (Name changed of course) posted a picture of you on their instagram story.” I had had no knowledge that my picture had been taken or posted, and I was mildly uncomfortable with that. Not so much that a picture had been taken, but that it was taken and posted without asking me. After much deliberating overnight, I spoke to the office managers, and expressed my discomfort of not being asked, but reiterated that I didn’t want the student to get in trouble. They said “Oh yeah, totally, we’ll have a quick chat about privacy and ask that it get taken down.”\n\nI went home, feeling a little bad, and talked about it with my mom, who said that the student was praising me through the picture and that I was being too hypersensitive. Now I don’t know what to feel. \n\nSo, AITA? Was I within my rights? \n\nThank you all for your opinions!",

      "description": "So me and this girl \"Kris\", met at summer camp many years ago. We're both 22, and have been together since we were 17. Anyhow, I'm a really introverted guy. I can have fun with friends just fine, especially after a few drinks, but other than that I don't really like talking to people, at all. It's not that I dislike people, I just hate talking to them. This has been an issue between the 2 of us since the beginning, and Kris always complained that I wouldn't let her in, since I'm not much for talking.\n\nI'm a guy that likes to solve his own problems, and to me talking about feelings and shit is more trouble than it's really worth. She's been upset about this though, and was telling her friends that she thought I was uninterested in her, since I never talked to her, or texted her. I was interested, of course, but I don't like talking, and her complaining about me not talking just got really annoying and naggy tbh.\n\nWhen I found out she talked to her friends about this I blew up, and started telling her that she shouldve respected MY DECISION, and that if she's gonna go behind my back like that, talking shit about me, I have no reason to stay with her, especially since she has pushed me about the communication thing for years now. I calmly told her to get out of my apartment, slammed the door shut, and promptly blocked her on everything.\n\nHer sister, and her best friend have both texted me saying that this breakup is destroying her, and that I was irrational to get so worked up about her issues with me, but I feel that our business was OURS, and that she should have taken the hint and just accepted that i dont like talking years ago. I told both of them that there was no way I was gonna \"fix\" this, and that's about the end of it for now. (It happened friday night for those wondering). So... Am I the asshole??\n\nTLDR, longterm Gf, after pushing and nagging me to talk to her more apparently started complaining to her friends that she thought i was uninterested in her, I blew up, and told her to get out. I blocked her, and have since yesterday been bombarded with messages from her sister and best friend about how \"this breakup is killing her\", but I'm not gonna fix this, she pushed me too far.

      "description": "So my(19m) Father(61m) was diagnosed with Frontal Temporal Dementia two years ago. Right now he's in the moderate to severe stage which basically entails no short term memory, poor decision making, poor communication skills and poor body maintenance. All he does these days is go on long walks and sit in silence or sleep. In the past few months my mother(58f) has had increasing trouble getting him to shower. He will never shower on his own accord so she makes him. But in the last 2 months or so he's basically been refusing. Saying he'll do it it the morning or in the evening and then never doing it or just telling you to leave him alone. So up to this point he hadn't showered or changed his clothes in 29 days. He sleeps in his shoes and clothes. He's a big guy (6ft5\"), although quite mild mannered, but we can't force him to do anything really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently my mum has been really stressed about it. She's been at her wits end for weeks and everybody else in the house can't stand the smell of him. There is literally no way to convince him or tempt him to have a shower, we've tried everything. My mum has had a couple of breakdowns this week crying and everything because it stresses her so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight I'd had enough and when everyone had gone to bed I went into the lounge where he was sleeping and just started filling up glasses and pouring luke warm water on him to wet his clothes. He got really annoyed and started walking after me to get me to stop, but I got a squirt bottle and kept squirting him as he's chasing me. This went on for like 10 minutes and he kept hiding in the lounge and when he opened the door I would wet his clothes more and he was cursing at me and shit. So basically I got him to take all his clothes off because they were soaking and he let me give him a wash with a cloth and soap because I told him mum would stop hassling him to have a shower every day. I took away his dirty clothes and got him some pajamas and new clothes for tomorrow morning to wear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now he's clean basically and has clean clothes and he stopped being annoyed by it as soon as I stopped, but idk if it was harsh to do that it does seem inhumane, but something needed to be done.",

      "description": "I left my country and settled in a far away country because i wanted a clean break from my entire family tree...i stay in touch with immediate family...i dont really like or agree with my folks (any of them) but i dont like upsetting them all the time by telling them so, so i pretty much stay diplomatic for the duration of phone calls i have to endure...\n\nMy dad is well off..and both my parents consider themselves loving and caring...but thats soo not the reality...\n\nEg. they showed their generosity to my older brother (they all love each other and get along) by buying him a house when he got married...my dad insisted on shorter term loan and cosigned the mortgage which meant higher monthly mortgage payments...my brother could not afford the payments so my dad took over the payments..fast forward 5-6 years, now my dad and mum treat my bro and his wife as if they should be at their beck and call, and almost like servants because they bought them a house...my dad even talks down to them and mum get into arguments with sister in law...i mean they get upset if my sister in law treats her own mother nicer than she treated my mum!!!! I mean cmon!!! Its her mother!!!!\n\nAnyways my parents decided that they want to buy me a house but not in the country i have been living with my husband for last 8 yrs but in my home country...this time, no mortgage, dad cosigning the property, to be paid off in 3 yrs (its £500,000 house!!! With £250 monthly maintenance fee for life!!!! Which i will be legally responsible for since i co-own the property)...i pointed out that i cannot contribute because i have to pay for my house/food here, so they should scrap the plan to buy, and if they want to help, help with the deposit for the house we want to buy here...\n\nOfcourse my dad went ahead and put a non refundable deposit down for the house in my home country...and i had no choice but to play along...but i made it clear that i wont be contributing towards the house..\n\nand lo and behold, now there is this expectation that i should be extremely grateful to them...\n\nI am soo not grateful...me and my hubby both have auto immune conditions, quality of life is sub par but we are happy living humble life we do have...now they dangle a dream in front of us that we will never get to spend our lives in and yet, i am supposed to show them gratitude!!!??\n\nNote: the house will be registered officially in mine and dads name in feb 2019...i am thinking of letting my bro have it because he is clearly putting up with all the shit i refused to put up with so maybe he deserves it",

      "description": "Now, before you guys say I’m controlling my boyfriend is very attractive and gets DMs from girls almost every day. He doesn’t meet up with them but he sucks at rejecting them and often he’ll barely hold a conversation with them, but they’ll take that sliver and run with it, trying to ask him out, or even heckling him to come see them. Even when he flat out rejects them he ends up getting thought piece like messages about their feelings and what not and I hate hearing him complain about them not respecting him enough to leave him alone.\n\nThe other day he got a dm from a girl\nWho has the same name as me. She basically was like hey we went to school together which he acknowledged and they had a brief conversation. \n\nAfterwards she DM’d him asking if he wanted to hang. Me and him were looking for something to do so I told him to say yes. \n\nShe invited him and only him to the fair with her and her son. And while I know he wouldn’t go (because he doesn’t like kids) i didn’t want him to send her an asshole message or read it and not reply. \n\nSo I went to his followers (on his account) and removed her as a follower. Once I did that I unfollowed her from his account and then blocked her. \n\nI did this without his permission and because he’s the type to looking for messages I went and sent him several DMs, cleared those notifications, and then un-sent them so that when he checks his phone it’ll look like she unsent the message(s) vs, me deleting them. \n\n\n",

      "description": "I met a girl in a dance course in October and we became very good friends very quickly and I got a crush on her.\n\nWe talked a lot and found out we had very similar life plans for things like family, home, etc. This got me pretty excited so I asked her if she was single. It turned out she was not, but still she wanted to hang out with me. It also turned out she is going for a student exchange starting in February. We started training new dance moves together even outside the course and also to cook and play board games. We started to meet 2-3 times per week and have done so for the last 3 months.\n\n  \nFor me it was quite weird that she wanted to hang out with me so much so I asked her if she was into me in December. She answered that if she wasn't in a relationship she would maybe like to be with me. I also asked her if his BF is OK with us meeting so often. She said that she doesn't know what he thinks about it and that she doesn't want hurt him, but she doesn't want that her relationship limits her life either. I said to her that I would not accept that my GF met some guy many times a week. The answer of she maybe being with me was also quite frustrating.\n\n  \nWe have kept on meeting and I am quite happy with the situation even though she is still in a relationship. I get a good friend who likes similar things, cooks great food and dancing is great fun. Still it is pretty clear that we also have romantic interest in each other even though we don't hug or do anything else romantic as I want to appreciate her relationship. I asked her about our situation again and she admitted that she has a personal crisis on whether or not she is in the right relationship. I said to her that if she really wants to be with her BF she should not hang out with me.  \n\n\nLast Sunday I met her again and it is now pretty clear to me that she is going to break up before going on exchange. I feel kind of bad for her BF because I kind of guessed that I am going to cause them to break up and our friendship is more than just friendship. I am stealing his woman, but she always wants to meet me too and often asks me to come over. I invited her to party with me and this week we are also going to get drunk together which is going to be fun!   \n\n\nAm I the asshole for actively asking her out and meeting up with her which I know is going to cause her to probably break up or is it her responsibility to take care of her own relationship?",

When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over.

I am paying rent to my parents (~£200) and I get a full mother's experience from that (although I'm trying to get her to teach me on how to use stuff / iron e.c.t.) and food + bills\n\nSo today I woke up and my family went to go pick my sister up from university. So I woke up, hung the washing up on the line and decided to play some videogames (CSGO to be specific). When my mum comes home with my sister and dad I don't immediately wish her a happy birthday because I was planning to say it when I gave her the presents I bought for her (with my sister) and I was in the middle of a competitive game which was almost finished...\n\n\nApparently I did a shit job of hanging the washing on the line, I missed a package (and I didn't even know it was arriving and didn't hear the doorbell), the parents kept threatening to turn the internet off to \"hurry\" me up, I was \"supposed to be at the gym\" or have come back from the gym. Also the fact that I didn't immediately come off the computer to \"fix\" these issues is what lead to mum blowing up at me even though if she waited ~10 minutes I would have done them as soon as I came off. She then said that I'm in a dead end job and this made something snap. I blew up and I know I did act like a bit of an arse said that I was fed up with what was a kind of controlling relationship, dad came in stood up for mum and then I stormed out of the house to cool off.\n\n\nSo first question is AMTA?

I despise it, and Idk how boring you must be to watch said videos. Thing is, some family members and college pals do watch it.

      "description": "Oh god, I know this sounds terrible.\n\nI (18m) have been dating my girlfriend (20f) for seven months. Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I (7 years together, both mid-twenties) really enjoy hiking together, especially after an awesome trip to the Alps last summer in which we did some challenging trails.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis summer, he has his sights set on a notorious ridge trail that we decided was too challenging for us last year. It is known for requiring a lot of endurance (a 10-12 hour day even if you're in good shape) and having a few spots that are pretty dangerous - as in you need to have great balance and solid footing if you don't want to fall to your death from a narrow ridge. While most of the trail is set up with cable ropes where you can attach carabiners for safety, these few spots are not. Beginners and people who aren't sure they're prepared for the difficulty are strongly discouraged from crossing the ridge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend really wants to do the ridge this summer, but I don't feel I'm experienced enough to do it (we have about the same experience level, actually I am a little more experienced than he is). We are both training for a summer of hiking but I'm not confident that I'll feel ready to take on the ridge so soon. He said that's fine, he will just go by himself. I told him that I thought he was underestimating the difficulty level and I would be upset if he went without me because I would ultimately like to go - NEXT year after another summer of gaining more alpine experience on less hazardous hikes. He is upset at me for 'forbidding' that he go by himself, whereas I don't see why he can't just wait a year so we can go together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being mad if he climbs the ridge without me this summer?",

I got out, we kissed, and went inside. \n\nOverall it was an awesome night. His house was clean and nice, so was he. The sex was phenomenal, he was really funny, if not a little boring, and I would’ve loved to see him again. \n\nHe wanted to leave to go get us breakfast, so I gave him my $10 and laid back in his bed. I heard something outside (like metal on metal) and so I just jumped and looked outside. He had backed into my car SO HARD that my bumper fell off. The entire right side is smashed. I swear it looks like he just went pedal to the metal and hit my car. He drove off went to get breakfast and I was kind of panicking on what to do. \n\nHe came back and literally acted like nothing happened. He didn’t mention my car or anything. We ate breakfast and I did mention it, and he seemed kinda surprised I mentioned it. He said it’s cosmetic and his friend could fix it for hardly anything f. \n\nI did get his insurance information, but he seemed surprised that I even asked. He said it was a small fix and he would rather just have his friend fix it. It’s a 2015 Kia Soul that I am still making payments on. I’m really mad and feel like it will cost a lost to fix. I don’t want a random friend of my hookup to fix it. \n\nWIBTA if I file an insurance claim? \n\nTL;DR Hookup hit my car.

      "description": "I'm already married but in my culture, we do three events: the vows, the bride's reception and then the groom's reception. \n\nI live 5000miles away from my parents and got married here. My parents don't quite love my husband, they've only met him twice and the one time during our vows which they flew all the way over for my dad to give me away. \n\nMy parents requests that I do at least the bride's reception as a way for my husband to meet the extended family and keep in line with tradition. I agree, so I flew back to my hometown alone in the summer and planned a wedding reception for early next year. I planned for a 100 guests, booked catering, booked entertainment, the whole thing and sent invites. It was supposed to be at my parent's home. \n\nI thought all is well, my husband and I will fly to my hometown and do the reception next year. Then two months ago my dad, who has never asked for anything from me and has given me everything, requests for an extra 50 seats for his guests. I agreed. \n\nA month ago, my mother found out about this request and went ape-shit. She's mad dad got more guests than she did! So she proceeded to invite 150 more guests of her own. Because of this, we aren't able to host the reception at our home anymore. Mother convinced me to book a wedding venue at 3x the initial cost. I then agreed, because hey, it's their day as much as mine. I transferred her all the money needed to book, changed the catering etc. \n\nLast week I found out my mother cancelled the entertainment I picked and hired street performers, the cost of the venue (which they expect me to pay) is $7k more than what they said it would, they invited people I loathe including my cousin WHO STOLE MONEY FROM US, picked a makeup artist that I did not agree to (too expensive!) and completely changed my menu. I no longer want to be apart of this. I will not show up out of principle. Invites are already sent, RSVP received. AITA? ",

      "description": "(Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile)\nI'm a first year student in college, so I am living in a dorm with my roommate. When we first got to college, we made a roommate agreement form. At the time, we were both single and what not. One of the most relevant points on this form was something along the lines of \"If you want to fuck anyone, let me know so I can either leave or not walk in on it.\"\n\nFast forward one month, and my roommate now has a girlfriend. One night, they are hanging out in the room, and I decide to go grab something from the dining hall. I tell them that I will be back in 5 to 10 minutes. I get my food and come back (I had my headphones in to listen to music), and when I come back, they were in the middle of sex. I tell them to text me when they are done so I can go back into my room, and leave. After they are done, I ask them to text me so that way I don't have to walk in on it again.\n\nThe next week, I come back from class, and they were fucking again, and yet again I had no text telling me not to come home. \n\nThis continues for almost a month until one time, I was unable to finish my homework, since I left my backpack in the room. At that point, I decide to lay down the law. I tell them that if they do that again, I will not allow her to be in our room anymore. She technically needed both my roommate's and my consent to be there anyways, so I had that power.\n\nThat same night, I am trying to fall asleep around 1:30 AM. I shift a bit and one of my headphones falls out (I sleep with headphones for silence). I then hear moans and \"daddy\". I ignore it for the night, but the next day, I sit them down and have a talk. I tell them that she is no longer allowed in our room, since they repeatedly didn't follow the one thing I asked. They could have asked me to leave or texted me, and I wouldn't have cared, but they never did. Now they are mad at and they say I'm an asshole. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I've been struggling with a large project, for a number of reasons. This is a solo project and we've been working on it for a few weeks.\n\nI've not been able to focus on my work lately due to a number of personal reasons which my friends are aware of, and I was able to get an extension for said project due to this.\n\nBy coincidence my friends had the deadline the same day as my extension and we've all been helping each other with a few issues over the course of the project.\n\nToday was the deadline and I had almost completed the project, but was running into issues I didn't understand and was unable to think of a way around it. I spent a solid few hours working away at it this morning and over the weekend, and I couldn't find a solution. I asked my friends for help, since they'd all finished this project and had a spare couple of hours before the deadline. \n\nMy friends decided they wanted to go for lunch out instead of helping me. I asked if they could go somewhere closer and come back and help me after lunch, and was told I shouldn't come with them but should work on it myself. They wanted to go to the further place as I had a discount, so I gave them the discount and then left without saying anything a couple minutes later because I was upset, and went back and tried to do some more work. \n\nI am aware I've been asking for a lot of help lately, not just with this but with other work as well as I'm struggling to keep on top of my workload with everything else going on.\n\nI didn't end up finishing the work as I was unable to find a work around. I had another friend try and help me but he's not familiar with the work and could do a limited amount, but he saw I was stressed about this and made an effort to help me. \n\nI ended up doing okay even without finishing but I'm upset with my friends for not trying to help me.\n\nThey're making plans for the weekend but frankly I don't want to see them for a while, so I'm not responding. We have plans for tomorrow night but I really don't want to go right now. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So let's start with a backstory that goes 4 years back. My friend and me were on a vacation at the seaside where we met a guy (let's call him Dave). He was a cool guy overall so we kept contact for about 1-2 years.\n\nFast forward 3 years my UNI made a picnic party. The day arrived and when I came there Dave was there and he brought a girl with him (let's call her Anna). So she was cute but a bit messy. With her dark hair, dark eyeliners and overall small figure not to mention extremly shy, she caught my eye. So we sat down at the same table, talked, drank etc. like every picnic party goes. Then it was time for chestnuts, so we gathered around the fire.\n\nWe were all just chilling there having small talk when suddenly I feel someone squeezing to me. I looked and it was Anna. A bit drunk but still not too badly, so I decided sure we can cuddle andd put my arm around her. Then the chestnuts were ready so we sat back down and ate them. Shortly after we decided to go home, so we packed a bit of booze for the walk home.\n\nAnna then wanted us to walk together and so we did. We escorted a 4th guy. Next up was Dave, and so we went towards his flat and when we arrived there he didn't want to go to sleep yet so we sat on a nearby bench and spent some time there.\n\nThen Anna drew out weed and said let's smoke it and so she started. I felt so bad because I had quit smoking weed for quite some time and this gril that was so promising was smoking it.\n\nA little backstory for weed as well I suppose. I also have a 4 years older brother and there was a scandal involving weed that I don't want to get into details which made me quit.\n\nAnyways so she passed it to Dave and he passed it to me. We drank our leftovers and then Dave decided to go to sleep. So now only Anna was left to escort. We walked slowly to her appartment and we were flirting all the way. When we arrived she was glowing of happiness and it made me feel special as well. So we stood there a while and made out when she invited me in. That's when it hit me.\n\nI've felt shivers go down my spine and I started to do whatever I could just to not get there with her, since I knew we would both regret it after. After a while I actually managed to say good night even tho I saw her sad. I then walked to my dorm which was like 40 mins from there so i had time to think everything through and decided to sleep over it.\n\n\nThe next day however I felt so much guilt cause I had broken my only rule that I ever made: to never smoke weed again. Anna tho was very excited in the morning to see me again. I shocked from my actions was trying to avoid any further contact with her, so after a few days of avoiding with lies I spit out the biggest lie of all: there's another girl and I never heard from her again. I did saw her some times at UNI after that and I still do (now she has a boyfriend) but she's ignoring me like I was air. AITA?",

      "description": "My older sister (I’m 17 and she’s 19) and I are taking a college course together (which I now realize was a terrible idea). Since the start of the class I’ve been doing all of our assignments purely because I want to avoid arguing with her. She can be really mean and hurtful when in an argument and I always end up crying (I’m also a female btw) so I basically let her push me around a lot. \n\nI eventually get fed up and tell her she couldn’t copy a homework assignment. She started yelling at me and refused to let me go to class until I gave it to her (she wouldn’t hand me the car keys). She says things along the lines of how I’m her sister and we should be helping each other out. She doesn’t have a job and she spends her time either at the gym or out with friends claiming she’s busy. She demands money from my parents (they both seem to have given up on her and just give her whatever they want so she doesn’t start yelling at them too... I sometimes think even my parents are afraid of her).\n\nShe called me an asshole and said a bunch of other personal things that she knows will hurt me. She tells me I’m useless and a terrible sister. \n\nI eventually manage to get the keys from her during the argument and I start walking towards the door. She then grabs my wrist (I have really small wrists) super tight and forces me to face her by also grabbing my face and turning it in her direction. Im pretty small so I hurt easily and at this point I was honestly scared of her. \n\nI ended up giving in and gave her the assignment.\n\nWe both get into the car and during the entire ride she is screaming at me. She’s one of those people who doesn’t let you get a word in when arguing so I sat there for a 10 minute car ride listening to her insult me. I was 25-ish minutes late to class that day because I couldn’t stop crying.\n\nThis all happened about a week ago.\n\nMy friends have all told me that I’m wrong and that it shouldn’t matter if she copies off of my work since we’re sisters. A lot of them said I overreacted and made a big deal out of nothing. I took their word for it and thought maybe they’re right but it still bothers me and I just want to know what you guys think. ",

      "description": "This happened awhile ago when I was a broke college student. Our local pizza joint had a special on Wednesday where the menu was 30% off for college students. It had been awhile since me and the when bf had a date night, so I decided to treat us. I specifically ordered a large pizza with the intention of having leftovers, because again I'm broke and I need to have my meals planned out. I even tell my boyfriend this plan. \n\n\nWe have a nice meal and I get the check and a to-go box for the half of pizza that was left. At least three meals worth, so I'm excited. We leave and my bf grabs and carries the pizza box out. As we are walking back to the dorms we see a homeless with a sign asking for money. To be honest they are everywhere since this is a tourist town and can rely on the kindness of out of towners. It always tugs on my heartstrings because that's no way to live. Anyways, as we walk past this guy he asks for money. My boyfriend tells him he doesn't have anything but holds out my pizza and says to take it. The guy mutters thanks, grabs it and places it on the ground. I'm a little stunned at this point since my bf knew that I wanted and frankly needed the leftovers. We keep walking and I turn around and see the pizza still on the ground and the guy ignoring it while continuing to panhandle. When we get back to the dorms I tell my bf how upset I am and that he had no right to give away my food. If he wanted to help he should have given away his own money. He said I was being selfish. We argued for awhile and I insisted he go buy me a small pizza to make up for it. Eventually he did, but he made me feel like a monster for wanting to keep my food. \n\nAITA for getting mad that my bf gave my food away to a homeless man? ",

      "description": "**I know the title sounds alarming, but there is considerable context.**\n\nI (27M) have a very high paying job, am engaged to a beautiful woman and have it pretty good in life. HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**",

Trying my best to feel better and keep positive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO gets snappy at me last night because I haven't gone to the dr to get it checked out. I knew it wasn't anything serious, just a bad bout of a stomach virus and it would go away with some time. I didn't want to go to urgent care and waste money on being told it was a simple stomach virus.\n\nShortly after, I mentioned that \"I didn't feel well and I'm gonna go lay down\" or something similar to that, and SO mocked me and echoed back those words. I felt hurt by this and ended up going to take a shower to relax as I was starting to feel nauseous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the shower I go to living room to lay down while SO finishes up some office work. SO comes in and wants to talk and I instantly respond with \"Please give me space, you are making me feel worse and I just need to relax.\" I was a bit abrasive with this, but I didn't like how SO never apologized for making fun of me and it was just making me feel worse getting worked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe night ended up with SO getting what was called \"silent treatment\" from me, except I was completely out of it and dozed off with a bad migraine and stomach cramping. I wake up this morning to discover SO is incredibly pissed that I didn't say anything all night to resolve the issue, and that I'm breaking our promise of \"never going to bed angry\". I didn't even know SO was up crying all night, or that they had slept on floor. SO also packed a bag to stay somewhere tonight and told me \"our relationship isn't going to be put on hold for you when you feel sick\" and that I don't respect the relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here for walling off and just wanting to rest and relax?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I (22m) saw this girl (23, call her Gal) for a total of 5 weeks.  I could tell by week 2 it wasn't going to work, but being inexperienced and from a broken home I wanted to try my best to make the relationship work.  At the end of week 5 my (friend 1) was celebrating her birthday by drinking downtown friday night.  I invited Gal, but she would only come if I didn't drink.  That would have totally killed (friend 1)'s vibe so we just set up a date for that sunday and Gal didn't come drinking, no hard feelings, I think. \n\nDetails real quick:\nBy the beginning of week 5 I had a strong feeling we needed to break up.  Not only did we not have much in common,  she was constantly mad at me because of misunderstanding what I was saying.   I'll be honest my sarcasm is a little dry sometimes but it ended up me weighing my words too frequently for me to be myself around her.\n\nBack to the end of week 5, the night we're going to go out drinking.  We're pre gaming at (friend 2)'s place and as I'm getting an uber I get a passive aggressive text from Gal about having not talked to her at all that day.  I hadn't made much of an effort to talk to her that week,  and the combination of considering breaking up and knowing I was going to see her that Sunday made me not really think about it. \n\nAnyway that text was it for me,  I knew reading it that I was intoxicated and not going to try anything rash, but was 100% breaking up with her the following day (saturday). I diffused the situation  and told her I was a little drunk and I'd talk to her tomorrow.\n\nThat night we all got very drunk.  At the end (friend 2), and two strangers, a guy and a girl (friends not dating),  came back to my apartment to drink after the bars closed.  (Friend 2) was totally set the whole night to get this girl to sleep with me.  Me, drunk as fuck with 0 game, thought this was a great idea.  I can tell pretty quick she's not interested so I drop it and just enjoy destroying these people at beer pong.\n\nAs we finish up the last game of whatever we were doing I go around for high fives.  This girl comes back with a kiss.  It was fast,  but it sobered me up real quick.  Nothing else happened and everyone left ~30 minutes later but I felt awful. \n\nThe next morning I broke up with Gal over the phone,  totally hungover, and I didn't say anything about the night prior.  My concern here is cheating.   My friends have said it doesn't matter because nothing happened,  but I don't think I would have stopped her had it continued, and I don't know how to feel about that.",

      "description": "Story goes like this and I'll try to be utmost honest about everything. \n\n I started dating my gf almost a year ago. We do LDR. I visit her every 1 and a half month. I am in Thailand and she's in UK. We have to be apart because I am a student researcher in an American university in Bangkok and she's currently pursuing her degree there. \n\n Before I dated her, she used to date one of my close friend and they were serious. While dating my friend, they fought a lot, broke up many times and my close friend cheated on her woth several women and I knew all of it. My friend also have commitment issues too. She didn't know much about him and his behaviours since they started  doing LDR in their second year and their relationship lasted for 4 years. While they broke up many times and between those different intervals, my gf had a guy that she used to see. Let's call him John. Nothing serious, just for sex. John was also having problems with his gf. \n\nThat shitbag, instead of fixing his problems with his gf, took a \"break\" from his relationship and had sex with my gf on every interval of her breakup or every occasion imaginable. Loose moral. I don't think a guy should have sex with another woman while they have a relationship on limbo. John was not absolute with his gf either and they were taking some time off. Even while sleeping with my gf, he met up with his gf.\n\nPlease note that John also had a couple of relapses with my gf after getting back with his gf after a long time and then my gf started seeing her ex, my close friend again. My close friend somehow had some hints about John but never knew the whole story. \n\nMost of the time my gf and my close friend fought was because my friend had big suspicions about John who also was, flirtatious, forthcoming and downright told my gf to break up with my close friend because they were toxic. \n\nHere's the problem. I don't trust that guy. I think that he took advantage of my gf and her vulnerable moments. I also think that it was not right for my gf to have had sex with John while he had an ongoing relationship. Before I dated her, I knew that she had a thing with John, but I found out about most of the intimate stuffs later when she told me incrementally, in episodes.\n\n \nAll in the past, am I right? No. John is now back with his gf and apparently told his gf about his past with my gf. But instead of letting the past guide his conscience, he kept inviting my gf out to bars, ball dances and even to an Ireland drinking trip on the dates that I was visiting her. It's annoying because my gf was interested in all of those offers. All of them. \n\nI don't want to be a self-righteous asshole.\n\nMost of their sex related stories happened after being drunk. I am in a long distance relationship with her and I truly love her. I worry. I told her that if John keeps flirting and inviting her out to those functions, I will have a conversation him. I told her to stay away from John too.\n\nAm I the asshole boyfriend? ",

We will check\n\nE2- Retro paychecks will be issued this Friday.\n\nE2- Payroll was just notified about the change so they didn’t let me know, but I just called. It won’t be much though since it’s only a $ .25 cent difference\n\nThis has happened before. Last year I stumble upon an article stating the state had raised the minimum wage. I noticed our pay rate had not been increased so I let my bosses know. They called payroll and retro checks were given. Same thing happened this year and I was really dreading having to tell them. I never thought they did it on purpose. I didn’t want to upset them. I really try my damn best for this job and get paid minimum so every little bit counts to me.

      "description": "I currently live two hours away from my family, and my dad’s birthday is this coming week. I don’t come home a lot, since I’m busy with school and work. I planned weeks in advance to come back this weekend before his birthday to see him and spend time with my family. I drove back Friday (yesterday) right before noon, and I went to visit my sister and her kids that evening. She asked me to take care of her two kids (8 and 2 years old) Saturday night (tonight). I, being a barely surviving college student, asked if she would pay me. She said she would, she would give me forty dollars. Keep in mind, this would mean bringing her kids come over around 6pm, and she would have them stay overnight, picking them up in the morning. I told her that I would think about it, not saying yes or no.Now, today she was talking to my mom about her plans for the evening and she mentioned that I was going to be taking care of them. I asked her if she would pay me sixty, and she got upset. She got mad and I told her that if she was going to have them stay the full night then I wanted at least sixty. She started to cry, and my mom got upset as well.\n\nI personally don’t think I was unreasonable, even if she is my sister. She doesn’t use babysitters or a babysitting service, only relying on family to take care of them. I take care of them almost every single time I come back to visit. I am currently working with a babysitting service which charges upwards of $10/hour, but I wasn’t going to make her pay $1/hour, but I wanted something reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We haven't been speaking since but we do live together. \n\nLast month we got into another fight. He was threatening to beat me up and saying I don't respect him. I asked him to acknowledge that what he said was wrong. His response was that what he said, he said in anger and he can't be held accountable for it. This went on for a while. I didn't ask for a apology, by the way. Finally we went to sleep and haven't spoken since and probably never will. \n\nI think the things we say in anger, we really mean. Because we don't have a filter during those times. In my dad's defense he's normal 90% of the time. But sometimes he will take a little thing and make such a huge deal out of it and seriously traumatise me. All my family members are telling me to talk to him and that I shouldn't be so egotistical. But I think he's a toxic person and I'm too sensitive to my own feelings.\n\nWe had a normal relationship when I was a kid. But I have a habit of holding onto bad things. I think saying something harsh would be 'acceptable' from a teenager like me but it shouldn't be excused for a 50 year old man. I won't ever talk to him again unless I absolutely have to.

      "description": "I have been dating my girlfriend for five months, and despite having very little issue with her personality, our sex life is terrible for me.\n\nIts not that I dont find her unattractive per se, I just don't enjoy sex with her. She doesn't understand my needs despite me communicating what I want. I have sat down with her multiple times and told her what I would like, and even though she agrees she has never been able to satisfy me as a man.\n\nShe herself always reaches orgasm and enjoys sex, and though I reach orgasm that is the only enjoyable part of the sex. The rest feels like a chore. I have told her this, but despite so many conversations nothing has changed. We even went to a counselor but nothing has worked.\n\nSo finally after yet another boring night I decided that I was going to respectfully ask for an open relationship, just so that I can pursue my sexual desires elsewhere while still maintaining the other aspects of our relationship. Also since I really don't like having sex with her I told her that she can pursue other men if she wanted.\n\nShe was very hurt that I even asked, and refused. She also said she still wants to have sex with me, and doesn't want an open relationship or other men, and she doesnt want me to be with other women. It is not my intention to hurt, but at the same time as a man I have needs. She says that its horrible that I would even ask.\n\nAm I the asshole for even asking?",

      "description": " \n\nHey guys!\n\nSkipping the long intro and jumping straight into it:\n\nRight now, I live with my room mate (Gonna call them X for this story!)\n\nWhen X and I moved together we had this agreement of how things where gonna be. We were gonna have a shared account for money to the flat (rent, Electricity, Wifi, etc) and we were gonna share cleaning around the house.\n\nIt was a good way to both safe money and learn to live away from our parents. The deal was to stay living together until we both finished University.\n\n\\- There's a lot of problems with this whole situation but the major problem is cleaning! -\n\nThe cleaning deal went something like this:  \nMe:\n\n\\- Clean bathroom, living room, bedroom.\n\n\\- Do laundry\n\n\\- Dust\n\n\\- Take out trash\n\n\\- Help with dishes.\n\nX:\n\n\\- Help with dishes.\n\n\\- clean X's computer room (I'm literally not in there unless I need one of my books)\n\n\\- Vacuum\n\nAlready now it's pretty obvious that I do most of the things at home, but this agreement was made when I was home sick with an injury and X was in university.\n\nFAST FORWARD TO NOW:\n\nI'm cleaning EVERYTHING! and I do mean \\*EVERYTHING\\* !! I'm allergic to dust, so I need to clean the flat weekly or I might get a serious reaction.\n\n6 months ago, I stopped completely cleaning the computer room, because Why would I? I'm never in there and I removed my books from there. 3 months ago X promised to clean the room. Today I looked in to see rotten food paper and old dishes scattered around the floor. (Ever seen a neck beard nest? HOLY SHIT I think I live with one!) We talked about it last night and X told me \"Yeah I finally got the weekend off to do it!\" but has been spending the whole day just staring at me keeping the rest of the house clean while X played computer.\n\nX's Dad once had the audacity to scream at me that \\*I\\* was the reason the flat was messy, after being away for a whole weekend, while X had a \"Game night\" with friends and (NO SHIT) didn't clean after them.\n\nOur lease runs out around December this year, and I don't want to move in with them again because I'M NOT A FUCKING MAID! I'm fuming with so much anger it physically hurt.\n\nTL DR:\n\nAm I the ass for not wanting to find a new flat with my flatmate (even though the original deal was to live together until after University), after realizing they treat the house as a pigstine and me as a personal maid?",

The time in between jobs in the morning is half an hour and 4 times this week my relief has been late causing me to be late to my 9-5.

Sometimes I'll be doing something (either on top or a bj, or whatever) then switch it up because whatever muscles I'm using are getting tired. I'll learn after sex or right after I move that he was kind of close to finishing but the change wrecked it (my words, not his). When this happens I feel terrible and power through another way, but this adds even more time and by the end everything hurts. But I make sure he finishes.\n\nI've never \"lost\" an orgasm with him. I either do or I don't. Whereas with him, if he loses it and I don't want to continue due to fatigue, that would be the end of sex. And I guess I feel bad about blue balling him in a way.\n\nThis doesn't happen a lot, but it's happened enough that I want to know what to do if it comes up.\n\nSo, WIBTA for not putting in the extra effort to make him finish after getting him close once?",

She refused to listen to our opinions so everyone started raising their voices. I got uncomfortable and went to my room to get some peace and quiet. My brother comes to my room shortly after and starts yelling at me for always running away from my problems (this isn’t the first time I’ve stepped out of an uncomfortable situation). I try to defend myself but he keeps attacking me. The argument escalates so far that I start calling him things like “insensitive” and he starts using my mental illness to tear me down. I am extremely hurt by the fact that he would go there over a silly rug and I start crying and screaming. My mom had to come in and break us up. I’m aware that he’s TA for blowing up like that, but AMTA too for walking away, and for still not forgiving him weeks after? I still talk to him and act polite but I don’t actually forgive him. ",

She is 30 with a former heroin addiction, two kids she dumped on her ex after he got out of jail, and doesn’t have a drivers license or a job. I would go on but she’s a serial parasite on everyone she comes in contact with.\n\nI was nice and didn’t say anything for a long time because he cares about her.\n1 st serious incident was drunkenly screaming and having a fit because it was late and we asked her to turn it down.\n\n2 nd incident was trying to convince him to quit his well paying factory job to go to this door to door scam which thankfully he did not fall for. She did and is now unemployed.\n\n3rd incident was the most recent. Everyone was home but him so we all went out Friday and I knew she was down on her luck so we had her come out covered her bar tab etc. she described him as controlling but had a problem with all of us saying that was not okay.... once we got home she would not stop talking about it. She escalated to threatening everyone with violence. Followed by slamming doors for hours and sending nasty pms on Facebook.\n\nThe following day I called him and told him she needs to get out and is not allowed in our house.     \nI explained the situation and he was treating it like high school drama and trying to make excuses. I’m about to tell him if she’s not out by Friday I will have her removed when he’s at work since no one wants her here and as far as I’m concerned she’s trespassing if he’s not home.\n\nThanks again in advance. I’m just conflicted because I know it’s hurting him but I can’t live with a temperamental person in my home who does nothing but cause problems.",

The wife called the cable company to get our account transferred and they screwed the whole process up. I have spent way too much time on the phone with them trying to sort it out. At this point I am pretty frustrated with them.\n\nThe titular event:\n\nIt's 8:20pm and my 2 year old is in bed. The wife and I are watching TV in the living room. The lights are off and so is the light on the front porch.\n\nOut of know where there is a knock at the front door and I can see a flashlight shining on the porch. My first thought, given the time of night, the type of knock, and the flashlight, was that it was the police. The dog is barking now and the kid has woken up crying.\n\nI crack open the door:\n\nMe: Can I help you?\n\nCG: Hi, I'm Cable Guy with Cable Company. I see you have recently had a self install kit and I need to get into your back yard to finalize everything.\n\nMe: It's after 8. You woke my fucking kid up. I don't have a visit scheduled and I am watching the cable right now. What the hell else do you need to do?\n\nAt this point I have stepped outside and closed the door behind me and started to unknowingly walk towards him.\n\nCG: I can come back tomorrow if that's better.\n\nMe: That's fine, cause you're not getting into my yard tonight.\n\nHe got in his van and left.\n\nAfter I went back in, I began to worry that maybe he was just casing houses. I called the company and questioned them on why the hell they would send a tech out so late. No one had called ahead like they usually do. The company said no one was scheduled to work on my home, but a tech was in the area and may have gotten the wrong house.\n\nI know swearing was uncalled for, but I was absolutely livid.\n\nTl;dr: Cable guy came knocking on my door after 8pm without an appointment and I told him to get the fuck out.\n\nAITA for how I handled the situation?

Her parents are very strict about this and sometimes we aren't even allowed to be in the same room together if we're alone. \n\nOkay, so I have no intention of doing anything sexual with her, that is not my desire. But, on Instagram she posts pictures of her in bikinis and at the beach, etc. I loooove those pictures and sometimes I'll subliminally ask for pictures like that of her. She send me pics but not as revealing as those she posts. I was sorta confused but I never brought it up. \nAnyway we got into am argument the other day and I was really annoyed. She then said you're just like other guys and said my behavior \"disappointed\" her.

      "description": "I've done this more than once, but yesterday was the first time I felt really bad about it.\n\nEvery Thursday night I play d&amp;d with a good group of friends, we start at around 8pm and go until 2am most nights. There's 7 people in the campaign, 3 live in the house we play. Me and 2 others crash on their couches, and 1 skypes in. We've been playing here for about 2 years and things are good most of the time. \n\nIn terms of food, we've gone through phases where we'll order a couple pizzas and someone will take the bill but it's never consistent. I could buy a pizza for all 6 in the house one day and the next week someone would buy pizza for only 2 people. It goes up and down and the distribution of wealth was uneven making me uncomfortable with the set up. 1 of the group members \"L\" is my bestfriend and I'm always down to foot his bill but not necessarily all the others all the time. I'm a student, working on call jobs so there's not always a sea of money flying in. I dont like the risk of saying I'm going to order pizza and having to pay for everyones. Even if they pay me back I'm not sure I have enough in my account to take in the first place.\n\nThe pizza thing lasted like 2 months then we went to doing our own thing. Most weeks I show up with food of my own, so does everyone else. Some people cook in the house and some buy and bring it with them. With this being the case I recently started uber eating food to their apartment. (I show up at 7, but ideally eat later so as to not feel snacky at like 2am). No one really said much until last night.\n\nOne of the home owners J's girlfriend played with us for the first time, my bestfriends L's girlfriend also joined us, and my other bestfriend too. I was planning on buying subway on my way over but wasnt hungry yet and could order more food from McDonalds for basically the same price. If it was just me and my two bestfriends I would have offered them to add to the order but again I can't do that with 6 other people.\n\nAnyways, I ordered and the food showed up and J's girlfriend says \"WHAT, you ordered food and didn't offer any of us??\" Then another player T says \"yeah... that's  a very u/SpidermanGoneRogue thing to do\" then they all do a little chitter chatter about it.\n\nI passed around my fries cause I felt bad... I felt awkward for the rest of the night. I texted my Gf and she's assured me that it's not assholish but seems like everyone else thinks it is.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTl;Dr - playing dnd with 6 friends every thursday for years, everyone usually does their own thing for food, I ordered on ubereats and got flack for not offering the group to also order.",

      "description": "Hey all! LTL, FTP, on mobile so forgive my formatting, etc., etc. I know you’re all here for the story anyway.\n\nFor some background, I’ve been suffering from depression since high school (I’m 25 now). The symptoms have gotten worse since I moved out of my parent’s house 2 years ago, due to losing a major support system. I began seeing a therapist and taking medication to manage it, and it was going okay.\n\nEarly on, my therapist and I determined that a major stressor for me was talking to my mom about my mental illness. My mom tries to be supportive but the majority of her comments have been negative. She routinely questions/criticizes my use of medication and has told me “that I’m not trying hard enough.”\n\nThe last comment in particular really hurt me, so after some thought, I stopped telling her about how I was feeling mentally. If she asked, I would say I was okay and move on to another topic.\n\nUntil now.\n\nLast week, I had a massive breakdown. I had a friend come stay with me for the night and scheduled an emergency session with my therapist. After a lot of talking, she strongly recommended I attend a partial hospitalization program to get me back on my feet.\n\nI decided to attend (I start tomorrow), got everything cleared with my work and my insurance. The last thing left was to tell my mom, due to having to cancel some plans with her since I will have to be at the hospital from 8 AM to 3 PM everyday for a couple weeks.\n\nSo I called her and explained everything and she flipped the fuck out. She started ranting about “how dare I not tell her about this” and “I didn’t deserve to be blindsided by this.”\n\nI tried to explain why I hadn’t been talking to her about this, hoping that since I talk to her about pretty much everything, including other medical things going on, she would empathize a little and back off. But was I wrong.\n\nShe immediately went off again, calling me a liar and a deceitful, merciless person, and told me how now she was going to have to go back to my grandparents and have to tell them about this after just telling them how well I was doing.\n\nI shot back, saying that I was sure that she didn’t share all of her life with me, and how she had no right to tell me how merciless I was when there were things I know she hasn’t forgiven my grandmother for.\n\nShe hung up, and we haven’t spoken since. I know she’s waiting on me to come and apologize, but I’m not going to do that because I don’t feel I’m in the wrong here.\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "One hour left on this stupid car ride, before I have to deal with her obnoxious ass. Sigh.\n\nI am a married, 40-year-old guy with a wife, two kids, dogs, a home, a profession, hobbies. All in all, a satisfying life. But a couple times a year, that all gets disrupted, as we travel out of area to visit my mother over holidays. Such as this one.\n\nMy mother is a widow, living six hours away from me and my family. She’s not perfect, but she’s my mom. We generally get along. However, my kid brother (35 years old) lives with her.\n\nMy brother and I have been hit or miss over the span of our lives. The issues I take with him are complicated: He was never held to the uber-strict standards that my parents imposed on me. My successes were treated as failures, whereas his failures are just overlooked. He is kinda rude and crude. He has no common courtesy. There was some blatant favoritism towards him. But… whatever. I can largely roll my eyes, and ignore him. He does the same, and we are able to pretty much avoid each other.\n\nAnd then, there is his wife.\n\nMy brother dated some questionable girls, over the years. But his most recent is a true piece of work. She is loud, opinionated, racist… and frankly, rather stupid. She has XYZ annoying medical condition, that apparently can make it difficult to conceive. She convinced my brother that that was adequate birth control. It was not. I now have a nephew, and a sister-in-law.\n\n“But 21stMonkey”, you are saying, “you don’t have to like her. You can just ignore her, too.” Yeah, I’ve tried that. Doesn’t work. She has seemingly made it her mission to be as infuriating as possible.\n\n1) Despite having no life, educational, or job experience, this woman is an expert on everything. I went to school for Computer Science, but she claims to know more about them. I worked in the credit industry. But her broke ass knows more about investing. I design games, professionally… but she knows more about them, too. I’m a hobbyist chef, with some catering experience. But she’ll happily tell me what I’m doing wrong in the kitchen.\n2) A special, infuriating case of the above: She tries to parent my kids. My girls are 10 and 8. They are outstandingly smart, well-groomed, well-spoken, well-mannered. I’m proud of them. Yet, without fail, she tries to boss them around. When I politely say ‘I’ve got it, they’re fine’, she claims to have worked in a daycare, and is thus a pro. Bitch, you worked in your aunt’s home daycare, as a janitor, for three months. Step. Back.\n\n3) Also a case of #1, she is really into herbal this, and essential oils that. I’m pretty sure that I’ll have to listen to another diatribe about the evils of vaccinations, before the week is over.\n\n4) My brother and SIL are living in my mother’s house, rent and expense free. They’ve never paid a dime towards their mountain of debt. Yet, I’ll bet Christmas day will involve lavish gifts, just like last year. In particular, SIL doesn’t work.\n\n5) SIL is a slob. Their room is straight out of Hoarders. Two outbuildings on my mom’s property are filled with heaps of their stuff, totally unorganized. The main bathroom is a dumpster fire of their shit. It’s disrespectful, I think.\n\n6) SIL uses my nephew as a weapon. If my mom tries to lay down the law, SIL threatens to take nephew away, forever. It’s really hurting mom.\n\nOk, I’m digressing, a little.\n\nAll in all, this woman is a terror. I don’t want to fuck things up for my mom, and start fights. So, a while back I decided that I should just ignore SIL, and not exacerbate things while visiting.\n\nThis is not sitting well with some of my other family members. A couple think that I’m being rude by being standoffish. I don’t agree. I think if I engage, I’m going to blast this bitch, and harshly. And it will cause problems.\n\nOne family member thinks that I have a duty to support my mom, and keep her from being victimized. I try to help her out, but I feel that I can’t fight all of her battles for her.\n\nWhat do you think? AITA for thinking that just staying away from her is the mature way to handle things?",

      "description": "This morning I woke up my husband, as I do every Wednesday. It is the only day of my work week that he is home and I get a chance to get ready without having to juggle our 9 month old. I placed the baby on the bed, and no exaggeration, he gets up and says he has to \"pee\", walks to the bathroom and closes the door. Is it even possible to muster up a turd approximately 3 seconds after waking up? The crazy thing is, this is so predictably routine. Mind you, most of my getting ready habits have died, I no longer have time to blow dry or fix my hair, and I never put on makeup. I never have enough time. He doesn't seem to care that this affects me. He just begrudgingly carries on with his day of taking care of the baby in between dumps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am willing to bet that he spends upwards of 4-5 hours per week on the toilet. In the course of the hour before I leave for work, he will absolutely go to the bathroom AGAIN. As we all know, men are not skilled in the area of efficient poop timing strategy and it takes them a bit longer. I get that. I also get that men do other things in the bathroom, and I am cool with it. But this is my only day to have an easy morning. Every other day, he leaves the house before we even get up. Part of me thinks its some kind of OCD tendency that he needs to poop without the baby around. And he won't have a chance all day unless he does it while I am home. I don't fucking care anymore. Grow up and poop like the rest of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expressed my agitation and explained to him that if I wasn't home, he would have to figure it out. If it were me leavinng the house every morning, he would have to find a way to poop whilst taking care of the baby. It doesn't seem very cool to me that he has no problem whatsoever doing this every single morning he is home. I yelled that he needed to \"make it quick\" and he still was on there for 10 minutes. After I finally got to take a shower, he was hostile, cold, and argumentative for the rest of the morning. I went to put on a baby show and he shout from the kitchen \"I WAS WATCHING THAT.\" Really dude? You were watching Hota's closet makeover on the Today Show? GTFOH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think I am wrong here, but he has been treating me like I am an asshole ever since. Short, cold, and insincere text responses. Wouldn't return my \"I love you\" before I left this morning. What the hell gives? Am I the asshole??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because my friends and bf know my username, sorry this might be long.\n\nThe title is a tad bit misleading, but let me start off by saying I love my boyfriend dearly. He’s a really a great guy and I love being with him. \n\nA little backstory: My [F/23] boyfriend’s [M/25] parents went through a very nasty divorce about a year ago. They were forced to sell his childhood home, and his mom moved into his grandmother’s small apartment.\n\nAfter his parents sold the house, my bf moved in with his older brother and fiancée. BF pays them rent (a small amount, maybe a couple hundred dollars a month) but buys his own groceries, does his own laundry, etc. \n\nNow, this is my issue. BF talks about how his mom is planning on moving into a larger home because she wants her own place again. He says once she moves, he will live with her. At first he said he is doing it for moral support because of the divorce, but he then revealed he thinks paying rent is stupid. \n\nIf it ever comes up in conversation, he will talk about how rent is throwing away money, a waste, etc. and how he will buy his own place instead. Now, this hurts my feelings because I have been on my own paying rent since college, but that’s a whole separate thing. \n\nAs I mentioned, he says he would rather save up to buy a house, which I understand. However, I know there probably isn’t much saving going on because he always complains about how he needs to actually start saving and he’s so broke. I know for a fact he is making about $80,000 at his job, I don’t see why he can’t set aside enough to move out on his own. For reference, where we are, to live with roommates it would probably be about $500 - $800, or $1200 - $1500 to live alone. \n\nI think there is some insecurity going on, because a few of his close friends have already bought their own homes. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I expressed these feelings to my BF? I don’t know how to approach this subject. I just think at age 25 it might be time to have some independence. \n\nTL;DR: BF currently lives with his older brother and is planning on moving back in with his mother once she gets a bigger house. He won’t  pay rent because he thinks it’s a waste of money. He says he would rather buy a house, but has put in little to no effort on saving money. ",

      "description": "Ok, so i was gonna have some beers with a couple of friends. One of my best friends (who doesnt really hang out with them) asked if he could tag along. I said yes, of course (because who would want to diss a good friend, right?). Now, while he is generally well liked, looks good and is pretty charming i must admit he is also not the sharpest tool in the shed. He has difficulties following conversations that does not involve beer or women, which can be a bit of a problem since he can get a little left out in certain social situations. This is important for later.\n\nNow, i meet up with my friends at a bar. One of them has brought along a girl from his work. I have met her a few times before and we seemed to click pretty well. She is smart, pretty but first of all single. I haven’t gotten laid in a few months since i’ve been kinda down after a bad break-up, so i saw a chance to maybe get some action. She was obviously intrested, so fast forward a few hours and we was sitting alone in a corner and really hitting it off, just good times all around.\n\nExcept my friend of course, who did not really have a good time. He was hanging with my friends, and while they tried to cue him in their conversations, he had a hard time following some talk about politics or something. He became increasingly bored, so he figured he would sit with me and the girl instead. Which he did, by opening with ”wazzuup”, and sat down next to us. I found that to be quite annoying since we really started to hit it of for real, but whatever. I tried to talk to him for a bit, but at the same time kindly telling him to fuck off by keeping my answers short.\n\nThis went right over his head. His answer to that was instead to get a round of beers for me and her, even though she said she didn’t want more alcohol. This was then repeated a second time. This made me more annoyed since it kind of came of like i tried to get her drunk. So instead i tried to ignore him completely and focus on the girl, but he was adamant in interrupting and getting in our conversations. So, long story short - i ignored him for the rest of the evening, but since he was constantly interrupting by talking to the girl instead (which made her visibly annoyed), he kind of fucked up the mood, so we didn’t hook up in the end.\n\nNow he thinks i was an asshole by ”dissing him the whole evening”, but i think he should have left me alone. I mean, he had like six more people to talk to. I must add that he is in a long term happy relationship so it was not out of jealousy.",

      "description": "This is a situation that happened 2 years ago and I’ve pretty much come to my own conclusion now but I think it would be interesting to hear reddit’s opinion.\n\nI was 17, never had a girlfriend, my mate had just broken up with this girl I barely knew. The break up was one of those “let’s take a break”  things so my friend was still not sure how they stood. \n\nThree weeks go by and I suddenly get to know her at a couple of parties and things start moving quickly. We were both frustrated with my friend (honestly he had been a bit of a dick at the time but it was pretty minor stuff) and so broke the ice by complaining about him. (We quickly moved on to other topics but I still feel guilty about this) I started dating her a week later because I was so excited to have a girl where there was mutual attraction and we were having fun. \n\nA week or so later, I told my friend about the relationship and it upset him a lot, saying that I should have spoken to him about it beforehand and “asked for permission.” After this, he started telling everyone at school about the situation and that I had “betrayed and manipulated” him and it turned a lot of people against me. Every time I would try to talk to him and ask him to keep the issue between us, he would become very defensive and at one point said “Fuck you u/McCleavage.” He never swore. Pretty soon after, we were no longer friends.\n\nAITA?\n\nAftermath; My relationship with this girl ended after 3 months. My friend and I didn’t speak for another 6 months but then we spoke about everything and honestly we’re much better friends now than we’ve ever been so there is a happy ending to this story :) \nI’ll comment my personal AITA judgment for myself after anyone else has already made up their minds, don’t want to bias anyone.",

      "description": "I am a second-generation US citizen, born and raised in America. The only family I have in the US is my father, who I have a pretty good relationship with. I am an only child and my mother passed away around 4 years ago. The rest of my family (aunts, cousins, grandparent) live in China. \n\nI have only seen my family one or two times in my life (I am 25) because I don't go visit them in China often, and they never come to the US. They have always been very kind to me when I have seen them and they always ask about me through my dad. \n\nLanguage is a major barrier. They do not speak English and even though Chinese was the first language I learned as a child, I have very limited proficiency now. I can somewhat understand, but speaking is difficult. Having an actual conversation is pretty much impossible. The few interactions I've had with my family have all consisted of me smiling and nodding and saying the few words I can.\n\nWhat sparked this post is that my aunt/cousin is going to be in my city (in the US) for the first time this week. Of course I offered my apartment and offered to take them out to dinner, but I realized I really didn't want to do any of this, I just felt \\*obligated\\* to. My boyfriend commented that I seemed stressed out after hearing they would be visiting, which I was (this combined with unrelated work matters have made me a little anxious). I then realized that he does is not this way at all when his family visits, which is often. He is genuinely excited to see them, happily hosts and takes them around the city. On the other hand, I feel like my family are strangers because, well... they mostly are. I honestly don't really want to see them, I just feel like it's another thing I have to do.\n\nBecause of this, I've let my relationship with my family deteriorate. I never prioritize visiting them in China. I planned a vacation next month, and chose to go to Europe instead. I can't write to them because I can barely read Chinese and definitely can't write. \n\nI am conflicted, because on one hand I do feel very guilty about it, but on the other I do think I am somewhat justified in feeling like they are strangers. In Chinese culture, family is everything. My dad always tells me that they are your family and you should always put your family first. And I've experienced this firsthand when I have visited China and been received with open arms, despite them not knowing me at all. They will treat me like family simply because I am, whereas I for some reason feel like I need to \\*know\\* them. \n\nAm I an asshole if I don't love my family back? I do believe they truly love and care for me, but all I feel for them is obligation. I realize there are probably some cultural differences at play too, like what love and family mean in each culture, but I do not want that to be an excuse for being a asshole.\n\nBecause language is a big part of it, I do feel like IATA for letting my Chinese language deteriorate. I know it's something I could actively try and improve, but it's just not really a priority in my life. I have a loving boyfriend and a few good friends. I don't honestly feel like I'm missing anything. AITA for feeling this way?",

So I told her before she left and before I was at work to not spend all of it just in case they tried to charge an overdraft if she went below zero. She also had 10$ cash on her. \nSo I text her last night and she says she did good and only bought a few beers and everything was great. Awesome I get home and everything is fine . I forgot to get my debit card from her and she leaves for work (in my vehicle).\nWe only have one vehicle at the moment bc hers is afk. \n\nSo she calls me 5 min down the road and says hey I have no money for lunch. And I say well what happened to the 60$ you had last night? She said I spent it all. So it upsets me and I tell her I don't understand why you would spend it all when I asked you not to. I figured my gf had enough sense to know she would need money for food the next day before work. \n\nSo I say I feel like you need to be more of an adult and manage the money better that I give you instead of blindly spending it. I'm not a money bank for you to just draw money from. \n\nThat led to her telling me I'm controlling her and she is sick and tired of me telling her how to live and how to do things. All I do is bitch and complain to her and try and control her. \n\nWe now are not talking to each other.

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I live in a thousand square foot apartment, and this morning my brother called asking to stay with us for a week. I told him I'd have to get back to him after talking to the gf.\n\nMy gf and I are 23 and 22. My brother is 32.\n\nRecently he was kicked out of his house by his girlfriend and has nowhere to stay. My mom said he could stay with her, but she's out of town until at least the 21st. He'd be staying with us for six days.\n\nI'm seriously torn here.\n\nThere are some pros and definitely some cons to letting him stay with us.\n\nPros:\n\n* Although we're not very close, he's still my brother and it's probably the \"right\" thing to do.\n* None of the guilt that comes with telling him no. I'm sure my dad would understand if I said no, but my mom is a notorious guilt-tripper and my brother seems to have picked some of it up as well. I'm not very close with any of them, but it would still hurt a bit to know they're mad at me.\n\nCons:\n\n* We don't really have a lot of space. We have a bedroom he could use, but my gf keeps all of her clothes in there. She's not a big people person, so making her walk around him sleeping at 6:30am for her clothes every morning for six days is a huge ask.\n* I'm worried about the strain it'll put on my relationship with my gf. As I said, she's not big on people. Especially people she doesn't know that well staying in her home for extended periods. It doesn't feel right to subject both her and I to the kind of stress it'll cause.\n* My brother has a history of drug use, and while he has been clean for more than a year now, it's still hard to trust him completely to be alone in my apartment for so long. Some past experience with a different brother makes me even more anxious about this.\n* This last one is kind of petty, but we had plans to have some out of town friends come down this weekend and most likely spend the night. And I really don't want him here when they come down.\n\nI'm leaning toward telling him no, but I still need to talk to the gf about it all. But if I do tell him no, I don't know what other options he has. I know he has a decent job, and I think he might have a bit of money, so maybe he could stay in a motel or something? \n\nI don't know. \n\nHelp me Reddit. Am i the asshole? Should I help a family member who is down on their luck? Or should I do what causes the least amount of stress in my own life?",

Until a few minutes later when I hear\n\n\"This is such a cool brush. I never seen anything like this before\"\n\nAnd in her mouth, scrubbing away was my dog's brush. Now there isn't any markings or anything that would indicate that the brush was for a dog; just a metal shaft with the brush head. However the brush head looks nothing like a normal brush, it's two pronged with the bristles facing inward. \n\nAt this moment I'm not really sure how to bring it up. I don't want to embarrass her. She keeps gushing on about it, looking so proud with herself. And the deed's already done. So I don't. Just nudged her back to the bathroom and tell her to wash up because breakfast is ready.\n\nShould I have said something?",

      "description": "First time poster, here! \n\nOK. I met this kid on a psychiatric ward last year. I’m bipolar (it’s not a big deal anymore, been in and out of hospital for years) and he was in with ADHD and drug-induced psychosis. In hospital all ages and backgrounds socialise and bond so it’s quite normal to find yourself hanging out with people you’d never know IRL.\n\nWe’d been out of hospital a while and he caught me on Fb messenger. He told me he’s now dating the hot healthcare assistant who worked on the ward and that she begs for his cock night and day. She’s about 26, and stunningly attractive so I figured improbable, illegal (there must be a law against staff hooking up with patients, surely?) and basically wishful thinking.\n\nHe started telling me about his new job in construction. We always enjoyed making shit dirty puns when we were in hospital so, when he started boasting about his “mighty piledriver”, I chuckled and asked him if he had a decent helmet.\n\nI’m not a sexy lady. I’m naive and enthusiastic, like a Labrador. But I can do innuendo very happily- I always loved the Carry On movies.\n\nWe talked about handling tools, filling holes, releasing heavy equipment, filler, some lower quality stuff about cable ties and webbing, erections... you get the idea. Periodically he said “don’t stop” and “this is so hot” but i just thought it was part of the fun.\n\nI am so immature.\n\nImagine my shock when he sent me a pic of him finishing himself off, followed by “that’ll be our dirty little secret then”\n\nA teenager. Ugh. I was so grossed out I actually cried.\n\nBut now his girlfriend has messaged me. Implausibly, he really is with the nurse. She has seen the convo. She called me a sad, fat, old slag and a perv. She said I was abusing a young and vulnerable mentally ill person and that I deserved to go to hell for it. She had a go at me for inciting her boyfriend to cheat and said their relationship was true love and I tried to tear them apart. She’s blocked me from his account and threatened to post screenshots to my insta. She says I am an asshole.\n\nOf course she’s quite a bit older than him and has abused her position of power, and I had no idea the little perv was fiddling with himself.\n\nAnd I do have a major mental health problem that is being exacerbated by the stress and humiliation.\n\nAnyways... AITA?",

      "description": "My husband and I work hard and are self employed- we own a fitness studio. After 8 yrs of hard work the place is successful, we have a fabulous core of families and employees.... we often call it our Other Family. \n\nNow my husband and I have been having issues in our marriage and while we are currently separated we have been going to couples counseling and seem to be on our way to reconciling. This has happened a year and a half ago only last time I initiated the separation, this time he did. \n\nAt the time of our separation we had been trying to conceive for about a year. This was after YEARS of me saying I did not want children but over time, especially after watching the kids at the studio grow up, I decided I was ready. Man, they do not joke around when they say your biological clock kicks in! Problem is I have been having a hard time conceiving naturally so I have (willingly) submitted myself  to many many tests, done endless amounts of tracking, peeing on sticks, crying in subs like r/TTC and r/infertility, the works. \n\nWhen my husband initiated the separation he said he did not want children with me. We both have anger issues and I smoke more weed than I would like. These are things I’m actively changing and am going to individual therapy to address.  \n\nYesterday in couples counseling he says he would like to wait for about 6 months to a year before trying to conceive again. Yes I know that in a perfect world that would make sense. I am 28 yrs old. That means I could be 29 by the time we start trying. Who knows how long we would have to try for? How old will I be? My uterine lining will only get worse. \nI have also wanted to look into adoption but that process also takes about 2 years and so we would have to get started NOW. I don’t want to be in my mid to late thirties with a toddler. I want to have the energy to do this stuff now. \n\nI would like to start trying to conceive as soon as my husband moves back in which will be in a couple of weeks. I think we could do counseling and therapy IN PARALLEL to trying to make a baby. \n\nAITA for wanting to try to have a baby AND continuing to work on the marriage at the same time?  He thinks we have to focus on one, I say life is short let’s do both. I worked so hard at our studio and now we have our Other Family. But now I would like to work on our immediate family. ",

We were recently assigned an extra credit question to answer and email in where we had to also include a two paragraph explanation for our answer. We could work individually or within our group. One of the guys texted the group chat with his answer and so did one girl. I told them that I got the same answer and since I already wrote the explanation, that they could just read over what I wrote and fix anything if needed, then I would send it in with our names. I told them to give me their emails so I could send it to them. The third group guy (The Leech) who hasn’t contributed in any way and hasnt replied to any of our texts suddenly just replies with his email and nothing else. I respond to him asking for the answer he arrived at. He replies that he didnt do it at all so he doesn’t have an answer. The extra credit assignment is due tomorrow and Im tempted to just turn it in with three of our names on it and leave out the Leech’s name. Would that be an as*holish thing to do? It may sound petty, but this dude has been riding my coattails the entire semester, I know he wouldve failed the course already if he hadnt asked for my help repeatedly, but I draw the line at handing out free points without him even doing any work.",

She's also a very very lovely girl who absolutely does not deserve to have her first boyfriend do this to her.\n\nThere's far more going on, and I know far more than they think I do; I know that V's explicitly told A that he wants to fuck her at least once, and I know nudes have been exchanged. A knows I know, V does not. Other far weirder things have happened too, but I won't get into that.\n\nWith all of this in mind, when A came over again the other day I called them out. I told them to think of V's girlfriend above anybody else. I confronted A about it and told her that it makes me uncomfortable, and they haven't done it since.\n\nV's girlfriend has no idea, of course. She has every right to know, but I'm just not prepared to go behind both my best friends' backs like that, especially since V's gf and I aren't close at all. \n\nBoth V &amp; A have severe depression too, and A's told me that the guilt of this situation coming out will be enough to tip V over the edge and make him kill himself; I don't know if she's bluffing or not, but I really don't want to take the chance. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "**So some revelent background information before I get to the meat of the matter:**\n\nMy sister is 18 yo and is in her first year of university. She went pretty wild her first semester and is looking to pledge for a sorority next semester. She asked my parents if she could go on a cruise to mexico with her friends, they told her no, she said okay and that conversation was over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What happened:** \n\nShe posted some drunk photos  of herself topless in Cancun, Mexico, on Instagram. The location name was embedded in the photo on the top.  One of my friends, who follows her, sent me a photo of her saying: \"Wow you're sister really went crazy her first year\". This was about an hour after she posted it. I did some digging around and apparently she had mentioned to one of my friends that she would be going to mexico, about a week ago. Also apparently a lot of my friends follow her on instagram. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Snitching:**\n\nAt this point I'm very confident she indeed is in mexico. A couple of things run through my mind: \n\n1. She's with a bunch of older guys she's known for less than a semester.\n2. My sister is easily peer pressured and will go to great lengths to fit in with whatever group she's hanging out with.\n3. No one fucking knows shes in Mexico. \n4. She has mom's credit card.\n5. She drinks a lot of alcohol and gets drunk very quick.\n\nI found myself in a very uncomfortable spot. If anything happened to her (getting taken advantage of, alcohol poisoning, getting in trouble with the law, etc.) I would be partially responsible, since I knew where she was and didn't let anyone know. On the other hand I'm one of the few people she confides in and trusts, and also her brother *(I'm 22 yo, we're 4 years apart*). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I spilled the beans to my parents. Lots of punishments are on their way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AITA?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I have minded my own business? I'm always  true to my word and I've never spilled a secret someone's asked me to keep. Even though she never shared her intention to go to Mexico with me, I know she will feel betrayed. My sister's relationship with my parents is already kinda shaky, will this just drive her away more? These are the thoughts I'm wrestling with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know for sure there could have been a better way to handle this. I am not proud of my decision nor do I think I know what's best for her. Thank you for reading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My mom recently moved from home to live with my sister in California. My sister attributes it to my mom wanting to get away from her ex. My mom says she wants to start a new life.\n\nMy mom has been living there for about 2 months and everything is going fine. It all started when they moved to Texas to be closer to my sister's husband's family and my brother. \n\nMy sister is pissed because she claims all my mom does is stay in the room all day and texts her ex. She is mad because my mom doesnt even want to play with her daughter and would rather talk to her ex. The same ex my mom is on and off with over the years and would complain about her to us, her kids every so often. \n\nMy mom says that she doesnt want to stay with my sister because she is too controlling and talks too much it is stressing her out. (I agree that my sister could get a bit too much at times)My mom says she wants to start working but requires a physical address. My sister found a place with her friend for 300 a month, my sister's friend just asks that my mom not stay some weekends so she could have alone time with her son. My sister offered for my mom to stay the weekends. My mom doesnt want it and to find a different place because she doesnt want to stay with her daughter and just live on her own. Note, my siblings and i will be paying for the place until my mom gets a job and could pay for herself and we are not exactly rolling in money. My sister's husband recently got let go from his job and they've been living off their savings. \n\nMy sister and mom got into a screaming match this morning because my mom didnt want to go to her in-laws wedding and would rather look for a job. My mom is currently in a hotel for the night.\n\nAm i the asshole for thinking my sister is in the right?",

      "description": "I met this guy this past fall and we quickly became friends. A couple months later, he confesses that he has feelings for me and \"can't help but see us ending up together.\" I did not even slightly share the feeling. With this, he requested space to get over those feelings. He wanted to hang out slightly less, but also requested physical space since I'm very physically affectionate. I was fine with that.\n\n5 months later and our relationship had been seemingly back to normal. He is aware that I am happily dating someone and supportive of the relationship. He's been there for me through many depressive episodes &amp; life changes. He never again articulated any discomfort or feelings. But this past Saturday, we went to a party. Then he calls on Tuesday to express his discomfort about my behavior during the party.\n\nAccording to him, my physical affection during the party was inappropriate. He expressed two things that violated his boundaries: hugging him and doing things like touching his arm as I reached for a beer. He told me that he found it to be emotionally manipulative since I knew how he felt and he said he found it \"creepy\" because I did not have affirmative consent for these things and because I am in a relationship.\n\nI was really taken back. No one has ever expressed discomfort from my affection prior and I try to be really conscious of body language and social cues as to what is acceptable. I would have never imagined a good friend of almost a year to react in that way or else I never would have done it.To suggest I was purposefully trying to toy with him or that I would be unfaithful is really hurtful to me. I told him this and asked why he didn't say anything at the party to which he responded that he didn't want to make a scene and that \"I would never fault a woman for not saying something if she was touched in a way she didn't want.”\n\nI apologized numerous times over for making him uncomfortable, but also expressed my offense at his perception of me as emotionally manipulative, creepy, or unfaithful. I don't understand why he'd want me as a friend if he truly believed that, and I can't help but feel like he's blowing this out of proportion because he's uncomfortable handling his own feelings towards me (and thus making me the responsible party for him having feelings). If so, I don't think this friendship will ever be happy or healthy for us. \n\nI told him how hurt I was by how he was describing me. And told me that he is imperfect and makes mistakes and doesn't always say things the right way, but continued to essentially say the same thing over again to me. \n\nI want to do the right thing. I want to own if I made a mistake and do better, but I also have a gut feeling that he isn't a good friend to keep despite months of being a good friend to me. Did I just royally fuck up? Am I crazy for thinking this is his problem that he's making mine? Should I not be offended? If I choose to end our friendship now, am I just an asshole?",

      "description": "So my dad recently passed away.  Waiting on the autopsy for the results. But it’s speculated to be an OD.\n\nI have never had a relationship with him, at all. Out of the 32 years I’ve been alive, I have seen him once. Yes, ONCE. I’ve spoken with him one time in the last 18 years. There has never been an attempt.  He was in and out of jail his entire life and constantly using drugs. I’ve made my peace along time ago about him never wanting to be there. I even had a son of my own and still no contact. \n\nSo when I got a call from my dads side telling me he had died I wasn’t surprised. I was a little shocked but nothing emotional. I talked to an aunt and she was sobbing and telling me how much he loved me and how he always wanted to talk to me. Then went on to say something about his phone being broken. I know she wanted an emotional response but all I could think of to say is “I’m sorry.” In my head, I was like it’s 2019 how could he not get a hold of me but you could.\n\nHe will be buried either Sunday or Monday. I live in WA and it’s being held in WI. I keep trying to find a reason to go but it would be so FUCKING weird. Like I’m the only child he had so all these random family members and people would be telling me about him or giving condolences. I don’t think I could go longer than 5 minutes with saying I don’t actually know the guy so leave me alone. Maybe I’m being a dick about it but I don’t want to go. There is nothing there for me, he’s dead now. Like am I expected to go and listen to some BS stuff about how he was a good guy or maybe I should go and see the needles scattered through his place that he used to shoot up drugs.",

I’m annoyed at the loss of the promotional internet price and the extra $80 a month without even discussing it with me first.  \n\nI can’t stand regular cable anymore.

      "description": "Long time lurker on this subreddit. I'm in 9th grade. Basically what happened was that there was a huge project which was displayed at my school's open day and was also counted towards our grade.\n\n\nSo two weeks before the project, I messaged the 8 other members and said something like \"Hey, we should get started on this.\" No one answered. Okay, maybe they were busy. Fast forward to a week and a half later, I started getting worried and messaged them to start the project. I also opened a Google Doc and shared it with everyone. I wasn't the group leader but I asked them to start doing stuff and no one was responding. Over the course of the next two days, I saw that all of them read the messages but no one was responding and only one person actually opened the Google Doc (but didn't do anything).\n\n\nThe deadline was on Monday, and by Sunday I had finished around 2/3rds of the project. Then at 9:00 p.m. that night, several of my groupmates messaged me and asked \"if there was anything I could do to help\". I was more relieved than pissed off as I genuinely needed help. They sent me a few pictures and typed a few words. Out of the 16 pages of the project, I did 14; and two of my classmates didn't do ANYTHING, though one of them apologized the next day, which I brushed off.\nSome of my groupmates also apologized through the chat though some didn't.\n\nAlthough I was happy that we managed to finish the project and got a good grade, I was also pretty mad that I was the one who did the whole thing and all of the others got the grade too. I'm thinking about telling my teacher what happened, but I also feel like I'd be an asshole if I do so because my groupmates apologized genuinely for not helping (because there was actually a lot of homework that weekend but I had to do it too) So reddit, WIBTA? If I am the asshole, what should I do instead?\n\n\nSorry for bad formatting (I'm on mobile) and bad English (I'm ESL).\n\n\n",

I pressure A a little but when she says they give her honest to God panic attacks I relent and commit to doing them with 2 people. \n\nThe Holidays come and A gets Extinction and we start looking for a server to play on , while still playing on Ragnorok with B. I go to bed early one night and B decides to buy Extinction and they both find a server for us all to play on. It's terrible, it's basically a cheat server, hit a tree once and your level 100 and have 10000 pieces of wood. I tell them both I don't like it and would like to find a new one together, A gets all upset that her effort of two days is for nothing and she is not changing servers. B is silent.\n\nDrama transpires on the server with it's owners, they kept resetting and locking the server with no notice, A and B take it on themselves to find a new server without telling me any of this. I come back to find they have moved to an even easier server that is incredibly laggy for me. \n\nCut to now , I can't even get through the games main menu before I lose all interest in playing the game or with them. Now both A and B message me every few days asking where I'm at. Am I the asshole? ",

That was one of the last times my boyfriend had seen his mother in person.\n\nAnd now, about a year ago, my boyfriend got a hold of his mother's phone number. A few text exchanges, and then a few happy phone calls, and my boyfriend was so happy to have his mother back. My boyfriend is a very very loving guy and loves my own mother like his own, so I could tell he was so happy to have his own mother back. \n\nA few weeks later, literally the night before his birthday, she said, \"I love you and I'll call you and send you a present tomorrow,\" to him. Then, she ghosted for months. And I could see my boyfriend becoming so sad because of it. He didn't talk about it, and if I brought it up he would get quiet and not say anything. He had already been abandoned by her once before. \n\nI ended up texting her myself and I did chew her out. I wasn't mean, but I told her she's missing out on the most sweet boy she would ever meet and that I would pay for her phone bill, stamps, whatever she needs to at the very least send him a text. I implied that if she can't at least do that, then my boyfriend and I would not contact her again. No response from her. \n\n6 months later, a text. She tells him that she loves him and she is sorry, and that she won't leave him again. And she admired me for getting mad at her, actually. And that she will be contacting him again soon with a call. \n\nHe doesn't hear from her for about a month. Christmas rolls around, and I ask my boyfriend if he wants to send her a merry Christmas text. He shyly says yes, but he asks me if I can do it because he's too scared to. \nThis isn't the first time he's asked me to text her for him. He wants me to do it so he doesn't have to face the facts of getting nothing in return as directly. I had texted her multiple times at this point.\n\nCan you guess what happens next? Yup, nothing.  And that brings us to the current point. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to cut her out, even if she sends us a text in the future? I hate seeing this pattern of him getting filled with love for her then getting his poor heart ripped out. I want to say so many mean things to her and I want to be nasty, it takes all of me to not be mean. I would be open to her coming back if I see massive change but it would take some effort on her part. \n\nTLDR; \nMy boyfriend's mother who left him at the age of 8 came back into his life. She will get him hopeful that he can have a mother presence in his life again by calling him and making promises and then rip his heart out by not responding to any texts or calls. Am I the asshole for wanting to cut her out? ",

      "description": "At the start of this year I moved into my own home, choosing it was kind of a rush job as where I was living before was getting a bit unbearable. The house was also reasonably priced in a semi-decent area and ticked a lot of boxes I had. \n\nSo this house that I bought had a few little things that needed doing, one of them being having a new door and frame fitted to where my kitchen meets a little back passage. This back passage is unheated so it let's in a terrible draft and just oozes cold.\n\nI'd talked to my sister about this and with her bloke being a joiner she said that she would mention it to him and see if he'd be willing to help out. He seemed more than happy to help so so I put the job off until he had the time.\n\nAnyway so fast forward to the present day, winter is here and it's fucking freezing. Still no sign of the door being fitted and my heating bill is through the roof. I've Brought it up a few times and he's got the things necessary to do the job (not a huge cost though, around £20) but as far as I can tell has no intention of doing anything else, So I went and bought a door and had it fitted.\n\nNow because he'd offered to help, and bought the things necessary to do the job and I've gone elsewhere they're being a bit funny with me, like I'm the one who is in the wrong for accepting the help in the first place. They're adament they had every intention of helping, they've just been too busy. From my point of view, they've had the the best part of a year to do something while it was warm and nothing has been done, so now it's cold and a problem I had to do something. I'd even asked if they could just drop the things they'd bought off (they have a van I have a hatchback) I'd have used them but they said they'd do the full job. \n\nSo, who has been the asshole here? Me for going somewhere else to get the work done even though they offered to help and bought the things necessary or them for leaving me hanging? ",

All of us have officially declared he's hands down no questions asked the most attractive out of all of us.\n\nleo has insecurity issues because of shit family (reading thru reddit and the net has enlightened me to know that sadly no shit families have existed before the dawn of internet there goes my faith in humanity) and other Life Happened reasons. the rest of us make it a point to appreciate his general existence because yes he does deserve it. so heres the AITA moment im concerned about.\n\ni have exactly 2 of him being a soft child in selfies saved on my phone.

      "description": "This has been on my mind for a very long time now. TLDR at the end. Back in 2016, when I was in my second year of high school, I met a couple of guys who had a lot of common interests with me (regarding anime, video games, movies, etc), so I tried to start a friendship of some sort.\n\nThese guys had their own small friend group but even so they were still kinda ostracized or at least excluded from the rest of the class. Both of them were pretty introverted and nerdy (when it comes to studying and certain interests), so I kinda just talked to them when I could in the beginning, trying to integrate them in my main group of friends.\n\nBut one of those guys, \"Paul\", started acting really weird towards me. Every morning when I got there and it was just the two of us I'd say hi and take my seat. He would always ask \"What are you doing?\" and poke his head over me or my desk, which I didn't mind at first, but after a while it became very tiring. I would be finishing an urgent assignment, studying for an important test or just browsing some personal things on my phone and even when I showed absolute no interest in interacting with him, he would continue there pressing me and invading my personal space in a physical way (which I've always had a huge problem with, and he knew that).\n\nNot only that but he would text me EVERY DAY. Like I said, when he got my number it was no big deal, we were talking normally and I was glad to have a friend with the same interests as me (since there were none in my main friend group). But after about 5 months or so, it got really annoying. I would tell him a lot of times \"Oh I'll watch this video later when I can\", \"I'm studying right now\", \"I've got class now\", trying to convey that I was very busy. Not only did that never work, but he would then absolutely flood my phone (like 20 messages in 10 minutes) so that I could answer later.\n\nAlso something I noticed after all this time is that he tended to be quite condescending when discussing our common interests with me (which I fucking hate). After I found reddit, I found the sub that described him perfectly, r/iamverysmart.\n\nAbout a year went by with me trying to avoid interacting with Paul as a friend, I wanted to be a colleague at most, since he started getting pretty obsessive and being near him was downright uncomfortable. I know that I should have confronted him about me not wanting to be friends anymore, but I was so scared of hurting his feelings that I just tried to back away quietly.  Eventually, in like mid-2017, he stopped invading my space in class and the daily messages finally stopped. I was so happy, since this was my senior year and I really wanted to focus on getting into a good university, and I couldn't  handle anymore stress from him.\n\nBut then, in the second half of 2017, Paul started to flood two of my female friends (from that main friend group) with messages just like he did to me. The same behaviors of invading their space as well. They both are like me and didn't want to hurt his feelings, so they endured it. We graduated, he went to a public university,  I went to another one in a different town, and these two girls took 2018 to try again for the university they wanted (here in Brazil to get into universities you have to take a test at the end of the year and try to make through the cut). We thought it was all over, but no: he would still message them endlessly.\n\nIt got to a point where they were so stressed that they were afraid they wouldn't pass the test they were studying so hard for, because he would take so much of their time. I kept telling them to block him (I blocked him after they told me how they were so stressed), but they still didn't want to make him feel bad. \n\nThen, he started talking about his depression to one of the girls. She shared the messages in a group chat asking for help, and we were pretty scared about how he would react to her responses. We told her to tell Paul to seek psychological treatment, he kept saying he didn't need it, the conversation ended. After a while it was all the same again, and they both pitied him a lot, feeling really bad for him after that talk.\n\nI spent about 3 months trying to convince them to block him, regardless of his mental state. 2019 rolled by and one of them got the courage to do so and blocked him yesterday, but the one Paul sent the depressed messages to hasn't. She's scared that he might do something crazy to himself if she blocks him, but I keep insisting that she does so, because her mental health has gotten pretty bad over this as well.\n\nI personally don't think he would hurt himself, but these things can never be overlooked. I feel pretty shitty trying to cut some of the only friends Paul has off of his life, but they're my friends too and I feel they don't deserve to be someone's emotional crutch.\n\nSo AITA for advocating so hard for them to just disappear from his life? I don't know how to feel, he is really fucking annoying, but we were some of his only friends and he clearly has a lot of issues. Some friends told me that I was too harsh for cutting him off, and even after a whole year after doing so I still feel guilty.\n\nSorry for the long post, first one in here.\n\nTLDR: Cut off all ties with former friend who turned out to be pretty obsessive and am trying to make my friends, the new targets of his obsession, do the same. AITA?",

      "description": "The build up of the current situation:\nMy brother (about to be 21) rented a room from people he knew and had a friend living in another room they were renting too. Brother sees this as a good gig, likes the fact is around people he already knows. This is where it gets frustrating, though. My brother managed to get a good job and saved enough money to pay his renters **a year** in advance. Okay, that's meh, but you're doing fine and like the place, so you do you.\n\n Couple months in, my brother starts to realize that the home owners are assholes. They treat their oldest kid like shit emotionally and degrades him. The man of the house would threaten friends the room renters would bring over (my brother and his friend). I spent the night there and the man was up until 3 AM, drinking to where he couldn't stand up, blasting some weird indie rock band. He also managed to break one of the renters new guitar stand when attempting to get himself up.\n  I could understand wanting to leave this situation. My brother clearly hated the environment and I didn't blame him, or his friend who moved out after the home owners yelled at the girlfriend for taking 2 showers (mind you, she is paid for by the boyfriend who rents the room and part of bills). More months follow my brother doesn't contact our parents at all. I come to learn he has been complaining to my grandma and just getting food and stuff from them. I find this weird because he always tells me that my parents don't care about him when all they did was give him advice because my father wasn't happy this his son was being taken advantage of.\n  10 months in and my brother doesn't have a job, no car, nothing. He claims about not having a job because every business is too far, but he lives 2 blocks away from a food 4 less and jack in the box. Public buses also exist. He mopes for a couple more weeks and then suddenly starts going out with friends? He is eating the home owners food, living there since he paid a year in advance despite him hating living there. I get frustrated with this because my brothers owns 5 gaming consoles. And more than 100+ games combained for each console.  He complained about having no money while he stays at the house and plays games, eats, or sleep.\n Coming onto this month my brother talks to my dad and my father lectures him saying he can come back whenever and I full heartedly did not agree with this because my brother took no chances to get a job, sell anything to get money or a car, didn't do anything. Complained only to my grandparents but he wants to come back with his family. To do what? He doesn't go to school either, dropped college. Last time he was here too he didn't clean, didn't go out to try get a job and my parents didnt like that  but here he comes again.\nI havent talked to my brother in 3 months because of personal reasons but before this we were super close for siblings and knew what was going on with each others lives for the most part. But i don't like him any more, even more so because of the situation.\nAITA\nsorry if it's all jumbled, frustration is making my thoughts messy\n\n",

      "description": "Okay, to start this off I will say my girlfriend asked me two specific things when we first got semi serious, “Don’t cheat on me” and “Don’t do drugs” honestly that was no problem, the reason this was even brought up is I have an extensive history of smoking weed through my freshman year of my college but I had quit a month prior to us meeting. (We’ve been together 4 months) Anyway, yesterday my buddy who is leaving for the Air Force in 2 weeks wanted to get high one last time before he went into the military. It just so happened my girlfriend was at work for the next 5 hours so we went and got high. Well one thing leads to another and I go to my girlfriends house and everything’s fine. I get home to a text asking if I smoked weed tonight, and I straight up told her the truth that I did and gave reasoning. She said she smelled it on my breath then she proceeds to threaten to break up with me, calls me an idiot and makes me feel overall just incompetent for the next hour, telling me how much she hates me and how much I’ve hurt her. Granted her deceased father was a drug addict and it explains her negative feelings towards the situation but AITA for doing it and really still not feeling like it’s that big of a deal?",

      "description": " I'm curvy, but petite. I'm 5'1\" and about a size 6-8 US with most of my weight being in my butt and boobs (I'm a 30F so big boobs, small frame). \n\nAt least once/month, a woman offers me a seat on the subway - crowed, not crowed, doesn't matter. ALWAYS slim/skinny women. Sometimes they watch me walk in, stare at my stomach area then immediately get up, wave me over loudly \"would you like my seat?!\" and then become insistent when I say no, I'm fine. At first I used to say, \"No thanks - I'm fine!\" and now I just say \"No\" bluntly and look away. They still offer. Sometimes they'll be sitting for 2-3 stops without looking at me, then when they *do* look they immediately panic and offer me their seat while standing and making room for me to sit. \"Please, please take my seat!\", etc.\n\nI wear a typical \"Canada Goose\" style jacket with a waist belt cinched in to emphasize my smaller waist. My sister even joked \"Now people will stop offering you seats on the subway!\"\n\nAgain - I DO NOT LOOK PREGNANT. People often point out how small my waist is. \n\nIt happened this morning. Got on subway, stood for 2 stops, woman looks up and then loudly asks me if I'd like to take her seat while getting up and moving away, waving me to sit. I said \"Nope\" and looked away. I could see people staring at me like, \"Well, that was a bit rude...!\" (to me because I said no and looked away!)\n\nMy husband, at this point, is pretty angry that this keeps happening because he knows it hurts and he can see in my face that I'm embarrassed. Today he 'joked' that next time he's going to call them out and embarrass them, but I told him I don't need defending and can stand up for myself.\n\nBut WIBTA for calling them out and embarrassing them back? What do I even say to that?? \"No thanks - and I'm not pregnant....\" He thinks that would be enough as they'd just shut up or apologize but I think they'd just double down and deny that's why they were offering. But I'm entirely able-bodied, don't have a cane, I'm young (37 but easily pass for mid-late 20's), I stand and don't complain, etc. There were even other women standing around me today - all small framed/slim. I didn't see her jump to offer any of them seats.",

      "description": "So this past winter break my good friend from college, Caroline, invited me on a 10-day trip to Germany. \n\nI knew Caroline “studied” in Germany for 3 weeks during summer while she was 15.\n\nWe arrive in Germany and she says she’s reconnected with a friend, named Jack, from when she studied there and she asked if I’d be up to meet him. I said sure.\n\nJack introduced us to a group of his hometown friends, and as the night progressed Caroline begins HEAVILY flirting with one of Jack’s friends, Paul. She’s so into Paul that she’s actively ignoring me/anyone else in the group who tries talk to her. She later hooks up with Paul (while me and Jack try to get some sleep in the bed next to them) on the first night. \n\nFor the rest of the 10 days, Caroline would think up ways to see Paul. Since Paul didn’t have a car, he always came with Jack. So trip basically turned into Caroline making out constantly with Paul while I walked around and did touristy stuff with/got to know Jack. \n\nI’ll skip a lot of details because this is already long...but basically at the end of the 10 days me and Jack were feeling really close, and while Paul and Caroline were out on the last night, me and Jack hooked up. \n\nThe next morning I told Caroline that I finally sealed the deal with Jack and to my surprise...she FLIPPED out on me, called me an asshole, bitch, slut, etc etc.\n\nApparently she had this huge crush on Jack during that 3 week program in high school (5 years ago) AND she planned the trip to Germany to see if “he still felt anything” AND that she was only getting with Paul to make Jack jealous, AND that if I really was her good friend I would have been able to tell that it was actually Jack who she liked and not Paul. Basically she was upset I hooked up with Jack and demanded I apologize. \n\nI refused to apologize, I told her I’d have no way of knowing that, that I had fun with Jack and that  I was creeped out that she planned a trip from the US to Germany JUST to see if her high school crush from 5 years ago liked her back.\n\nIt’s been over a month since we came back from the trip and she’s still demanding I apologize for being a “slutty bitch” and “ruining the trip.” I see no reason to, but she’s being so insistent I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong. \n \nAITA for sleeping with Jack?",

I don’t know what we were talking about but somehow she ended up trying to spell my name.\n\nMy name is Nicholas by the way, a very common name (at least in the US).\n\nShe spelled it “Nickoles.” I told her she was wrong and then she tried “Nicholes,” “Nicholos,” “Nicholis,” and finally she spelled it correctly. It took her five tries to spell my name. Not only a common name, but the name of her brother.\n\nI was hurt and got pretty mad. It seemed to show a lack of care and respect for me. What’s worse is that she can spell her friend’s names like Jerusha and Nevaeh.\n\nMy sister got extremely mad at me for getting mad at her and in the end, I got yelled at by both my sister and mother for a good while and then told that I shouldn’t be so mean to my sister for something so minor.\n\nLet me note, I didn’t hit her or scream at her or anything terrible like that. The worst I did was yell once we started arguing about it and not talk to her for a few hours.\n\nI honestly forgot about it for a good while but I remember the encounter and thought you all might be able to either confirm what I thought or explain why I was being an asshole.",

      "description": "I offer tuition to children from my home. The parents are asked to pay me by bank transfer at the start of the month and this is written out in their contract. Some folks do this manually and others set up a standing order where the bank automatically sends my fee across. \n\nG has sent their children for lessons with me since May 2018. In October G was 2 weeks late paying me. In November G was 3 weeks late paying me. Both months I texted reminders and reminded G face to face. G never brought it up with me or premptively apologised for paying me late, it was me who had to bring it up with them each time. G also never mentioned a reason or apologised for paying me late just that \"it's been paid now\".\n\nAfter being paid 3 weeks late in November I made it very clear that according to our contract I was to be paid at the start of the month. I asked that they do this in future and consider setting up a standing order. In December a few days passed without payment and I contacted G again. They said they were unsure about my holiday dates and told me that they planned to take Christmas day off that month and asked how much that changed their fee to (it actually didn't change their fee. My fee is averaged out each month and this is detailed in our contract). I confirmed that I would also be taking Christmas day off and asked them to pay me. G paid me and said they would set up a standing order for January.\n\nThis month 12 days passed with no payment. I did not chase G for my fee this time. Instead I gave them 10 days grace (taught their kids once in that time span) and then offered their lesson time to someone else. I texted them yesterday to say I didn't think things were working out and gave them a couple numbers for other tutors to try. G said they were \"very sorry\", they had set up a standing order but saw that it had accidentally been set up for 1st December 2019 instead of 1st January 2019. They sent me a screenshot of this. I replied to say that I had already passed their lesson time on to someone else. \n\nAm I the asshole for not chasing them up a 4th month in a row? If the standing order mistake is true then am I the asshole for assuming that they just forgot to pay me again? I saw them FTF last week and G didn't mention setting up a standing order and didn't ask if the fee had come through. Am I the asshole for not asking them?\n\nOther points that made me decide to finally drop them: they only paid me on time in June and September 2018. They paid me late in May, October, November, December 2018 and not at all this month. They took 10 weeks off over summer which is unusually long (other students take 3-6 weeks off over summer) so no fees paid in July/August. The kids turned up 50% of the time without their books. It took G from May to late September 2018 to buy 2/3 books I requested they purchase and I spent each week prior working from old books or photocopies that I provided. G never bought the 3rd book I asked them to get.",

I'm a closeted ex muslim and my family can't ever know about that.\n\nWhen I first told her she texted my mum to pray for me as I think too much and need prayers, they both never told me, I knew on my own.\n\nShe thinks I'm sick and wants me to go to a psychiatrist, I refused saying I'm fine and will know when I need to go. She then texted mum asking if I was behaving differently, I found out on my own, she took a snapshot of their conversation \"the non related part\" and sent it to me but this is unrelated.\n\nI found that mum never mentioned she talked to her and when I went home I checked mum's phone. \" I know it's not okay but friend has depression and I feared she might have told mum unreal things about my mental health\" I'm okay btw but she heard from another friend that I had problems concentrating for an exam and she took it way too far.\n\nSo, yesterday she asked me to delete her sister's number from the contacts that can see my status because she started asking my friend about what I mean with them, I said no and told her to simply shut her sister off by telling her she didn't know. She said she has no energy for that and can't deal with it now, maybe after she finishes her medication she'll be able to deal with her family knowing about me.\n\nI said this is personal and I don't want to delete her sister, if she asks her something she can just ask me because it's my problem. She said not when it's in my house, and she doesn't want her family to know. \n\nToday, for the first time mum asked me to translate my status - that are im English - , I asked why all of a sudden she said she wants to understand them.\n\n I asked my friend if she said anything about the status, she said that whether she told mum or not where's the problem, and that since I'm putting these status mum can ask to know what they meant, then said she didn't tell her cuz she's not crazy nor afraid to tell me if she did.\n\nI blocked her. \n\nTl;dr, friend might have told a big secret of mine to my mother and I didn't believe her that she didn't.

      "description": "**NSFW tag because of trauma? I've seen other subreddits require this for stuff that might trigger other people who've gone through domestic abuse/ sexual abuse/ etc.) I can remove it if unnecessary.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for a few years. Over time she has slowly revealed how abusive and toxic her dad is. She's had to see therapists in dealing with the trauma he has caused. This Christmas, she finally outright refused to go home and finally said how she actually felt about him as a father and human being (all of it being negative). Now her mother is trying to convince her to go home again and to \"give him another chance.\" Now I obviously can't just list all this man's wrongdoings, which would obviously be biased, but I have one incident and a few factors that stands out to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she was in highschool she started \"dating\" a black guy. She's a pretty innocent girl and has never been a drug abuser, diving into sexual relationships too young, and get's good grades. Her dad's response is to call her names, threaten to kill the black guy's family, and **load and unload a gun** while threatening her. She says she can't remember if it was pointed at her because she was so scared of dying. Remember, she's a teenager at this point. The next day he claims to \"forget\" he did that and laughs it off. He frequently sends out creepy/threatening texts and claims to \"forget\" he sent them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe claims to forget because hes on pain medication, which I'm sure is just an opioid addiction. He \"hurt his back\" and hasn't worked in decades, hasn't left the house in two years, and generally cycles between watching tv, attempting to sleep, chewing tobacco, and eating microwaveable food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo two days ago, my girlfriend gets a phone call from her dad. It starts off well, him being normal for once. Just him asking if she's going to back for Christmas. She initially says yes because it's so unusual for him to be \"nice\" (as in normal to ask your daughter politely to come home for Christmas). This conversation somehow turns into a 45 minute rant including things such as \"I was so sad when your brother and you left for college that I went around punching holes in the wall.\" \"If you go to Japan again, he (as in OP) will just sell you.\" \"I didn't watch your graduation ceremony online because I think people are spying on me through the streaming website.\" (This is for the UC Davis online stream of the graduation ceremoney, he couldn't go because he has \"anxiety\" and hasn't left home in over 2 years.) Also, class emotional abuse lines such as \"If you're coming home for less than 7 days, then don't bother coming at all.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, now her mom is calling trying to convince her to go home and saying \"he still expects you to come home.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, this guy clearly has the emotional maturity of a 17 year old. I don't care what kind of bullshit \"family first\" excuse he says. He used a loaded gun to threaten his teenage daughter. Why should anyone like that ever be trusted? I don't know what kind crazy he'll pull this year? Murder suicide is pretty damn on my list of **very possible things he'd do**. Are we the assholes/ is she the asshole for refusing to go home to a psychopath?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, we are both in our mid-twenties and live together. I feel like that may be relevant to some people? I don't want people to think we're teenagers running away from home for Christmas or anything. Honestly, this guy should be on some watch list because he's another pop-up add away from shooting up a mall or something, but the only people that know how crazy he is either won't say anything or don't have physical proof. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm 20yo with my sister (18yo) and my mother and stepdad in the house. It's 2am and I'm watching a movie from my bed. \n\nIt's both exams for me and my sister, which means studying entire days. I got lucky by having a free day to watch a movie.\n\nAll of a sudden my sister walks into my room and asks if I could help her with the printer which wasn't working. I tell her no and that she shouldn't use the printer since it would wake up our parents. She proceeded to go to the printer room, with angry feet.\n\nOur house doesn't have good sound isolation, so you can basically hear all doors and footsteps at night. This in combination with the sleep problems of our mom gives some troubled nights for her.\n\nI follow her and angrily whisper that she should be quiet. She answers in a loud voice that I should just help her to print, being 7 meters away from our parents room. I whispered that she should shut up and started cussing at her (in whispering voice) that she was extremely disrespectful towards our parents. Then she started shouting, which made me gave her the bird and go back to my room to ignore her, so she would shut up.\n\nFinally she left me with some messages saying 'With that aggression you'll never get a girlfriend' and 'Why do you always act like a dick to me'. As you might've guessed, similar situations have happened before.\n\nI get that she needs to study and that I should've been less angry, but I think it's her fault for not printing at a normal time and that she could wait.\n\nI think she's an asshole, but was I an asshole as well?",

      "title": "AITA for not giving into my older roommate's demands about my gf?",
      "description": "For context, I'm a 23 year old living in a subletted room of an apartment of a 43 year old professor. No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN MY ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.\n\nMy roommate also didn't tell me that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.\n\nWe're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.\n\nRoommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she \"can't focus with more than one person in the apartment\" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.\n\nNow the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, I manage to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while we're out, I get this text message. \n\n\"if possible I’d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I’m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I’ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable.\" \n\nWhen I saw that text, i just broke down crying. It definitely not the whole weekend? I was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew I was upset about my kid dying. \n\nit's not just her home, I also pay rent here. I don't know. AMTA? I'm tearing up while re-reading that text. I'm moving out at the end of December which I'm very thankful for, I'm just nervous for these next few weeks. My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her. Also I keep saying in my room because whether or not my girlfriend is there, I'm in my room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. \n\nTL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that. I've tried to be accommodating to my roommate about my girlfriend, and roommate was ok with my girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to me about my girlfriend being in my room 2 days after one of my 7-year-old students was shot. AITA? ",

      "description": "My gf and I have been together for 3 years, and I have continually wanted to have sex work her whenever I can. Not in gross way, but like, hey we have the house alone today (we're both college students living with our parents), hopefully we can have sex. I see her three to four times a week, however we only have sex about three to four times a month. We don't even do things over the internet sexually anymore like sext or anything. We used to once upon a time but now she just prefers to look at porn when she's not physically with me and when we're together it just feels like pity sex. What really irked me was me asking her to masturbate with her a few nights ago, and her saying no because I hadn't slept very well for a few nights and it was very late (which was true), and her saying she would wait until tomorrow to masturbate with me, and the very next morning I find out she masturbated without me. I wasn't going out of my way to snoop on her, but she decided to take my phone to play Christmas music on the speaker and I have Spotify premium so it was easier so she said to use my phone. I went on chrome on her phone for Reddit, and the most recent tab was a porn tab, so my mind wandered and I checked her browser history and she spent a few hours on porn the night before. \n\nI don't have any issues with her looking at porn. I personally don't look at porn, I know it's  weird, but I rather just wait for my significant other and be as intimate as I can with them as often as I can. But sure, people like porn because things are appealing to them. Okay. But I just think it's unfair to say \"hey, I won't masturbate, you go to sleep\" then they go and masturbate anyways? If that were the case, just tell me and I can masturbate to pictures of you all alone :( \n\nIdk I just think it's strange how often we see each other and considering how long we've been together that our sex life is just so non-existent now. Like sure we'll touch each other when we're physically together then have a few minutes of sex. (not because I came too quickly but because she just wants to stop) I do warm her up. I do go down on her. I do ask her to try new things on bed. I even ask her if she wants me to act out any specific porn or whatever. It's just saddening that I continually ask to masturbate together and for one reason or another, she finds a reason not to. I have spoken to her about it but idk if I'm being too clingy as a bf to her and asking for too much sex. I know she has a sex drive because she admits to looking at porn almost every day for like an hour?! Sorry for the rant I just don't know whether I'm the jerk for wanting more sex time and mutual masturbation time or if she's the jerk. ",

We got engaged 5 months ago. \n\nI have two kids from a previous relationship she has a daughter with serious medical needs. I’ve learned how to care for her.\n\nI have my children ever other weekend and those children are the world to me, weekends when I have them are soooo important. My SO’s daughter lives with us and goes to her dads when I don’t have the kids. So we get a weekend together having fun without the kids and a weekend family time where the kids are together. \n\nOk so this weekend hasn’t been too good so far. My SO suffers from heavy PMT, she’s been down, withdrawn and irritable. During these times she also is unloving showing no affection towards me. I’ve tried my best to help her, take the kids, give her space etc. Tonight she’s invited to a party of some friends who she hasn’t seen in a while, I encourage her to go to it to cheer herself up. She said maybe she’ll go for a few hours. She left at 5.30 pm. She gave a cold good bye and left. \n\nI’ve just woken up, she’s not here, Its now 3.45am and I’ve text her to check to see if she’s ok. She’s text back and said she’s sorry, she’s had a load of whisky and is dancing in the kitchen atm!!!!! Wtf\n\nShe gets the worst hangovers. So, that means tomorrow she isn’t going to be any good until my kids are going back to there mums. I won’t be able to leave the flat with 3 of them. \n\nBefore going out she did offer to take her daughter to her mums tonight. But I said no as it didn’t seem right not all being together as a family. \n\nSo because of the PMS and this night out, my whole weekend with my kids, time for us as a family has been ruined, we’ve done nothing together. I feel like a single dad sometimes. ☹️\n\n(She’s still out BTW)\n\nAITA?? I know I’ve put this from my prospective so please ask questions. ",

As in, I'm still 5cm (2 inches) shorter and \\~30 kilograms (70 pounds) lighter than my dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family was out vacationing and after eating dinner, mom didn't feel so well, so she started complaining, and when mom is upset she likes to play cold (and she can be really infuriating with it). She demands a cup of hot water at some place, but dad rushes us \"home\" (to the apartment we were staying at). On the subway, she stands in the adjacent car and won't talk to any of us. When we get home, mom and dad argue, and it escalates into a fight, with dad punching her. I saw him grab a knife, but I was still shocked, and 12-year-old me didn't have any balls to fight an angry, 80-kilogram (170-pound) dad. Now, I knew dad wouldn't use the knife, since even when he's really mad he usually threatens with excess force that he'll never use, but I've never seen him pull a knife before. I think \\*Oh, this is serious, even though no one's getting stabbed it still shows that he's the angriest I've ever seen him\\* (to this day it still is), snatch mom's phone, and call the police. Mom tries to run outside but dad pulls her back in. Police come, no one presses charges, but dad is super mad at me. Now it's nighttime, and I usually sleep in the same bed as dad, but this night I'm scared and sleep with mom and a very upset younger sister. She locks the door for good measure, but at 2 in the morning dad picks the lock with a knife, drags me out of bed, and lashes out at me for calling the police. He tells me never to do it again, and that \"we're family and we should keep it in,\" that the police will only do worse, and that he can lose his job over this. I think of all the counterarguments, but arguing with this guy is like trying to douse a fire with alcohol, so I don't. (Quick r/legaladvice: if no one presses charges but the police have to take him away because someone's hurt, can his employer see his record? This thing would be a misdemeanor—no one was seriously hurt; mom only got a small bruise.) ",

We would text during the night, and because of our schedules, we both had to wake up at 8am, I liked to go to sleep anywhere from 11pm-1am, however she stayed up til 3-5am every night because of her insomnia. She NEVER let me go to sleep easily. If I texted her before 2am saying that I wanted to go to sleep, she’s would get angry and we would have an argument because she didn’t want to be alone while she couldn’t sleep. She tried to get me to stay up very late with her every single night, and because I was so in love with her I did a lot of the time, and if I didn’t, I would wake her to 5-20 texts from her all about how I must hate her and we might as well break up.\n\nI’ve texted her many many times (during the day) that if she can’t let me get decent sleep then I’m going to have to break how with her because... I like sleep, so she had plenty of warning \nOne night in particular she somehow convinced me to stay up til 4am\nWe both had class the next day, and I literally just had surgery about a week ago\n\nI’m falling asleep in class only to be woken by the pain in my side I would feel from the surgery if I didn’t sit a certain way, it was so horrible and felt like torture \nWe both had study hall the next hour and she sat a few seats away from me for whatever reason (she wasn’t mad at me or anything but I just don’t remember) and just looking at her being perfectly fine compared to what I was going through made me so upset so I texted her right then that I couldn’t take it anymore and I was breaking up with her.\n\nI know I should waited for us to be out of class and had this conversation with her in person but I was so mad and tired and in pain I couldn’t think straight and I didn’t care. \nI watched her pull out her phone and instantly have a face of shock and sadness, she pulled her hoodie up and put her face in her hands and she cried for the entire rest of the study hall session.\n\nAlthough I felt bad, I felt validated in my actions for months but recently I’ve been feeling that maybe I was too harsh, should’ve given her another chance or warning or something. Idk, what do you guys think? AITA?",

      "description": "I am a runner, currently marathon training, taking it seriously. \n\nMy regular route is along the coast (south England).\n\nIt is a narrow tarmac path surrounded either by grass or beach shale. \n\nTo begin with I will acknowledge other pedestrians have equal rights to the path.\n\nGiven I'm running at 6mph it is much harder for me to step off the path, higher momentum.\n\nI am wearing road shoes, which are not as suited to mud (it rains a lot in the uk) as the pedestrians walking boots.\n\nI am much more likely to trip or fall on shale or mud going at speed.\n\nOld and disabled people get a free pass obviously, and if you're walking away from me I understand. But if you are walking 2 abreast coming towards me, get in single file or step off the path. Don't just glare me down.\n\nPs dogs on leads need to be on the same side of the path as owners, or else you are a walking trip wire. \n\nUpdate:\n\nIt seems I have received a fair bit of internet hate and taken a karma hit. Let me share what I have learnt.\n\nI take the point about \"whoever is the cause of danger should take responsibility for this risk\" and as such I will be dodging when necessary.\n\nI think the ahole judgement is a little misdirected: too much focus on my perceived entitlement to the WHOLE path. Let me clarify I am primarily focussed on groups who walk two abreast and don't drop to single file.\n\nAlso to pick up on some of the hate: a lot of people have commented that I should go somewhere else / the path is meant for pedestrians / people just want to enjoy themselves.  To them I respond: I live in the coast my options are either drive somewhere, run through the city or run along the coast, this is my home; I am a pedestrian, I appreciate that bikes and skateboards can be dangerous, I am not a bike ; I am people I also just want to enjoy myself.\n\nI get the feeling that a few people have brought their own experiences to the table when deciding, it sounds like there is a lot of frustration in both directions. So let me remind everyone, in the words of Plato: be kind , for everyone is fighting their own battle . \n\n",

      "description": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm mostly confused about this and wanted to maybe get some other perspectives on this.\n\nI've been watching a relatively small streamer for a few months now and the chat feels like a small family, everyone knows each other and talks among them and with the streamer. Now a woman who always used to be there and talked very friendly with everyone hasn't been there for a few weeks now and I kind of missed her, so I added her as a friend on Twitch which she accepted. Then the dialogue went as follows, I'm copying my messages and transcribing hers as I assume she wouldn't want me to copy them:\n\nMe: Hey! Haven't seen you around in a while, all good with you?\n\nHer: Hey! I'm perfect, how about you?\n\nMe: That's good to hear! I'm getting done with college right now, only one more exam to go! Did you find some new streamers? I was surprised to not see you in [streamer]'s chat anymore\n\nHer: Says she'd like to curse at me, asks my how I'm of the opinion that this is an acceptable question, how it's way too personal as we've only talked a few times, asks me why I care and to back off, says I should find someone else to talk about.\n\nMe: I'm terribly sorry if I offended you by this, I was just sad to not see you in chat anymore and yes a bit curious and wanted to make conversation. I guess I crossed a border I didn't see, so I'll just back off then.\n\nShe had already deleted me from her friends list by then. If she felt like that was too personal, why did she add me in the first place? To be honest I was trying to take the high road here because my first thought was \"wth is your problem?\". I assume it might have something to do with her having an unpleasant exchange with [streamer] at some point, because he had mentioned something like that, so maybe I just struck a nerve.\n\nHowever, AITA? I just don't see how any of this was inappropriate.",

It being the first day, I'm really jetlagged and look like shit, with that nasty grey tone to your skin when youve not had enough sleep. Add to that my hair is greasy, I'm not wearing a bra, and it's a really unflattering angle on my nose. Despite all this he printed it and framed it for my grandma. I really hate this picture and wish I'd never taken it. I never would have sent it if I'd realised it WOULDN'T be just some throwaway. \n\nWhen I moved back home and saw it framed and up I was so pissed off and upset. I begged them both to get rid of it and offered to find another picture for the frame if she really wanted it. It's the only picture of me over the age of 10 and it's not because other pictures don't exist. I really liked my graduation photos and they are nowhere to be seen in her house or anyone else's in my family. I occasionally send my dad pictures of me and schoolfriends, or me and my partner at events and noone seems interested. Just this horrible ugly picture of me that makes me feel sick.it's been there for about 5 years and I shudder whenever I see it. Everyone told me not to be silly. But if it was so trivial, why couldnt it just go?\n\nI left intensive eating disorder treatment earlier this year and decided I would try and eliminate things that made me feel shit from my life as far as possible. Two weeks ago I discreetly removed the picture from its frame and left a note \"IOU A NICER PICTURE OF METO REPLACE THIS\". I destroyed the photo. She just discovered this two nights ago and is, together with my dad, really angry and saying I've crossed a line.\n\nAITA? I found it borderline oppressive and noone even listened to my concerns, let alone took them seriously. ",

      "title": "AITA for being honest about my experiences with a racist teacher?",
      "description": "I'm a high school student, and the only black student in my graduating class. Until recently, there was a teacher (white) at my school who was remarkably well liked: but awful to me. He called me argumentative and accused me of trying to start fights. I'm a straight A student, but I would get consistently low grades on high effort, high quality work, and whenever my parents or other teachers or administrators tried to talk to him about it, he called me an \"underperforming student\". It damaged my self image, and made my white peers think they could treat me that way too. I always got told I was playing the black card, or that I was an angry black girl. Recently he assigned an essay. I doubled the expected word count, exceeded all of his requirements, and turned in a thoroughly edited essay. He added and removed 30 commas and docked me 18 points with no comments on the actual content. My boyfriend is dysgraphic, and he often gets someone to scribe his essay. He's also white. I scribed this essay.; so it had all the same comma and grammatical errors I make. It was half as long and missing requirements. He got a 90. It was then that I realized that he docked my grades so he could excuse his racism by calling me and underperforming student. I got used that evidence and got my grade up to a 90. Then, for unrelated (truly) reasons, he resigned. Everyone, all the time, talks about how great he was.. how much they miss him, and I've made the decision to remind people how he treated me. Needless to say, I haven't been getting the greatest responses. He treated his white students great, and I can admit that. People have been talking about me behind my back, calling me a liar, lying about the things they saw, etc. It's also come up that it wasn't just me: he pressured a student to play soccer on the basis of being latina, and told a group of female athletes to \"lose weight before the season\". Anyway. Am I problematic for being honest about my opinion about him?\n\nTl;dr: I was discriminated against pretty egregiously by a teacher, and my white peers don't care and are upset at me for being honest about it. Am I problematic for even bothering? ",

      "description": "My husband and I are newlyweds and just bought our first house. When we lived in an apartment, it was pretty constantly messy, because I work about 70 hours a week and I ended up doing the majority of the cleaning (such as cleaning bathrooms, sweeping, vacuuming, etc.). However, I have also been working hard to improve my neatness, because I often would leave dishes out and such. My husband claims that because I would leave dishes out, it made him not care about the cleanliness of the rest of the apartment, which is why he never helped with cleaning tasks otherwise. This has caused multiple fights between us, as I view weekly tasks as separate from the daily tasks of picking up dishes. In other words, even if I miss a dish or two, the weekly stuff still needs to get done. He thinks that he’s under no obligation to do housework if I don’t pick up after myself and that I’m unreasonable (and rude) to suggest that he should. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "We (sadly) live with my girlfriends mom because her health isn't great. She needed extra help. But without telling me, her mom stopped contributing to rent. Rent is $1000. Utilities is 400$ roughly depending on season. I pay all the utilities. I used to pay for her mom's cell phone too when she was contributing but I cut her off (AITA for that??). All said and done I was paying over $600/mo for cell phone, electric, and internet. It was fine but now her mom is no longer contributing towards rent and only pays for \"food\" but she mostly shops for herself and no one else.. so that isn't even a fair contribution.   \n\n\nBasically, my girlfriend is paying $1000 rent and I'm paying utilities. $150 for internet, $200 for electric, and $150 for cells. I cut her mom off my cell plan so my girlfriend pays for her moms phone while I pay for my girlfriends phone (lol).  \n\n\nShould I be offering more money? I have plenty of money saved. I sometimes feel bad but at the same time her mom is a full grown adult who is capable of helping out. If she weren't it'd be a different story. Two years ago she flipped out on me when I bought hamburger meat because I bought cheap stuff (I only had $10 on me, was broke). I used my last dollars to get hamburger meat so she could get food that I didn't even like. She flipped out and said I was an asshole for buying cheap meat.  \n\n\nI'm planning on moving far away this summer. I just feel bad my girlfriend is getting screwed but she isn't really saying anything. AITA?",

      "description": "I am known to be a bit of an asshole, but this time I am not sure. Title is such for addition of context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort backstory. I just turned 30, this woman (or girl, we've known each other for almost 20 years) is a family friend through her parents, and the families have always been in good relationship. She got married for the first time in college and got a kid, divorced after two years, got another one some 18 months ago, got married instantly, divorced 6 months later. I wouldn't call her irresponsible, but she tends to sort her priorities quite weirdly (if a trip to the coast is more important than a physical exam, then...well...). I try to keep my distance and not get into any arguments, but on a regular basis I see all the problems. Both fathers hate each other, and their relationships with her and the kids are quite strained. She finds it hard to find and keep the job, and is generally very moody because of the whole situation. Her parents help her a lot actually, and kids have fairly healthy sorroundings.   \n\n\nThe issue is - she needs a job. Her parents are willing to finance her kids as much as possible, but her...not as much. She is seeing another guy now, and although he seems much better than previous two guys, I trully doubt he is capable of surviving with her.  \nShe, along with her parents, pleaded with me to ask my boss to hire her. I've been working there, I do my work well, and apart from boring middle-aged coworkers, I like it quite a bit. First reason I have no intention of doing that is because I don't want to risk my good reputation by bringing in someone who can make more potential mess than a helmet to Viggo Mortensen's boot contents. \n\nSecond reason - she needs to start sorting her life properly. I don't mind looking after her kids once in a while, but not if she wants to spend that time photoshooting with her friends for instagram or whatever. I don't mind them all coming to barbecue at my place, but I don't want her sitting on her ass texting while her kids are trying to hit each other in the head with firewood or whatever.  \n\n\nIt is not about hating kids or single mothers, I primarily don't care. I have a single mom neighbour who I've always been friendly with and we still exchange garden produce. I hate the \"oh let me live a little\" behaviour after making crucial life decisions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some context before I start, my mother has been divorced from my father for over 4 years and I heavily encouraged her to get a boyfriend but since I am introverted I did ask her beforehand not to have him over in the house all the time. Her current boyfriend is here 7 days a week for over 5 hours a day. It's almost like he lives here. I paid for the apartment and  I pay half the rent, I asked her to at least not have him here 2 days out of the 7. She throws a fit but I eventually convince her after reminding her that before they started dating I didn't want him here all the time. Now her boyfriend doesn't want to come over at all and it's pretty much turned in to a \"should you move out or should I move out?\" situation. Which is what I think he wants, he still lives with his wife and kids though they haven't actually been in a relationship for a while. (she cheated on him) and she knows about my mom. But I still think its sketchy that he basically wants to hop from one family to another. He refuses to live alone, I don't know if it's because of expenses or he can't function as an adult by himself but after knowing my mother for only 6 months he is heavily pushing for them to move in together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't talk to him at all but I know that he is respectful to my mother and me, and he was really helpful with us moving. But I don't appreciate that he is pushing so hard to move in with my mother because he doesn't want to be living with his soon to be wife, yet doesn't want to live alone. I don't like him being in my house 24/7 and I don't think I was being unreasonable for asking my mom for him not to be here at least 2 out of the 7 days a week. AITA for standing my ground and thinking his being to pushy? I don't want my mother to be unhappy and shes basing her happiness heavily on her relationship with him and right now I'm pretty much the biggest source of stress in their relationship because I don't want him moving in and don't want him around all the time. But I think the biggest problem here is that his to afraid to live alone and still hasn't divorced his cheating ex wife.",

      "title": "AITA For not walking my dogs when I am too fatigued, thus making my mom walk them when she gets home from work?",
      "description": "So for context, in the past I used to really dig my heels in the ground about walking the dogs simply due to outright laziness. When I was in high school, one the excuses was that I was too tired after school — and although true, wasn’t a good excuse since my mom is tired after work. Other times I outright refused. \n\nIn the present day, however, I am physically incapable of walking the dogs on some nights. I have been struggling with anorexia and although I have been trying to recover, I am still actively restricting. Due to the restricting I have done in the past and am doing currently, along with a large amount of weight I lost in a short amount of time, my physical health has taken a huge toll. \n\nI am currently being monitored about a heart arrhythmia, and also having rapid heart rate all of the time. No matter if my eating is more in the day, I also cannot stand or walk for long (normal) amounts of times. Going from a sitting to standing position leaves me winded, out of breath. \n\nI have explained this to my mom — who is a therapist by the way — and she has not been able to grasp that I am not refusing to walk the dogs due to how it was before. Also, before my physical health took a decline, I was walking the dogs every single day for over eight months. Before those eight months I was away and not living at home. \n\n&gt;&gt;When my sister is at home (she’s away at school), she is not required to walk the dogs — so if I’m not well enough to walk the dogs it still falls on my mother — which doesn’t make sense but whatever. \n\nI have had many conversations with my mother about my condition and have apologized to her. I have been intermittently walking the dogs when I’m able to as well. However, whenever I’m feeling too weak or too fatigued my mom will come home and start saying how she is so exhausted from work and how the dogs must be miserable having to wait for her when I’m there to walk them. When she get back from taking them out she will say “are you healthy enough to take off their leashes?” \n\nShe will always say she doesn’t understand and so I’ll talk with her again and we will go into a back and forth, and I’ll offer to send her information about the physical effects I am feeling. \n\nI have also tried to get her to come meet with my dietitian but with no avail. \n\nMy siblings text me saying “why aren’t you helping mom with the dogs?” all of the time no matter how much I explain to them either. \n\nI feel so guilty that I make my dogs suffer when they have to wait to go out and I hate fighting with my mom, but I also don’t want to pass out while walking my dogs. \n\nAm I the asshole? Is this all my fault? I don’t know what to do 😞\n\n",

      "description": "This is nothing dramatic, but something that happens more than I‘d like.\n\nI’m 17 and live with my mum and my stepdad (which will hopefully change very soon.) I like my mum except when she gets bitchy and I didn‘t really get well along with my stepdad at first. Now I tolerate him, but I definitely don‘t click with him.\n\nWe had a busy weekend and were all hanging out in the living room. I was watching video essays because I think they‘re interesting and I like when somebody talks, as my parents are usually very quiet. Because they prefer silence, they also were kinda annoyed by the videos and insulted them. Not very nice, but I didn‘t care that much.\n\nMy stepdad drank a beer and the smell suddenly reminded me of when I got harassed a few days ago by a drunk old man. Without thinking I blurted out: „You stink like that old man I told you about.“ He immediately left the room and locked himself in the bedroom with the beer. \nMy mum got even more bitchy than before and told me I should go and apologize and also be nicer to him since he drives me around a lot (he really does which is very nice of him, but I‘m not good at being overly friendly to people I don‘t like).\nI tried to explain to her that I didn‘t mean to insult him and that the smell just reminded me of this specific thing. Now she‘s in the bedroom too.\n\nI don‘t want to apologize. I realize how that sounded horrible, but I genuinely don‘t feel sorry for it and an apology would feel forced and dishonest. I don‘t feel sorry because I don‘t care about my stepdad‘s feelings (which kinda makes me an asshole, but I can‘t control who I feel sympathy for). Besides, my stepdad makes mean comments about spitting in my food and me being stupid and useless all the time and stuff like dad isn‘t that big of a deal. I honestly think they‘re both overreacting because they were already annoyed by the video essays.\n\nTLDR;I‘m an annoying teenager, accidentally insulted my stepdad, parents want me to apologize, I don‘t feel like I have to.\n",

      "description": "I'm 16 nearing the end of sophomore year along with my best friend throught the year the friend has missed a lot of school at least 3 to 5 whole school weeks the reason being games and an awful sleep schedule. He has terrible grades in third quarter with all d's and f's and a single a. \n\nHe will most likely not get accepted into a single college at this rate. His plan however is that he will go into Iowa National Guard and that will be some miracle that turns his life around. My friend is not overly athletic he doesn't do sports and at most lifts maybe some weights not the sets but just the small dumbbell and fights occasionally.  His sleep schedule is God awful recently he didn't wake up until 5 pm. \n\nThis fear is exasperated by the fact that I saw a friend of mine who is in national Guard working at a gas station  saying that the Ng is more like a part time job. When I went to tell my friend why I didn't think it was a good idea I was told off by him and another friend who is a junior and in alternative school that wants to go into national Guard that I'm being egotistical and that it will work out. I don't believe that either of them but especially my best friend will even be able to qualify for it. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "First time poster, long time lurker, sorry I'm on mobile. I'm trying not to word vomit or ramble so let me know if I need to trim anything or add INFO. TLDR at the bottom\n\nI've been incredibly ill since Wednesday, 5 days ago. Bedridden, could not drink or eat anything.\nFriday morning, after some food and meds, I thought I was feeling well enough to attend an event for my Aunt's birthday that I had already agreed to prior and had purchased tickets for.\n\nI ended up passing out right in the doorway of the venue and immediately had to be taken home. Everything was pretty much closed at that hour and going to the ER seemed a bit much as I hadn't hit my head, so I decided to just go home with my mom and go to immediate care the next morning.\n\nMy heart rate was elevated for someone of my age and size (150 bpm for a 123 lb 5 foot one 21 y/o). They ran a bunch of tests, including an EKG, and were prepared to send me to the ER for an IV if my vitals didn't mellow out while I was there/if I couldn't keep down the water they wanted me to drink.\n\nLuckily they cleared me to leave after a couple hours and some prescriptions, but they did warn me against driving in my state as losing consciousness again was still a concern.\n\nI've been incredibly weak and sick so I've been staying at my family home, which was a closer drive from the center and I didn't want to be on the road too long. I've been here since Friday so far with marginal improvement, so I know I'm staying at least one more night.\n\nSo back at my place, I live in a house with 3 roommates I get along well with. 2 of them I've known for a long time. We're all on different schedules so we don't \"hang out\" all that much but I like to think we all maintain a good relationship.\n\nAt that house, trash is collected every Tuesday morning, so the morning after next. I know for a fact that I have 2 bags of trash in my room and there's one full bag of trash in the shared bathroom. Would I be an asshole if I asked them to take the trash out for me if I still can't make it home by tomorrow night? I know it's not their mess (my 2 bags at least) and it would definitely be a favor that is appreciated instead of something I expected from them.\n\nI don't want to seem like a demanding dick but I also would really like to not come back home to a room that smells like rotting garbage, since I dont know yet when I'll be back. \n\nI've done favors for each of them before but, like I said, we don't particularly interact all that often for extended periods of time so we aren't the closest of groups.\n\nTLDR; I've been super sick and haven't been home in a few days, probably won't be home for a few more.

      "description": "About six months ago I began noticing that something wasn't quite right with a coworker (Miriam). She is in a different department but my team works with her on some projects. Issues ranged from emails written so oddly that intentions were unclear to ignoring/violating corporate compliance. Shortly after I noticed the trend, another coworker mentioned similar issues they had with Miriam.\n\nOver the next few months, things got worse. Many times Miriam sent comments or direction either very vague or simply incorrect. In these instances, I would reply for clarifications: \"Can I get a few more details?\", \"Are you sure about this?\", \"How does that jibe with this other thing that would contradict it?\", \"Is this a new process?\", etc. Sometimes I'd get a response that made sense. Sometimes I just used my best judgment to move forward. Miriam didn't seem to notice either way.\n\nMy coworker has a good relationship with Miriam's supervisors (and I do not have a good relationship with those people) and had mentioned to them some of the smaller issues. The response was that Miriam is dealing with a family issue and to cut her some slack.\n\nMany projects that generally run smoothly had problems this year. As 2018 winds down, there have been talks about why certain projects were bogged down. Until last week, I'd only had private conversations with a couple people about Miriam being at the center of it. \n\nAt an event last week, which Miriam was not attending, I spoke up something like \"Miriam needs to take a break, handle whatever's distracting her from work, and come back when she can do her job well.\" This was not received very well by others.

I didn't take a picture of someone's face or body or any features that someone could make out who it was. I'm failing to see how I am getting a creep or taking away this person's privacy.

And Honestly no one in my life who I know would ignore my birthday wish (I wanted to be the first so I told you on the eve and you ignored that text so I gave you space because you wanted to not be that emotionally involved) then come to me drunk and upset about someone else not telling them happy birthday. Like honestly what the fuck? Who the fuck does that. And then to be like oh this girl who I used to date is one of those people, but she’s too cool now for me and living in LA....? (So you probably would drop everything to be with her if you had the chance to... that’s greaaaaaat.... that’s why you’ve been wanting me to take it slow... slow enough to not be alone till she’s available?) Like honestly I feel bad for you and wanted to do what I could to make you happy but try and treat people who try to show they care about you right and don’t be a dick to them. It’s fucking depressing... I always was optimistic but you didn’t seem to appreciate that at the time. I don’t even think you really appreciate it now. You say you do but your actions don’t. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: But one that I remember early on is you getting upset with me while you were in Hawaii for not really taking it that serious when you asked if I wanted to come join you (I literally asked if he wanted to go.... he said he couldn’t affford it and I said ok, i just thought it would be a fun thing but I understand... no pressure cause I know this is new, I’m just going alone so thought I’d ask). I made a joke about your tan line like the girl from the suntan bottle because I did not think I was insulting you but kinda being cute everyone has a tanline on their butt (I literally sent him a nude and he said “lol”) and you took great offense yo that and then when oh got back it was like super early and I did not think not freaking out you were back would be that big of a deal because we were going to hang out normal people times soon (he hardly talked to me, fucked me, went to sleep- I was gone for two weeks prior). I said I wanted you to tell me if I was doing things like that because I felt at that point I did not know what I was doing sometimes but maybe you were just more sensitive than I realized.\n\nThen blackout drunk thing was bad (but more for me I just shouldnt be doing that stuff) but as you know people on drugs are not themselves and are very unaware of what they were doing then you played it cool at the time only to leave in the morning and the plan was to just necer talk to me or see me again ignore my calls (I answered his calls... ) and texts forcing me to go and try to get an explanation that could have been a little sign I cared ya know if you just ghosted me and I didn’t give a shit why would I go to your place I would have just been like cool now I don’t have to deal with it \nI am not an alcoholic but I do have issues sometimes with taking my drinking too far and I guess my actions during those times are going to be put under a microscope the most instead of how I am sober. That is fine I was shitty to you those times I got drunk and I am sorry but as someone who said they have dealt with drug issues in the past maybe you could have talked to me about it and how the actual drinking was bothering you and how I acted during states of drunkenness were not okay and I would have listened not just ditch me and make me have to go to your place for you to finally tell me. \n\nSorry for being shitty I get the picture and I apologize. If you still just want to keep being mad and bring stuff up some more that is fine as well if it helps you out. And you can believe whatever you want to believe about me and my appreciation or feelings for you back then I know how I felt and that is fine again whatever helps you feel better. If you want to keep writing this stiff out I suggest doing it on a piece of paper or journal or something cuz me just responding and trying to make you not blame yourself is obviously riling you up and I am not responding anymore.\n\nSorry for everything you are a way better person than me so just take some comfort in the fact you don’t have to put up with my shit anymore.  Feel better, goodbye",

      "description": "AITA Every Friday I have this same calculus teacher come and teach me and strengthen concepts of the lessons for the AP calculus exam. I have a final exam (not the official just for school marks) this Tuesday sooo there isn't really another time for practicing and stuff I am extremely tight on time and the tutor knows that. I wrap my head with a bandana today cuz I'm feeling nauseous and to me wrapping my head makes me feel less nauseous and more focused. I opened the door for him while wearing a Red bandana don't think it's a problem and when he notices it he laughs at it for a second. i tell him I'm sick and have a painful ear infection and a bad case of strep throat. I tell him I organized all my books and papers for the upcoming finals (You know just small talk before we start the lesson) I Also tell him that one ear is almost deaf and in pain especially when hearing loud noises. He says that he had it last week but it wasn't as bad as mine. So he explains to me the new chapter before we start solving and I  ask him to repeat some points in the middle because I have a short attention span (I have ADHD which was diagnosed by psychologist). He's doesn't seem bothered or anything and repeats the terms normally. Now we start solving the test and he gets a notification on his phone And it is too loud and starts hurting my ears (the sound he has set for his notification takes time to finish). I just ask him if it's fine if he can just lower the volume for his notification because my ear is in actual pain and the volume is too loud. He closes his phone rigner and made no complain or negative reaction about it. We continue solving the questions he asks me look at the table he gave me I ask him If it is fine if I can try solving without looking at the table directly becuase understood how the table works and he explained it. I also wanted to try solving first without the table to see if I completely grasped the concept. He says fine with again no negative response and I proceed to solving this one question. it's a multiple choice question and I explain my answer to him (tried answering the question twice because first time I got the answer wrong) and he starts shouting at me telling me you should be looking at the table. He then continues shouting at me with a louder voice when I tell him that I understand it is my fault and I just really wanted to atleast see what my level is and what I should focus on. I just try to ask him respectively to lower his voice a little because my ear is in pain. He gets pissed and is like if you use that excuse one more time I'm leaving and that I'm acting as if I'm the teacher and he's the student telling him stuff like close ur phone and lower your voice. I start apologizing and telling him it is my fault and that I will not bring it up again after a few seconds of silence I try to bring us back to the topic of calculus. He stands up takes his keys and says I'm not doing this anymore then barges out the door. I was apologizing through the whole process of him getting up and everything. Through this whole thing I did not increase my voice becuase the pain of having a strep throat is extremely painful and increasing my voice would only make it worse I was talking in a low understandable tone (but not low to the point of whispering).

      "description": "My wife has been having a bad week, and between work and grad school, I haven't been there for her much. Last night I finally had some time, so I went to the store, bought all her favorite foods, had a movie night with her, then drew her a bath with a bath bomb and let her soak.\n\nThis was late at night, past the puppy's bedtime. I \\*did\\* take the dog out according to the usual schedule. She just refused to go. Not a good sign, but she's really good at whimpering in her crate until we wake up if she has to go in the middle of the night, so I put her to bed.\n\nWhile my wife was in the bath enjoying herself, I went and finished my homework. It was about 1am, and I was falling asleep while typing. Finished, asked wife if she would join me in bed.\n\nShe wasn't quite done yet. Normally I hate not going to sleep at the same time but I couldn't physically stay awake. So I told her I was going to lay down, please wake me when she came in so I could give her her official good night kiss.\n\n\\*Blackout\\* I sleep extremely well. Out instantly and awake with my alarm. That's my memory of last night. But apparently I missed some stuff.\n\nIt turns out, while I was asleep, my wife was so happy with me she wanted to do me a favor. So she gave the dog a bath. After the bath though, puppy finally asked to be taken outside. My wife wanted to change into pajamas, so dumped her on the bed and asked me to take her out.\n\nNow, I have a history of sleep talking. Sometimes this means my wife'll have an entire conversation with unconscious me, thinking I'm conscious, that I won't learn about until the next day. Up until last night, this was always humorous. Last night, it got me in trouble.\n\nAsleep me agreed verbally to take the dog out. My wife happily goes off to get dressed. Comes back several minutes later, dog has peed on the bed and is getting ready to take a dump on it. I'm rolled over sound asleep. Wife has to take the dog out, and is furious with me. She goes to sleep on the couch and leaves me there.\n\nPart of me thinks ITA because. . . well I agreed to do something and didn't and it resulted in a disgusting bed and my wife having a horrible night's sleep on the bed fuming at me for fairly justified reasons. But at the same time, she's blaming me for something I did while completely unconscious. I have no memory of any of that happening. Moreover. . . she made me sleep in a pee-soaked bed.\n\nSo AITA?",

She sits in the front in case someone walks in, and I'm either with her or in the back doing other things. (Things like cutting meat, folding boxes, ect). I am annoyed with her because she has a habit of falling asleep, its not like we are doing anything that requires our full attention, but it urkes me for some reason.

I could afford to loan him the money but the reason I didnt was I knew he would never pay me back and more than likely want to start treating me as if I was an ATM machine if I did.  \n\n\nFast forward a few months and he ends up finding out I gave (not loaned) I gave $400 to another friend on the proviso that they never come to me to ask for money again. They were about to be evicted from their place so I agreed to help them out this one time.  \n\n\nSo the friend I declined to help goes off at me, calls me all the names under the sun, says you call yourself a friend and you wont even help a good mate out but you help this guy. He viewed himself as a closer friend than the person I helped and to be fair he had been the closer friend for many years but we had started drifting apart not seeing each other all that much in the last couple of years, we ended up in a screaming match and say some things to each other we probably shouldnt have and that was the end of the friendship.  \n\n\nSo AITA for not lending him the money when I could afford to?

The problem is, she only bathes in the upstairs sink *ghetto style*.

I had this teacher last year and her class was interesting and I really wanted to be in her class again for the next year. However she’s started being really cringe at times and gives a lot of work but it’s tolerable. Recently she just started making the class REALLY boring by doing the same dumb and redundant activities with more redundant assignments which she claimed to be “fun”. I haven’t been in a really good mood either but I didn’t try to use it to affect how I was feeling. So the day of the journal check I wrote down in complete honesty how I’ve found the class boring and uninteresting and how a lot of the assignments feel redundant and whatnot. Later she reads it and calls me over talking about how she didn’t like at all what I wrote. I wanted to say you wanted honest feedback and I gave it. However I actually said that I must have wrote that because I was in a bad mood. Truth be told I was in a bad mood but I didn’t try to use that to affect what I was saying. \n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for getting sad, angry and irritated that my parents are giving my SO way more support whilst he's dealing with his mental health issues, than they ever did for me.",
      "description": "When I was 16, I broke down in my kitchen in front of my parents saying that I hate myself, I want to die and that I hate feeling so shit all the time, I need help.   \nI only got help by the time I was 24. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring that time gap, I was pretty much ignored by my mother, assumingly because she didn't want to acknowledge that there was something wrong with me. She pretty much buried her head in the sand and pretended I was fine, although I really wasn't and would NEVER bring up the topic of me being depressed, with the only exception being her telling me to \"just smile and be happy.\"  \nMy father constantly bullied me, even before my break down. I grew up scared of him and hating him. But during all this stuff about my mental health, I was told that I was \"Just making it up\" and to \"suck it up\" and that I need to \"nut the fuck up\" because I was upsetting my mum.   \n\n\nWe did get me an appointment to see a therapist back when I first broke down, but only had the 1 session and was then told that said therapist was moving away to africa, so it was the first and only session they were going to do for me.  \nDuring this session, the therapist INSISTED that my parents be in the room with me, so they were there for me telling the therapist about how bullied and ignored I felt.   \nThe whole situation caused my mother to cry when we got home and my father instantly berated me for having this whole situation happen. Everything was my fault and I was a horrible person for making my mother cry.  \n\n\nAfter that day, any discussion about getting my mental health sorted stopped. No talks about Drs, nothing. The only person who would talk to me about it, was my aunt, (who just so happens to be an anti-vaxxer, so yeah...)  who also has depression. But the problem with this was how my aunt basically scared me away from getting antidepressants cause she told me how they made her a completely different person and there were a tonne of side effects and I'd end up like her.  \nShe ended up buzz cutting her hair away multiple times and basically just being all over the fucking place, mentally.   \nSo I was terrified of antidepressants. I didn't want to turn into my aunt, who was just batshit at this point.  \n\n\nSo I went without help for several years. As a result, I had 0 energy or motivation during my GCSE and A-Level  exams, and I just passed all of them.   \n\n\nAfter college, I developed gallstones, of which the constant pain caused me to lose all my hair, I could hardly eat, move or do much of anything without just being in horrible pain. During this, my depression just got worse and worse.  \nI just went through every day being okay if something were to happen to cause my death.  \n3 years later and 1 gallbladder down, I was then diagnosed with a sliding hiatus hernia. This basically causes me similar pain to what I had with the gallstones. Only this is permanent, since Drs have stated that they really don't want to do surgery to fix it unless they REALLY have to.   \n\n\nDuring all this medical problems though, at 20, I found this lovely guy who's literally the light of my life. I really love him and hope to spend the rest of my days with him.  \n\n\nBut I also felt so sorry for him for having to deal with me and how bad my depression made me. But, he was the one who finally gave me the courage to go get antidepressants because I really didn't want to drag him down this dark, scary hole with me. Yes, it took a while at 24, but I got there.  \n\n\nI got counselling, as well as antidepressants. I was on the up, I can say they really helped me.  \nAll the while, I got 0 encouragement from my family about any of this, apart from my grandmother. She's my best friend and makes it 100% clear that I'm her favorite.   \nMy aunt kept trying to scare me away from Drs, my mother kept burying her head in the sand and my father just plain ignores me at this point.  \n\n\nI'm now playing assistant for my mother with her childcare business, while she goes through multiple surgeries for a shopping list of ailments. I practically have to do everything when she either can't use her arms or her eyes, depending on the surgery. When she's in a period of being ok, we tag team. All the jobs I either fully take over or tag team, is pretty much everything apart from laundry because my dad insists that he does it.  \n\nSo when mum is out of commission, I do all the cooking, cleaning and all the physical stuff with the kids, such as picking them up and loading them into the car, or lifting them on to the changing table. Basically all the physical stuff. Which with my hiatus hernia, can actually be really painful sometimes. Yet I still do it.   \nWhen mum is ok, we share the load.   \nDespite all this, I'm constantly told by both parents that, although I'm \"invaluable\", I'm still \"fucking useless and lazy\" for not washing up two plates a bowl and a mug one day cause I was waiting for more so it's not so much water used. \n\nI get this sort of shit constantly. All the while, my dad and bother do nothing to help.  \n\n\nBut recently, my SO has been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety and it's like my family's attitude has done a total 180. I would joke that my family liked my SO more than me, but now I'm starting to believe it.  \nMy mum and dad constantly ask about my SO and ask if he's okay and how he's doing with getting the help he needs and are now constantly asking me about what things they can send him to cheer him up, etc.   \nAlways offering treats and presents and a place to stay.  \n\n\nI'm happy they love him and everything... But, wth?   \nWhy is he getting all the love and support while I got nothing? I get so sad, angry and frustrated about this series of events that I'm starting to well up as I type.  \nI've been helping my SO and doing everything I can to help and support him during this process. We have gaming and/or movie nights, we indulge in MTG and all sorts of things. I even read him short stories to help him get to sleep when his anxiety is keeping him awake.   \n\n\nBut the fact he's getting so much love and attention from my parents is really frustrating me. I'm not mad at him, I'm mad at my parents.  \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So me and this girl started talking quite a while back and I liked her a lot and she seemed to like me back, so eventually I asked her to a school dance, we went, she said she was interested in me, and so we dated a bit.  However after several successful dates I asked if she wanted to make things official but she said no, she has had bad experiences with some of her exes and she wanted to get to know me better first.  Seemed reasonable to me so we carried on as we were for a while in this weird limbo between dating and not, and eventually I asked her again if she wanted to make things official.  This time her answer was a lot more ambiguous, something like \"I don't know, I'm not sure if I want a relationship rn.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this put me in a weird place bc I wasnt sure whether to continue investing in us or not, so naturally I struggled over this for a while.  Anyway fast forward about two weeks and she says yes she would like to make things official (It's worth noting that it had been about 2 months at this point).  So of course I was happy to finally be official but then she said that she doesn't want to kiss.  She said she doesnt want to kiss bc she is afraid she will lose control and it will escalate into sex, which she is not ready for yet (I dont mind this, if she isnt ready for sex she isnt ready, whatever), and partly because she has bad experiences with some bad exes.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I just cant help but feel so fucking frustrated, that Ive waited so long for a girl I really like just to have her say we cant go farther than a hug.  AITA for wanting to kiss her?  It seems like such a simple, minor, thing to me, but what do I know.",

      "description": "This is an alt account for obvious reasons. So I'm in college and currently my next door dorm neighbor who I'll call Chris has become one of my best friends. He's funny, sweet, cute and has helped me through a lot of my personal shit. I honestly don't deserve him as he helped me through some physical and emotional injuries over the year. I see him being present for the rest of my life for sure. Over the course of getting to know him I developed some romantic feelings for him but thought it was best not to do anything as it would be awkward if we broke up. Plus he has never dated anyone or has been sexually active. He's starting to become more into Christianity and I'm not super religious so I feel like I would ruin him if anything were to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Chris invited me to be his date ot this dance and I was ecstatic. We danced the night away even though I was on a crutch haha. Eventually he confessed that he had feelings for me and I was shocked that he did it. I said I did too but when I also confessed he had this serious look on his face and it seemed like he didn't care. I brought up my issues that I wrote above and he told me there's nothing I could do to harm him. It meant a lot and I asked him if we were official. Instead of saying yes he kept talking about not wanted to pressure me and we should go slow. After then we got interrupted and had to cut off the conversation. The rest of the night he didn't even kiss me so when we went back to our place I tried lay some hints down that I wanted to move things along physically. It seems he didn't care or was oblivious as he just got dressed and went to his best friends birthday party that he mentioned earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly I felt like shit but eventually I moved on and started talking to this guy who I'll call Dan from my club sport who was interested in me. Chris asked me out on a date a week later but I thought he was toying with my feelings at that point. Over our break I met up with Dan as I had surgery in his city. He asked me out and we started dating. When I came back to school I felt like I had to sort things out with Chris. Chris asked if I was dating Dan and I said not officially because I didn't want to hurt him. Then Chris started saying how he overheard us sleeping together like not too long after he asked me on a date and that gave him some kind of anxiety attack. I got super embarrassed and told him we were watching a raunchy movie and he believed me. So we worked things out and we seemed to patch our relationship up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to keep the two separated and had to tell Chris that I've been meeting up with others. But later my new roommate went and told him that I was dating Dan since break and now Chris is pissed that I've been lying to him. I think sometimes to protect those we care about we have to do things not normally ok but my other friends say I'm wrong and that I have issues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm such at a lost reddit, was I the asshole?",

      "description": "To put things in context, very fast : my mother left my father and I when I was a baby, letting him providing for us. Then the day my father remarried, had children and his wife made my life miserable until I decided to live with my grandparents.\n\nMy father and I haven't had a good relationship since then, and even before. I always considered him spineless and he resented me for what my mother did. Still, he helped me financially for my studies, and gave me a nest egg when I was adult. Mainly for fiscal optimization, but hey. The nest egg was supposed to be for everything besides the studies but I never touched it, preferring to work.\n\nWe saw each other during family events, but have no more affinities. I just see the ghost of someone I once liked. He lives a wealthy life, or so it seems, and I share none of his interests. He shares none of mine either.\n\nFast forward many many years, and here we are.\n\nTwo events degraded the already low esteem I had of him.\n\nFirst, his daughter, my half-sister, recently started to open herself to the world, seeing people outside of her close family circles, and especially dating a guy that her mother did not approve. Indeed she was already shipped with some other boy, thus her mother started to make my half-sister's life miserable too. When consulted about it, my father insisted that he would stay neutral in this matter. (Just like he was neutral about me years earlier, allowing his wife to lie and manipulate to her heart's content.)\n\nSecond, I recently had a child, and wanted to start investing in a home for my wife, my kid an I. To do so, I took the aforementionned nest egg into account. So I was surprised when I learned that my father had liquidated it to pay his taxes and debts.\n\nWhile he finally accepted to give this money back after a heated conversation (claiming that the money has always been his and that I should have taken it before if I needed it, and \"Welcome to life\"), I am still disgusted by the contrast between the high life he's living, his participation (even presidency) in a charity club, the money his spends in futilities with his wife and other son, and the fact that he took money that he claimed was mine in my back. The throwback to my previous situation with my half-sister doesn't help to appreciate him.\n\nThus I decided that this man and his wife had nothing of value to give to my family and especially my son. I especially don't want my stepmother to see him and I see him and her as a single entity at this point, so be it. Actually this money matter was a relief, because it gave me a solid reason to prevent them from reaching another kid.\n\nNot sure if I am an ingrateful asshole, overprotective, right or a little bit of both.",

      "description": "I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 6 years now, living together for 3. The entire time, he’s worked a really intense job, about an hour and a half away. The commute wouldn’t be so bad were it not for the 70 hour weeks. He loves our town though and refuses to move closer to work. \n\nHis company puts him up in a hotel for free and he usually stays near the office 2-3 nights a week. He’s been complaining about it a lot lately, mostly feeling like his life is constantly in flux (and he’s losing a lot of things...)\n\nHe’s mentioned getting a cheap room in a house with some of his colleagues but he mentions a lot of random ideas, so I figured we’d discuss it more seriously if it was...more serious. \n\nWell after not really talking outside of text for a few days because he was working 18-hour shifts...he came home and told me he rented a room (“I had to make an immediate choice when the opportunity came up”)\n\nOur finances are separate so money isn’t the issue but aita for being furious about this?",

      "description": "I’m in college, I’m a film student taking an online anatomy class to knock out a gen ed requirement. The class uses Smart Book by McGraw Hill. This program allows students to read, do assignments and take quizzes from an online text book. In addition, we also need to participate in a weekly discussion forum.\n\nI was working on the assignment in Smart Book and I had answered 70/100 questions and it said I had 70% progress. I had to close my browser at a certain point and when I reopened it, it took me back to the very first question. It still said I was 70% completed so I called customer support and they told me that I would only need to complete 30 more questions and the assignment would be complete.   \n\nThis was a lie. The site forced me to answer 70 extra questions with no credit before adding any progress to my assignment. Basically forcing me to do extra and ungraded homework for a class that I already consider a waste of my time for not being related to my major. Every week I’m neck deep in homework assignments from all courses and I value the little free time I get. This is cutting into the time I have to myself and the time I have to do other homework. \n\nI feel like I should receive extra credit for this, under the fact that I’m forced to do extra homework that I never asked for or was told I’d have to do in the first place.

      "description": "Throwaway account because some of my ‘friends’ follow me.\n\nMy mum cares about me and my life at school and regularly asks if I have friends and whether I’m happy or not. Usually I’d say yes because I want to keep her happy but recently it seems as though I’ve started to have less and less friends and I’m not sure who is a fake or a real friend. I decided to tell the truth to her as lying isn’t getting me anywhere. \n\nBit of extra info. I don’t really think of myself as a popular person - which I’m ok with, I’m an introvert and most of the time I’d prefer to be by myself than with friends. This is the case with most of the family, so we don’t go out much and my mum wanted to change this because she thinks I don’t like being with myself.\n\nGoing back to me telling her the truth about not thinking I have any friends. She asked one day “u/Steve-Irwins-Koala do you have any friends?” I said not really, she asked if I enjoy going out and I say not really e.t.c.\n\nWhen we got home, she asked my dad a question, like which of these bin bags is the right one for our bin and he said I’m not sure. She immediately used this as an excuse to start complaining about how my dad doesn’t do anything, about because he’s partly on the spectrum - barely - that his genes passed into mine and now I’m Autistic. She shouts that she is tired of me being antisocial and my dad being a nuisance. Don’t think I am autistic btw.\n\nI’m starting to think that telling her the truth has not gotten me anywhere and might actually affect some important aspect of mine and my dads life.\n\nTL;DR : mum always asks if I’m ok at school, I usually say yes but today I said no, she immediately starts flipping out when we get home and fights with me and my dad.\n\n",

Sure, I get the highest possible ratings on my review, but my raises are pennies.  Promotions only go to people who have been with the company for 15+ years, regardless of how much or little they do.\n\nIn my career I'd always take on extra work, do things what were not necessarily my job description but helpful for our department, strive to train and learn all the processes we do daily.  And it's gotten me nowhere.  So after our last \"raise\" I just decided I don't want to waste my time anymore.  I no longer do extra, I rarely help out.  Nobody has even said anything to me or asked why.\n\nNow today my coworker was talking about adding another process to our work we do jointly b/c she wanted something more to do since she was bored.  I want no parts of it and I said as much as politely as I could manage.  I can tell she's kinda annoyed with me.  Boss had no reaction.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to do more work or do extra things b/c I get almost nothing in return for my efforts?

      "description": "I work for a major retailer near a big city. Recently we hired a new kid named Chuck. Chuck is great. Chuck does their job, shows up on time, and is pleasant to be around. If you’ve ever worked retail you know not many people can check these 3 basic boxes. \n\nA couple months after being hired Chuck began asking people to not use him, he, bro, sir, etc when we referring to Chuck. Cool, no big deal, I’m down for respecting that sort of thing and I imagine it was super tough to tell someone let alone 30 plus people. Chuck is unsure if they are asexual or possibly even trans but knows they no longer want to be referred to with a male gendered pronoun. \n\nSo this was fine at first but has been becoming more difficult as time has wore on. It’s a daily struggle to drop man, sir, and bro from my phrases and mannerisms. And I feel terrible every time. Chuck just gives me this look until I realize that I’ve done it again, which I then apologize for again, and repeat ad nauseam. \n\nI’m not alone in this struggle and it’s wearing thin on several others. I’m to the point now where I just kind of avoid Chuck and limit my interactions with Chuck. I’ve even struggled to write this post ensuring not to refer to Chuck with a male pronoun. I like Chuck, but I don’t want to deal with Chuck anymore. I’m also very aware that this is most likely even more difficult for Chuck than it is for everyone else. \n\nThat being said, I’m tired of walking on eggshells around Chuck, it’s exhausting, and I no longer want to work with Chuck. I’m probably the asshole here. ",

      "description": "This just happened at lunch earlier and my one friend is telling me I went too far and making me second guess myself.  \n\nThere’s this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that’s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she’s very insulting, all the time.  It’s seriously like she doesn’t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says “I’m just being honest” a lot. The problem is that she can’t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it’s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  “Are you sure you’re not trans?  I’ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.”  And then, “It’s not attractive. Just being honest.”   So I said, “You’re not just being honest, you’re being a bitch.”  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, “No one thinks you’re funny.  The only thing that’s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.”  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went to far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ",

      "description": "Reference: I'm 22, she's 23. - Europe.\n\nWe started dating mid August, she told me.she has PCOS and could not get pregnant.\n\nThrough our entire dating time, she's always said she can't get pregnant, and if she ever got pregnant, she'd just get an abort - No biggie.\n\nWe found out 2 weeks ago that she was pregnant, and yesterday she was at the gynecologist, and was told she was 8 weeks in (Law in Denmark is that at 8-12 weeks it's surgical, before 8 weeks it's chemical abortion, aka take a pill)\n\nShe'd been quite slow through the entire process, first she forgot to buy a pregnancy test for ~3/4 days, them she slept over on the day she should visit her doctor, and could get a new appointment 3 days later. Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?",

Also realized that I did not want to lose her despite my initial anxieties. I’m deeply ashamed of the original post, but I felt that I should update since it’s been a few weeks.\n\nI apologized to my girlfriend for the way I acted. She forgave me, but things were different. She was not bringing it up anymore and I could tell she was still really hurt. I felt like shit, which I deserved. I decided to try to show her I’m ready to be supportive. I accompanied her to therapy a few times [not seeing the therapist myself, just waiting for her in the waiting room].  I started researching this topic trying to figure out how to handle it. I ask her about it and tell her I’m here if she wants to talk. I’ve been trying to do nice things for her around the apartment to show my support. I know it probably sounds ridiculous but I really wanted to make it up to her and had no idea how.\n\nA few days ago we had a very long conversation where we laid everything out in the open. I told her why I was so distant at first and how I’m afraid to hurt her, and she told me how badly I made her feel. She told me a few stories about what she went through too along with telling me what she needs from me. It was really emotional. I think we are in a better place now. She seems to feel more comfortable around me again, which I am glad about. The idea of me attending therapy as well came up but sadly we don’t have means for that right now. She still attends twice a week.\n\nAs far as our sex life goes, it’s pretty much nonexistent. We have had sex one time since on Valentine’s Day, and it honestly wasn’t enjoyable for either of us. It does suck but I’m okay with waiting until she’s ready. \n\nI’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little intimidated still because I am. I feel all the time like I need to be extra careful with her now which I know isn’t true. It’s gonna take some work for both of us. I appreciate all of the comments, good and bad, that made me wake up. She deserves a partner who has her back and I’m trying my best.\n\n",

      "description": "Note: I'm going to be telling this story from the perspective of my mom, because it makes most sense that way. I am also missing many details, but I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability. \n\nMy father told me that he had been married before he met my mother when I was 14. I was sitting in a diner with my brother, and got very serious, and said that he needed to tell us something. To sum it up, he explained that he'd met this woman when he was fairly young, and they got married basically right after they started dating. She was a ballerina, which is an important detail because he loved ballet so, so much. He told us that they had a son, who he hadn't seen since him and the woman got divorced. My brother and I got the impression that it was an extremely messy, painful divorce, and that they ended hating each other so much that they never wanted to see each other again.\n\nAt this point I think that it's significant to note that my father was a war veteran with PTSD, depression, and he was an alcoholic. He ran from the nazis as an extremely young boy, and he had lots of problems that he never fully recovered from.\n\nBack to the story, though. My father continued to tell us that she got remarried, and he hasn't seen his son since. He thought that the boy's stepfather had fully taken the roll as an actual father, and because the boy was a baby when they got divorced, the boy thought that his stepfather was his actual father. We assume that the boy was never told about us. As my brother and I grew up, we thought about this occasionally, and the fact that we had a half-brother whom we had never met, and who didn't even know we existed. \n\nLater in life, we found him. He lives in the state next door to us and is fairly successful. We didn't reach out to him. It could have ruined his life. He still lives there with his family. AITA? ",

Now, the situation we are in is an interesting one. He is quite self-centered and we have been having problems with that since around September. The main part of the problem is his personality. He is judgmental and gives himself leniency at the same time. (Yes, we are both teens.) It certainly doesn't help that himself and his parents are:\n\n* Somewhat anti-vaxxer (such as supporting delayed vaccinations)\n* At the (extremely) opposite side of the political spectrum than I am\n* Into certain online cultures that are less than optimal\n* Their mental state is almost akin to being brainwashed (like believing every single thing that is told to them by certain news outlets)\n* Is always angry at the world  \n* Most of his decisions are made out of fear\n* Extremely lenient towards his own group of people\n\nNormally, I would have gotten out of this relationship as fast as I could. Every day with him feels like sitting next to a bag of toxic waste. However, I do have to rely on him to drive me to school everyday. \n\nRecently, he has been pushing towards trying to leave 10 minutes earlier by showing up 10 minutes earlier and expecting me to be ready. To be completely fair to him, I certainly have been short tempered with him in this past week, and that certainly couldn't be chalked up to the time we leave at.  Anyhoo, yesterday his parents texted my parents telling my parents that I had been dismissive with his concerns.  \n\nNothing happened in the long run, but I would like judgement from a bunch of internet strangers I do not know.

      "description": "Obligatory sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile\n\nSo, to give context, I [21F] had a boyfriend [21] for around 3 years who was manipulative and mentally abusing before I broke it off ~9 months ago. He was nice to my parents, especially my mother, who had no idea how he was when we were alone. \n\nFlashforward to after the breakup (and many \"suicide\" attempts later, in my home while I'm at work), he's still keeping contact with my mom to brag about how great his life is and this and that.  My mom continues to bring him up after us being freshly out of our relationship, so I message him one day to not talk to my mom anymore and how it's extremely weird that he's still talking to her and to come get the rest of his things out of my home. He gets defensive and acts as though I'm being angry and questions me, since he had gotten a new job, \"Are you jealous of my success?\" So I block him.\n\nAnd so he decided... to act like a small child and screenshot my messages and send them to my mom, whining that I didn't want him messaging her anymore. After a long conversation with my mom, she agreed not to talk to him anymore nor to bring him up. Months fly by with him having no contact with my mother, and all is well. I have a new boyfriend who's incredible, understanding and kind. My relationship with my mom is better than it's ever been and I love her to bits (after pushing her away for years because of my ex).\n\nAnd now to today.\n\nObviously the first of January is a holiday for post, but I always check the mail out of habit since we get a lot of mail stolen, especially when no one else is home. Today, I found a letter with only my mom's name on the front, with no address or postage (which I believe is technically illegal). Now, she isn't home and I had a feeling about the handwriting. And I open it, and sure enough, it's my ex boyfriend sending a birthday card to my mom. It has some emotional throw-up inside and some cash. So, I took the card and some extra cardboard I had laying around and tossed it in our firepit and burned it. I made sure you couldn't tell I what I had burned, or even that I had burned something. Just ashes.\n\nI really didn't want to give the card to my mom, but I felt horrible for keeping a birthday card away from her, even if it was from my ex. Should I have done something else...? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I got into an argument last night over this and while I think I'm in the right, I want to be sure moving forward in case the issue comes up again. \n\nWe haven't been dating for very long, about a month and a half, so I knew that there would/will be some issues for us to work out in the long run. One of these issues that has repeteadly come up is that she says I'm not affectionate enough with her. Her two biggesy concerns are that I'm not affectionate enough with her in public, and that I don't pay enough attention to her at work (we're coworkers as well).\n\nLast night it came to ahead when she sent me a text last night asking me if I could be \"cuter\" when texting her. She said that she does so and would be nice if I could reciprocate. Usually when something like this comes up I try to compromise. I work early mornings all 7 days a week for a aide job, but still do my best to go out with her most nights when she asks, I do the cute activities she sets up for us to do at home in private, and I let her take pictures of us to post on social media even though I'd rather keep that private. \n\nI finally had enough with her bugging about it and said \"[Girlfriend], I'm just not a cutesy guy. It's not something I feel comfortable doing and it isn't me. I'd be faking it and I respect you too much to act fake.\"\n\nShe replied \"and i get that you're not cutesy, but i am. and idk i just feel like if it's something that makes me happy then you'd want to do it for me. little things  like that matter to me\"\n\nThat part bugged me a bit. I've given her a lot of ground and compromised on other little things like I stated above, and seeing that just made it seem like she was unappreciative. It also seemed like she was trying to make me feel guilty. So I replied:\n\n\"And I feel like that if I tell you something makes me uncomfortable you wouldn't try to guilt me into doing it. I understand it that this is important to you, but being able to move at my own pace and stay true to myself is also important to me.\"\n\nI feel like I don't have the time or energy to put on a charade and pretend to be something I'm not. Especially if in the future I stop acting like that (because that will never be the kind of person I am) and we discover that after being in a LTR she's fallen for the person I was pretending to be and not the actual me. It just sounds exhausting.\n\nAnyway, AITA?",

      "description": "Before anything, I do like animals, but I do not love them as some people do. I've had many family pets growing up, but would never be able to say I cried when any of them passed away. I just don't get emotionally attached to animals.\n\nWith that said here's how the dog came into our lives: Ex-wife adopted a dog shortly after our divorce. I was HIGHLY against it. She had previously adopted a cat that she couldn't take care of, so I told her this was an even worse idea. She then adopted an 85 pound American Bulldog and Pitbull mix.\n\nFast forward about six months, and she is saying she's getting rid of the dog. I didn't care, and I told her it didn't matter to me. She then asked if I'd take him, because she doesn't want him put down. He's a six year old, huge dog that barks all day. I still said no. I had no means to take care of him. So she called my dad, who I live with. He can't say no to anything related with animals, and so now the dog lives here. I told my dad that I wanted nothing to do with the dog, and it's 100% his responsibility. Of course that didn't happen. At least three times a week, my dad will leave for the entire day, and ask me to go home on my lunch break to take the dog outside, or if I'm not working, to take him on walks. The answer is always no. I am usually gone on my days off, and not revolving my days around a dog I did not want. Recently, it's escalated to my dad being home and asking me to take the dog out because he's too tired to do so, or to give the dog a bath in my shower because I have a better shower head. He's also a huge germophobe, so he will leave shit in the yard, and ask me to pick it up for him. This last one is what lead to me telling my dad that if he can't take care of the dog, he needs to suck it up and get rid of it. My dad said I'm just an asshole and should help take care of the dog because he's a good boy. This last week, I've done absolutely zero to help, and my dad is now pissed that he has to do this all himself, and says I'm an asshole. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: Dad took in my ex wife's dog, and I don't want to help him care for it. ",

I currently do not work due to being newly moved, not driving, and living in the middle of nowhere. \nAll day long I do chores to keep the house clean and nice. Except on their days off.\nThe issue is that on their days off they cook these crazy big meals or bake a ton of treats all day and just leave the house a mess. \nAs I say I'm fine with dishes but there us a bigger issue at hand here. We have sugar ants. We have put out ant traps but like clockwork the morning after their days off I wake up to dozens of ants scuttling across counter tops and over cutting boards and into bowls. \nI've already raised the issue of the need to clean up after their huge messes in regards to the ants twice. Today I wake up and it's the antpocolypse again.\nNow I get that I don't work. I get that I should therefore take care of the house. But I barely make any dishes or mess at all when I cook and these two are a solid hour of cleaning with their meals. And I'd cope with that if it weren't for the ants. \nSo today I told my husband that I'm not pest control and they need to deal with it or I won't clean anything that isn't my mess anymore. I hate bugs in the kitchen and letting it get that way is unacceptable.\nI'm worried that he's gonna come back saying it isn't fair because I don't work and they have long shifts but honestly I'm not gonna live with an ant issue that no one else wants to prevent. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I have to start this off by admitting I'm a pretty emotionally vacant person. Sometimes when friends tell me their problems I will say off the bat 'Look I love you, but I'm not sure I can be there emotional rock you need in this situation.' I'm like a drama no fly zone. \n\nMy mom is a tremendously emotional person with a flair for the dramatic. She's also been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. A few weeks ago we had to call the police to make a mental health arrest because she was screaming hysterically about her husband that died three years ago. While she was in the hospital she kept saying she wanted to kill herself. I talked to her for an hour about how important she is to me, our family. How impactful her life was to others. Still, she kept saying her life wasn't worth living. I notified my chain of command (in the army btw). I was ready to take emergency leave from work to support her in court. Then my sister calls me and tells me she was drunk the entire time. She 'snapped out of it' and didn't remember anything that happen. Ok fine, we wrote it off as a drunken rage. She promised not to do it again. \n\nShe did it again not even a week later. She calls me, asks me how my day is and says in this childish voice 'I don't want to live anymore'. We go through the same thing. An hour passes, I tell her how important she is to so many people, and how valuable life is. I go through all of this just for her to say 'thats alright, I still don't want to live anymore' and she hangs up. I was livid. I called her the next day to tell her that she needed to stop drinking and to see a psychiatrist. She promised to do both. As of my writing this post, she has not.\n\nToday, she starts questioning me about whether or not America is safe. Whether or not we would go to war with Russia. Literally the weirdest, most random possible shit. She says 'if you tell me right now America is safe I will be fine with that'. I tell her the truth. I don't know. It's not really my job to think about things like that. I'm not a big picture policy person, I literally fix computers and go home. She gets upset and says 'Well, that's fine, I guess I'll just go to sleep knowing we could be nuked tomorrow'. And she hangs up. Every conversation now is about some possible crisis where I end up dead or she ends up dead or the world ends up dead. Everything is a possible catastrophe. \n\nThis is becoming exasperating. Between the drinking, the suicidal ideations, and the 'holy shit the world is ending' call I get every day, I just can't do it anymore. I love my mom, I'm trying to support her the best I can. I call her as often as I can to reassure her and support her. But it is also coming to a point where it is becoming stressful for me. She is giving me this feeling of being helpless and I hate that. I find my job performance suffering at work because my mind wanders to what I would do if my mom decides to kill herself. I'm doing everything I can to support her from across the country but there are some days where I just want to tell her not to call me anymore unless she gets some help which makes me feel like an asshole. But I also know that this isn't about me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "The post was about the ban of single-use plastics, specifically straws. **SISTER** is against this because it’s “ableist” to disabled “folx” and we should instead focus on the “100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions”. Debate ensues between **OP**, **SISTER**, Disabled Folx X (**DFX**), &amp; others. We discussed ocean pollution, eco-friendly alternatives, boycotting the fishing industry, and how the #1 “company” responsible for over 14% of global emissions is actually China, specifically Chinese coal. Which of course is used to manufacturer cheap goods (cough, like single-use plastic drinking straws, cough) &amp; heating people’s homes.  \n\n\nIt was more of an emotional discussion rather than intelligent. **SISTER** &amp; **DFX** told everyone to “stay in your lane” and to stop “talking over them”.\n\n  \n**OP:** (the fishing industry contributes to poverty alleviation &amp; food security for millions of people, or similar).\n\n**SISTER:** You talked over my friend (referring to **DFX**)\n\n**OP:** I didn’t talk over him.\n\n**SISTER**: I know you don’t know them but you did misgender them, just to give you a heads up. They/them pronouns.\n\n**OP:** (goes back and edits post to “I didn’t talk over them”)\n\n  \n**DFX** has a very traditional male gender name &amp; has a masculine profile picture. I corrected myself once I was made aware of the issue and moved on with the conversation.\n\n  \nBecause **DFX** was complaining about alternatives, I reached out to a local company by me who makes compostable straws from plant materials. I contacted them to ensure that they could be used in hot beverages (yes) and if they could make a positionable straw (Yes). Awesome! So I posted the company’s response in the conversation.\n\n  \n**SISTER** immediately deletes the entire post, unfriends me, &amp; posts the following public status.\n\n&gt;  \nIf you are ableist, if you misgender someone and then purposefully do not fix your pronouns, if you are anti-LGBTQA+, if you are racist, if you are sexist...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My timeline is not for you. My posts are not for you. And my timeline will not be a platform for you to promote hatred, inequality, inaccessibility, and ignorance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Discussions of opposing viewpoints are always warranted. But continuously denying marginalized folx their voice and talking over them is not.\n\n  \nWTF. I sent **SISTER** a PM.\n\n  \n**OP:** Such outrage! I called someone named FUCKING (male name) a “him”. I didn’t fucking misgender on purpose AND I changed it to THEY when I was corrected.\n\n**SISTER:** When you knew you misgendered them you should have fixed it &amp; apologized because that is damaging. They have their pronouns visible on their profile to the public for those who need them. And they ducked out of the conversation due to the mental harm it was causing them before you misgendered them.\n\n**OP:** Like I fucking read everyone’s profile who I interact with on Facebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "*Context*\n\nThis is actually my friends story and I am transcribing it for him as he does not wish to make a Reddit account. He has given me his full permission to post this. As such, this will be from my friends perspective, not mine.\n\n*The Story*\n\nSo I recently broke things off with my girlfriend of 8 months as she has always talked down to me and made me feel like shit. The final straw was when I found out that she was a letting guys into our apartment and fucking other guys in my bed. We had a huge argument and she left to her parents and I started gathering her remaining stuff and packing it up so that she can pick it up as soon as possible. After 2 days, I had to go back to my shitty gas station job and joy upon joy, I have to work 3 doubles this week. For those of you that don’t know, a double at my job means that you come in at opening (6:30) and stay until graveyard starts (12:00). So my schedule was as follows: Single, Double, Double, Single, Double, Off, Off. The reason that this matters is, I had wanted to change my locks as I knew that my ex is very petty and may try to come in while I wasn’t home. Prior to learning my schedule, I had every intention of going Saturday, which is my first day off. However, I knew that I was going to be very tired and decided I would get it done on Sunday. That turned out to be a very bad choice as on Friday night(Or technically Saturday morning) after my last Double for the week, I got home at 12:30 and drifted off at around 1:00. I am a medium sleeper, I don’t wake up over everything, but I don’t sleep through anything either. So after my long shift, I felt something get into my bed. At first I was so tired, I had assumed it was my dog, then I remembered that my apartment doesn’t allow pets and I had to put him up for adoption when I moved in. So I jumped up and found that at 2 fucking 45 in the morning, my cheating, manipulative ex-girlfriend had used her key to get into my apartment and tried to sleep in my bed. \n\n*Dialogue Upcoming, This Is The Format*\n\nMe-Me\n\nEx-Girlfriend- XGF\n\nMe: “What the fuck?!? Why are you here?!”\n\nXGF: “I know you still love me! We WILL make this work! Now let’s go to sleep!”\n\nMe: “Get out and take your shit or I’m calling the cops!” \n\nXGF: Fine! Fuck you!\n\n*Dialogue Over*\n\n*Resume Story*\n\nSo I finally go back to sleep after smoking a few cigarettes and recounting the events of the last week. I awake around 9:30 am to multiple voicemails from my GF and her mom saying how I had no right to act so childish and how I should just take her back. I told both of them that if they don’t leave me alone, I will pursue breaking and entering charges. They have both been harassing me nonstop for the last week, as well as her friends telling me to get over myself and take her back.\n\nSo to conclude, Am I The Asshole for wanting to press charges on my manipulative, cheating Ex-Girlfriend for coming into my house while I slept after we broke up. Also, in case it matters, her name is not on the lease, just mine.",

You can equip misc quests?\" I though it was funny he didnt known that you could do that so I laughed. His friend was like \"mate dont be a cunt\" I told him I'm not a cunt. Keep in kind we are in highschool, we have been friends for three years and were guys. I told him it's just what guys do. He said no it's not.

      "description": "Recently two of my friends moved across country to where I live, under the pre tense that I would let them stay with me and my roommate for awhile until they got on their feet. However when they finally arrived my then current roommate (roommate a) sprang on all of us out of nowhere that he was leaving the lease and that it would be “ok” because the two friends would just cover his part of the lease. Ultimately the two have stayed we’ll call them roommate b and his girlfriend roommate c. When they arrived they were rather smelly, they came from a less privileged area so it didn’t bother me I assumed once they’d had time to clean their clothes etc it wouldn’t be an issue. However as time went on their hygiene wasn’t up to standard, roommate c the male often skips showers and has an unpleasant odor around him, which tends to spread to the couch and throw pillows. When they first arrived they were both rather active in maintaining the apartment and would help clean regularly, however now after about a month that has grinded to a halt, and they do almost no cleaning whatsoever now. I have asked on rare occasions for them to clean their dirty dishes out I.e. dirty cooking pot with dried beans etc, so that I can cook dinner for everyone (I’m also the cook) and though they begrudgingly do so, I end up having to go re wash them myself because they aren’t clean. I also ask for what I feel are simple things, small pet peeves of mine, like keeping the toilet seat and cover down, which still seems like an impossible task for them. They will also leave food all over the kitchen so that it dries up or gets stale, and I’m forced to watch over it as if they were children. My girlfriend also lives with us, and she by nature avoids and hates conflict, even assertive non aggressive conflict that I give. So she gets upset with me that I ask our roommates to help take care of things. The roommates also seem to use her as medium to vent their frustrations towards me, and tell her how it frustrates them when I ask them to do these things. \nMy roommates do however contribute groceries though mostly the food is for themselves some of it I use to make dinner for the house.\nMy roommates will also be having their furniture from their home delivered soon, I know that their old home was infested with cockroaches and the sort, so I told my girlfriend that when it gets here I would want to personally inspect everything before it comes into the apartment and at minimum spray the furniture with febreze to minimize the invasive smells that would permeate my living space. She got upset with this proposal and said it would incredibly rude. So reddit, would I be the asshole?",

      "description": "I recently got out of a long relationship and now I’m back on the market. I’m 28F and looking for something serious, yet none of my dates have gone beyond the first or second date and it’s frustrating.\n\nI don’t know what I’m doing wrong. My friends think I’m being too “needy” but I think I’m actually doing the complete opposite. I’m 100% honest with the men I meet about what I want, who I am, what I expect in a relationship or potential partner. I’ve been hurt before and I’ve been trapped in abusive situations with losers and I’m not looking to waste my time with boys, basically. \n\nSo now I verbalize exactly what I want and what I’m looking for. I shut down unwanted advances and I don’t hold anything back if/when the date does something I don’t like. I figure it’s better he knows now than if we end up dating for a while and fight over predictable stuff. \n\nAITA for being honest on early dates? I’m getting dejected because it seems impossible to find someone with the same viewpoint and desire to play no games. I’ve kept in contact with some nice men who I ended up befriending and they’re now all dating other women and I just don’t know why. I don’t know why they all end up turning me down for all sorts of reasons even though they’re looking for relationships too. AITA?",

      "description": "I got an email earlier today from an instructor saying that I hadn't turned in an assignment that was due during the final yesterday. I told her I did it and it was in my folder (a lie) but I just forgot to hand it in (another lie, but it's college, whatever). Then, I left for work. When I go on my first break, I notice she emailed me again and said she was deciding to be generous (she doesn't take late work, ever) and I should send her the assignment. I had to write a paragraph of reflection. I call my boyfriend who is home (we live together) and ask him to open my folder and send me a picture of the handout so I could do it on my lunch break. i do the assignment. I know that basically this assignment is the difference between a B and an A, that's how close my points were. I ask him to do the printing at home and snap a picture for me that I can email to my instructor before I go back to work to make it look like I did the assignment on time and genuinely pulled it out of my folder and took a picture.\n\n\"Later\", he tells me. It's already 7pm and I don't know when my instructor's generosity is going to run out. I tell him, why can't you just do it right now, it'll take 30 seconds. I tell him again, can you please just do it real quick so I get it out of the way, and he says \"Later\" again. At this point I hang up as I'm walking back into work from my break. I wait... no picture. I wait five minutes over my break for him to send it.\n\nI'm working and we had a call out, so there was no way for me to (1) notice that he finally sent it to me and (2) even if I had noticed, I would not have been able to step aside to email it to my instructor. Finally, I get out of work around 9:50 and I check my phone and see he sent the picture to me around 8:45 (again, an hour after I initially asked him to do it), and then I see an email from my instructor saying grades are finalized. That email was sent at 8:30. I check my points, and I was five points away from an A. The assignment had been five points.\n\nI come home crying bc my grade could've easily been an A and he comes to me asking what's wrong and I just push him away and blow up, saying that he didn't send it to me in time, and how hard was it to print out a paper and take a picture of it. I go to the bathroom so I can clean up and calm down. Basically, I was upset that he took an hour to send me a picture when it took maybe 30 seconds total.\n\nI go into our room where he's just on his computer. I curl in bed and ignore him because I'm still incredibly angry and I can't talk if I'm angry because I'll just start crying, and he says nothing. Eventually, he gets off the computer and goes to the living room, still without saying anything to me. I got home at 10:10 and it's been two hours and I still haven't spoken a word to him, and he hasn't attempted to even apologize or even just talk to me or comfort me since I got home.\n\nAm I the asshole for being angry at my boyfriend?",

      "description": "This fall has been a complete shitshow. Everybody in my friend group has been miserable at one point or another, and of course we are there for each other, but one friend, we'll call er \"Marcy\" is getting to be too much to handle. First off, insecurity in itself is not a big deal, my friend group is basically the bunch of insecure weirdos nobody else wanted, but Marcy shows her insecurity at any time she can. She writes about how things are terrible, she calls all of us constantly, sends us upwards of 10 messages an hour even if we don't respond, and is generally exhausting.\n\nMarcy has been like this for about two months, mostly she has been insecure about her relationship, and her smoking, which is understandable. However, she always brings it up to the detriment of others. For example, I'm dealing with pretty severe physical/mental health issues, but every time I've tried to get advice she starts talking about her problems. She had a complete meltdown at my birthday party because she was angry at her BF, which I took in stride, but I'm getting seriously annoyed.\n\nIt would be one thing if me and basically everybody else weren't knee-deep in our own shit and drama, and if she didn't bug us constantly. I've replied and tried to console her every day from october up til last week when I just put her on mute, and started responding when I felt like it. It's really stressing me out, and everybody else is sick of it to. Her boyfriend, a close friend of mine basically broke down because she is getting to be impossible to be around. \n\nAITA for being really sick of her? I love her as a friend, but I don't want to help anymore. I've tried, but I'm sick of it, and my health is already going to hell without this drama.\n\nTL;DR: Friend is severely anxious and makes it my problem. She made my birthday party a scene for her to have a meltdown, she spams me and the other friends constantly and even her BF is getting nowhere with her. AITA for not wanting to care anymore?",

She finally moved out last year about 10mins away. Because she lives so close, she comes over unannounced several times a week to pick up mail or give some treats to the kids. \n\nToday I got home early from a shitty day at work and was alone in the house. I then hear the gate open. \n\nI knew it was my MIL because she NEVER rings the door bell. She knocks on the door, “Open Up, it’s Mom”  \n\nI swear I duck low to the ground behind the couch and away from windows. You’d think I was hiding from a sniper. \n\nShe goes around and knocks on the back door and I don’t move or make a peep.  After 15 mins or so, she finally leaves\n\nMy husband comes home an hour later and I ask him if his mom told him she was coming by. He said no. He calls her later and I could overhear the convo. She asks if he was home because my car was in the driveway and he says no he was at work. She asks a few more questions but I can feel in her voice that she knew I was home.  My husband asks if I heard the doorbell and I said “no (it was true) I must have been in the bathroom.” ",

I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. \n\nI did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.\n\nAs far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids.

      "description": "A month ago my fiancée told me she didn't want to get married anymore.  We had been together for 3 years and engaged for 5 months with the wedding planned for August.  Of course I was devasted but we ended on good terms and later after talking through her thoughts on things I saw her point.  We always supported and loved each other but our interests and passions couldn't be more different.  We'll both be happier in the long run this way.\n\nNow for the AITA question, who should keep the dog?  She's moving back in with her parents who are retired, who will be home all day, so even while she's at work he'll have company.  They have a big backyard in the suburbs and have had dogs before and know how to care for them.  I live in the city in a ground floor condo with a small back and front patio, but have two large off leash dog parks nearby.  Both of us work, but I generally have longer hours than her, so I am gone from 7:30-5.\n\nShe's saying having a dog is too much work for one person and he could instead be home all day with people.  She's also saying I'm putting my own interests above what's best for him (hence the asshole). My plan is to walk him for an hour in the morning at the dog park, have a dog walk walker come in at lunch and then take him to the dog park after work again.  I'm fully willing to make this commitment for his whole life. I also love the outdoors and camping, and would be taking him with me all the time on weekends.  He loves the woods and camping, but that's something she has no interest in, so he wouldnt have any experiences like that anymore.\n\nWe're sharing custody right now until we figure it out but that's not a solution we want long term.  AITA for wanting to keep the dog even though he could be living in a house with a big backyard? ",

      "description": "My group of friends have a once a month game night.  It’s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It’s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she’s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe’s nice enough I guess, but she’s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she’s really not that interesting so it doesn’t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I’ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that’s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I’m gay.  I’m not the “gay bff” type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She’s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have “girl talk” with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I’ve tried to be tactful with her since she’s my buddy’s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don’t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don’t know how to tell him.  I’m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  “The group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We’d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. “.  ",

      "description": "Some back story first. I was a 20 yo male virgin when I decided to get over my loneliness and socialise a bit. So I installed Tinder and a couple of days later was texting a girl. We were both unable to meet for a week so we just texted a lot and talked over call. I think she was really into me so I went along with things mostly because I'd never dated anyone and wanted to see how things go. Being rather immature I caught a few feelings for her before we even met and told her so.\nWe were going to do a movie date, but when we met, she didn't look much like her pictures and apart from that was much more overweight than she led me on to believe. Whatever little feelings I had for her and any sort of attraction disappeared then and there. I was kinda trapped with her in the theatre but I didn't want to spend 150 minutes sitting awkwardly with her. However she just leant in and kissed me when the movie started so I sucked it up and told her I didn't find her attractive but that she was a really nice person. She obviously felt pretty bad and I felt bad for being honest and it was dark and we somehow ended making out wildly for the whole movie. I know I shouldn't have done that but I'd never kissed anyone before and we were both really riled up from teasing each other all week. When we got out though, she must have thought everything was alright and was holdi g my hand though I didn't want to. I thought it would be really cruel to not hold hands with someone I'd just been making out with so I walked around with her for a couple of hours and left. When I got back I called her and explained that I shouldn't have kissed her and that I still didn't find her attractive but I did have a good tins with her today but we probably shouldn't do it again. I know, I'm stupid. She said it was okay and that she had a good time too.\nThst should have been the end of it. But I hadn't ever had the kind of emotional affection that I experienced over that last week and adding that with the physical affection I got that day, I couldn't forget it easily. My friends told me I'd gotten catfished and to move on, but I kept texting her and soon we mutually agreed to friends with benefits. I kept asking her to make sure she didn't have feelings but on one hand I had some sort of feelings for her and I was sure that she has some sort of feelings for me. Anyway we hooked up a few times but our relationship is almost like a normal one over text but our 'dates' are just sex. I don't think I'll ever be attracted to her enough to want to date her properly and she said what we have now is good. Am I an ass hole for doing any of this? I'm so confused. ",

      "description": "I visited an online friend a few months back when I started to have feelings for him. The trip just made those feelings stronger, so it was easy to say 'i love you' back and seemingly reciprocate the until-then unrequited feelings he had for me.\n\nBut as time went on after I went back home, distance took its toll and I started to question these feelings. I realized that there's a difference between loving how someone makes you feel and loving them for who they are, and that I fell for the former. I was left trying to evaluate him as a person over long distance. I still cared, but the feelings started coming in increasingly less frequent waves. Sometimes I did something like tell him I loved him back without really meaning it, which I seriously regret now. My 'rationale' was to keep it going until he came back in January, when we'd physically be in the same space again so I could make a better evaluation. Those inconsistent feelings were confusing; I couldn't tell if my doubts were valid or not.\n\nSo last week, he was talking about moving in with me again away from his abusive family when he asked if I even wanted him to still visit. I used to love the idea of him living with me, but at that point I wasn't really willing to do it (What the hell was i thinking, just letting 'I love you' after a few weeks and 'moving in together' after a month or so slide like I did?). So the truth came out about how the feelings have been slowly going away, and it hurt him. He said he was hurt over how I essentially lied, and now he's not talking to me\n\nI could easily come up with reasons of how it's my fault, but I want to keep this neutral. Am I right in feeling this guilty over it?",

      "description": "okay, so this just happened an hour or two ago so bear with me. i’m on my phone and have been drinking a little bit and need to know if what i did was wrong and or offensive and or however redditors may deem my actions.\n\nNow, my roommate has been sick for... about a month or so. she has asthma and contracted bronchitis sometime in the middle of December. She went on a cruise bc her bf’s parents paid for her since cruises are relatively cheap, whatever. she gets back 8-9 days later, sick as a fucking dog. Exhausted her asthma and is taking a shit ton of medication. sometimes her coughing wakes me up in the night/morning. \n\nOur relationship has been pretty good, we started living together July 2018 and haven’t gotten into a fight or anything aggressive like that. We joke around and roast each other often, if not daily. we’ve gotten close in the short time we’ve lived together and i do consider her a close friend. From what i understand there’s a general understanding of each others humor and up until now she hasn’t said anything about the way i joke around with her/there hasn’t been a problem with my humor. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really get offended by anything and have a thick skin for offensive jokes. i myself can be an offensive joker. \n\nSo she gets home i’m talking to her in her room and she starts coughing, you know, because of the exhausted asthma and bronchitis. i notice she’s not covering her mouth. so i go;\n\n“Damn girl cover your mouth ya nasty”. \n\nshe responds with\n“it’s my room” \nand doesn’t say much after that from what i remember \n\nnow i don’t think much of it if anything bc i had been drinking a little tonight so nothing is really phasing me at that moment. \n\nHer boyfriend comes over, she’s heating up some soup and then takes a napkin and coughs up a goober, folds it AND PUTS IT ON THE FUCKING KITCHEN TABLE. I was kinda -very- disgusted and was astounded that she had done that. i’m kinda a germaphobe when it comes to shit like that. So i say to her loudly , due to sheer shock\n\n“girl, that’s fucking nasty get that off the kitchen table” \n\nshe says \n“it’s in a napkin and i folded it”\n\nme:\n“dude, you have ejected something out of your body and is now on the kitchen table, that’s gross”\n\nshe looks at me and silently throws the tissue away, grabs her soup and leaves the kitchen, her and her bf walk into the living room, he kinda gave me a look, something like an eeeeeeh sort of deal. i can understand a social que when it’s staring me in the face so i follow her into the living room. \n\ni asked her if she was mad and she said yes, because i had been coming at her the whole night and or a lot recently, by making comments about her being sick and used her coughing in her room as the example. she started sniffling and her eyes were watery. \n\nwhen she said that i kinda got mad because if what i was saying was bothering her all she had to do was tell me. which is what i told her before because i do acknowledge that i can be offensive/intense at times and if anything i said bothered her then i would just stop joking about that thing. it’s just simple as that. but the issue is she doesn’t like confrontation and that was something we talked about last night. \n\nI mean don’t get me wrong, i have horrible communication skills and it’s hard for me not to come across as aggressive/ angry when i’m trying express the issue i have with someone (childhood trauma yada yada). but i’ll let someone know if what they’re doing it’s hurting/bothering me in some way. \n\nSo after she said what she had to say, i went on the defensive side and said\n\n“i’m sorry my half hearted joke affected you that much, i didn’t think it would. i won’t joke about it again if you feel so strongly about it”. \n\nwhich was kinda passive aggressive, but in my defense i look at it as her being unable to communicate to me that she has an issue with something and then blows up on me bc she couldn’t tell me she had a problem with it in the first place. \n\nI don’t want to be blown up on like that, it makes me feel like a bad person for not knowing how someone felt about something but i only know it’s a problem if you bring it up to me... \n\nshe hasn’t said anything to me and i don’t think she going to but her bf in passing made light conversation with me. and i passive aggressively changed my hulu password while they were using it because i was upset/got no closure/annoyed. but i pay for it so...\n\n\nsorry for the grammar misspells and whatever the fuck, it’s late and i’m tired. \n",

Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?",

Tonight, I told her I don’t want to sleep over her place as I want to just hang out by myself at my apartment  for the night. I enjoy my alone time to play video games, watch movies, etc. but she doesn’t see that as a valid reason to not want to sleep with her. Her reasoning is that we won’t be together the next couple days because my roommates (who are currently out of town) will be back tomorrow, and I’m going to want to hang out with them since I haven’t seen them in a while.

      "description": "(Sorry for any grammar mistakes.)\n\nSo there’s this girl, let’s call her Sofia (obviously not her actual name), she’s my ‘friend’ and she’s incredibly toxic, or so I think.\n\nShe has slagged me off behind my back on many occasions, turned half my year against me and when I asked her to stop she denied doing it (I have many witnesses and a recording). Whenever I call her out for it, I get called mean and ‘discriminating against her mental illness’. \n\nThe thing is, I have all but one of the mental illnesses that she has claimed to have, but whenever I act out (even slightly) I’m yelled at. \n\nI did an experiment, I ignored someone the whole day (like she does daily), the backlash I got stopped me from going to school for the next week. She only got reprimanded.\n\nShe then starts a HUGEEE argument about essentially nothing and rips my friends apart. So I did what I had to do, I sent a long paragraph to her (explaining why I didn’t want to be friends). Here is it below:\n\n“Listen, I’m not trying to start an argument I just need to get this off my chest. I know you slagged me off behind my back. The things you said about me are true about you. You ‘smoke’ and ‘drink ‘alcohol’’ and then brag about it. I have stopped myself from snapping at you many times. I’m fed up of toxic people and I’m kinda hope that you won’t really be hanging round us anymore. You spread lies to [friend] and because of that I am losing a great person to hang around with at break and lunch. Ik you’ll be mad at this but I’m trying to get rid of this overwhelming feeling of you getting what you wanted. You either start arguments or continue it and then get annoyed when people argue back, what did you think would happen. Yes I will reblock you after this but you should know that you really need to change your attitude. You forget that things have consequences and complain when something you did bounces back at and then blame it on me. You need to sort your life out. Now, goodbye.”\n\nMy friends (again) said that I was being rude and discriminating. I need to know, AITA?",

      "description": "So, some context for this, I am usually a very happy and positive person. However, every now and then I get struck by terrible pangs of sadness and feeling shit about myself. I've always thought this was normal for women because of hormones.\n\nThoughts of how I don't deserve my bf, how I hate the way I look and how I'm a amounting to nothing in my life. \n\nUsually they creep up before a period so I can almost assume they are positively correlated. However they do go away after my period and I forget about them.\n\nSo, today the morning went like this; I wake up first and in the shower I have all these negative feelings come. I don't know how to deal with them so I just stay silent hoping I will fade into the wallpaper whilst doing my makeup later and he won't notice but because I am usually so happy the change is noticible by my bf immediately. \n\nStraight away he asks what's up and I just replied saying I didn't want to go to work with a smile as I usually say that this in a more lighter note. From then he knows something is wrong and goes silent on me. Our drive to work is silent until he asks why I'm feeling sad. I say I'm sorry but it's the negative feelings again and that I know they're irrational but I can't help them and they'll go soon. He just stayed silent. I get scared to tell him because he doesn't react well to me being sad. I asked if it affects him when these feelings come and he said yes it makes him feel bad. \n\nI just stayed silent. I feel awful for something that I feel I can't control making him feel bad and then there is this tension between us. Sometimes he makes me feel like I should be happy all the time and I should never feel sad at all but to me that isn't normal? I'm so confused. AITA, should I get help or look more into these negative feelings?\n\nSorry this is the first I've spoke of this and now it's  falling into an advice seeking/asshole post but still I wanna know if I'm the asshole?",

The doors open and out of nowhere comes this man, climbing past me - mind you, there was hardly any space - and running straight into / against the crowd that were leaving the train. He fights his way in and then slams himself on the next available seat. At this point it’s worth mentioning that we were not competing for that seat as i was going to stand anyways and there was plenty of space after everyone had left. But i made a snide remark about his behavior upon which he pulls the ‘i’m disabled’ card. Apparently, his left hand got shredded 7 months ago, to which i replied that i was sorry about that but that it was a poor excuse. Of course other passengers listened in, but it wasn’t until the next stop that a women - just before she left - told me i’m an asshole over the shoulder. Am i the asshole?",

She finished her leftovers at the dinner table and left behind her trash all over the table while she went to lay down on her bed and use her phone. I cleaned up the table because she really did make a huge mess. I throw out all the garbage (which means that I took it outside to the dumpster). \n\nAbout an hour later I see her looking in the trash and I ask her what she's looking for. She says that she is looking for her phone charger and all I say is that I don't know where it is. She then asks me if I threw out everything that was on the table (which should have been obvious since the table was cleared of her mess) to which I respond with a simple yes. She then begins to yell at me and berate me because she left her charger in her McDonalds bag. I apologize, but I also tell her that she shouldn't have left something as important as a phone charger in her trash. She keeps screaming at me and continues to berate me. She also demands me to go outside, reach into the dumpster and grab the trash bag, bring it upstairs so she can look for the charger, all during a snowstorm that had just started. I tell her that she must be crazy if she thinks that i'm going out there in the cold and rummage through the dumpster and that she should go look for it herself if she wants it so badly. She gets more mad and punches me as she goes to her room. \n\nThe next morning she goes outside to look for it, but the garbage truck had already come and collected the trash. She wakes me up by screaming, punching me, and demanding me to buy her a nee charger. I push her off of me and tell her to buy it herself and to not be so careless with her stuff.\n\nMy Dad is telling me that I should buy her the charger since it was ny fault, but my mom is telling me the opposite.\n\nAm I truly the asshole in this situation?\n\n",

      "description": "My [36f] and my partner [37m] have been together for over three years now, engaged since January 2018 and are getting married next summer. We are planning a super simple, small wedding with one or two people on each side of our wedding party. My partner’s relationship with his family is one of estrangement as of about nine months ago. Prior to that, he did have a relationship with his older brother [40m] as long as my fiancé covered the cost of any alcohol/food/activities when him and his brother go out and leave an open invitation for his brother to live with him (all expenses paid) at any time (even when his brother had his own housing). His brother (and his father) both have problems with alcoholism and are both very awful to women, which has led to some really bad (and sometimes scary) situations for me, and I no longer have any contact with them, nor do I plan to in the future. When my partner moved in with me, we agreed that his brother was not welcome to live with us, and eventually my partner agreed to stop paying his brother’s way in social situations. Since we’ve set boundaries with the family, it’s led to this estrangement (it stemmed from an incident where his dad was particularly awful to me and my partner stood up for me, and has been perpetuated because my partner does not want to take them out to get drunk to show he “forgives” them or pay his brother’s way anymore) not to mention that both his dad and brother have been sending him an incessant barrage of swear-word, insult-ridden drunken texts and emails. All this said, my partner really still wants to rekindle some sort of relationship with his brother (I totally get that, family is family), but for some reason wants his brother to also stand at our wedding. As someone who is paying for 50% of this wedding I really don’t want someone who has always been disrespectful to me and openly dislikes me standing and saying a speech that will likely be very disrespectful and embarrassing to me, not to mention has only been disrespectful to my partner and won’t help or participate in anything a groomsman should to be standing at our wedding... I think my partner is scared he may lose the opportunity to make up with his brother if he doesn’t include him in the bridal party, but REALLY.... AITA for not wanting this drunken buffoon standing at our wedding?? ",

      "description": "so I moved to a new city back in December to start a new job, and on my first day of training I met a girl in the same training class we’ll call D.  D was immediately open about the vast majority of her personal life the day I met her, and she told me about how she lost one of her kids in an accident, and about how she had cheated on her boyfriend at one point and now he’s super insecure. \n\nAnyway, aside from all her baggage, D seemed like a fun person to hang around and we chatted on breaks and got to be friends. Then she confided in me that her boyfriend (father of her kids) gets physical with her. I didn’t really think it was any of my business, but I assured her that if she ever wanted to leave the guy that i would help her. Gradually she reveals some crazy shit to me, like how he should have gone to prison for 5 years and that he was kidnapped as a kid, and she tells me that she’s manipulated her friends into “sabotaging” him and their relationship, whatever that means. \n\nFlash forward to week 2. Yes, week 2. She told me all of this within the first week. Red flag. \n\nD asks me if i wanted to talk to her about a dream she had.  Now, I’ve never put any stock in dreams meaning anything because I personally very rarely dream and the ones i have had have been absurdly and unintelligibly weird, so I told her so, but she told me anyway: she had a dream about her and i (we’re both bisexual women but i have absolutely ZERO attraction to her) making out in tshirts on her bed. I played it off and said “yeah i’ve had weird dreams too” but have always thought it was really creepy and disconcerting. She also mentioned to me at one point that she would probably try to have sex with me if she gets drunk, which was also really fuckin weird. \n\nFlash forward again to month 2. D has since met a girl near her desk and fallen in love with her, CONSTANTLY telling everyone except this girl that she’s “the light of D’s world” and “the most beautiful person D’s ever met” (they met at the end of December). One night at 2am, I suddenly get a text from D’s number from her abusive boyfriend, asking me if she’s been looking at any other guys or girls. I don’t answer, but i tell her he asked me first thing the next morning; she was close to leaving him at the time and this was supposedly the final straw, and i told her i supported her leaving this chump. \n\nShe tells him she’s leaving him and he immediately does the asshole thing and tries to get her flowers. so he texts me again at 2am asking how to get them to the building, and i straight up told him to STOP contacting me, that i want nothing to do with him or their relationship, and he accuses me of having bf problems, so i just say something to the effect of “i’m too gay for bf problems and i don’t want to be a part of this”.  he tells me he won’t bother me again. \n\nthe next week, D’s boyfriend left and took their kids to his mom’s in Texas and took their car to get there, so i had to take D home from work. As i was getting directions home, he calls her and, when he finds out i’m driving her home, tells her to put him on speaker. He gets my attention by saying “Hey, Jelllybears.”\n\nI just say “What?”\n\n“Why did you tell me you were gay? Why are you fucking my wife?”\n\nnot even “are you”. “WHY are you”. \n\nI didn’t know what to do, so i laughed. I laughed really hard. It probably wasn’t the smartest reaction, but I didn’t expect this at all. It got less funny when he started cussing me out and calling me names, but i still point blank told him that he’s insecure and delusional. D does nothing. She says nothing, even while he’s cussing me out. I don’t even know what this guy looks like. we’ve never met. ever. and D is just sitting there, not even doing anything. I drop D off, and she thanks me for the ride tells me that he told her to text me and call me a piece of shit, and to expect that. So i was like “sure”. I stew over the fact that she didn’t do anything, but gave her the benefit of the doubt bc she’s probably legitimately afraid of this guy even if he’s a few states away. \n\nThen, a coworker tells me that she’s told people around the office that i was trying to start a fight between her and her boyfriend. i was furious when i heard that. It’s one thing to not apologize for not doing anything to even try and stop him from yelling and accusing me of shit i didn’t do, but now she’s spreading lies around the workplace about something that is completely contrary to my very nature. \n\nWe haven’t spoken since, and he’s still in texas, but even when I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to just curb the drama, she sneers at me and refuses to even talk to me. \n\nI can’t help but wonder if i’m completely in the wrong here?? perhaps i didn’t have the best reaction but all i want is to go to work and make money and go home. i don’t need the high school rumor mill again. \n\ntldr: coworker’s bf accuses me of fucking her, and i laugh, and now she’s spreading rumors that i was starting a fight. aita?",

      "description": "So this just happened to me. I was driving down a two lane road, when the car in front of me suddenly pulls off the road. I said wtf, there's no emergency vehicles coming behind us or in front.  It dawns on me this nincompoop is pulling over for the hearse and tiny funeral procession on the other side of the road.  I realize I can squeeze past him, so I do. He proceeds to lay on his horn for about 10 seconds as I drive away.\n\nI saw ANOTHER longer procession shortly after posting this and again on a two lane road.  No one was pulled over and they were going through red lights like I had always been accustomed to.\n\nThis had me thinking about funeral procession etiquette. I have never broken a procession line nor followed one. I always yield to one if I'm at a crossroad. I've never heard of people pulling to the side of the road though. I live in MI and I'm in my mid 30s and I've never heard of this. However, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Today my husband and I received a... blunt... email from our downstairs neighbor. I'm including it here with my own commentary in parenthesis. For context, we live in a really old building with a lack of insulation, meaning we can hear a lot of creaks, doors and steps from all throughout the building and a bunch of our neighbors. Not unexpected from an old building and something we just deal with since we knew upon signing the lease the shit that comes with old buildings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's her email-\n\n\"I am at a loss as to how to get you to understand the amount of noise that I have to endure daily from your apartment.  I've sent a couple emails but nothing has changed; in fact, I find it is worse. (She has sent us one email in the past and we have tried to be accommodating- walking as quietly as possible, not moving furniture or dragging anything across the floor, not wearing shoes in the house, etc).\n\nThe noise coming from your apartment wakes me up daily long before it is time for me to awake for work.  Thursday morning it was 4:45AM.  If you are scheduled to work early or whatever,  please do not disturb me before it is time for me to start my day. (Unfortunately, I have to wake up at 4:30am for work. I try to be as quiet as possible to not wake up my husband but I don't really have a choice as to when my job needs to me to arrive.)\n\nI would also like to ask you to stop slamming your doors. (We actually never close any interior doors- save for the bathroom- let alone slam them).\n\nAlso the amount of knocking and moving around heavy objects as well as dropping them (it seems) is very disturbing.  The noise constantly frightens my dog and starts him barking as it is noise out of the ordinary. I had minor surgery a couple weeks ago and found it difficult to rest well and  recover because of the amount of noise from your apartment.   I also have overnight guests that are disturbed by the noise from your apartment. (We don't move heavy objects around and, unless we're especially clumsy people, don't drop things a disturbing amount. Also, i'm not exactly sure how we can anticipate accidentally dropping something in order to rectify this particular problem. Her dog whines a lot- we can hear him from her apartment. We've never complained because it's just par for the course living in an old building).\n\nPlease be respectful enough to understand I, too would like to enjoy my apartment.  I have a day off every other week and it would be very nice if I could enjoy being home and getting my business done without distractions of noise from your apartment, as I have been able to do in the past.  The  apartments are not well insulated and there is nothing to buffer noise, and I hear everything that happens in your apartment and I don't need to. (We can hear her too. She has loud conversations every night and again, we've never complained because we know it's an old building- there's not much that can be done).  \nI appreciate your understanding that this email is to address/complain of the noise that I cannot ignore and affects my comfort in my apartment.\"\n\nI'm not really sure how to to be a good neighbor to her so I plan doing absolutely nothing else to make things better (although, what I really want to do is stomp around all day every day). We've already tried to be respectful of her but at this point she is asking for the impossible. Does that make us asshole neighbors?",

I am going to be celebrating this weekend with my dad since I’m with him. He is VERY obsessed with where I am in the college decision process, to the point where it feels like it’s all we talk about. So he floated the idea that he would take me to a school out of state that I had been interested in for my birthday as a gift. The school he wanted to take me to is SUPER competitive and I really don’t think I have a chance at getting in, so I feel like visiting it would just force me to look at an unattainable goal. I’m a very good student and I feel like I do have a shot at some good schools, but I also just don’t really enjoy visiting schools or anything. Schools I’ve been to excite me but I just don’t feel like I would want to go to one as a birthday gift.",

My first reaction was \"wtf, why has noone told me before?\".\n\nFrom what I understood, my grandma was chatting with my cousin trough skype and my cousin told her that one of the professors was working in a field of neurosurgery and she mentioned my case to him and he was interested in it from the medical perspective. So my grandma thought it would be a good idea to give my cousin the CDs of my scans so that she could talk about it with the prof, so she was going to send my mom to ged a copy of the CDs in the centre.\n\nNow I don't have a problem with helping my cousin in her studies but I kinda lashed out about all of this happening without my knowledge. My granma's argument was that she wasn't planning to share it with some random people, just with my family and a medical professional and that it was only meant as a learning material for my cousin. I told her that I don't have a problem with my cousin seeing it but I have a problem with her sharing my medical info without asking me first and I felt like my privacy was being breached. She then started acting hurt and went into the \"Ok, you got what you wanted, I won't send it to her\" mode. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not keeping my temper down and lashing out on her?\n",

There's its ups and downs but generally we're still stupidly in love and we plan to stay together all through our respective college years and eventually live together. \n\nHowever, she has told me multiple times that friendships are more important than relationships and she prioritizes her best friend a lot to the point where I'm not first in her life, her reasoning being that friendships last longer than relationships and it's best to give your friends more. \n\nI disagree quite a bit with this since all of my friends don't make me a priority or make me feel wanted like she does, and all of my close friends have found people they like more. I've been giving her all of my attention and even though we argue sometimes (mostly my fault since I have a tendency to be miserable or careless) I've changed myself so much for her sake and I've always been there when she's needed someone. I can honestly say she's by far my highest priority and I do everything for her that she needs even though she's very independent. \n\nRight now, her best friend is talking to one of our mutual friends and my girlfriend is upset that her best friend isn't giving her a ton of attention and I got in a kind of bad mood after we talked about it and assured that she's being reasonable and there's no issues with their relationship. I told her it upsets me that she puts her friends above me when I believe I've proven that I'm always there for her and her worries are unfounded. She told me she still disagrees and she thinks giving me more would push her friend away, who has been getting upset herself when my girlfriend gives me more attention. \n\nI thought that the situation would show that I'm worth more than being second best but she's even more upset and has gone out with her friend right now so I can't talk to her for a little while. \n\nAITA for wishing she'd put me first?",

      "description": "So, my parents have split up with my mum keeping us (sister and I) most of the time and us seeing our dad every other weekend (assuming that its possible). Only recently when it has been made clear on both ends that we have a choice to go to our dad's my mum has also started saying things like \"well I suppose I'll have to take you to your dad's\" in a rather derogatory tone, making comparisons between her and him which boil down to her asking \"who's better/who do you like more?\", and just other kinda rude but not offensive in any way things. Of course this makes me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable and I try my best to avoid answering the question and/or talking to her for the rest of the day when it's brought up because I just think that the way that she puts her in a decent situation, my dad in a pretty bad one, and me in an awful one is ludicrously scummy. \n\nTo provide some context: I don't know the exact nature of why they split up, my dad has recently had a baby with another woman (I personally am ok with it), and the frequent of us seeing our dad seems to be dropping",

      "description": "So I go on a school in Germany. It has the classes 5 to 12. Every year the students in the 12th grade have a \"chaos day\" where they can go to other classes and do every kind of stuff for an hour (like \"try to draw a parabola but the pen has to be in your mouth\"). Then the school usually does some games on the schoolyard. Everytime they also had lipsticks and wanted to paint on other students (penises, hearts, that kind of stuff)\n\nA friend and I made a bet to be the last to get painted. So when the school started and some 12th graders came to the room I was in. They tried to paint on me, but I ran around the room, probably knocked some tables and chairs away. They then went to other rooms. Later some girls came to us and saw that I didn't have lipstick on my face. I then ran out of the room because it was too risky to be inside.\n\nI went in the room again some minutes later. We continued the class normally and then the hour was over. I went to my **friends** but they didn't seem happy. They said \"you went too far\" or \" you ruined it for them\". Later some of them had lipsticks themselves and chased me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 12th graders were allowed to paint on other students, I ran away, my classmates hate me now",

I sent them to the trash, then emptied the trash.\n  \nI come in today and my old colleagues are livid at me, apparently they have been using my documents and folder long after I left the team, including having added documents.

However, recently I have felt like she isn’t being affectionate enough. She has been very busy, but over the past two months, the most I have gotten other than the “I love you”s is a “you’re cute.” Over the summer she told me that she would do her best but she might be more busy than usual, but she still manages to spend 5+ hours with friends every day. She keeps telling me that she hasn’t been horny because she hasn’t regularly been having sex because we aren’t together, and that it stresses her out when I tell her I need more, but she doesn’t seem to realize that I am also stressed out because I need more. I feel like I’m living in a sexless marriage already and she is completely unwilling to try anything (she is completely unwilling to try phone sex which is fair but she also hasn’t sent nudes or even a half-hearted sext). It makes me feel like a creep for wanting something from my girlfriend and it feels unfair to me. So am I the asshole for asking her several times over the past two months to try to do more? ",

      "description": "I was friends with a girl(M) and sat next to her in a forensics class. We weren’t the closest of friends, but we got along well enough, and had some good in-jokes. One day, the teacher, (T) assigned us a group project on the history of Forensics, so naturally we agreed to team up. We planned this shit out, me agreeing to bring the framework for the project(a cheap plastic skeleton) and M agreeing to bring the 40 facts we needed, and we’d piece it together the next class period. So, the next period rolls around, and I have the skeleton in my backpack, and I’m ready to get started. M doesn’t show up. I start texting her, most of my texts somewhere along the lines of “WTF, where are you” and “we have a project due on wednesday”. \n\nI don’t get any work done that day, and i’m still waiting for her to reply to me. Throughout all of this, I’m texting her like mad, even trying to call her phone once or twice. The next day, around twelve, I saw that she was on Discord for about ten minutes, and didn’t say anything. I get madder. \n\nThroughout all of this, when I was frustrated, I would send her a message along the lines of “I’m going to punt you into the sun.” This is important. \n\nSo at about 7, I give up on her, and ask my mom for help to assemble the skeleton. I scrap together the facts in about twenty minutes, and then me and my mom(bless her little heart) begin taping. Then M finally starts talking to me again. In a group chat. And she’s furious. \n\nShe had been sick these past two days, and was mad at me for bullying her. I was honestly confused about this, until she posted screenshots of my first messages. \n\nMe: “M I’m going to punt you into the sun. \nWhere the fuck are you. \nWe have a project.”\n\nYou get the jist of what I sent. We start fighting about this in the group chat, but this is a chat filled with her friends. We probably should have taken the argument to DMs, but she didn’t start, and I am bad when it comes to asking for what I want with friends if it only really affects me. \n\nOne of her friends was quick to shut down the argument. The next day, I present the skeleton alone, and get a decent grade. Over the next few weeks, I attempt to act normally whenever I bump into her around school. This means waving and saying hello during lunches, or when we bump into each other. She glares at me for this, and I feel worse and worse about this. She moves seats away from me in class, but this gives me more room to spread my shit, so I’m not complaining. After a few weeks, I still don’t want to lose her as a friend, so I write her a nice letter, asking for an apology for not contacting me about her being sick, and if she had told me sooner she was sick, I would have done all the work for both of us. This, *infuriated* her, as she was still angry about this, and we argue some more. I finally have had enough, leave the group chat, tell her not to talk shit about me(as we still have mutual friends.) and block her. We haven’t spoken since. \n\nSo Reddit, Am I the Asshole for being angry at M?",

      "description": "Hi! I’m an average college student cooking at a small town bar while going to college. I’ve worked here for about 2 years now and I work almost every weekend because that’s when they need the help. Ive been fine with that, requesting time off here and there because I like to go visit family and friends every once in awhile. \n\nSo the problem is that I requested off my 21st birthday this year. I requested it off in February, while my birthday is on March 29th, which is a Friday. Friday’s we tend to be a lot busier than any day of the week. I came into work today to have my boss tell me that I have to work 2-10 on my birthday because he has ‘no one else’. Just for some more context, we have gone through cooks like crazy. I believe it’s mainly due to my bosses not wanting to pay people more. The only reason I’ve stayed is because it works better for my classes this semester and the full time cook that used to work here quit in November after 10 years, due to wanting a raise and my bosses would not give to him. We have had some good cooks leave because of this reason. \n\nNow I’m pretty frustrated because I hardly take weekends off of work. I maybe request a weekend every two to three months to visit my parents, who live 2 hours away from my college. Otherwise I only have Monday’s and Tuesday’s off of working. I work 10 hour shifts on the weekend.\n\nCurrently, my boss also has two cooks here who work under the table for cash, when he needs them on the weekend. They are not obligated to be here so if they tell him they don’t want to work, I usually get stuck working shifts alone on the weekends. We also have a new cook, but he has no experience prior so it’ll be awhile until he’s all trained in. So my boss relies on me heavily to pick up the slack here. I’m pretty frustrated because for a bar, we have very understaffed in the kitchen and the weekend hours fall on me. I somehow feel ‘punished’ when I’m unable to get days I request off because he doesn’t hire more people on the actual pay roll. \n\nI want to send my boss a text tomorrow and tell him that I either get this Friday off or Thursday is my last day working here. And that I would like to discuss it in person as well. Would I be the asshole to pretty much threaten quitting if I don’t receive my birthday off? ",

One friend I knew for years before working there - we’ll call her Lana - and the other friend I made through work - we’ll call him Tom. All of us hang out at Lanas house every week for at least one or two nights, that’s how I got close to my now boyfriend who we’ll call Harvey. Harvey and Lana are absolute best friends and plan to move in together soon and I’ll make it super clear now that I have no problem whatsoever with my boyfriend being close friends with a girl. He’s bisexual and just gets on better with girls and I trust him with all my heart so I have no problem there. The problem is my relationship with Lana. We appear to be friends on the outside as were nice to each other and get each other little gifts, but really she’s never asked how I am or anything. I’ve recently been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and though all my friends have been there for me she’s never asked me how I’m doing, if my medication is working or anything but she’ll ask other people how I’m doing. She also opens up about her problems to everybody at work and in our friend group except me. I see her multiple times a week but our conversations barely go past a ‘hi how are you’. I even spent the day with her the other day but she would hardly speak to me and barely interacted with me I felt so awkward.. I’ve been trying to get closer to her but I feel like it’s just not happening. \n\nNow she’s going through some problems of her own but won’t speak to me about them, my boyfriend says it’s because she knows I have depression but I hate when that effects things. So AITA for distancing myself from her and not trying to get close anymore? I talk to her so often and tell her she can open up to me but she’s never asked if I’m okay or anything besides asking other people about me. I’m just confused... it feels like she doesn’t care about me but then she asks everyone else about me so I don’t get it?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriends best friend used to be my friend but now I feel like we’re just awkward around each other.

      "description": "Just a note, I had a lot of background information which I felt was necessary but got cut out of the limit, so I put it in a comment - but please I'd appreciate if you read it before making the judgement or asking INFO. The bottom line is that I have a particular bar I like to go to and feel particularly comfortable in for stuff like this, as well as other certain peeves which I'll cover there. Nothing high maintenance though (at least I don't think so). \n\nSo, had a date, who had me pick the place. Agreed to meet at my usual spot outside and then get a drink. I never like to make them wait so I'm always making sure to be in communication.\n\nSo, as I was getting out of the shower, I get a text from her, saying she was actually ahead of schedule and ended up leaving early. So I shrug it off an give her a heads up, but then as I'm getting dressed she says \"hope you don't mind, but I stopped by [other bar] for a drink\". Well, it wasn't where I planned to go and I wasn't too keen on meeting there since it has a tendency to get crowded and not an ideal date place, but I play it cool and say \"okay that's cool, well I actually had somewhere else in mind but I'll let you know when I'm ready\", and she seems okay with this.\n\nFive minutes later I'm ready, I ask her if she can meet me at where we originally planned, and she then insists I go in there and find her. Then I get a little annoyed because I really don't wanna have to explain it to her and she literally said \"I hope you don't mind\". Of course I don't say that to her, I continue to play it cool, start walking towards the area and call her - and sure enough it sounds super loud in there, and before she answers she sounded like she was already preoccupied (exactly what I strive to avoid) and once again she text me insisting I meet her where she is. As I get closer, I say where I am and ask if she can come meet me, and even mention the other bar (and it's literally right outside, at the end of the block, not out of the way at all in a very public area, not shady in the slightest).\n\nNo answer. I try calling her phone several times, nothing. At this point I'm quite annoyed, but I figure it's not the end of the world so I'll just go meet her in that bar since she's doing terrible with communication and can't follow simple instructions and it probably won't work anyway. Just as I'm about to get there I get a text saying \"I have to be honest, trying to meet up tonight has been pretty sketchy, sorry it didn't work out\", so apparently she came all the way out here and then cancelled/left over that.\n\nCouldn't believe it, I can understand the particularness arousing curiosity but come on! It was a public place so I can't see why she would think her safety was in jeopardy. But what do you say? AITA?",

      "title": "WIBTA for wanting to kick my mother and sister out of our house when my father passes?",
      "description": "This is gonna be a long one, so I'll put a tl:dr at the bottom\n\nSo for the backstory, my mother was incredibly abusive towards me and my sister during our childhood, physical abuse, emotional abuse, you name it, she did it. My father tried to get it to stop, but he's too nice, and he's getting old.\n\nWhen I hit the age of 14, she left my father, and I couldn't be happier. She moved out, and was completely out of our lives.\n\n3 years ago however, my father let her move back in with us, even after going through an official divorce procedure and everything. And it seems like she hasn't changed at all.\n\nShe still acts cold towards me, and toxic as well. Last year I had the honor of hearing her say to my face that she wishes she never had me. Fair enough, I tell my father, and he constantly threatens to kick her out if she continues with her behavior, but he never does anything. Also, she only acts this way towards me when my father is not around, cause she knows that she'll get fussed at if she acts this way with him around.\n\nShe currently looks after him. By that I mean she'll cook him dinner, iron out his clothes, and clean somewhat. Meaning a mess could be in front of her face and she wouldn't get to it until hours and hours later, despite doing nothing but lying down on a couch, and playing on her laptop. \n\nOnto my younger sister, she has a terrible drug problem. She'll do drugs even though my father clearly stated that the moment you do illegal drugs, he's done with you, he will not help you out of any bind if you willingly mess with drugs like that. In addition, she has him and my mother take her to work, and she has the gall to wake up me and my mother at 1 or 2 in the morning to take her to get drugs. She only does it when my father is not around, because she knows that she'll get in trouble if he is around. Oh, and she doesn't contribute to the household whatsoever, and has the gall to yell and fuss at them and get into arguments when they rightfully tell her she needs to stop doing drugs. \n\nThey offered and set up a meeting with a hospital that would supposedly help her with her addiction. She didn't go, instead she went to her boyfriends house and did more drugs there.\n\nNow, I probably should've talked to them about all of this, right? Well I cant. The moment I bring up any of their problems, they immediately get very hostile, and very defensive, constantly beating you down with insults and goalposts moving all the while not listening to me. So that's out.\n\nRecently I learned from my older sister that my father plans on leaving the house in her name. And she's told me that she plans on leaving the house in my name once it's in hers. My sister nor mother know this, and I've made sure I haven't told them about this. Now my older sister is fantastic, we bond over dinner whenever she visits us from florida. She also dislikes my younger sister, and doesn't care too much for my mother.\n\nI've tried to move out a number of times. But my father is getting old as I've said (he's currently 66)  and he'll actually break down into tears and beg me not to go, and that he needs me. I've obliged, and at this point I give him rent, and pay for everything I use. All he provides for me is a roof essentially. \n\nSo basically, when my father passes, I want to kick both my mother and sister out of my house.\n\nWIBTA here?\n\nTl:dr put up with abusive mother for years. She leaves for years, and comes back still toxic as ever, my younger sister abuses my dad's love and takes full advantage of him by disrespecting him, and doing drugs in his house, my father is leaving the title of the house in my older sisters name, which will essentially be in my name, and I want to evict both of them the moment the house is in my name.",

      "description": "Some pretence. I really like the game of pool. I've been playing it a fair bit recently after not playing for about 8 years. (I never played well the last time I played was on a caravan holiday when I was 14 or so.) I've been playing every week at my local bar who let me on the team. (Mainly I just help them warm up while I practice my basic mechanics) I really want to get better, and my step dad knows this because I've been taking him to a local pool hall every week so I can have some more practice I pay for his drinks so I have someone to play with because I have a bit of anxiety in new places with new people so it helps to have someone I know along. \n\nSo this is out 4th or 5th time out and I've never beaten him. (In overall games, I win a few but he's always won more) yesterday playing at the bar, one of he team gave me some advice and it drastically improved my game. So I wanted to cement that by practicing more today.\n\nSo we get to the pool hall and play a couple of games, I'm doing pretty well as we're winning alternate games. The score is 4 to 4 my chance for the lead. I pot my final ball and have pretty hard position on the black. It is a difficult shot for me. It's may be a 80-85° cut in the side pocket. Now usually I'm pretty good into the side pocket. \n\nSo I line up my shot. I'm confident in going to pot this ball and finally be in at a chance of beating him. Right before I take pull back for the shot he blurts out. \n\n\"Oh did your mom tell you she's pregnant\".\n\nI awkwardly burst out laughing. Partly because I didn't know how to react partly because I knew he was putting me off and joking. Anyway I'm still chuckling a minute or too later and so is he making me chuckle more. I get down for the shot again try to concentrate, can't so I just go for it hoping my I just make it. I completely miss it and roll the white straight not the corner pocket. He bursts out laughing. I instantly stop. I know 100% I could have made that shot if he didn't put me off. \n\nWe play 2 more. I win the next game so its 5-5. I'm still pissed of and I'm just hitting them. I put the black in because I was careless and lost. He looks at me at the end with a sort of you know what you did wrong look. And I know I was pissed off and careless. So my response was \"yeah I know I was pissed off and just didnt care\" he says \"why are you pissed off it's not because my fault\" so I explained. \"Well yeah, you put me off a crucial shot which would have put me ahead.\"  At this point in packing up the balls to go home. He puts his cue away and leaves the pool hall.I didn't know he had left and started walking home. So I wait 5 minutes outside then presume he's walked home and call the taxi. I tell the taxi to take the roads that he's probably walking on. And when we pass him in the taxi I ask the driver to just pull over and I open the door to let him in. He sticks his middle finger up at me and continues to walk home. So I shut the door and taxi driver walks off.",

      "description": "Sorry for the formatting as I am on mobile.\n\nPA: playing aunt\nNPA: non playing aubt\n\nMy 2 cousins, my PA and I were playing mahjong (Asian tile game). My two cousins and I are beginners and my aunt is the most experienced among all of us. My uncle and NPA were just doing their things in the background. \n\nWe were playing fine and one of my cousin had trouble deciding which tile she should discard. So the NPA came and take a look. She was sitting behind my PA that was playing so she could clearly see all her tiles. When she came and see my cousin tiles, my cousin decide to throw one and immediately NPA said don't throw that but we all already saw what she intended to throw which is the tile that PA needed. NPA then switched the discard tiles which sparks the issue that NPA saw what PA needed and decide not to discard it. So all my cousin, PA, and I made a rule that non players are not allowed to give insight on the game at all. Previously my uncle was telling my other cousin what to do the whole time. \n\nFast forward 1 hour ish.. \n\nWe were trying to finish the game because it has been going on for too long and PA was close to finishing all her chips. My cousin decide to take a tile from my PA discard and my uncle immediately said don't do that. (He was still butting in here and there but we just ignored him). So my other cousin and PA said not to tell him what to do. He then stood up and say what he told him to do went affect the game. Which was not true because my cousin was going to make a move that was going to make him really hard to win. So I told him that his decision to change his move will change the whole game. He then changed his argument saying that he is just teaching him how to play. To which I told him that we all agreed that non players cannot give any insight in the game. He then changed his argument again saying that if he don't teach him, he will not learn. Which I said then it is not fair for my other cousin and I because no one is teaching us and all of us are just learning from the mistakes we are making in the game. He then changed his argument again saying that it is just a friendly game. (At this point I was getting really frustrated as he was speaking over me over and over again really loudly and interrupting our game) I then just yelled on top of my lungs to stop it. It's not his game and he should not be disturbing. He still continues talking over me giving the same reason he gave which I have already told him he was wrong. \n\nMy other aunt who was cooking came in and said I should not shout like that and said I was rude. My grandparents who was also sitting there said I was rude. I just say fine. Just because I am the younger one I am the rude one. To which my uncle just left and went to the living room and my cooking aunt just shook her head and sigh. We just continued and finished our game. \n\nSo AITA for yelling at my uncle for that? ",

      "description": "Sorry this is a long story but I'll put a TLDR at the bottom:\n\nA few months back, my husband's grandmother passed away. She lived overseas, close by to where my husband and I live , so a lot of family from america flew in for the funeral. After the funeral service, I heard my mother in law talking to my husband, asking him if I would consider escorting their 13 year old daughter (his sister) back to america, since she cannot fly alone.\nThe Mother was flying to another state back in the US, where her sister was suffering from cancer and not doing well (the father travels a lot).\n\nMy husband said absolutely not. He did not like being separated with me for long periods of time, and I have anxiety and depression, and he did not want my condition to worse in unstable situations. He did not want me to be 'used' for whenever his parents needed something done.\nI spoke to my husband later, and said I would be honored and flattered to have his parents give me such a major task to do, and to help his mother out during these hard times. Her mother just passed away, and her sister was ill, I wanted to help however I could, I wasn't working at the time and didn't mind helping out. Eventually I convinced my husband and I packed my things to go with his sister.\nBefore I left, my mother in law approached me and asked me to make my sister in law breakfast each morning, and dinner, give her medicine if she's sick, and take her to the doctor and after school activities. I agreed, she also warned me NOT to act like a parent, just a helpful adult. So I agreed to that as well. \n\nWhen I arrived in america, I got very ill, so did my sister in law. We were both so sick, we lost our voices, and it hurt to speak and swallow. Despite this, I still got up at the crack of dawn and helped wake her up, and made my in law breakfast each morning (we ordered out for dinner). \n\nMeanwhile. At their home, my husbands brother, (18) was living at home, played video games all day, and went to college and did homework late into the night (whatever floats his boat), but sometimes would throw loud parties in the middle of the house while the sister and I were trying to sleep.  I would sometimes stay up late at night with him to help him with homework and give him tea to help him keep going. But due to his laziness, and the sister's illness (and I suppose age), neither of them cleaned up after themselves. So I did my best to clean the house each day, do their laundry, ect. On top of this: the family had rented out their home the previous year, and only started to slowly move back in, so the house was a WRECK of boxes and items strewn everywhere. I also spent a lot of time trying to clean the home as best as I could, and organize, although it wasn't easy. \n\nAt some point, my depression catches up with me, and I begin to slow down in pacing. I can't clean up as well each day, and I struggle to make dinner for the daughter and order out more and more often. I was told when my mother in law would arrive, so I decided to pull myself together to clean the home as best as possible before she arrived. \n\nShe arrives earlier than I expect and explodes. \n\nShe begins to freak out the kitchen isn't clean, that my sister in law hasn't been eating sufficient dinners. That the place is a wreck. She screams she is too embarrassed to call cleaning people because the house is so messy. I apologise and say I was doing my best to keep up each day, but it was difficult when I didn't get any help. \nMother in law rolls her eyes, and says, well of course a thirteen year old isn't going to clean up after herself, and an 18 year old isn't, but a 27 year old woman!? She tells me to my face she is concerned for our future family, how will I be able to keep up with it? How will I be able to manage it? I am stunned, after everything I did for her family...none of that counted. At some point my explanations turn into defense and we begin arguing, and I say, \"I have been doing so much for your family, why does none of that matter to you?\" and she freaks out I said, \"YOUR family\" as though it wasn't my family, but what I meant was her children. \n\nEventually I tell her I am going to stay by my sisters and begin packing my things.\nFor some reason, my mother in law believes I left, and she begins trash talking me to my father in law. \nThe house is a wreck, food she bought isn't being eaten, is she really the best person for their son? Is he really happy with her? She can't believe a 27 year old woman can't keep the place together, and how she said she was taking care of 'your family' as though it wasn't hers!\nI come down stairs and tell her I heard everything and we fight again. My husband gets on the phone and calms his mother down, and after talking to her for awhile, she cries and apologizes to me. I tell her it's okay, and I apologize to her as well, that I only meant to help her (I figured with her mom passing and her sister being ill, it was a lot for her all at once). \n\nThe next day, staying at my sisters, I buy my mother in law a gift to make up for what happened. My mother in law says I didn't need to, but accepts it. \n\n\nAnyway, fast forward to now: I am extremely destroyed by everything I heard her say. I haven't been eating well, or exercising like I used to. I keep wondering if she's right. Maybe I'm not the best person for my husband, we love each other so much, we would call each other each night while I was in america. But I wonder if I'm not good enough for him. For a future with him, to hold together a family. I keep thinking she was right. Despite my good intentions, good intentions aren't good enough: it's what you are actually capable of doing, and I don't think I am capable. \nAm I the asshole for taking on something I thought I could, but couldn't handle?\n\n\n*TLDR*:\nEscorted my sister in law back to America, was in charge of taking care of her, I did, and also their son, neither of them helped clean or do laundry, so it was on me to do it. I couldn't keep up and my depression made it harder, mother comes home and is pissed and tells me I'm not good enough to hold a family together and may not be good enough for her son. \nAm I the asshole for taking on something I thought I could, but couldn't handle?\n",

      "description": "This is going to be an unusual one for the sub, as far as I can tell.\n\nSo I was playing Blackjack at a casino last night. The shoes are all favoring the dealer to an insane degree. Doesn't matter what hand you have, the dealer wins. So I start playing a bit unorthodox because of the situation.\n\nEnter the Old Man. Old man just left some other game, Texas Hold Em IIRC, where he lost his ass. He sits down with ~$25. First hand he's at the table the dealer's showing a 5 and I had a 12. I hit because why the fuck not? I have a better chance of winning than not because every other hand, played by the book, has been a loser. I play in to the break and he decides to chastise me for it. OK old man, stick around for a while.\n\nWe're all treading water for a while, staying close to even, but Old Man is obviously getting frustrated as well and he plays in to a break.

We were all a little pissed since the shoes sucked, and he wasn't helping.\n\nFor those of you that don't know, you split Aces and Eights. That's a rule. You get double Aces/Eights, you split 'em. Well I got double Sevens. I leaned to the dude to my left and said \"I bet this'll piss him off...\" and split my Sevens. Holy shit, the dealer got mad, the old man got mad, even one or two guys at the table were upset...and that old man took his chips and stormed off. I think he had $20-30. The dealer laughed and told me I was an asshole.\n\nAfter he fucked off the table started winning.\n\nSo am I the asshole for pissing off some Old Man that was needlessly fucking up the table?",

      "description": "My (F/23) ex (M/21) and I just broke up this week because he felt like he needed more time to focus more on his acads and himself. He has clinical depression and couldn’t identify his feelings towards anything (including me anymore). We talked about it and decided to stay friends because we’ve been together for almost 6 years and we have a strong foundation built from friendship. To me he’s my bestfriend. But of course like any other break up-even if it was our decision, well mostly his to break up, it hurt so much for the both of us. I still want us to keep trying but I think he really needs time for himself right now. As someone that has been by his side for so long; I always , always want to be there for him. But he told me that I shouldn’t anymore because if I’m always there he wouldn’t be able to figure things out on his own. \n\nSo here I am bawling my eyes out to sleep every night. It still hurts because even though we agreed to stay friends, to me the way he acts feels like he doesn’t need nor care for me anymore even though he says he still does and always will. It’s only been a week and I’m still grieving. Earlier today he invited me to go drinking with his two friends that were both girls/bi? He said he wanted to drink till he gets drunk (and he’s not the drinking type of guy so this is new to him). I felt hurt because I feel like he doesn’t care that I’m still on my grieving period with our break up and he invites me to drink with TWO girls. Of course I’ll still feel hurt. So i decline because I was upset and really didnt feel like talking to his friends. I want to talk to him though but he just cant talk to me straight.  And then he gets slightly pissed at me for my reasoning. I got more upset, hurt and also pissed. I just slept to clear my head and rest my heart. I don’t know am I the asshole here? ",

Like she’s how old now and I still wouldn’t mind tapping that. \n\nAnyways, so I asked him yay or nay for Sara and he said nah so I was disappointed. So I asked him, “ So who’s on your list then huh?”.But what I meant, from previous context, was who no matter their age do you find attracted to and therefore would consider doing. \n\nAt this point i was like damn we having an old fashion locker room chat now. And out of nowhere one of the waitresses says, “ Wow what a bunch of scumbags” and then sarcastically laughs. I was like “oh I’m sorry ma’am...” and she reply’s “No no it’s fine it’s fine” in one of those “yeah whatever” kinds of tones. So from there she never did a lap around the diner that included us and now I felt like a asshole. But I just wanted to see who my friend thinks is still attractive at an older age.\n\nAm I the asshole??",

      "description": "Here's some background. I'm currently in highschool and have been looking for job. I just recently landed a job but I haven't begun to work yet and will be starting next week.\n\nSo here we go...\n\nSo my brother and I bought tickets to an event a month ago and the event is the weekend I will be starting my work. So I was like...\n\nI should text my boss before he sends the schedule that I wont be able to come into work on Saturday right?\n\nBut my mom's like, no, don't do that, you'll get fired\n\nAt this point I'm like why? Isn't it better to let my boss know as early as possible??\n\nMy mom explained to me and my brother that because I haven't started to work yet, asking for a day off before even working will leave a bad impression and will get me fired.\n\nI thought of it was somewhat reasonable??? This is my first real job BTW\n\nMy brother then explained that it's better to let my boss know before he sends the schedule so that my boss can work it out with that in mind.\n\nMy mom reasoned that because I haven't even worked yet, it wasn't okay. But if I were to already have been working there for a bit it would be acceptable. And then she goes on about that she personally would tell my boss and just drop the event for work.\n\nMy mom and my brother would argue a bit and I would be sitting there listening and texting my friends about the situation. They tell me that it should be totally fine to text my boss, so I thought about it and decided to send the text without my mom knowing.\n\nI asked my mom again why couldn't just text my boss and she reasoned to me, slowly raising her voice. And while I was trying to reason with her, I told her I sent the text anyways so there isn't much you can do about it.\n\nEverything goes downhill from here\n\nMy mom goes pretty much nuts. She goes on about why the hell I didn't listen to her and that I don't prioritize my studies and work and always play instead. I tell her that I finish all my work at school, that's why she doesn't see me working a lot at home. She goes on again that she would drop the event to work and emphasizes that I don't work enough. \n\nI told my mom this\nI got straight A's last semester, I have 2 AP's and I've been working on work at school. Which may not seem like a lot to some people, which includes my mom.\n\nShe says that I have so much free time, why don't I take up another AP?\n\nSo I had a 3rd AP previously and I dropped it because I couldn't keep up with the HW load and was 3 assignments behind only a month into the semester so I dropped it.\n\nBut anyways, the conversation goes on about my grades, my responsibilities, my priorities and etc.\n\nI asked why she was getting so worked up about it. It isn't her job, it's mine so therefore it is my responsibility and if I do end up fired, that's my problem not hers.\n\nSo at this point my mom threatens me by taking out all the money from my checking account and telling my brother that he will not be taking me out on Saturday.\n\nSo I don't rly remember when my dad got into this but he always takes my mom's side when we argue. He was saying that I don't listen to them but previously I was seriously taking everything into consideration before texting my boss.\n\nI get a text from my boss saying that it's totally okay and third schedule's are very flexible, meaning that u have Saturday off to go to the event right?\n\nBut my mom was like, whether you have Saturday off or not, I will not let you go to the event. And then she told me to cancel the plans I had for the next day and proceeded to take all my money from my banking account.\n\nSo yeah, that happened. I tried making it simple without going too off track like the argument did about my grades and shit.\n\nTd:lr I had plans on a weekend do I wanted to tell my boss at a new job that I could work on that one day, but my mom said not to do it cus I will get fired. I try to reason with her and ended up sending the text anyways and she gets mad at me, taking all my money out of my checking account and cancels the plans I had for the week.\n\nAlso here are some questions I think will be asked\n\nMy brother paid for both out tickets and my mom said she will be paying for them\n\nI can't drive\n\nMy boss is chill",

      "description": "\n\nA little over a month ago I started talking to this girl I met on tinder. She was great, super sweet, and most importantly she was ok with me being a cripple in a wheelchair. I asked her out almost immediately, so I wouldn’t have to fret about that very long. She said yes, but she didn’t have a day off work for two weeks and we talked until then. It got pretty serious, we talked about everything. Here’s where it started to fall apart. I’m a serial introvert, so I thrive being alone and not taking to people, and after a certain point everything that’s worth talking about gets talked about, and your just talking for the sake of talking. Like I really don’t care about your favorite zoo animal, and I know that makes me an asshole, but I’m sorry I would rather play video games. Then I came to the realization that maybe I’m not supposed to be in a relationship at all, and that I was only seeking one because I thought that was what people did to get happiness. What makes it even worse is that she kept saying how great of a guy I was, and how easily hurt she was. She kept saying she wasn’t bothered by my introvertedness, but I think she really was. After I had this epiphany I felt really bad it was a little less than a week before the date, and I’ve never been on a date and I really wanted to have that experience and to see if my mind changed. So I lead her on, and for that I am truly an asshole, but then Karma struck and she got sick the day of, turns out she had been sick the whole week and didn’t tell me because she wanted to go on the date. The next day I did the right thing and broke it off. I went about it ok I would say, I do regret a couple things I said, I think I led her to believe I led her on for longer than I did, and that letting me be my introvert self had something to do with it, so that was sucky of me, but at that point it was too late, her heart was already on the mend and I didn’t want to make it worse by going back and apologizing, I wanted to give her time and space to heal. My biggest regret though is that it took her getting heartbroken to make me realize that I’m not supposed to be in a relationship, and I really want her to know that I’m sorry for that. Like I said this was a little over a month ago, so what should I do? Is my epiphany correct? Should i wait longer? Should I have said something sooner? Should I never contact her again? Should I have toughed it out and gone on the date? \n\n",

Ben has had a divide in his family since his abuser went to jail. For a while there was no contact between my partner and his sister(Jess). As Ben's partner I have head all sorts of stories and horrors that come from systemic abuse and the grooming of Jess. Since then both Ben and Jess have had therapy and Jess has since had 2 kids  \n\n\nWe met up with Jess and her partner, it went okay, but then this week. Ben was told the only way that he could see Jess's kids, was if Ben got a Psych evaluation from Jess's partner, next year after he finishes his qualifications.  \n\n\nI am adamantly against this, believing it is a major conflict of interest having Jess's partner do it. I suggested instead that he came to a therapy session or something different, trying to find a middle ground. I don't think I am an  asshole I think it's a complex situation.  \n\n\nTL:DR: Sister want's my partner to get a Psych evaluation from her partner, I think that is a conflict of interest.",

      "description": "Hi everyone. I'll keep it short and sweet here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for some backstory, our shower has for 2 years leaks through the floor at random. We've tried numerous ways to simulate the leaking but to no avail. My dad has the idea that it leaks when there's someone in the shower showering (why that makes a difference idk) but he's never got to test it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I am showering with the curtain closed and my dad knocks on the door. He asks me to open the door and let himself in so he can figure out why the shower is now deciding to leak into the floor below. I tell him I'll be out in 5 min but he insists, so I reach my hand out of the curtain and reach around till I get a grip on it and open it then close the curtain. He walks in and goes into a usual 5 min rant about where it could be coming from and how, so I tune out for a bit. Suddenly I feel a hole open up in the curtain right next to my ass and an iPhone pokes through while recording. I'm quickly turn around and tell him to please not film while I'm in the shower and he removes the iPhone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple seconds later I'm still expressing to him how it's really weird to do that and he sticks the iPhone back in while saying I'm not in the frame. Now I'm pissed and start yelling for him to shut it off now and how inappropriate it is while your TEENAGE SON is showering and he's sticking a camera to try and film some stupid leak. He shuts off the camera and leaves the bathroom. I finish showering and while in my room he tries to explain how I wasn't in the shot and wanted to see that particular scenario while the shower was running. I respond and tell him how violated I feel when someone sticks a camera into the shower while ignoring my continuous requests to turn it off and tell him to try to re create it another time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought my mom would react differently and be guilty and apologize but nope same reaction, how it wasn't meant to film me and they wanted to re create the scenario. She said the ceiling problem is \"$1000s of dollars\" and they needed a way to figure out the problem. I told her I didn't care and felt violated and embarrassed for recording me **while I was showering**. She stopped responding to me when I asked how she would feel if I were to poke a camera through her shower without warning while I recorded and ignored her requests to turn it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR had privacy exposed because my parents wanted to diagnose a shower leak while I was actively showering. As a teenage boy I feel massively violated and embarrassed. My parents seem to find nothing wrong with it. I feel so disgusted.",

      "description": "I broke up with this guy about 6 months ago, and we were in a serious relationship for almost 3 years. A while back, my family lost everything as a result of bad business decisions, and I was working multiple jobs while trying to keep my GPA at 4.0. While all this is happening, my ex would play the pity card and tell me he doesn’t have enough money/not pay the expensive food bills etc. \n\nHe also once took money out of my account without telling me, and his excuse was “I didn’t think it was necessary”. He doesn’t work, he doesn’t do well in school, and doesn’t try to improve himself as a person. He also didn’t bother helping me get food when I was throwing up all over the place due to a bad gastritis attack from working long and stressful hours and hadn’t had anything to eat for a day. He proceeded to berate me for working too much and taking on more than I can handle.\n\nEventually he told me he stayed with me for money because our relationship was taking a bad turn (I didn’t want to have sex) and so he needed something to cling onto. He expected me to be fine with it, and called me a hypocrite when I wasn’t because I “didn’t like the honest truth” that I always advocated for. Now he won’t stop telling people that I’m the terrible person who broke his heart.  Oh, and all this while, he was basically cheating on me with people on role play forums playing out sick fantasies, which I found out after the breakup. He showed absolutely no remorse. He then said that I shouldn’t give up on this relationship because I’m just walking away from a commitment. \n\nHe did help me out a little, and was patient with me throughout. But I felt like it doesn’t justify his behavior...\n\nSo, AITA for not forgiving him and giving up on the relationship? ",

      "description": "So this is a leading title that will need some context so you get the full picture. So this happened to my friends and I when I was studying abroad in this European country. Essentially some of our friends from the US were visiting us that week because they were on break for Thanksgiving. \n\nOne night we were walking back from the clubs/bars between 3am-4am when these group of local guys started to harass us. It all started because one of my friends who was visiting has a very boisterous laugh and he was laughing past these group of guys at whatever conversation we were having . These locals thought we were laughing at them for whatever reason and started coming  at us, yelling curse words their native language. So they keep yelling and following us and it got to the point where it became to much.  We were being restrained because we were all in a different country where, if the police were ever involved they would most likely take the side of the locals. For the record before this we were mugged at knife point in a different city in this country.\n\nThen the moment when we knew it was “serious” was when they all TOOK OF THEIR BELTS( I shit you not) and started swing them at us with the buckle end .We were so confused because we NEVER saw something like that. At that point it was flight or fight and we chose fight. We all ended up fighting, however my friends and I handled ourselves well. Once it was all over not was knocked out or seriously hurt it was your normal drunken fight. However in the end we had no problem handling them because they were smaller than we were, you could say we “won”. The caveat is, they were clearly under the age of 18. I would put them in the range of 16-17, however in this particular country they are allowed to drink and be out.\n\nAre we assholes for fighting these kids? For reference we were all aged 19-21.",

      "description": "Before me and my GF moved in together I told her I hate cleaning, I despise it and I won't do it, I will give a hand from time to time but that's it! It wasn't meant just so I can afford being lazy, but when we were living each in our own apartments she would clean every 2 days because she likes it clean and I don't really care much, I would give the house a serious clean like once every 3 months (I know, but meh) and maybe sweep every few weeks IDK.\n\nBut like I said, I made sure to make it clear to her before we moved in together that I don't wanna clean much because that's what I'm used to, and if she feels the need to keep the house clean to her standards that's fine but don't ask me to do it because I don't care. I made it clear because that's the last thing I wanted us to fight about when we moved in together.\n\nWe moved in, things were going along fine, I agreed to do the dishes (which I do every single day), I also sweep the house from time to time on my own accord, and do random cleaning stuff for her sake (cause I couldn't care less, screw cleaning).\n\nLately I had a lot of time off from college and work, so I've been home a lot, and ever since she enters the house after she's done with her work or w/e and she's clearly pissed because I didn't clean. I didn't say much and tried to clean a bit more for her sake, but today it was like the 10th time she had that fucking sour face on because I didn't sweep the house. I told her she didn't even ask me to, and that we've talked about this before we moved in, but she says that because I live in the house I can't afford not to clean and that she can't believe I couldn't take some time off studies (was studying for a test tomorrow) to sweep the house.\n\nSo obviously I got super upset, I feel like I shouldn't have to do that, I think I'm trying enough for her sake and doing stuff around the house much more frequently than when I was living on my own, and I got super fed up with her sour face cause I didn't clean. We had a big fight and honestly wanted to ask, AITA here? ",

      "description": "So my boyfriend (27m) and I (23f) had a massive two and a half hour argument on Saturday. We had made plans for him to have dinner with my family and he had bailed an hour and a half before I’d asked him to be there. The crux of the argument was that he felt I didn’t understand his workload and put pressure on him to catch up a lot, and I felt that he was failing to communicate, and if he didn’t want to see me he just needed to say no., and not wait until the last moment. We ended in an unsettled agreement and haven’t talked for two days. After talking/seeing each other everyday most weeks, this is unusual and upsetting for me. But in an effort to understand his workload and to recognise that I had heard what he was saying in the argument, I left him alone. \n\nI should also mention that I’ve been really sick with the flu this week so I’ve been pretty miserable. \n\nAnyway come to last night and there comes a stream of Facebook posts from my boyfriend that are a mix of complaining about burnt coffee and being happy some of his big assignments are done. Amidst the Facebook posts he writes this:\n“Today was  a good day. Also didn’t mind the couple of cute girls complimenting me on my appearance on the way home to finish it off” \n\nThis annoyed me. He hasn’t talked to me in two days since the huge fight and this status made me feel really insecure. I rang him this morning and gently brought up that posting something like that on Facebook really made me feel bad, especially after a huge fight we hadn’t quite healed from yet. He got really angry at me and said that I was taking away from something nice someone had said to him and that he wasn’t going to stop posting things like that if someone showed him random kindness. I stressed to him that I was happy someone had complimented him, but that him specifically mentioning they were cute girls made me feel insecure after our fight.

      "title": "AITA [36M] for reminding my wife [34F] about soap we already had?",
      "description": "I came home tonight and my wife was telling me about her day. One item she recalled was going to target, and she specifically mentioned getting meyer's clean day soap. The last time meyer's clean day soap was purchased was the first time we purchased it for our house - she specifically requested for me to get it. I had asked, \"which variety\" and she had told me, \"any\" I then, like an idiot got different varieties of dish and hand soap, ruining the aesthetic she was trying to present in our kitchen. (never expressed to me.  No fight from this)\n\nAnyways, that left us with extra of this expensive dish soap, which I thought we would use next and just get matching hand soap for that time.\n\nSo, she mentions she got new dish and hand soap, and I replied with \"ooh, remember that I got that other one last time that we should probably use?\"\n\nHer tone then becomes annoyed with me and she says that's not the one she likes and she got the variety she likes. At this point, I'm confused because regardless of whether it's her favorite variety or not, we should use that first. However, now I'm feeling a heavy bad attitude coming from her - my assumption (from our usual poor communication) is that she feels accused of a bad memory or lack of observation in our daily life by me. (She thinks I'm saying she didn't remember we had the extra soap and that she's stupid for it.)\n\nSo, after asking why she's perturbed, and verifying it is because she is upset about me asking a question about whether she may have forgotten the extra soap (she told me that my questioning of her was rude/offensive) I try to explain myself in hopes of setting the record straight, because I had absolutely no intention of passing any judgment about whether she knew the soap was there or not. 3x I explain that me asking why she got new soap was not me accusing her or having a poor memory or not being observant, and that it was simply because I could easily imagine MYSELF forgetting the extra soap was there that I asked that question. Each time, she answers in a fashion that ignores my explanation, and only escalates her frustration with me. I am remaining calm in my explanation the entire time, and quite honestly, begging to be understood.\n\nProbably shouldn't have bothered explaining, but not being understood makes me feel utterly empty and disrespected / marginalized / villainized.\n\nAnyways, this ends in her giving me \"advice\" as to how I could approach the situation better, while she spoke of each of us only being able worry about ourselves in the situation and that the only way something like this would improve in the future was for us both to work on our own end. (which I agree with, but paired with the \"advice\" to me on how to approach it, and no outward recognition about what she could have done different to help, seems quite hypocritical.)\n\nAnyways, AITA?\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated here. I really need the sanity check, even if it's hard truth for me to face.\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "So, I sit at this table with two other guys in an class. One of them is depressed and possibly suicidal (lets call him “T”) and the other is edgy and dark  humored(lets call him “L”). L frequently jokes about serious topics like suicide and depression, with such enthusiasm that nearly the entire class can hear it, and have told him to stop several times (He doesn’t). He sits right across from T who is like I said depressed and maybe suicidal and sensitive , and T can hear everything L says. T doesn’t laugh at most of these jokes, but does not tell L to stop. I enjoy L’s humor and I frequently play along and laugh at it, sometimes to the point where I am unable to do work due to being preoccupied with laughing. An example of L’s humor is “Suicidal people are just (life’s) speed-runners”. I do try to get L to have a bit more discretion, especially when it is rather dark, but sometimes it is just too funny, and I know that I probably am an asshole, but I wanna make sure since I told this situation and that joke to my other friend (who has attempted suicide) , and he laughed at it, but he said that I would possibly have to take some form of burden in the case T ends himself in part to my involvement in L’s jokes, which is an undesirable effect for me.\n\nAITA for playing along with L’s humor in the immediate presence of T?",

      "description": " AITA... A little bit of context.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live and work in London and use a contactless method of paying for my travel to and from work. For those that are not from the UK a contactless system calculates the cost of your journey based on where you tap 'in' and where you tap 'out'. A one way journey costs me £3.20.   \n\nOn this particular day I forgot to tap 'in' when I got the train to work. The way this system works means that if you tap out without first tapping in, it calculates your journey cost as the maximum price in order to stop people abusing the system. Therefore tapping out would have cost me \\~£10 (I'm not sure of the specific amount). On the journey I had realised my mistake and wanted to avoid having to pay the maximum fare and so went to speak to a railway employee.   \n\nHe listened to my explanation and my plea for help and then asked for my contactless card. After recieving my contactless card and checking that I didn't tap 'in' he informed me that taking a journey without a ticket is subject to a £20 automatic fine. He then proceeded to fine me £20 on the spot, using my contactless card to pay.   Therefore I ended up paying £20 instead of the £10 that I would've paid if I had just tapped out. \n\nBy asking for a railway worker to help me in a situation where I had genuinely made a mistake I had inadvertantly cost myself £10.   I was so pissed off by this situation that after the railway worker fined me I told him that I hope he has a \"fucking shit day\" as well as some other colourful.language directed at what I think is a fucking ridiculous system.\n\n   \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling this railway worker to have a fucking shit day?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: forgot to pay for train travel, admitted my mistake, was charged 6x my usual fare, took my anger out on the asshat of a railway worker.

I live in a house with my boyfriend, and our roommate. We are all college students.\n\nRoommate is constantly having guests over without telling us, but it isnt just like any other situation. These guests come over AFTER 10pm (when im normally in bed) and stay until the early morning. They are also loud, and I have a dog that barks when anyone enters the house. Roommate is an aspiring DJ and always playing loud music. He meets women on dating apps and has them into our home to spend the night, constantly. It used to literally be a different woman every day. Now its a new woman every week. He has no sense of cleanliness, meaning, he doesnt ever think anything is dirty therefore he doesnt care to clean. He is a complete night owl, waking up at 2-4pm and going to bed between 4-6 am. \n\nNow, i understand we are just different people leading different lives and we all have different goals.\n\nHowever this is my last full semester of college and I am in 27 credit hours. Yes, 27. Obviously my life is about to be dedicated to school, and sleep, not much else. \nWith that said, I am debating drafting a 'Spring 2019 House rules' sheet because I am tired of having to ask him if he has guests, or telling him to turn the music down, etc.\nRoommate stress is the very last thing I need to be worrying about this semester. \n\nThe agreement would consist of things like:\n\nAll members of house must be aware of incoming guests-- overnight or not (so fucking tired of walking downstairs in my robe and he's got a group of friends over)\n\nHeadphones must be used past midnight (the bass drop wakes me up. not the music, the vibrating bass.)\n\nNo guests (except lady friends in the bedroom) allowed over after midnight on school nights (cant be loud if theyre not there)\n\nCleaning rotation implemented (cleaning floors, counters, etc)\n\nNo smoking blunts downstairs (shared space, I am trying to quit smoking)\n\n\nWe are not currently under any lease, i've debated just kicking him out, but as this semester started today I've decided its better to just make this semester as smooth as possible, which I think would be easiest under clearly defined rules. \n\nI assume many people will say its unfair to me to limit what someone else can do in their own home (I own the house, he is tenant, there is a power imbalance), but our original lease agreement (expired last june, didnt care to renew) stated similar rules, he just rarely followed them, and it didnt bother me until it started happening more and more frequently.",

      "description": "My old 2DS’s (handheld video game system) battery broke about a year ago. I ended up replacing the battery but my mom had bought me a new 2DS already. My friend, who didn’t have any Nintendo game consoles except for the Wii, expressed interest in the old 2DS. I agreed, as at the time we were pretty close, considering each other best friends. Along with the 2DS I gave him some Pokémon games that he’d always expressed interest in. This included: Pearl, White, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Moon. Each of these games roughly cost $40 for me to buy. I cherish each of these but felt that I could do without them since I had either beaten them or had the alternate versions of each copy (For non-Pokémon nerds, most Pokémon games get sold in pairs with the two games virtually the same besides minor differences)\n\nFast forward to earlier this week. I made some meme about one of the Pokémon you can encounter in the games. My friend responded, very confused, and wondered what the heck the Pokémon was. It was a fairly common and recognizable Pokémon creature so I was kinda confused. I grew suspicious and hated asking him so, but questioned him in a joking manner “Have you ever even actually played the games?” He flat out said no, and included that he doesn’t know where the 2DS went. I’m glad he responded honestly, but part of me felt very betrayed. \n\nOne could use the excuse that he’s just busy and hasn’t gotten around to them, but he’s consistently Online, playing some sort of Xbox game. I was furious, as I had spent a lot of money on these games. I asked him for the games back if he never was gonna play them, as I wanted my money’s worth and my games back. He kinda just responded half-heartedly, not caring. I haven’t heard back from him since and probably won’t unless I bring the conversation back up.\n\nI know a gift is a gift and that it would be terrible to take it from him, but it also upsets me that he never used it or thought about doing so. I also don’t wanna tarnish our friendship over something as stupid as a video game. Am I the asshole for asking for the games back?\n",

      "description": "Okay I know the title makes me sound like the biggest A-hole already,,, but there’s more to it. So, for some background- I’ve only known this guy for around a year and a half. He has a massive crush on me (not being like that, he’s expressed it to me multiple times verbally) and kinda... well, fake. \n\nAnyway, I feel he should be excluded for many reasons, but the main reason is because of his transphobia and (kinda) homophobia. He’s constantly starting arguments about how being trans is ‘weird’, ‘wrong’, and how he ‘doesn’t understand it’. He’s also constantly calling me and some others a faggot. By the way, I’m pansexual and try to be as active I can in the LGBTQ+ community and HE KNOWS THAT. I’ve talked to him about it multiple times and every single time I do, the only thing he gives me is a sorry.  And it’s definitely not genuine. Another reason is about his crush on me. He’s asked me out over and over, each time me saying ‘No’ as politely possible. He won’t stop! He’s even resorted to calling me ‘babe’ and telling other’s I an his girlfriend. It’s slightly scary, especially since I’ve rejected his moves multiple times. The last reason I’ll cover is that ‘he’s fake’ statement. This’ll be brief cause my phone’s dying. For an example, one day he flat out ignored me and our other friend. Yeah we we’re a little upset cause we were tryna hang out with him. But we talked it out and he FLIPPED out- saying how we were being over dramatic and it’s a stupid reason to get upset over. Mind you, a couple month ago I had lost my phone and he got mad at me for a couple days because I wasn’t responding to him. \n\nSo, people of this subreddit, Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So when I first met my husband he played guitar he had tried to pursue a music career for a few years after high school but had recently just given that up to go back to college. That's where we met, college. Fast forward we've been together for 10 years married for five with one kid. Slowly over the years my husband has kind of stop playing his guitar. He will pick it up maybe two times a year. Instead he's picked up lots of other hobbies including homebrewing and hunting, that take up his free time. \n\nWe recently moved to a new city, and he's been talking about wanting to start playing music again. I was all for it and supportive but then he started talking about playing and meeting up with this particular bandmate. There have been some weird stuff with her that makes me uncomfortable here are the bullet points. \n\n• when my husband and I first started dating 6 months in,  he went down to hang out with some friends. We kiss goodbye say I love you. All good. He ends up taking mushrooms with said girl and they have a long talk about what they want in life.  He decides (while talking to her) that I'm fake?? and he needs to break up with me. Two weeks later we get back together because he is miserable without me. We've been together ever since. \n\n• A few years later the girl came to visit us for two weeks while dealing with some family stuff. She was weird the whole time she visited. She refused to talk to me. She would text my husband when he was at work asking if she could have some of our milk when I was sitting on the couch in the next room and could have asked me. It was weird\n\n• my husband secretly sent her flowers on Valentine's day. He sent them anonymously, as a supportive friend but he hid it from me. I only found out because the florist sent him a postcard the next year reminding him to buy another bouquet for Valentine's Day. Lucky for him the website still had the old order and I could read the message he sent her. It wasnt romantic, just him being supportive of a friend going through a hard time. I forgave him.\n\nWIBTA if I told him I was too uncomfortable with him hanging out with this person? I don't want to be that controlling wife who dictates who her husband can hang out with but I can't help but see the red flags and feel uncomfortable. ",

      "description": "\nGood day all of you.\n\nSo this just happened a few minutes ago and I'm a bit torn, about if I am the asshole here now and should apologize.\n\nMy Grandma died nearly 2 years ago. My mum was an only-child, my parents are divorced and she has no current partner and my grandpa is dead for over 7 years now, so my grandmother was the last close relative left besides me and my sister to my mother. \nShe fell into really heavy mourning, cried for months every day and still isn't over it yet, crying whenever a memory of her mother is brought up.\nWe all suffer from her loss, but it's not comparable to what she went through and is still going through.\nToday she met with a friend of hers, who also knew my grandma. \nOut of the blue she (the friend) suddenly started talking about my grandma. Like, in short: \"I don't know if I should tell you, but I think it's important for you to know. Today at the parking lot where I last met her I saw her again. She seemed to be happy and wants to let you know, that she is fine\". All that medium esoteric bullshit stuff.\nMy mum (who is very gullible) was totally thrown of the track and called me, after she left.\nAs I heard what she told me I was quite pissed inside, but didn't comment and only gave my opinion, as she asked me for it. \nWhat I told her was' \"Well, you know what I think of all this esoteric stuff. I think it's incredible insensitive to make up such bullshit. It's tasteless, to say something like that for whatever reason\".\nMy mum quickly changed the subject, but noticeably more quiet and after we hung up only responding very short and pragmatic.\n\nI don't believe in any kind of mystery-magical-ghosty-stuff, so to me it's clear that the friend of hers made this stupid story up for what ever reason and I can't comprehend why someone would do that. I don't think it's comforting, imo it's just totally wrong. But now I keep thinking I might be TA for telling my mum. I don't think lying about such things is appropriate, but it seemed to disappoint her, that I brushed it off as nonsense.\n",

      "description": "I recently went no contact with my mother after, from my perspective, a difficult and stressful five years. This is a long one with a lot of context and backstory, so please bear with me.\n\n \n\nMy parents got divorced five years ago and things were messy. My parents tried turning us children against the other parent. By in large the majority lf the lying and manipulation came from my mom. My dad isn't perfect and is a little weird but he at least I can understand him. My mother on the other hand has become someone I can't trust to tell basic truths.\n\n \n\nHere are some highlights of our relationship during the past five years:\n\n \n\nDivorce my dad after years of her cheating on him (at least 3 men)\n\n \n\nAccept a marriage proposal from my dad as he’s trying to fix things\n\n \n\nSecretly get engaged to another man, marry him shortly thereafter\n\n \n\nNew husband tries to become my dad, becomes verbally abusive when I refuse that offer. Mom takes his side.\n\n \n\nShe tries to turn me against my dad, saying he had emotional relationships with women on the internet. Probably true, but she’s forgetting the plank in her eye.\n\n \n\nI learn that there have been 3+ other men, one of which could possibly be my real dad\n\n \n\nI suffer depression and go to therapy because I realize my happy childhood was a lie (at least that’s what I was thinking)\n\n \n\nShe lies and says she and the new husband got a divorce. Among other evidence, she eventually has to sign my car title (which we were both on and requires both sigs to sell) and signs it with her new married name.  \n\n \n\nSecretly move new husband into her home\n\n \n\nPlans trips to my city and stays in my home without asking if I am okay with that, considering I don’t trust her anymore.\n\n \n\nAttempts to buy my affection with expensive items (ex: living room furniture set)\n\n \n\nCalls about twice a week to check up. I try to ghost most of them. I know this is immature, but I get a huge wave of anxiety from seeing “Mom” on the incoming call.\n\n \n\nWife and I have a baby, and she begins planning a week or two long stay at my house to “help.” Again I don’t trust her, especially to take care of my newborn.\n\n \n\nBrother finds facebook profile of the new husband (same one she “divorced”) with posts of them together buying a house, and them at a family reunion for his family. When confronted with this, she lies, makes excuses, and takes down the posts and untags herself from the photos.\n\n \n\nThat brings us to current, where my wife and her mother are pressuring me to forgive my mother and stop being so cruel by keeping the grandmother away (my brother and his wife plan on having no kids, so I might have the only grandkids in the family). My stance is that now that I have a child, I would never treat them like I was treated and lied to. I do not trust my mother still, and especially if she were left alone with my child.\n\n \n\n",

      "description": "\nSo the story is my FIL(51) has been living with my husband(30) and me(30) since September of 2018 when he was released from prison on parole. The only way they would let him out is if he stayed with us in our state.\n\nHe smokes and he’s an alcoholic which husband and I don’t really care about. We only said he couldn’t smoke in the house or close around our toddler and baby. \n\n\nHe doesn’t smoke in the house but barely. House smells like cigarettes all the time. (I’m a former smoker so I give him leeway but it’s very loud).  Even when my 3m old got rsv and we explained that smoke makes it worse he dgaf until we told him to take proper measures or else. \n\nHe took my 4y old to breakfast but he was drunk, doesn’t have a license or insurance. Husband okayed it so they were both at fault. Husbands normal Meter was damaged severely in childhood.\n\n\nSo a month later FIL is mad because we are placing (2) limits on him. He blew up at us saying he didn’t want to live with us anymore because I was a liar and a bitch because I hated him smoking (I’m a former smoker and my dad has smoked his whole life) and I lied about cps getting involved if he got a dui with our kid in the car, and I clearly hated him. His proof for my hate is because I don’t like the smell of his cheap beer. I also got mad at him when he smoked a cigarette and then immediately got into the car with my 4m old and 4y old. \n\nI apparently also think I’m better than him because I told him I wanted the kids to go to college. My husbands’ family are mostly criminals and drug dealers. Which is their business! They live 5 states from me and I see them maybe once a year so I really could not care. My husband who grew up with a convict father, a drug dealer uncle, and alcoholics, who was constantly derided for doing something as lame as trying to get an education does not want his kids to be anything like his family. \n\nFIL wishes he had stayed in home state or was homeless rather then spend one more second in my presence. He isn’t grateful for anything we’ve done (condition of him getting parole was him staying with us because we are stable, paying thousands to move him in with us, getting furniture, his job, paying for food, etc).\nSo I told him to get the hell out of my house then. He said gladly. \nSo now FIL doesn’t have any money, of course,  and needs time-a week at least- to look for a place. Husband thinks we should just be polite until he leaves and then put him on very low contact. So he wants me to give him an extension.\n\nI’m afraid that this could spin out for weeks and Im mad at him.\nSo am I the Asshole for telling husband he’s out of his mind to think I’m going to let FIL stay any longer? \n\nI can give more info if needed. Had to keep it short.",

      "description": "I’ve worked at a hardware store for going on 3 years now.  I was there when Katy was first hired.   Katy is fucking awful.   She is always late.   Needs shifts covered all the time.   She slacks off and then the rest of us need to pick up her slack.  All the time.  She’s also rude as fuck.  Like just mean spirited.   There have been customer complaints about her.  \n\nThe rumors are that she’s been fooling around with our store manager.  There’s no proof of this.  But this past week she was promoted to assistant manager.  \n\nShe’s already letting the power go to her head.  She made the schedule giving herself all the easiest times.  Usually when the schedule is made you can request certain days off.  Another coworker who is pregnant requested Tuesday off to go to a drs appointment.  Katy told her no and that a lot of things are gonna be different now. \n\nThere’s no way Katy was promoted for her work.  It’s just not possible.  Everyone hate her because we’re all constantly picking up her slack.  She’s rude to customers.  It just doesn’t make sense that she was promoted.  \n\nThe district manager is coming next week and a couple other employees want to pull him aside and talk to him about her.  I really have no idea if the rumors about her and our store manager are true, but I really don’t see any other reason that she would be promoted.  I kinda want to join in, but I’m conflicted because it feels shit accusing someone with no proof.  \n\n",

He’s not a student at our school, so she cooked for him, cleaned for him, etc while all he did was live off her. She even loaned him her car. \n\nSo imagine our surprise when she finds out that he cheated on her the whole time with another girl IN HER CAR. They obviously break up, and he starts dating the other girl. The other girl comes outside my friends’ dorm to “collect his stuff” and talk shit about my friend, and it’s all messy. \n\nCome to find out, this guy is also cheating on the girl he cheated on my friend with. He sleeps with anyone he can sleep with. I personally think he’s the definition of trash but that’s just me. \n\nSo the other day, he comes to my friend’s dorm. He asks her what she’s cooking, and she gives him food (the fact she stills speaks to him appalls me as well, but anyways). He trashes my food and then says hi to me and my friend like we don’t hate him. Then, him and his friend (who I also have a problem with) go into her room. \n\nMy friend and I are in shock, and start discussing it. At first, we whisper, but I wanted to let him know how I feel. I shouted “wow do we really allow trash guys in this dorm” and “no one wants you here, leave” in the hall audibly so that he could hear it. Everyone in the suite could hear me, but it was obviously directed to one person. Him and his friend left, and it’s likely due to what I said. \n\nWhile I know I was INCREDIBLY immature, I don’t really regret my actions because I think he’s a piece of shit who doesn’t consider the feelings of others, so why should I consider his feelings? To cheat on multiple women and stick around at this school just to sleep with girls and be dishonest is gross. But, obviously I’m biased. \n\nI was wondering reddit’s opinion just out of curiosity. \n\ntl;dr: Guy cheated on my friend in her car and every girl he‘s dated since then. My friend is seeing him again, and I shouted about trash guys loud enough for him to hear, and so he definitely knew it was him. AITA? ",

When I go upstairs she basically just calls me an asshole and leaves. She told me to stay there because she didn’t want to see me but I went home with her to try and smooth things out. She is livid and won’t talk to me, because she was worried for my well-being and took it upon herself to look for me. I totally get that she would be annoyed I forgot to text her, and I understand it’s because she cares about my well-being, but I feel like she overreacted. I’ve been largely independent for a while now and I would’ve thought she could have just assumed I fell asleep and talked to me in the morning.

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nI(20M) met my current girlfriend(19F) in high school. She is very smart, funny, nice, and beautiful. I felt very lucky that she showed interest in me and even eventually agreed to go out with me. Early into our relationship, guys were warning me around school not to get involved with her because apparently she had a reputation of being a tease. I never heard anything about it and I liked her too much to listen to that stuff.  After 3ish months together and doing nothing beyond light kissing, I started to wonder if maybe the rumors were true. I asked her about it and she told me that she has that reputation because she comes from a religious background and doesn’t want to have sex before marriage. Guys always broke up with her when she refused to sleep with them and that’s why she never told me. I admit I was disappointed, but I didn’t care enough to stop going out with her. She was perfect in every other way and honestly she still is.\n\nOver time though I started to notice that she isn’t that religious at all. I have no problem with that but I was frustrated that she was only religious in this one spot of her life. After 2 years together, I asked her about it. She told me that she does in fact want to have sex with me but after being raised with this mindset, it’s hard for her to shake it. She asked me to give her some time and she will be ready. Well, after about 2 years and 7 months together, she was finally ready. We started a sexual relationship. It sadly wasn’t at all like I’d been dreaming it would be. She was very timid in bed. She was only willing to do certain positions and most of the time it seemed more like a chore for her than something she wanted, even if she had been the one who initiated it. I’m not violent but I personally enjoy being a bit more aggressive in bed and she does not respond well to that at all. It started to believe that she is not attracted to me and this put a strain on our relationship.\n\nNow we have been together 3 years and 3 months. She started attending therapy for her depression a few months ago which I fully supported, but something came out that I was not expecting. She sat me down and told me that in therapy she had been discussing previous sexual abuse she experienced. It was brutal stuff. I won’t go into detail out of respect but family members had raped her for years of her childhood. She explained that this is the reason for her holdups in bed, and she used religion as an excuse in our relationship because she didn’t want to tell me she had been abused (she’s never told anyone before, I’m the only person besides her therapist who knows) but she also didn’t want to have sex because it gives her PTSD. She cried as she told me about some of the sick stuff she went through, and promised to work on it so that our relationship will be stronger.. I felt a lot of emotions, mostly heartbreak.\n\nIt’s been about 2 weeks since the truth came out. I want to be there for her but I can’t help but look at her differently. I keep thinking about how much she lied to me over the years to keep this secret, and I don’t want to be angry about it but I sort of am. She has opened up to me a lot and I listen, but most of the time I don’t want to. I hate how what they did to her. I don’t want to hear about it, I miss how it was when I didn’t know. I hate admitting this but I wish she never told me. I don’t know how to respond to this, and I certainly don’t know how I’m supposed to help her. I don’t want to have sex with her anymore because I don’t want her to think of them while she’s with me. I’m afraid that she will bring it up when we are together. I feel bad because I’m the only one she can talk to about this besides her therapist also I recognize how much she must trust me to tell me this, I don’t think I’m the right guy to be with someone so damaged. When I thought she was just religious, I could get over that but now I realize that even if we are married one day, this will be a lifelong battle for her. And for me, as her partner. \n\nShe sensed my discomfort and asked me if it bothers me when she talks about it. I told her the truth, yes it does. She started crying and apologizing and I immediately felt guilty and told her I didn’t mean it. Since then she hasn’t brought it up again, she’s very quiet now. I regret saying anything.\n\n Some part of me wants to run, I just would hate to lose someone so amazing. She really is the most amazing girl, I cannot say that enough. I know this abuse was not her fault at all. I’m wondering if this is a normal initial response from a S/O of sexual abuse or if I really am just an asshole. If it’s a normal response, I will stick it out longer and see how it goes. If I’m just an asshole who is going to keep feeling this way, I think I should break up with her. I still love her so much. If I break up with her now I’m also scared she will know that this is why and be scarred from opening up about it again forever. \n\nWIBTA to leave her? WIBTA to stay? Idk. ",

We moved to Texas \n\nI was completely devastated that my father broke the promise that he told me and that I was moving away from the one place I always looked back at and called home,When we got to Texas I fell into a major depression of everyday mental breakdowns where I would just laugh and cry by myself, cutting  and constant contemplation of you know, it wasn't good.\n\nBut then it changed, on the last year of middle school I found my first real friends and started getting more and more happy with myself,  fast forward three to four years im a soon to be Junior in highschool who is relatively popular,  I have a girlfriend and really close friends who I see as basically brothers. I was now finally promised by my Father that this would be our last home until I graduated \n\nMy parents faired far less, my father is not happy here and has had multiple and major anxiety issues, he is not in a job that he completely likes and is not in a totally great state of mind.  His problems pale in compare to my mothers,  \n\nMy mother left her only couple of friends in Sweden when she moved to the US, and then left her only friends in Florida to come here, she has no friends, no job, and gotten into a carwreck caused by my old classmate and now has a permanent damage in her neck, she constantly rants to me about how Texas is her hell and that it'll never be home to her, its gotten so bad that shes also admitted to me, her son that shes been contemplating divorce just so she can leave to Florida.\n\nThis is the first time I have felt real happiness in my life, the constant moving was hell to me and my parents now are threatening moving back to Florida cause they really don't like it here and claim that I am the sole reason they are staying and how I don't care how they are feeling, and in truth I really don't \n\nThey made constant hell for me moving me around place to place and I have FINALLY found a place I can call my home, I made up my mind that if we move to Florida again, that I would move immediately back when I turn eighteen and would also make this choice a mental hell for my parents  There is no way that I can say through text how much Texas means to me, it means more to me than my parents do, and after this giant essay, AITA for it?

      "description": "We have two dachshunds. Our house is very tiny, and our dogs are super annoying because they were never socialized and they never go outside unless it’s to pee. (I know. It’s awful, but I don’t live here full time.) I try to take them out and they’re either too anxious or one of them is now a senior and can’t walk too well. \n\nMy mom is currently throwing my niece a birthday party. She put both of the dogs in my bedroom. The whole party, everyone could hear them whining and barking. Then i realized how cruel that is. One of my dogs has an anxiety disorder (both come from not great homes) and I didn’t realize her whining and barking was from her being scared, not just her being annoying. I have been sitting in my room with my dogs for an hour now, and I finally got them to calm down. They went from nonstop barking and whining and running around to laying on the bed with me quietly. Every now and then someone will make a loud noise or my mom will speak and my dog with the anxiety disorder will get riled up. \n\nI feel like this is so unfair to the dogs. Someone would happily watch the dogs for 4/5 hours for probably $40, which isn’t unreasonable for her. It would make the party a lot more enjoyable because the dogs wouldn’t be barking, and my dogs wouldn’t be alone and scared by themselves, and I wouldn’t feel obligated to miss out on the party to make them feel better and calm down. \n\nMaybe I’m overreacting. I don’t think my mom would take this criticism well and she would blame the dogs for being annoying and say it isn’t her problem. ",

      "description": "First things first, this might be a little hard to read, since english is not my mother language\n\nI'm at my 1st year in university, and our class decided to create a whatsapp group to interact, get to know each other and talk about subjects that we all study\nSometimes, some off-topic comments are brought into the group, and I ussualy don't care about it, but this one got me right in the feelings\nThis guy sent an image that said \"killing yourself is for weak people. Strong men marry and die slowly each day\". The thing is, recently an aunt of mine commited it, and I am still very sensitive about it when it's brought by a stranger.\nI calmly send a text that said \"this group has 25 different people, with 25 different life stories. Please don't joke about something so serious as this\" and went off for a couple minutes.\nWhen I checked the group again they said that it was just a joke, and \"you shouldn't be offended by everything\" \"watch out for this kind of things in your daily basis, you might get offended\". I wasn't offended until this moment, I was just sad and send the text in case someone was going throught the same I am, but the fact that they said I was offended made me offended.\nI said it's ok to joke about it in a group where you know everyone well, but not in one that you barely know someone, and then mentioned the fact that made me sad in the first place. He responded with \"well you didn't said that in class\" as the fault was mine.\nI thought it was completely disrespectful of him to say this, so I returned to the 'joke' and responded \"well, if you think is that hard to be with a woman, go find yourself a man\" which is disrespectful if you consider the \"conservative person\" fact\nUntil this point I totally thought I was absolutelly right, but then this 3d person entered the conversation and said: \"we shouldn't post everything in this group and we also shouldn't polemize everything. Let's keep it cool.\"\nWhen I read it, I immediately thought if I overreacted about it, that I should've not continued after the 1st text or even just ignored the message and pretended it never happend\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTl;dr: someone send a killing yourself-sexist joke and I said it was unaproprit. It escalated",

      "description": "This is more of just a sanity check, and I hope to god it is so ridiculous that is sounds like a shitpost.\n\nAnd a short backstory on us. We were high school sweethearts that got married at 18 and are 48 now.\n\nLast weekend I was out of town on a business trip and her work decided they wanted to throw their Christmas party early this year and had it that same weekend. I was a little bummed that I missed it because they are usually really fun and I like a lot of the people she works with, but no big deal.\n\nTurns out my wife gets drunk at hooks up with one of the guys AT THE PARTY. Nobody caught them red handed but people noticed them being flirtatious and that they disappeared for a time. It was weird enough that I ended up getting a text from one of her coworkers warning me that something might be up and explaining the story.\n\nSo when I get back from my trip Monday evening I confront her about it and she admits to cheating. I tell her I will meet with an attorney this week to get the divorce filing started and I leave. She follows me crying saying that she is sorry and it was a mistake and so on but I still just walk away. I don't want to lose my cool or say anything I will regret so I leave without saying a word. \n\nYesterday she ended up calling my friends and family, whoever she could get a hold of and tries to guilt trip them into taking her side (that I should leave her), and some how it seems to be fucking working.\n\nMost (not all but still more than half) are actually siding with her. Telling me that I should throw away a good marriage over 1 mistake and that I should work towards forgiving her. And that I need to think about our kids, ect.\n\nI am sorry but cheating is not \"a mistake\". You don't accidentally fall on someone elses dick. It is a conscious decision to betray the person you claim to love and destroy all trust.\n\nOur kids are 26 and 24 established adults, they can handle their parents getting divorced.\n\nSo am I really the asshole for leaving my wife?",

I’m a lifeguard and this specific coworker relieves me when my shift is over. At the end of my boss’ text to me it said “can you help her in her time of need”. My boss is known for undermining most of the lifeguards and kind of putting us down. \n    AITA because I don’t want to take this shift because I feel like my boss is guilting me into taking the shift. I feel like if I say no that I’ll be looked at as a lesser person. Obviously I’m sympathetic towards my coworker in her time of morning, but I have to get up early to go to school, then go straight to work after and I really don’t want to have to stay at work until 9 because it’s been a long tiring day?",

      "description": "I am in a bit of a messy, undefined relationship with a person I deeply love. We've never been in an exclusive relationship, and since the beginning I told him I wasn't ready to be monogamous. He has always made it clear that is what he wants. We have been trying to make the open relationship work, but it is a strain on both of us. I have tried hard to respect his need to be monogamous while still being honest about my need to not be, and have told him that, while I love him and want to be with him, I'm can't sacrifice my mental/emotional wellbeing by ignoring what I need because it won't be good for either of us in the long run. And that if this doesn't work for him, he needs to make that decision and end the relationship. \n\nI have broken up with him a few times, always with us getting back together in a few days. I have felt like I need to be the one to end it because I am the one who is causing the strain, even though it kills me everytime. But then we'll start taking and get back together again. \n\nRecently, he broke up with me and we stayed that way for about two months, during which I did not contact him. I felt like if I were the one to contact him, I'd be dragging him back into a relationship situation he didn't want. I was miserable and missed him so much, but the guilt of knowing he was hurt by the situation kept me from talking to him. But then he reached out to me, and asked to come over, and we decided to give it another shot. He said anything is better than nothing.\n\nI love him so much, but that doesn't change my need to have an open relationship, because I will fall into a pattern of self destruction I've been down before and barely survived.

      "title": "AITA That I give more effort and attention to my girlfriend &amp; Job than my Mom?",
      "description": "I'm 21 and recently got my first girlfriend a couple weeks ago. I also started doing online freelancing work earlier this year teaching myself video editing from scratch and marketing myself. I feel like my life is coming together and I'm working hard at my job to improve, and also treating my girlfriend very special mainly by texting her while I work during the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get to the point, I bought my girlfriend her favorite perfume for her birthday, got it in a nice box made it nice and everything and my Mom is upset that I got my girlfriend such a nice gift for her birthday, but nothing for my Mom's birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor more context, I was medically discharged from the Navy and now I live with my parents and have no \"real\" job. My freelance business has only recently started getting success which means I didn't have any money to spend when it was my Mom's birthday earlier this year. My sister and I got together and made a hand made gift and treated her special, cooked dinner, and took over the house duties. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra context, I'm autistic and people skills are not my specialty at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many other details on my work life, and other problems, but I'm aware this isn't the place for a life story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not just this one event though, this seems to have been the tipping point and my Mom has been building up anger for a while now. Another major thing that my Mom is upset about is the fact that I'm not putting in effort in learning her mother language, Armenian. Armenian is a very unpopular language and there are no online resources to help me learn unless I pay hundreds either for a personal teacher or a local college class. My Mom speaks it, but is a terrible teacher. She tells me and my sister to dedicate 30 minutes a day to learning it and then come back to her on what we learned, but what are we supposed to learn when there's no resources? We just awkwardly learn the alphabet and google translate to learn then get yelled at for not putting in enough effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I have recently started to learn Dutch because my girlfriend is from Belgium and I want to talk to her family who hardly speaks English. Dutch is super easy in comparison to Armenian mainly because there's a free app for it, most of the words are similar to English, and it's fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's the conflict. My Mom went on a rant this morning telling me how my girlfriend is fake because we originally met online and I'm spending more time &amp; effort on my girlfriend and my job rather than her, and ends up calling me an asshole who doesn't respect their parents. She has now told me to read self-help books (the kind that's titled \"3 steps to sucess\"), and also telling me I'm immature. I denied all of this and my Dad also supports my Mom telling me that they are only trying to help and want the best for me.",

      "description": "Hi guys. I’m really conflicted here and could use your advice. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together since July 2017, and are a great couple. He has a friend group from college, one of whom (Harry) has a girlfriend Alice that he has been with since early 2017. \n\nIn November 2017, he went for a meal with his girlfriend Alice, her best friend Francesca, and another friend. This was before Harry and Alice lived together. After the meal, Alice went back to her house, and Harry got an uber with Francesca. Francesca invited him into her house for a drink, they had sex, and he stayed over. \n\nHarry told my boyfriend about this, who told me. I was completely torn up at the time, and still am (although it’s recently reared its head again, which I will come on to). Harry and Alice were due to move in together 3 weeks later in December 2017. At the time I had the same dilemma (should I anonymously tell her) but if she had found out, she would have lost her boyfriend/best friend/house at the same time. I decided to take no action as she’s not my friend/it’s not my place. Harry or Francesca never told Alice. \n\nFast forward to early 2019. I just heard Harry and Alice are planning to buy a house together, a massive financial commitment which will tie them together forever and be very expensive to get out of. These feelings have come back and I don’t know what to do. \n\nThe emotional part of me says that I should make a fake email account and tell her anonymously. She deserves to know everything so that she can make an educated decision before she enters this financial commitment of buying (so much harder and more expensive to separate than renting). \n\nThe logical part says I should leave it, it’s not my place, I am not her friend, ignorance is bliss in her case, and it would harm my current relationship (my boyfriend would be furious if he found out I’d told her, or I’d have to keep this huge secret from him, something I’m not going to do). There are other people who could tell her and have chosen not to (other friends know as Harry told them).\n\nI should stay out of it, right?\n\nThanks for reading \n",

      "description": "I was texting my friend and mentioned something about his girlfriend. He replied they had broken up, but in a joke way. I apologized for not knowing, or else i wouldn’t have brought it up. I got no response so i made a joke, as his breakup response was in a joke way and tried to change the subject. I figured he didn’t want to talk about it, while good friends, he would have never really talked about personal things like that to me. \n\nI get a response telling me how horrible i am for already knowing about the breakup, pretending not to know, bringing it up purposefully to talk about it and being extremely insensitive. I was shocked. I know his gf quite well and see some of her friends often, so he assumed i already knew, but i didn’t, i didn’t even know when/why they broke up. \n\nHe refused to believe i didn’t know, i tried to explain that i didn’t and i apologized profusely about misreading the situation, as i assumed he didn’t want to talk. I didn’t meant to brush it off, i felt like i was crossing a boundary if i asked about it when he didn’t reply originally. Eventually he said it was fine, but probably still thinks i knew. We talked a few days later, i initiated, but not much substance.\n\nRecently I was at Christmas drinks organized by a friend and his ex was there. I thought nothing of it as there were a quite a few of us there and the couple had a lot of good mutual friends so i was always going to see his ex at some point. Me and the ex-gf very briefly talked about the breakup, basically just agreed we would still be friends as we had actually been friends for longer and a bit unfair to split friendships. \n\nThe next day, my friend berated me for being there, although he knew his ex-gf was going these Christmas drinks it was organized ages in advance. Someone had told him I cancelled plans and went out of my way to be there that night, which was a lie and was not said to him. I tried to explain someone organized drinks with people who happened to be around that time that we don’t see often, as people like his ex-gf were over for Christmas markets, so it was an opportunity to see everyone. But every problem he had and i explained reasonably, he just found another problem/argument, and I’d explain and he’d pick on something else til he had nothing else to argue about. I apologized many times if my actions came across as malicious, but i was just seeing old friends, and his ex-gf happened to be one. \n\nHe would have always been a bit picky towards me and i feel like an escape goat for the pain of his breakup. I know it’s hard, but i feel like he wants someone to be angry at. I said I had a lot of personal shit going on and apologized if i had dealt with it incorrectly, he told me that me having my own issues didn’t help him. I understand i could have handled the breakup news better, but i apologized sincerely. He actually did tell a mutual friend he thought he was too harsh on me after accusing me of knowing about the breakup, but never apologized to me, and instead got mad at me because I had already told that friend about it as i was upset about the situation. \n\nHave i been an asshole?

She's supportive, caring, affectionate, pretty much everything I'd want in a girlfriend. \n\nWe were having a discussion about her future with her company and it might have her relocate her job to an area that's around 1 1/2 hrs commute from me which is pretty far if she takes the job. She currently lives ~ 20 minutes away and we've had a little bumpy but eventually straightened relationship. I told her that there are a lot of things she could do such as her relocate to a place that's not so far from her, etc. but one of the things I mentioned is that long distance might not be the best thing for us. I really do like her and I want to stay grounded here but I know I come across as blunt sometimes and I don't know if this is something that I should have brought up.\n\nShe thought I was joking but I was serious, since we're only less than 5 months into the relationship. She got immediately upset and mad and said that \"I don't love her enough to consider a LDR\" and \"How could I even say something like that\". I went to end the conversation by saying \"I love you\" and she responded with \"Apparently not\". \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here? Is there something I'm missing",

We've all started college at this point and all go to the same college. They used to fight physically when they were in junior high but probably since freshman year she's been physically and verbally abusing him. Now I'm not saying all of it is unprovoked but (in my eyes) she's a psycho. I was supposed to hang out with him the other day but I ended up being way late on schoolwork and had to cancel (fuck finals) and she needed to get a hold of him. He wasn't responding and she knew we had planned to hang out so she messaged me to ask him to call her. (Super passive aggressively I might add) I told her that i didn't end up hanging out with him and she called me a liar. So being the reasonable person that I am I sent the texts between my friend and i with a super passive aggressive message back. She doesn't like it and we ended up fighting back and forth for probably a week or 2 before she told me he constantly abuses her sexually. I told her that I didn't believe her and that she was just trying to ruin our relationship. How am I supposed to, she is abusive to my friend and manipulates everyone she talks to. \n\nTldr my friends girlfriend is a manipulative bitch that will do anything to ruin our friendship",

      "description": "My girlfriend recently got an awesome promotion for work and moved away to a different city. Until she finds her own place, she is staying with one of her good friends(who is gay) that lives in that city. His place is a 1 bedroom apartment and instead of sleeping on the couch, she sleeps in his bed with him. She told me the other day that she cuddles with him at night. I didn't make a big deal of it when she told this to me, but I did notice that it kind of upset me a little and told her how I felt. She told me I was overreacting and that it is not a big deal. I just want to know from an outsiders point of view if I should shrug this off or not. Thanks",

      "title": "AITA for having my partner over 2-3 times a week?",
      "description": " So for the past year and a half I've lived with 2 other roommates with generally little to no issue. Roommate A is somewhat controlling and a neat freak which has been fine, I have no issues with cleaning a bit more than I might on my own. There is also a \"place\" for everything that is largely decided by roommate A.  This is all fine. I don't complain about anything and consider myself pretty easy to get along with.    \n\n\n  \nThe issues started arising a month ago. Roommate A expresses that my partner is over too much and she doesnt like it. (for an example, my partner is generally over 2 nights, and sometimes 3. Usually one weekday night and Friday night- Saturday night.)  Her complaint was that my partner was in the house when I wasn't. This is only when I need to leave for work and it's about an hour of my partner sleeping in my bed before they need to leave. My partner doesn't shower at my place or take up more than a couple minutes in the common areas. We cook meals together and maybe spend 30 minutes eating it in the living room. We always clean and do any dishes in the kitchen.    \n\n\n  \nAnyways, despite me thinking it was ridiculous, I asked my partner to get up at the same time as me and leave around the same time.  fast forward to yesterday, my roommate texts me that \"we need to talk about X being here so often\" which I reply that I apologize and understand that it's annoying when someone has their gf/bf over all the time. I can try and be less intrusive/wake up earlier so that you don't see us in the morning. (other than that we are generally confined to my room)  she replies that it's unacceptable and that partners are to be over no more than 2 nights a week and that she's \"done being nice about it\".    \n\n\nMind you, she also had her parents living on our couch for 2 weeks during the holidays. My common areas were all but unusable during this time.  I have no problem chipping in extra for utilities ect. I have no problem establishing quiet hours or morning routines that are less intrusive. I don't know how we could possibly be less intrusive on the weekends as we are either just cooking, out of the house, or in my room, things I would be doing myself anyway. We're also moving out to our own place in less than 4 months.  \n\n  \n\n\nAll of these things were met with hard no's and it ended up with me blowing up a bit. I essentially told her we pay the same rent and she's not the arbiter of how I get to spend my time. She half assedly threatened that the next couple months would be sucky for both of us. I said the conversation wasn't going anywhere and to lodge any complaints with the landlord.    \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I've been friends with this girl since highschool, we even messed around a few times, simply put we've been close  for a long time. Let's call her Jane. She studies abroad and she came home for the holidays, we agreed to met up at a local pub, at that point I haven't seen her for about half a year.\n\nWhen she came to the pub I was already a bit buzzed from drinking with some other friends for a few hours, I should point out that I've had a very stressful day, but I won't get into it because I feel it doesn't really matter and the people involved had no way of knowing.\n\nJane came with her best friend and her sister, both of whom I knew, but also another friend and her sister's bf which I was seeing for the first time. Now i've heard lots of talk about Jane's sister and how she's bitchy and controlling, but I never really got to know her because she only hung out with us a couple of times. I was really happy when I saw Jane and rushed to hug her, we start talking and after a short while her sister drags her over somewhere outside the bar, to talk to someone I didn't know, her best friend and her sister's boyfriend came with. I was annoyed with this but I decided to let it go and pay it no mind. \n\nI introduced myself and started talking to this girl they brought with them, let's call her Amanda, and apparently she was left behind same as me. Amanda was really interesting so I lost track of time talking to her, but after a good while Jane comes and starts whispering in my ear. She tells me to stop talking to Amanda because her sister hasn't seen her in a while and wants to talk to her. For whatever reason that really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nAmanda was sitting alone at a table with me, nothing stppped Jane's sister from talking with her, instead she sends Jane to get me to leave. I'll admit I got a bit pissed off and I started pressing her, asking her why doesn't her sister just come talk to Amanda. Jane refused to give  an answer and just continued asking me to stop talking with this girl. I told her she's immature and kept talking with Amanda, and Jane left, frustrated. After a short while, her sister comes to me calling me an asshole for apparently making Jane cry. I explained my side to her but she wouldn't hear it, demanding I go apologise. She said Jane did was she was asked to and that I should mind my own business and live her friends(talking about Amanda) alone. Now at this point I just ignored her and kept talking to Amanda, who strangely enough also ignored her, making me question what the fuck was going on between those girls. Jane's sister kept swearing at me but the music really helped me ignore her. Then her bf grabs my shoulder aggressively and demands I listen to her, I politely tell him to get his hand off me and when he refused I got up and shoved him into a wall, luckily we were quickly broken up by the bouncer. I talked to the guy and told him I respected him standing up for his gf, we drank together a short while and all was well. Amanda left soon after what happened.\n\nLater I talked to Jane and her best friend and both kept saying I should apologise to Jane and her sister and that I acted like a dick, I shouldn't drink so much etc. I admited I may have over reacted but to this day I refuse to apologise because sober or drunk I do think Jane acted like a fucking child doing big sister's bidding. We're all adults why can't we communicate like adults instead of playing those stupid games? Regardless to say we haven't been talking so much since and I can't help but wonder if I was maybe in the wrong.",

I’m a pretty understanding and sympathetic guy, but I’m finding myself getting wound up and having to bite my tongue constantly in order to not lose my cool.\n\nDespite my own situation, I’m still happy to help people and listen and give advice. But this girl complains about the same things constantly. I give advice, she rejects it, I tell her I don’t really feel comfortable talking about it, she gets annoyed. I’ve just now told her that “I’ve got my own issues, you have friends living with you who you’re very close with, they’ll be better listeners than me. I’m more than happy to help but you turn down every advice I offer. I don’t see what you want me to do. I’m so sick of repeating myself.”\n\nBear in mind, I’ve not asked her for any support myself, nor has she really offered any. This other girl who I’m extremely close with gives me support and I return it. I don’t get at all frustrated with her because at least she will consider the things I say.\n\nI fully understand not everyone is the same, but there’s a limit to how long someone can feel sorry for themselves.\n\nAITA for responding how I have, or feeling how I do?",

      "description": "(On mobile and I cannot spell)\nFor some context I'm 18 doing full time college, dog sitting, and trying to get a second job for more pay. Usually I take one art class per quarter in college and this time it's a figure drawing class which has homework sketches that can take up to 5 hours to finish. I also started to make a new webtoon comic on top of all that. I got over 15 pets of my own to take care of too so i am super busy most days and any free time I have I want to spend it on myself.\nSo, usually I make painting sketches you name it for relatives because  I Used  enjoyed them and liked seeing them happy. They're old people in Ohio with nothing else to do except bug their grandkids :). Anyways lately more and more people have been asking me to make them paintings (some not relatives too) and my mom has decided to promise all of them that I will make them whatever they want. Before this was no problem but as I said I'm starting to get busy. The supplies are exspensive to buy too. Now as much as I like art i have a certain thing about making it for other people. I hate it. I cant make what I want, I dont get to keep it, and they're this pressure to make it as best as it could be. I like to draw for myself and it makes me happy.  These paintings also can range from book sized to me sized too.\nMy family has this idea too that birds are my best thing I make but I havent enjoyed painting birds since middle school (when I was obsessed with it). Its boring now and I am starting to get mad at these art requests people are giving me. I told my mom I didnt want to do these anymore or at least  not for free and she said I was being rude because it's easy for me to make them art. Sure I can make a painting in a day but it wont be that good, I'll hate it they'll love it should be no problem. Dont give me shit about me \"bragging about being good either\" I'm not the best I'm not saying I'm the best I'm just saying that people want to me make them free shit and I dont want to anymore because I'm not a little kid who doesnt need the money anymore.\nSo am i the asshole for wanting to either turn down or request pay from family for me to make them art?\n",

      "description": "My FIL passed on Easter weekend. MIL has trouble moving past it, and still mentioned him on a daily basis. She is also kind of dramatic and immature, and used her loneliness and grief to guilt people doing stuff for her (possibly subconsciously, but I can't be sure). She had not always been kind to me over the years and I have tried to shrug off the passive-aggressive comments towards me and my family, but due to me now having my own kids and a mild postpartum depression, I have started setting boundaries to protect my own sanity. This is not going well with the family but nothing has blown up yet.\n\nI am generally an empathetic person and I understand grief never ends, but I don't want certain weekends to be defined by a tragedy forever. Especially when sometimes it feels like certain dates are used as reasons to make us visit. I want to plan fun things with my kids like Easter egg hunts, but I also want to be sensitive to the situation. It's only been a couple of years - my question is, WIBTA if I planned fun activities on Easter weekend this year? Will there be a time (e.g. few years later) that it ever becomes appropriate?  I understand Easter falls on different weekends each year, but it had been remembered that he passed on Easter weekend and arguing it's a different date may sound even more insensitive?",

      "description": "This is my first actual reddit post(other than asking the name of a weird orange fluffy ball that I brought because it looked cute)\nI am also on mobile so this may not be the best post\n\nMe(M16)\nGf(F16) Named E\n\n\nOkay my family isn't the most fit or skinny, but me and my brother aren't obese by any definition of the word, but my mum is, she constantly projects the insecurities about her weight onto me and my brother, she constantly decides that we should start eating healthier, which I have already decoded to do months earlier, she talks about how I've gained weight.\n\nNow one thing that should be pointed out, I've seen quite a few doctors and been passed around between organisations, all of the ones I've seen within the past few years all agree that I have some sort of depression and anxiety. I've struggled with this and before seeing the doctors I tried to convince myself I was fine and other things happened after which aren't relivant so I don't feel comfortable going into it.\n\nNote that my mum is nutorious for lashing out and throwing tantrums, hitting things, slamming doors, and all of those beautiful things, she has never hit us but both me and my twin, 6ft 16 year olds still flinch from her screaming and slamming doors, mostly because my stepmum used to hit and hurt me constantly verbally and physically abuse me(this physical was only when it got really bad) screaming at me, calling me worthless pinning me against a wall with my hands behind my back, trying to push me down marble stairs, the list could go on. My mum knows all of this but still doesn't hesitate to do any of this. \n\nRecently she has gotten better at not doing this(other than a tantrum in the car of her hitting the steering wheel screaming and pulling over the car) but when something happens she tends to hold thta against us that she hasn't acted outrageous recently so we should do this for her or we should realise we are in the wrong which I already have trouble with. \n\nShe knows about the depression and anxiety, in fact she has depression herself aswell but still treats me as if I know nothing about it.\n\nShe constantly points out my flaws, mainly focusing on my weight and commenting how I should \"go to the gym more often\" and \" stop eating so much crap\" it's gotten to the point I struggle to have a conversation with her without her bringing it up.\n\nAbout a month before chrismas I try to explain to her how this is hurting me and I am struggling to handle my self worth already and she's making it worse, she then says that it's okay she'll stop. Next day in the car to school, \"I know I promised not ot talk about your weight but have you thought about going to the gym with E\". I then go into explain about how \"E doesn't really have much time for the gym right now because of problems with family(which are extremely serious)\"\n\nThe comments don't stop, and it reaches a point where I don't feel comfortable with her alone or in a position I can't not talk to her in so normally I have headphones in and am in my room or on my laptop. In the car she lectures me and weight and how I'm always alone and never downstairs, always in my room and how she thinks my depression is getting worse, she says all this while shouting at me (great way to make someone's depression better). I put up with it because anxiety I physically can't find the words to express myself in that moment.\n\nMy mum pulled me into her room a week ago and said both of us need to start being healthy because my twin is doing incredibly good at it. One day ago were all frustrated in the car and she gets us chocolate, small bars. I look in the bag and she goes to stop me, I tlel her to chill I'm just getting our chocolate out, I look in and there is so much shit in there. She gives the excuse its for her students in her class because they've been good.\n\nLater that evening I walk into her room nick her charger for an hour because she was out and I find all of the chocolate wrappers and shit drawn out across her bed. This fucking infuriates me but I eventually calm down and let it pass because she was probably just frustrated at school today.\n\nNow onto the the main part\n\nE and my sister were both coming over to my house about 3 days after chrismas to eat dinner with us, the day goes past, my sister making fun of me, making me feel crappy and all that shit but I can get past that. My mum volenteers to take E home as her parents do the same for me alot.\n\nMy mum knows E deals with a lot of the same shit as me, even worse because of some other situations and stuff but still does thing. My mum knows that E is afraid of her and is afraid of not being liked by her. \n\nNow until today I didn't know anything about the conversation that happened in the car. And thanks to it being about a month's ago not all details were remembered but if I find out the whole convo I'll edit and post it here.\n\nMy mum spends the trying trying to convince E to bring me to the gym and make me eat better foods, when she tells her it's my life and keeps going after told she can't because I'm my own person, trying to pressure her to do it, I was told later on by my gf that she was afraid of her in this situation as if she'd be angry at E.\n\nI am really struggling with this, because my mother who I'm already struggling to trust after the repeated tantrums and things like that(also an incident where she probably looked into my diary my doctor said I should write) repeatedly points out my flaws and says I need more excersise and that I'm getting to big and all that shit and then she goes behind my back and tries to pressure my socially anxious E to then pressure me into doing what she wants.\n\nIve also tried explaining to her that I have been eating healthy and excersing but she seems to relentlessly mirroring her flaws onto me.\n\nI want to confront her about what she did to E, because I can put up with it if it's me but there is no need to bring E into this, and I'm especially angry because she played on E's fear of her and not being liked by her to get what she wants from E. \n\nE doesn't want me to because she's afraid that it will make her hate E. But I feel like this has to stop and I know if I don't confront her she will most likely do something similar again. I also have extreme problems with my mum breaking my trust again and going behind my back. \n\nSummary- Mum decides let's eat healthy, doesn't, does this repeatedly, shouts at me for it, shouts at me for my depression getting worse because she's making me self conscious, tries to pressure my gf into pressuring me to do what she wants.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I confronted my mum about it even though E is scared for me to?",

      "description": "So I think I may be getting a ESH, but I think I just wanted a rant and see that normally people make really good suggestions on how to move something forward.\n\nSo I live with my husband and little brother (brother since last October Long story) husband is 29 and brother is 28. I have lived with my husband for 6 years and I have to kick him up the ass quite a lot about being lazy around the house and basically making me his bloody mother. But since my brother moved in I know feel like I have two children, I had a bit of a melt down new year about the mess and feeling like they were taking the mick and it got better. I still do all of the cooking, sort bills and make sure there is food and everything runs but they have at least started to put clothes in and out and wash dishes still got to push them but been better.\n\nLittle brother has been trying hard to help out, husband past few weeks since we book a holiday (sept Dubai) has basically just been super lazy. Watched me de icing my car (have a bad back) and walked past, and few other little things. Went to the gym Monday night (aqua fit) great for my back from work. Messaged him during the day and said can you do tea gave him instructions and said I’d be back at 7pm, gets in at 5 past. Brother is upstairs playing x box and husband sat watching Gotham…. He comes in and says he’ll quickly boil some pasta and put tinned tomatoes on it so its not dry.\n\nI walk into the kitchen nothing oven is on and he jumps up and starts going on like Mr Bean as he doesn’t when he’s being shit.. I was just erm I was waiting for the oven to warm up and I am just looking at him. I have a go at him and say to him its just shit. I said last night I am just not sure I want to bother doing any thing for his birthday as were booked to go away for his birthday for 4 nights with friends. I have arranged a meal with friends and a surprise overnight in a posh manor. Because I feel like I am going out of my way to be nice and he just half arses everything. He is generally a good persona do will do things if asked but honestly valentines I got a bracelet that didn’t fit. Nothing for my 30th, the list goes on he is just generally crap at this stuff. Starting to feel like really punishing him is the only way for him to see that I am not his mum. The birthday debacles go on been together 10 years. Not I am just not speaking much.\n\nTL:DR husband being lazy, even lazier since little brother moved in shall I sack off his 40th to teach him a lesson.",

      "description": "No matter how this ends, it's gonna be awkward because one of the friends is my college roommate. Also, this is my first post so here goes. I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as \"life-giving and sacred,\" then ended it with how bras are \"designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'\" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. \nIt doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month. Am I as inconsiderate as they say I am, or am I just a bad friend? \n",

      "description": "About 1 1/2 years ago my father packed his stuff and moved in with his girlfriend without saying anything to me (21m). Since then my parents have been going through a messy divorce. I’ll meet with my father for lunch/dinner around once a week or so. He is still supportive of me and pays for half of my college tuition. He was cheating on my mother (an angel) for years with various women. He has a narcissistic personality and seeks constant validation from anyone and everything—he needs to be the greatest, and generally holds it over my head that I would be unable to pursue an education without his help, but this is besides the point. \n\nNow I still enjoy getting together, staying in contact etc., but he is extremely hurt that I have no desire to meet his GF who I see as a homewrecker. It should be mentioned he has actually cheated on her as well and got some other lady pregnant (or at least thought he did, now he’s not sure if it’s his but I suspect he just doesn’t want to pay child support). His main GF and him are still together despite her knowing about this but it just goes to show how meaningless most relationships seem to him and therefore I don’t see the point in meeting this woman. I’d feel incredibly awkward and probably dislike her even if she’s a fine person just because of the fact that it’s such a weird situation for me. \n\nSo AITA?

On my birthday, only my immediate family remembered and said anything, other than one of my close friends P. Well, come to find out, my fiance had messaged P the night before to remind her.

P doesn't know I know she was reminded, and I didn't really say anything about it to anyone else, though I did express to my brother and my fiance how much it really is bothering me. My mom told me I was being an asshole by talking about it so much and I should move on, that she and my dad never celebrate their birthdays and stuff like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, am I an asshole for being so bothered by this?

      "description": "This happened a while back but it still bugs me to this day, you guys let me know if I'm the asshole.\n\nSo my mother's cleaning lady and I were friends, when I got home from school we would chat a little bit. She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I (25) recently inherited a 4 bedroom house in a the suburbs not to far from the beach near LA. I own the house outright, so no mortgage or anything.  I was very excited about the prospect of getting a little more independence, but at the same time I didn't really want to live alone yet. So, I started looking for a roommate. Being that I don't need to pay a mortgage I thought I could offer a really great deal and get my ideal roommate. Someone who had a similar lifestyle to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago my family found out that my cousin on my moms side, Lupe (27), is pregnant. The dad is not in the picture. She currently lives with her dad in a 2 bedroom apartment about a 45 minute drive from the town where my new house is, which also happens to be the town where her job is. So we (Lupe, her dad, and my other cousin, Maria (32) all went out to lunch a week or so later. The subject of my new house came up and Maria asked me if I was going to have a roommate. I said I was. The conversation then started getting steered towards how it would be so great for Lupe and the baby to live there. The town is safe, there's lots of parks, good school district, its so close to her work, the house has so much space, etc. I felt very put on the spot and just said I was waiting to hear from a few other people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home I thought about it some more and decided I definitely did not want to live with Lupe and a newborn. I'm still pretty young and want to be able to have fun without worrying that there's a baby in the house. I didn't want to have to turn one of my bedrooms into a nursery. I wanted a computer room and a room dedicated to my art projects, not a nursery. I didn't even want to baby proof the house at all. So, in a panic I started messaging all my best friends and family on my dads side to see if anyone wanted to move in with me for $600 a month (which is a pretty great deal around here). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day my cousin Alice (25) on my dads side says she would totally be up for it. I was so happy. We're the same age and spent so much time growing up with each other, Our hobbies and backgrounds are very similar, so, I said great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my moms side of the family found out they started hinting that I was playing favorites with my dads side of the family. Which is kind of true. I spent a lot more time with them then I ever did with my moms side of the family. Basically every holiday I spent with them. We went on trips together. In general I think I'm just more comfortable with them. Which does makes me feel like an asshole. Lupe asked before anyone else about moving in and it would definitely have made her life a lot easier if she lived with me, but I just didn't want to live with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I are living in a major city, about a thousand miles away from where we are both from. We dated back in the day for around 8 months when we both lived in our hometowns and parted ways when our lives weren't going in the same direction. Coincidentally, we both moved to the same city a couple years later and we reconnected and now have been dating here for about a year and a half.\n\nWe've been doing pretty well and we just moved in together, having signed a preliminary 6 month lease. I thought things were going great, he is in graduate school and is working a really awesome job on the side that is exactly what he wants to do, and I'm working full-time and just completed my application for grad school. He's been going through a really hard time recently, as his grandpa who raised him recently just passed two weeks ago. He spent around two weeks in his hometown surrounded by his family and friends before the passing and after, and I joined him for various parts of the process. He's been back for three days now and he just seems really down, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, today he dropped the bomb on me that he wants to be out of the city by June and wants to move back home to be with his family and friends because he says he's miserable here and he hates the city that we live in. He has never given me any indication that he hates this place, in fact all he does is rave about his job and I thought he really liked it here. He says he hates the people here, that he doesn't feel appreciated in his job, and that he has no friends and really wants to be around people that support him. So essentially, in my mind, he's willing to give up an awesome job and quit grad school to move back to a place that he used to complain about non-stop. I feel I should also mention that he does have mild clinical depression and he used to be treated, but is no longer on medication.\n\nThe thing that makes me the most angry is that he says he's been feeling this way since last November, way before I had officially decided whether or not I wanted to go back to grad school, and he knew this. I don't understand why he didn't tell me that he was feeling this way because had he, I might be more open to the idea of moving back home, but as it stands with my commitments, I don't want to go. I'm about to go over to his house to have a discussion with him about this, and I know I'm going to tell him that I don't want to leave. I love him, but I can't tell if he's throwing everything away to move back home, or if I'm throwing everything away with him by refusing to go with.\n\nWIBTA for not wanting to move back home with my boyfriend?",

      "description": "For my summer internship, I needed to go to a different city which meant I had to find a place to live. I was browsing any rooms to rent near the area when I saw a $500 per  month post which I was interested and contacted the person. I was shown the place and everything looked fine. We reached an agreement and rented me his extra room for $500 a month, everything included, for 3 months. From mid May to mid September (this is important)\n\nHowever, right away I realized I hated the place the first day. I live in Texas, which is pretty hot. I was never told that the A/C was to be turned off when we were both out of the apartment, so when we arrive from work the inside was a crisp 85-90 degrees. It was the summer. The A/C took all night to get to a temperature of 75-80 degrees. Sweated every night btw. No big deal, I didn't care. Just put up with it. \n\nHowever, around the second month, I was asked if I can help with electric bill because it was summer and light bill is higher, I was like, \"why not?\" So I said I'll help out. Big mistake. From then on I was requested money to help for light bill. Again, I said why not. Usually $100. No big deal. \n\nMy last week staying there came up, I thought that's it. Nope, more money was  wanted, $150 for those two weeks for the light bill, when I confronted the person, saying that I couldn't even leave the A/C on, suffered every night with sweat, plus, I would leave on weekends to stay with my family, and that I didn't even have a TV in my room so I couldn't have used that much  electricity and that my kindness was being taken advantage of they replied, \"$150, no further discussion\". \n\nI was mad. So I told the person I was paying them my next check because I was broke (college student) and gave the person $70 (all I had). Decided to not pay him after I left. I feel bad, that's not necessarily like me. AITA????",

      "title": "AITA for hoping my invalid grandfather will die soon?",
      "description": "I have a grandfather who was injured about 50 years ago in a work accident. As he grew into his 70s he grew less able to move and take care of himself. At first my grandmother took care of him and he lived in their place, but they couldn't get along, so eventually my mother offered to take him in. I wasn't really happy with it but I don't think I had a say in the matter and anyway it was objectively the correct thing to do. This has been going on for about 3-4 years. I hate him and hope he dies soon. For your reading convenience, here is a list of reasons why:\n\nThings that suck because of him but aren't his fault:\n\n1. My brother and I have to share a bedroom despite us being both teenagers. This is generally a mild inconvenience but one of us has to take turns sleeping on the floor which isn't very comfortable (also this makes masturbating a lot harder)\n\n2. Our college fund is being depleted because of his medical expenses (it's not so bad that it's all gone or anything but enough to be worrying)\n\n3. He sometimes has to wake people at night because of illness and various ailments and we get no sleep\n\nThings that suck partly because of him, but also it's complicated\n\n4. Him being an invalid that needs constant care. This isn't exactly his fault, but he has also refused to do physiotherapy that could help him regain a good deal of mobility and quality of life. If he kept up with physio he would still have some use of his right arm, but now he barely does. And also he would be able to walk with a walker, but now needs people to support him all the time, or a wheelchair. \n\n5. Our house constantly smells like shit and piss. Again, not exactly his fault he has difficulty peeing and passing motion, but if he had kept up with physiotherapy he likely would have more use of his core muscles so it wouldn't be this bad. Also he shouts abuse at his caregivers when they try to give him water to drink so naturally his excretions are painful.\n\n6. He screams very loudly whenever he's taking a shit (I'm sure it hurts but the doctors can't do anything if he doesn't drink more water) and my ears hurt and I hate it.\n\nThings that I'm reasonably sure are mostly his fault:\n\n7. He abuses his caregivers. This includes my mother, his daughter. He uses obscene words (in a different language that basically translate to filthy whore or cunt but sound a lot more personal (it's a bit hard to explain))\n\n8. He injures his caregivers: while he still could walk, he swung at my grandmother (his wife) with a walking stick; he kicks out at whoever is his maid; he also deliberately puts all his weight on you while walking and tries to walk in an odd lurch which puts a lot of strain on whoever is supporting him: my dad got backaches, one of the maid's cesarean scar reopened and got infected somehow, and another one got abdominal pains.\n\n9. He used obscene words on my then 11 year old brother\n\n10. He calls people at night way more than can be reasonably tolerated. Like I get that he's old and sick but we literally bought him a hospital bed so he could sleep better and he sometimes (like once a week at least) wakes everybody up several times a night to tinker with the settings to tilt the bed up and down and then when people have to go to school or work on 5 hours of sleep he naps in the daytime\n\n10a. We learned to live with this as long as he didn't do it too often but while in the month while I was taking my A-level exams he did it nearly every day such that my parents pleaded with him to stop because I needed more than 5 hours of sleep to function during exams and I swear he only did it more to the point where I considered begging the school to let me sleep in school. As a bonus shortly after A-levels were over, he became less noisy. Could be just me being paranoid though.\n\n11. He is really religious and afraid of dying so he wakes people up at night to ask them to pray for his soul and doesn't really see the irony in this. \n\n12. When he's out in public he does everything to make it seem like we abuse him. (we don't. I fantasize about him choking to death but that's about it). There was once we were in this restaurant and he drooled over himself and my mom reached out to wipe his face and he screamed and started tearing up and wailing like she hit him. Also when we bring him to the exercise park, he refuses to do the exercises, starts tearing up and pleads with us to \"have mercy on a poor old man\" and to \"stop bullying this poor old man\" when we literally did nothing but ask him to exercise. \n\nThat should give you a good picture. From a  utilitarian point of view, I think that if he just fucking chokes to death in his sleep, it would greatly increase the overall happiness and decrease the overall suffering in the universe. I recognize that having fantasies about smothering him with a pillow don't really reflect well on me and I'll probably go to hell. So lay it on me, I guess. \n",

      "description": "I’m 24, getting married in March next year, my younger brother is 20. We never got along until recent years, and it’s still a bit rocky due to him being an “ex” drug addict, and now an alcoholic. \n\n6 months ago he totaled his truck, due to reasons unknown to us, he says the brakes were going out and finally quit when he was taking a corner. At the same time, I had gotten a real good deal on a car at the dealership I go to, but I already had a car loan and didn’t really want to take on the extra payments.  I was talking to him about it a few days after his crash, he said he really needed a new car, and offered to take over my payments and I could get the new car. \n\nNow, at this point I DID have enough money to cover both, and I know he isn’t as financially stable or able as I. I considered the deal, and eventually accepted. Under the preface that if he ever got into financial trouble, to let me know before anything, because I could handle paying the payment on both cars for a few months if absolutely necessary.  He told me he was all good, working more than usual, and earning more spending money. \n\nFast forward to last week, my other brother called to ask if I check out original brothers new car yet? Wtf? Call him up, says he ended up getting his girlfriends grandparents to give him a down payment and cosignature on a brand new truck. Ok cool, but whatabout the payments on the car I gave him? \n\nTurns out, according to my original loaners, he hadn’t made a single payment since I gave him the car, and was $1700 in the hole, they were sending it to collections and attempting to repossess it unless I got them $1500 up front. Now, the money isn’t a big deal to me. I put up the money to cover it, and the other brother wants it, but that’s a story for another day. \n\nThe issue for me, is I am so close to being married, buying my first house, and starting my life, and he had no issue with letting my credit get rocked for the $8000 left on the car and not saying anything to me about it. He was 100% willing to continue on with letting the car get repossessed without even calling or sending a warning text to me. \n\nI’ve lost all respect and trust for the kid, I’m definitely not allowing him to be a groomsman anymore, which sucks, because I thought it would help us bond, but I’m also considering just not inviting him whatsoever. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA or would I be for not inviting him, or making him a groomsman?

We've had this discussion a few times over the last 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago, we had a discussion about how tight money was going to be this month because both of our incomes were going to be about 1/4 less than normal. I brought something up that I thought we needed and it was decided we wouldn't spend the money on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat same day, we both needed oil changes and we headed off to the shop to go get them done. In the car he told me he got a package (a card with 3 oil changes and 1 free) that would cost X amount of money and could he use my card to pay for it. I said fine and he went in to pay for it. I get a notification on my phone after he swipes and it ended up costing Z amount, which was almost double what we discussed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe argument came about because we had JUST discussed not spending large amounts of money unnecessarily this month. I told him I was angry that 1) He didn't let me know before spending that amount of money on something and 2) He spent that amount of money on something that we didn't ACTUALLY need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says he was wrong for not letting me know (while also saying he would have just used his own money if I had said no), but said he wasn't in the wrong for spending money that we really don't have on something we wouldn't need (at least not for another 3 months when our income would go back up) especially since just hours before we decided not to spend money on something that we did actually need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being irritated at the course of events? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: BF spent almost double what we discussed for something we won't need for 3 months after having a discussion about not spending money on things we won't need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm a senior in college right now home for the break. I act pretty cold to  my parents, not intentionally but I do acknowledge I don't talk to them like I do friends. I would feel  awkward going out to eat with them one on  one and I only rarely initiate  conversation with them. This is what they're upset about, that I don't actively want to / seek out to spend time with them or talk to them. That said, I do occasionally joke around with them and whatnot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. They actively judge me negatively on whatever I do. For example, I used to be extremely antisocial in high school and they consistently called me weird / judged me for not being social.\n2. After developing a social life in college, they judged me for partying too much, so  I stopped talking about what I do in college, parties I go to, etc. with them. I came home buzzed a couple of days ago and they pretty much yelled at me. \n3. They were extremely non-supportive of my weight loss journey, I lost 90 lbs over two years and it seems all they focused on throughout the process was calling me anorexic for counting calories and watching what I eat.\n4. They consistently and heatedly argued intensely in my youth which always added stress to my life as a kid, I feel I still slightly resent them for this, deep down. \n5. They migrated from a poor Asian country before I was born and always bring this up whenever we get into arguments, claiming they gave up their life back there so I could have a better life here. I have nothing to refute this and I am grateful but this is what they bring up to get me every time. \n6. I lent them a very large amount of money to help them out with bills two years ago. They ALWAYS bring this up, asking me if this is why I 'resent' them. I don't even think about the money as a factor, but no matter how much I tell them, they still bring it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey manage to guilt me every single time I come back home, making me feel like a terrible son for not being chummy with them. I don't mind them, I don't dislike them, I just don't feel I have that great of a close relationship with them. I can't pinpoint a single reason to provide them with  either, it's just the way I am and when I tell them that, I feel shitty. ",

      "description": "Back in April I met this guy, AN we'll call him. AN and I hit it off, we start a FWB thing. He introduces me to his friends, one of them, TT, talks to me quite often over insta. Now, AN and I were spending quite a bit of time together and it was clear we were developing feelings. I told him how often TT and I talked and he told me TT was just trying to sleep with me. AN told me that TT had literally asked AN if he could ask me out. I message TT, clarify that I have no interest in \"homie hopping\" and that we're just friends. TT acquiesced, but a few weeks later blows up on me for something random, says some rude shit in front of our friends. Eventually apologized but it was clear why he was upset. \n\nTT and I were friends for a while (about 6 months) while AN and I navigated our increasingly complicated relationship.  We had lots of meaningful conversations. \n\nEventually shit between AN and I reaches a boiling point &amp; things are ended. Shortly after things are ended, TT and I hang out. I joke that I need some rebound sex. TT literally says to me, \"You're trying to get laid, I'm trying to get laid...\" I cut him off there- him and AN are still friends, I know AN had feelings for me, I'm not comfortable getting between two good friends. Besides, I told him we were never going to be more than friends. He agrees. The next day he texts me and tells me he was an idiot for suggesting it; I tell him it's alright, I understand why you brought it up. \n\nSuddenly we stop talking as much. Days go by without communication, when previously we would at least share memes or music daily. \n\nAnd again, out of nowhere he BLOWS UP on me over messenger. He said some unbelievably hurtful things. He used insecurities I've confided in him against me. My self esteem took a massive blow; I cried myself to sleep several times (which is very out of character, I'm not a crier) and I even relapse into self harm. \n\nIt took a lot of work to get over what he said, I was already in a very delicate state because of AN's treatment of me. My current boyfriend helped me trust men again because after those two, I felt like I was worthless aside from my looks. \n\nI've avoided TT since, and generally moved on. Despite my best efforts, he's always around my other friends and I ran into him; he asked if we could talk. He \"apologized,\" by saying he \"was very stressed out about being in the middle of AN and I's 'break-up'\" (which, to be fair, we did put him in the middle of) and I happened to be who he blew up on. I told him I have moved on but I want nothing to do with him. \n\nNow some of our friends think I'm being an asshole, while to me it's clear TT was just waiting for good chance to get in my pants, and never really valued my friendship. They think I should move on. \n\nTl;Dr: AITA for wanting to avoid an ex friend who devasted me and gave me a flimsy non apology? \n\n",

I always ask my mum about things I don't see the point to, and why I should do them. she always tells me\na. you should already know\nb. your playing me, you can't be that stupid.\nc. just do it. a mother should be able to tell her kid to do something, and they'll do it. they won't question it. \n\nshe doesn't get I want answers. she gets angry when I pester her, and says I'm always want a better answer, and I'm just trying to find an excuse not to do stuff. my problem is she doesn't answer, I'm not picky I just want a reason. she also has a very do as I say, but not as I do. example, she's a hoarder, and has a room in the house *just* for her stuff. she does work from home there. but, even with her crap all around, it's still a good study environment? she says it's because she's lived her life, that's why she has it all. (notice, not answering the question). if I point that out, she will repeatedly call be a smart-ass, and I should be more respectful.\n\nam I really attention seeking? am I being rude to her? am I just so dumb I can't see the problem here? this is tearing up our relationship. I want to do something, but I want to know the problem before I try solve it. ",

      "description": "I've only been driving since February of this year, so I'm still pretty new and not super comfortable on the road yet. I've developed some habits that help me feel more comfortable, but every time someone else is in my car they have a lot to say about how I'm driving \"wrong\". \n\n* I always have the windows down if it's 45°F or higher. It helps me hear other cars around me and I feel too closed off if the windows are up.\n* I almost never take the right on red. Usually I can't see well enough around the corner to feel comfortable. To prevent cars from honking at me, I don't put my right turn signal on until just before the light turns green.\n* I avoid highways whenever possible. People always get annoyed if I'm giving them a ride somewhere and they think I'm going too slow. I'm just not comfortable going that fast yet.\n* I don't attempt parallel parking in tight spots or high-traffic streets. I let people out and go park somewhere else that's easier, and they usually say that was stupid.\n* I never look at my phone while driving, not even at red lights. I just use Google Maps audio directions and play music on it, but people get annoyed that I couldn't text them \"I'm 10 minutes away\" or something if I'm picking them up.\n* When I'm on a busy road and I know I need an exit coming up on the left, I'll get into the far left lane and just sit there at the speed limit or a little over. I don't want the stress of having to change lanes right before the exit comes up.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I the asshole for refusing to change what makes me comfortable, or are these all reasonable things?",

We’re from neighboring towns and the same age. Only thing is our schedules haven’t aligned , as we both went back to our separate colleges shortly after first messaging, and we’ve never met. We haven’t really been able to find a good time to first meet, but not for lack of trying. \nDue to all of this I have no idea where we stand romantically, as we’re clearly both interested in something long term ( despite meeting on tinder) and talking a lot, but to say we’re together feels odd. Recently, I’ve thought of Re- downloading  tinder( deleted it for the first time for other reasons) and talking to other girls until I’m able to meet the aforementioned girl in person. \n\nWould talking to/ going out with other girls in the meantime make me an asshole ?",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.  I have an ex-coworker (from 7 years ago) that we've remained \"friend\" on that social media platform that is used to keep in touch. I mainly use it to keep in touch with all my old Army buddies since we're scattered throughout the world now.\n\nAnyway this previous co-worker has always had some issues with mental health.  Not just depression or anxiety but some pretty severe PTSD as he's a former Military person himself and he's also been put on an extended hold for some pretty serious thoughts (violent thoughts towards himself and others). He's been abusive to both his ex-wife and current wife.  He's also not allowed anywhere near his children from his ex-wife due to his abusiveness.  Which in the state I'm in the judges always award 50/50 custody unless the other parent has been proven to be extremely abusive. Even then parents are given a chance to be rehabilitated to be able to keep joint custody. Parents that have serious drug addictions even get to keep custody of their kids. I'm only giving this background info to show how badly someone has to fuck up in my state to lose custody of their kids, it's rare.\n\nHe has been married to his current wife for about 6 years. As soon as he divorced the ex he immediately (in about a month) jumped into a relationship with the new wife.  At our previous job he never asked me out.  He did while he was going through his divorce and we no longer worked together. I politely declined and he seemed fine with it. \n\nFast forward to three months ago. He sent me a message on the dating website I'm on. I ignored it.  Well last night he sent me another message and I asked him wtf he was even doing on a dating website since he's married. I got no response.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I told his current wife he is on a dating website?  I know they're still married and just two days ago posted on the social media site how she was the love of his life and blah blah blah.  On the one hand I don't think it's my business and it would also piss him off.  But on the other hand I'm not the one that's married and trying to date other women (his dating profile states he's divorced and looking for a LTR as well as quite a few made up things about himself).\n\nI would just like some opinions on if I should say anything to his wife or not. If it was me, I would want to know. And maybe that would be the eye opener she needs to leave his abusive ass. Idk, I'm torn. So please help me out here Reddit!",

      "description": "Ok, I know how unassuming the title is, but I guess that's exactly what I'm asking. For privacy reasons, I'm going to change the names of everyone, including myself.\n\nTo introduce myself, I'll go by the name Allen. I'm a sophomore in high school, and I'm a bisexual trans guy. \n\nSo, the story all starts in the eighth grade. I'd gotten my first \"girlfriend\", who I'll call Molly. I say \"girlfriend\" because it wasn't an actual relationship; we'd held hands twice and went on only one date over a five month period. Nonetheless, at that point id considered it a real relationship and thought I was truly in love. \nThis portion of my life was probably the lowest I'd ever been. My mental health was at an all time bad and my coping mechanisms were much less than healthy. To make matters worse, Molly was very manipulative. She pretty much followed the textbook of gaslighting. I'd pushed away everyone in my life except Molly, and thank God I've now repaired most of those relationships by now, but things could have gone south quickly.\nOverall, a real bad experience that I'm still slightly messed up over.\n\nEarlier this year, my good friend who I'll call Sam asked me out. I said yes and I had a datemate. Pretty quickly, though, things went sour quickly. There were lots of parallels to the situation with Molly. Things were moving too fast and I quickly found myself on an emotionally sinking ship. I was spiralling back into a shitty state of mental  health. I broke up with them after about a month because I figured I wasn't ready for a relationship.\nNow, Sam is someone who I consider family. I love them dearly and would go to the ends of the Earth to make sure they were happy. Part of the reason I ended the relationship was also the fact that we are in a small club that I cherish deeply. I could attribute the people in it to saving my life on multiple occasions.\n\nAnd that's where my problem lies.\n\nRecently, I reconnected with an old friend who I'll refer to as Gwen. We hung out and hit it off quite quickly, and two days after out first hang out Gwen had asked me out. And I said yes.\nGwen is taking things much slower, as she knows my prior situations. We've got a first date planned, that's honestly more of a trial to see what the both of us are comfortable with.\n\nAnd I feel like an asshole.\n\nI'm fully aware Sam still has feelings for me, and I really don't want to hurt them. I care about them a lot, but I think I could really be happy with Gwen and I could make Gwen happy too. I don't intend on abandoning Sam, and they are still a big part of my chosen family.\n\n\nSo, Reddit, am I an asshole?",

      "description": "A coworker and I both have to go testify in a case, with the courthouse being around 4-5 hours of driving away depending on the traffic.  My coworker said she isn't a good driver and doesn't like driving long distances, and said she would come along with me while I drive.  Not only do I not particularly want to spend 4-5 hours in a car with her, but I also had plans on making the most of my trip and visiting the city and grabbing a few drinks without being responsible for someone else as well.  \n\nYesterday when she first asked I kind of tried to laugh off her suggestion and said I'd think about it, even though I had pretty much made up my mind that I wanted to drive solo.  Today I come into work to a piece of cake on my desk she had gotten with a \"thank you for driving me\" note, with a few others in the office laughing and thinking I'd apparently be thankful for her \"gift.\"  I again tried to laugh it off and thanked her for the cake but that I still wanted to go alone, and she got upset as she left work for the day.  The other ladies in the office also seemed taken back and that I was being rude.  \n\nAITA here for not allowing her to carpool along with me?  I wouldn't really want to drive her anyways, but the way she kind of  just jumped in and tried to impose to grab a drive without asking me if I was okay with it, or if I had any other plans for the day, also made me want to say no.

I was talking to this guy for about a month when one day I explained to him that I was dealing with some depression and other social anxiety issues. No big deal as it really wasn’t his fault whatsoever that I was having difficulties communicating, but I didn’t find it to be fair to continue to talk to someone romantically if I knew it wouldn’t be a healthy dialogue the majority of the time. \n\nAfter I sent my explanation over text (we hadn’t even had the opportunity to meet one another in person yet, but we live in the same city) he told me that I had “expressed the biggest, bullshit excuse” that he’s ever heard. I even apologized for our communication from the last month potentially being a waste of his time, though I didn’t fully consider or understand the effort and dedication that a relationship could take.\n\nHe said “that’s obviously an excuse, lmao bye Andrew 😂. Have a nice life,” and blocked my number. I honestly was confused but I just let it go and went about my studies since I’m in school and had other things to concern myself with.  Well it’s been almost a week and he decided to unblock me and send this as an apology: https://imgur.com/a/3rxRASP\n\nAITA if I don’t think it’s sincere? I’ve tried to understand what he’s written but it left me sort of confused, as it seemed like he was trying to write several excuses and explanations in his apology. I just feel like at the end of it he was making it seem like I had explaining to do when in reality I’ve already done it, which is why he blocked me in the first place.",

      "description": "Context: I don't have too many friends at my office and it's not because i'm not friendly ,it's just that most of the buddies i had ,have switched to other companies over the past few months. Of the few i still have, two are particularly close, one guy and girl. They are pretty helpful for the most part and we hangout frequently. The girl, let's call her Katy, has a vicious side to her where she often makes fun of me for being slightly chubby(BTW i'm a guy ). \n\nI have always let this slide and taken it on the chin, but i can't help noticing Katy isn't a perfect size 0 either. I'm not condoning unhealthy body types, too fat or too thin and i agree i should get into better shape. However it's gotten to the point that Katy points this out at every opportunity she gets. \n\nYesterday another friend of ours, Kevin ,mentioned that there was a free for all marathon next week and asked if we would like to join in . Katy joked about how i should join first so i would burn up some of the fat I've got \"stored in my cheeks\". It bummed me out.  The worst part of this.. she laughs this off and never ever apologizes.\n\nAt this point,i should mention, I've known Katy for a couple of years and she has been a great friend for most of that period. It's just that i feel i should give her the taste of her own medicine by letting her know that she's not in shape either and maybe i'm not the only one that should be hitting the gym. Another part of me thinks that this would be a cheap-shot.\n\nTL;DR: Female Colleague keeps poking fun at my weight while being on the healthier side herself ",

I’m leaving tomorrow, Monday, and will be there for a week.\n\nSo, now the bachelorette party is happening and I kept replying to peoples’ IG stories saying things like, “Wish I was there!” Wasn’t getting any replies which was weird, I’m friends with everyone there. \n\nSo all of a sudden I realize the bride’s stories disappeared. I thought this was some IG glitch, then I realized my sister could see the stories...aka, she blocked me!\n\nI think she thinks I LIED about having a work trip!?! Or thinks I should’ve come for the weekend and then flown to London from Nashville...? I’m not really sure, but this seems like some Bridezilla shit. \n\nOur one friend FINALLY replied to my (clearly in Chicago) stories being like, “I thought you were out of town...” leading me to believe everyone thinks I lied about having a trip.\n\nJust gut checking here that I’m not the asshole.",

And we definitely both love each other an endless amount. \n\nWe've both been very open with each other, and recently our sex life has been in a bit of a lull, I've always been the one to initiate it, but that's just standard I think really, barring the odd occasion. \n\nRecently; after another time of attempted initiation, I went a touch quiet. She asked me what was wrong and I explained about whilst the sex itself wasn't the issue, it was affecting my self esteem a little, more to the fact of the rejection. I explicitly explained about it not being anything she's done wrong, and I love her to the world and back, and now I feel as if I've been a complete asshat. \n\nWe've had conversations about it, and she's explained it is due to her own self image, and I understand, and I support her everyday; I wouldn't change her for the world, but AITA for feeling insecure about this? Its not even that I just \"want sex\" or even the physical activity thereof, I just feel my own self worth plummet each time. \n\nThank you, and please help! ",

I also apologize for my grammar as its not my first language.\n\nMy face is a little bit sensitive and so when it's hot in classes, my face turns red extremely quickly. I sadly cannot control it and thus it goes open in front of my whole face. \n\nWe have 4 seat tables that are all around the classes and we can pick freely on where we sit, so I, of course, sit with my friends. Whenever the teacher talks or roasts me (we have a really funny history teacher, he's great!) I turn red quickly and my friends are of course one that notices it and I have this friend we'll call M. He quickly says \"OMG He's turning red!\" And the whole class notices. And this is not first time no, this is almost happening 3 times a week. He gets shocked every time I turn red and it really annoys me.\n\nAfter all the weeks of him constantly getting shock fact, I turn red. I message M to stop it, respect the way I am and to just ignore the fact I even have it. He told me to calm down and that it's a joke. I tell him its not a joke when you are repeating it and you're just disrespecting way I am. He then says we'll talk tomorrow and then if ignored all my messages which basically, I said that this is last time we're talking about it and to just stop when someone tells you to stop.\n\n\nSo am I overreacting? Am I in rights for telling him to stop? Share your opinions on this subject. Thank you lots!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for obvious reasons as this is a very personal story, I don’t worry someone accidentally finding it as I am the only English speaking person in my immediate “family”.\n\nAlso sorry for the huge wall of text.\n\nTo give you the much needed context, this has started about 6 years ago and it is still ongoing.\n\nMy parents have gotten divorced when I was 12 but it didn’t really affect me that much. My father is a great guy and he has always supported me in every single way, the same goes for my mother.\n\nNow the thing about my mother is that she really couldn’t get over it, and still hasn’t. She got this amazing idea of having me emotionally blackmailing my father and coercing him into returning back home. \nShe started telling me to tell him things like “Can you please return home for me? I want my family back yada-yada-yada...” and I actually did for a while. She managed to convince my 12 year old self to do her bidding on the account of having “a common goal of restoring our beautiful family”. This bullshit was pretty heavy from an emotional standpoint for a kid. And to make matters worse, I had to do this pretty much everytime I had a chance to see my father then come back home and recite every single word and gesture uttered by him to my mother. \n\nIf I ever missed out some part of the monologue I remembered by heart my mom would FREAK THE FUCK OUT. Starting to cry and tell me how I don’t love her enough or I don’t want my family back. It made me feel like shit every single time and I would call him or something just to fill in any sentances I might have missed while she would listen to the phone call on speaker. At some point she figured that it would be better if I would always call him at midnight, talking to him on the speaker while she rubs written papers with the dialogue I had to recite in my face all while analysing the responses and writing more appropriate shit for me to say. \n\nI got fed up. I was just a kid and at about 13 I told her that I wouldn’t talk to him anymore about any of this and that there are no chances of him ever returning.\nAs you may have guessed by now, she did NOT take that well. I’ve heard it all, “You don’t love me enough to help me rebuild this family, you don’t care about us, I’ve done everything for you and I love you please do this for me...”. I told her that I am sorry but no. The shitshow continued for about 3 days. I couldn’t take it any longer and this is when I first started lying. I would just come home after spending time with my dad and telling her how he told me he would come home eventually. I belive it was at this time that I completely stopped caring about anything she said, I was just so fed up that every since then her screaming and tears have absolutely no effect on me. So I just started lying because telling her the truth wasn’t an option and I was actually afraid that she would do some stupid shit if I did so. \n\nThis has been possible because my mother doesn’t talk to my father, AT ALL. I am the messenger that gets any message across so she can’t check anything to see if I am indeed telling the truth. I am now 18 years old and I have been doing this every since the day they have divorced. At the moment my father is aware of the situation and he had tried to tell her he’s not coming back but everything that did was making my life miserable for a month or so until I got my mom back in a comfortable web of lies and false hope. So we pretty much agreed that I would just tell her “Oh he didn’t really say anything when I told him to come back home today” in order to stop lying so much and maybe keep her in a barely stable area.  \n\nLooking back I wish I had aggressively refused to help her at the very start, but I was just a kid, she manipulated me and made me feel like shit if I didn’t cooperate. Every day I have lied, it became a little harder for me to tell her the truth, so I never did. \n\nMy mother doesn’t have any close friends and never leaves the house except when going to work.\nMy father currently has a girlfriend and plenty of friends. Of course my mother doesn’t know of my father’s girlfriend and there is simply noone to tell her.\n\nSo AITA for building a huge web of lies in order to give my mother false hope and make my life more bearable?\n\n",

      "description": "I broke up with my gf of nearly 3 years last month and I'm still struggling with feelings of guilt and sadness for hurting her. We're both in our early 30s and she was an amazing partner. We made plenty of good memories and rarely had any disagreements, but I felt my attraction to her slowly fade (she wasn't my type from the beginning but I liked her well enough and we grew on each other).  \n\nI keep telling myself that I made the right decision by just ending it rather than dragging it out, but she was really blindsided and when we spoke the other day she said that she's still struggling to process things. I've never felt this bad about a breakup, even when I was the one getting dumped. Every time we talk I feel worse and worse, but I don't have the heart to tell her that we should give each other more space. \n\nAm I the asshole for breaking up with her? ",

I got really weirded out and asked her why she still follows him , she told me that it was not a big deal and how it was kind of her fault as well .Being a guy who had that happen to his girlfriend to find out she still follows him? She acted like I am making a big deal about her following this guy. Any advice would be helpful. She has now unfollowed him but at my request, is that not something I shouldn't have to ask for?",

I wanted to share something a bit more personal so I told them to check the more private group. My best friend's boyfriend then logged onto her account to spy and see what was being said in the group he wasn't apart of. I feel like it's a huge invasion of my privacy. I went to the more private group specifically because I didn't want to share something personal with people I wasn't close with. He knew this and purposely logged onto her account. It's not like he came across it on accident. He didn't even hide the fact that it was him. When I said hello to (who I thought was) her, he straight up said that it was him. I then brought it up to my best friend, saying it made me uncomfortable and that I think it's wrong. She told me to talk to her boyfriend about it, said it wasn't her problem and left the group. So now she's pissed at me. Am I the asshole? ",

Also, my classmates aren't that creative and, honestly speaking, their gifts are not that great. It's basically a bar of chocolate + something small. (I can't even eat chocolate, so it would be useless to me). \n\nWhenever I give gifts, I go for creativity and making the gift as personal as I can (many inside jokes, favorite stuff, anecdotes, etc.). I just don't want to stress myself out, knowing, that I wouldn't get anything good in return.\n\nNow, it wouldn't be a problem if I didn't knew these classmates that well, but we have known eachother for 6 years now but our relationship is weird. We are only friends in school, but outside school we barely talk or text eachother. \n\nShould I suck it up and buy random cheap gifts or just straigt up say no?

I’ve never given it any thought. Until, two weekends ago, my wife’s friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daught shopping for a prom dress. My wife says “I still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.” She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment “oh, no, it has spots on it” and my wife says “oh, yeah, my date wade a mess! I should have taken off before we did it.” The friend says “ew!” And my wife laughs and they keep talking about shopping etc. Later after the friend leaves I am in the bedroom, and my wife comes in with the dress, and holds it up in front of her in front of the mirror and says “I loved this dress, I wish you could have taken me to prom we could have got dirty in the limo”. I said “hey, I don’t feel comfortable with another guy’s cumstains in your closet on that dress, have it dry cleaned” she said “what! You never cared before! I have good memories of that night, this is just memories, don’t be jealous, I won’t have it cleaned.” I said “I don’t care that you had sex with other guys, I don’t care that this guy came on the back of your dress, I don’t want another guy’s cum stains in my house, get it cleaned.” She said “no, you’re overreacting!” \nIt’s been awkward ever since. It’s still in her closet. I brought it up again yesterday while she was in her closet “are you going to get that dress cleaned?” She said “I don’t think so, don’t be jealous”. I have talked with her since. \n",

The fundraiser is to pay $7 for a ticket to a breakfast...which I would not go to because it's in another state halfway across the country from where I live. Her \"offer\" is that if we buy tickets, she'll eat \"a piece of bacon\" for us if we buy \"1 or 2\" tickets.\n\nOn the face of it $7 is not that much. But I am mildly annoyed that she even asked. I don't want to buy even one ticket, let alone two.\n\nAITA???",

      "description": "For some backstory, I have a different perspective on marriage and what I think it’s supposed to be about. I’m 28f and got married to my husband (31) about a year ago, and we both agreed it would be more meaningful if we were alone, so that’s what we did. We took our kids to celebrate for dinner the night before. My brother got a temporary ordainment and married my husband and I on a beautiful beach and took pictures, it was perfect and all i ever wanted/needed- I’m simple, I hate the idea of a huge wedding with tons of people, tons of money spent, ridiculous dresses, all of it. I can’t stand it honestly, it takes away from it all and in the end seems more of a fake projection to me. I have extreme anxiety issues and it’s hard for me to go to ANY party which I don’t know if many people understand. It sucks feeling that way so what usually happens is I get wasted and do something ridiculous. Last Christmas, my mother in law went on a long rant about how upset she was that we didn’t want a wedding. I explained that I understand and that I was sorry, but I’m anxious and that I feel like a big wedding would more or less take away the most important part of getting married to me- sharing our own special bond. She doesn’t work and my father in law is an engineer, but they struggle because she has insane spending habits and is constantly throwing ravish parties and buying furniture that they can’t afford.\n\nSo to the actual party, my husband told me we were going to an anniversary party for his parents. We both have kids from previous relationships; I have one daughter and he has two and they were all originally going to come, but my daughter (who is 7) did not want to go, so figuring there would be a bunch of drunk people at their anniversary party I told her she could spend the night at her dads house and it was ok, I wasn’t going to force her. My husband said NOTHING to me to hint that I should take her.\n\nWe go to the party and I walk in, immediately swarmed by people clapping and saying “surprise!” I noticed my own mother walking up to me with her phone, recording me and it clicked what was actually happening. I wanted to die. I wanted to crawl away and cry and I was speechless. I was in front of a room of about 150 people, mostly his family and a scattered amount of mine. I went around and started hugging people and my mother asked where my daughter was. I immediately texted her dad and told him the situation, he said she still didn’t want to go so I told him to please try to get her to. \n\nMy immediate family was there but so was an estranged cousin that I want nothing to do with. We had a rocky past and I was good with never seeing her again (she spread rumors about me, is a hairdresser and cut my daughters hair for her first haircut without bothering to ask me, etc.) My daughter wasn’t really thought of, no one thought to make sure she would go and my husband didn’t even think to tell me at least so I could bring her. I think he was afraid of my reaction because him and his mother knew I didn’t want this and knew my reasons for it. My husband is agreeable and is the same as me, hates parties and knows his father can’t afford anything like that, but his mother told him a week before and that “they could cancel but they already spent a ton of money.” I was asked all night by my whole family why she wasn’t there. His ENTIRE family was there and a few of his friends- none of mine were invited. His mother had set our seats to be with his brother and sister at a table- neither of my brothers (I didn’t sit there, I saw at my family’s table.) She wanted us to a dance to some country song SHE picked, I don’t like country, so I asked for something by Jim Croce- the dance didn’t end up happening. She had my husbands brother do a speech that SHE wrote. The whole night she told me how much she had to spend and how she had to tip everyone and their mother. Then at the end of the night, I was surrounded by two of his cousins girlfriends and some inbred looking lady from his side, all making remarks about what I was wearing (all black) and how drunk I was.\n\nI feel seriously depressed that in all of these pictures, my daughter wasn’t there. She’s the most important part of me and now these pictures of our “wedding” are out there forever with her missing. I don’t want her to wonder why she wasn’t there. I also would have prepared more and gotten ready/worn something not all black and fixed my appearance up. I would have invited my friends and people I’m close to at work. I almost wish I had done it myself because it’s not like I can do it again...\n\nThis “wedding” was more for my mother in law in my eyes. I feel like an ungrateful jerk but am I really? I know it was a lot of effort and money but with all the things I would’ve had if I had really wanted to do my own damn wedding, I feel cheated. I’m thinking about texting her and telling her that I’m upset but don’t know if this is a bad idea. Am I an asshole or should I let this lady know what’s up? ",

We will call her Jane. Jane is great except, in my opinion she hasn’t experienced the real word. We’re both the same age and I left home at 18. She’s 25 and still lives with her parents and has never had a job. She is someone who cares a lot about what people think to say in the simplest way. All she writes on FB is about how she wants to go to UCLA. I feel it’s to impress people. At the end of the day Jane has mediocre grades. UCLA has a 17% acceptance rate. We both want to go into the same field. Physician assistant. I could be wrong so please correct me but in her situation I just don’t think she needs to care so much about going to a prestigious school. And if she doesn’t get accepted I don’t want to see her get upset. She has absolutely no intention of “seeking out other options” because she’s determined to go to this particular school. I’m in the process of applying to 10 different schools! How do you only pick one? Any way we were talking about it and I was telling her there’s so many more options and that having a backup plan could really help if shit hits the fan. Maybe she took it as me doubting her but she abruptly just hung up on me. Jane is very smart but I know the world we came from. To be honest maybe I am doubting her. UCLA is a hard school to get into and just having good grades isn’t a guaranteed entree.  What do you guys think ?",

      "description": "So I went to Santa Monica with a bunch of college  friends who my roommate (someone I've only known for 2 weeks) knows, I do a lot of photography work myself. I happened to have snapped a shot of a girl half naked. When I get back to my dorm, my roommate picks up my camera without even asking me, just goes through my photos. I was shocked at first, then I say, \"I can't let you see past IMG 250\", he gets upset and says \"why?\", I respond with \"there's photos I can't let you see (in particular to protect the privacy of the half naked girl), he replies, \"I thought we were friends\". This makes me feel bad because it makes me feel like I don't trust him. I say \"hey, at least I don't go through people's camera's without asking\". I got frustrated.\n\nNow, come last night we went to a party together, I brought my camera out and took photos, I leave early to go to bed. My camera is placed on my desk. Come next morning he says, \"hey the photos you took were pretty good\", I'm confused, thinking... How did you see my photos? I say \"how did you see them?\", he says \"I looked through your camera while you were asleep\". I'm straight up like WTF! (to myself), that's literally not cool. I say, \"have you heard of privacy?\", he smirked. Wtf?! I genuinely don't feel comfortable with my information. Do I actually have to take my photos off the card before I go to sleep? What if he goes through them and confronts me about my photos being missing. I don't feel like that's necessary. Now the best option is to say, \"can you please not go throigh my photos while I'm asleep\", but knowing him, he'd say \"why, I was there too, why can't I see \". I don't want to publish and show everyone my photos that I took. And also, within the Santa Monica photos, I had some personal shots, like, my home, family, etc. \n\nIt's like I'm fathering this kid. It's really frustrating because he sleeps right next to me in my room and I feel like my privacy is literally exposed 24/7\n\nI discussed this with our mutual friend and feel annoyed that I talked shit about him, because I don't like it when others talk about me. But I just had to. It's like a voilation of trust being roommates. 😡\n\nSo what now? What's a polite yet not dick move to say, don't go through my photos. ",

      "description": "I was speeding on the highway, going 100 in a 50 (bad i know). A police officer catches me and pulls me over. I know I'm absolutely fucked so i was panicking and after i pulled over i positioned my phone in the car and started recording. The officer comes up and starts absolutely yelling at me and cussing me out like a complete asshole (even though it was justified since i was endangering everyone). And he tells me that I'm going to spend multiple years in jail, then takes my license and goes back to his car to run it through. At this point im so fucking scared, and im just breathing heavy while I wait. He says he has me on his radar gun at 10-something. Then something ive never experienced happens: he says \"son youre gonna go to jail, so i'm gonna give you a break, you got cash on you?\" I told him I did as I just cashed my paycheck. He said \"alright give me 300 and we'll just go our separate ways.\" At this point i was relieved that i wasnt going to jail but also pissed off he wanted to take a bribe, and he was also kind of blackmailing me. So I took my phone, quickly stopped recording then sent the video to my friend and i told him \"Sir I was recording this whole stop, (I start playing him video) I sent the video already to a friend and it clearly shows you trying to blackmail and take cash to let me off, and I'm gonna show this video to your boss and get you fired, or we can just 'go our separate ways' (i said that last part mockingly like he did. He was just extremely confused, embarrassed and angry. He didn't say anything, he just went back to his car, and drove off. I sat there for a few minutes with my heart pounding at 200mph while i just calmed down. I was shook to say the least, and to be honest I dont know why  I did this, but I went to the police station and filed a report of him trying to blackmail/bribe me, and I knew i turned the camera off before i blackmailed him. Well fast forward to now, he got fired, and i feel like i may be the asshole, so reddit, AMTA?",

I guess I can’t provide full context unless you’ve been at a live sporting event AND have a devout passion for one of the teams playing, but this is Reddit, so everyone is allowed to have an opinion. 😂  And this rabbit hole is fun for me, I want to see how far this goes!\n\nMy questions:\n1) I went to school in Philadelphia, so East Coast sports fans are “more passionate” or “assholes” depending on your view.  Does this play into how you should act at a sporting event?  I’ve never gotten yelled at before, why now?\n\n2) I am naturally a loud person, despite having to act professional and be quieter in most environments, including work.  It is rare that I get to cheer overly loud for my team.  Should I just stay home from now on?\n\n3) My wife tells me to tone it down all the time, but has never done so at a live game.  And I’m lucky she’s still with me, haha.  Is there a range of tolerance levels/“fandom” that I’m not aware of?\n\nSo have at it Reddit!!  Am I the asshole here?!?

Weve been on several dates over the last 2 months or so and things are going really well. On our last date she told me she hads felonies for drugs and possession of a stolen car ( shes clean now) but she will be on felony probation until 2021. At the time I was okay with it because like I said shes clean now but the more i think about it the more I change my mind. She cant go to any state with any kind of marijuanna legislation ( almost half the states) or go to the state she was convicted it which is the state my mom lives in. Because of her probation she cant go to nearly all bordering states. I really like this woman but the more I think about it the more I realize id have to give up alot of freedoms. Would I be the asshole if I broke up with her for the sole reason of her being on felony parole. This is literally the only reason I have for not wanting to see her romantically. ",

We have discussed marriage thousands of times before he proposed and I just automatically assumed that we were on the same page about sharing the same last name. He is very traditional in many ways such as wanting to get married in a church but when I mentioned the fact that I cannot wait to be Mrs. (last name), he went all weird and silent. I asked him why he went silent and he just said that he doesn’t see the big deal of accepting his last name. It really isn’t an offensive last name and to be honest, if we have kids, I’d prefer we all had the same last name. We both came from families where the mothers took our fathers last names, so what’s the big deal? I guess it just really bummed me out and now I’m reconsidering getting married to him because I had honestly thought we were in the same page. Maybe I’m overreacting?

      "description": "**It's super long but context is important I believe in this case.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know where to begin. Maybe some back story on my mom?\n\nMy mom is the 2nd youngest of 5 kids. When she was growing up, until 8 years old, my mother and her siblings were abused physically and (the girls) sexually by their drunken father. My mom talks about the night her dad got drunk and lined her and her siblings up against the wall in the kitchen and smacked them all.\n\nShe said one night she got up because she heard screaming and went in the kitchen to find her mom tied to a chair and her dad cutting her eye lids with a knife. She cried about this quite a lot when she told me this story.\n\nAfter a while she and her siblings were taken from both their parents because neither were fit to take care of them. My grandpa was a piece of shit and my grandma was okay from what I understand but was a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nFrom there my mom and her siblings were taken into foster care and split up. They were sexually and physically abused. My mom said she would go to a foster home and get abused or go to a good one only to be taken away from them after a few months or a year.\n\nShe had no motivation for school and dropped out. She had no idea how to take care of herself so she started using men as a way of surviving seeing as how she had learned no practical skills, failed high school and really didn't have a family to lean on. She was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic but denies it and hasn't taken medicine for it in over 20 years according to my dad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm almost 20 now. Growing up my mom took care of me and my younger half-sister till I was 9. My mom was on housing assistance and food stamps, she didn't have a washer and dryer most of the places we lived so sometimes we wore dirty clothes to school. The only reason my dad let me live with her was because he was afraid she would kill herself and then me and my siblings would hold it against him.\n\nFinally he got custody of me and my half-sisters dad got custody of her. After my mom didn't have her kids to take care of anymore she fell into deep depression and started heavily abusing drugs and pills. My mom used to be beautiful, 10 years later and she looks 20 years older, her teeth are very messed up from smoking meth I think.\n\nThroughout her addiction she has given drugs to my siblings. Hardcore drugs like dope. She lives with my older sister right now and gives her drugs and pills and continues to help her ruin her life and be stuck in addiction. My other older sister overdosed when I was 10, was choking on her own blood and had to be med flighted if I remember correctly. My mom was there too. She still gives drugs to my siblings in exchange for them helping her get drugs and pills.\n\nThe last 10 years my mom has been helping my siblings destroy their lives and after driving my older sister to the hospital twice for overdoses and almost seeing her die I cannot fathom how my mom can give her kids drugs. She says \"They're adults, they make their own decisions.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom had a very rough life growing up and a hard adult life as well. She just doesn't have the skills to be a proper parent. She never even got to see what normal parenting looks like and she has a mental illness.\n\nI'm very conflicted between being mad at her and feeling sympathy. I can't imagine having gone through what she has and coming out the other end even slightly okay. I feel guilty for even getting mad at her for what she does and cried for a long time before writing this.\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk to her anymore?",

      "description": "First of all, let me give you all some context.\nI'm dating a guy and our anniversary is two weeks from now, he's very sweet and always is there for me when I need him, our relationship is very healthy. He's also been my only company over these last months, since all my friends forgot about me during vacation (I'm from Brazil so we get a two month holiday break at the end of the year).\nThe other person involved is actually my best friend but because of some coincidences, misinterpretations and a lot of anger we stopped talking for almost an year and she spread some nasty rumors about me, so we actually hated each other for a long while. \nAt the time she was dating my bf's best friend, but it was an unstable and toxic relationship for both parts, he's also one of the motives we argued. \nMy boyfriend, started hating her because of all the shit she put me through and for dumping his best friend. \n\nThree days ago she asked me to go out and talk about all of that. Before accepting it, I talked to my bf. \nI never expected him to be so mad at me for wanting to talk to her. For real. We argued for like, two days. I accepted her offer anyway, but he was still pretty enraged. He didn't think she deserved it, that I am pretty dumb for doing that, and that I am gonna be betrayed by her once again.\n\nToday, he asked me if he could come over so we can watch some movies together, I sweetly declined because I had to go talk to the ex-enemy/best friend (I guess), and said that if we finished it early then I would go and meet him. \n\nWell, that's where things truly go downhill. \n\nI went and talked to her, we had a good conversation about everything that happened, she apologized, recognized her error and didn't blame me for anything. At that point I had pretty much accepted her apology and we were talking about random things that happened over the course of the last year.\nThat's when my bf called me and said he had been waiting for over two hours for me to go meet him and started saying that I preferred her over him. He told me he was gonna meet me at where we were and that if I didn't stop talking to her, he was gonna break up with me. \n\nI got really mad and told her everything, but he wouldn't stop calling. He was almost screaming telling me to go meet him at the park and that he didn't approve of me to be friends with her again. I, very emotional at that point, told him to come where I was if he wanted to talk, I told him he was being very childish and that it was only a conversation. \n\nWhen he got there, he wasn't screaming anymore, instead he very calmingly asked me to speak in private for some minutes. But I was very angry and told him I didn't want to talk to him.\nWe started loudly arguing in public and I was ready to dump him. He told me I was being a jerk and \"if you really do prefer her, then I'm not gonna be with you\", so I replied giving him my promise ring. I was in tears at this point, I had completely lost it. He was pretty shocked and my friend was quietly watching everything. \nI grabbed her hand and walked away from him and towards the park (we live on a really small town). He followed us, of course, while rambling about giving him one minute to talk to him in private and not breaking up.\nMe and her sat down at a bench and he was still going on. I was crying a lot and asking him to go home. I told him I was gonna talk to him tomorrow but he was still telling me we shouldn't leave this unfinished.\n\nI did my best to calm myself down, he gave me my ring back, and we talked for some minutes.\nHe apologized to me and told me I really shouldn't be friends with her because she hurt me, and that he was only worried about me, but still very angry. I told him that it was my choice and he had to respect that, and that it wouldn't affect our relationship, that I would still give him attention. We hugged and I thought everything was okay.\n\nNope.\n\nShe walked me back home and I apologized for the trouble, she said no problem and went home.\nI went to my room and grabbed my phone.\nI read some recently sent messages from my bf and he still insisted me to choose one of them. I of course said that I could be his gf and still be her friend, and then he said he didn't want me anywhere near her. I asked him to come over so we could talk. AGAIN.\n\nWe talked, he told me how embarrassed he got at the ice-cream shop and that everyone was gonna talk about it tomorrow. He also expressed how upset he was that I lied multiple times about seeing him and not becoming friends with her. I never said I was going to meet him, just said it was a possibility.\n\nWith no option left, I apologized about my behavior and told him that I am gonna stop talking to her. He's still upset and we can't find a common ground.\nI still love him very much but I miss my best friend friend.\n\nTell me reddit, who's guilty? ",

      "description": "Cast:\n\nMe: 'gifted' stoner, in my early 20s, emotionally incompetent and unmotivated.\n\nHer: cheerleader type that works hard at everything, very smart and driven.\n\nHim: jock with an ego but not dumb\n\nLong story but it is required to get to one tiny issue that fucked everything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe three of us were in a two-year psychology course together.  None of us started off particularly liking each other but as the classes went on we grew quite close, close enough for the jock and the cheerleader to start hooking up and close enough for me and the cheerleader to call each other best friends.  The three of us got on great together and it was easy--until he started treating her like a dick.\n\nShe would get sad because the jock would say things like 'I don't care about you' and blatantly stare at/flirt with other girls, but I was happy to listen to her and help her and we still talked every single day for over a year.  She helped me through my bullshit and I can honestly owe a huge deal of my maturing process to her (she's older).\n\nThen as the course was coming to an end she just cut me out of her inner circle.  There was no reason that she just stopped including me in her life and when I said it to her she just said that she was so busy--looking back it was gaslighting.  I was stupid and didn't realise it for a few weeks, until it became painfully obvious to me.  She would never admit to being done with me but her definition of effort was saying \"Hows things?\" most Sunday nights which would lead to a three message 'conversation' of pleasantries and surface level bullshit.  We literally stopped talking in person and after a party at my house, she and I were alone, sat in the kitchen for an hour without saying a single word to one another as my girlfriend went out to get more drinks and she waited for her jock to wake up.  As you can imagine this was hard but I did what I could to move past it.  Seeing her do things with other people was like having my heart shat on with razor blades, but I stopped trying and it started hurting less when I didn't think of her.\n\nThis lasted until after we were done--it had hurt like nothing else to see someone you care about forget that you exist, but it happened and I moved on.  Then my phone rang for two seconds and hung up.  It was her.  I called her back and we were tense but we made up without really addressing the cause of the issue.  Things were good again and despite myself, I trusted her again.  We were best friends again and there were fights here and there, but we were good.  She was still hooking up with the jock who started treating her worse and worse and I was still friends with him, this was the source of almost every fight but there was nothing serious. \n\nThere was another bout of exclusion somewhere in there but it was nowhere near as bad this time as she wasn't being cruel and I shot my shot early and pushed her out of my head after I realised she was being a stranger.  The jock never included her in things so when she finally reached out (after two months) to say 'Hi' it was the morning that the jock was earning some triathlon medal.  I had been invited and, being not bothered, I said I didn't want to go.  When she said Hi I knew it was to try and tag along and I didn't want to reply with \"Hey, I'm not going to the ceremony\" because that would have been short and that's the only way I could see around having to do the painful pleasantries, so I didn't respond.  Later that week we grew close again.\n\nFinally, the potentially assholey bit of my story (I think I had been pretty supportive and forgiving so far)\n\nThe jock was being exceptionally cruel to the cheerleader.  She was miserable and I was there for her.  I wasn't great as I was drinking a lot and smoking too much weed at the time, but I was always there for her when she needed it and she could snap me out of my self-destructive stupidity when she wanted to, she just didn't think to do it this time or I was beyond a finger-wagging, or she just didn't see the bout of depression.\n\nI was a bit shitty with her but nothing too bad.  We went on a road trip across countries together and despite me not being in top form, we still created some wonderful memories.  Then before Christmas I was invited to lunch by the jock. I went and he invited me to another sports ceremony that I politely said I didn't care about (I'm endearingly honest), then he invited me out for Christmas and proposed a road trip in the new year.  I agreed to both of them without much thought of the cheerleader, and when I saw her that night I told her (not that endearingly honest).  Of course, she was pissed off but not bad enough to be done with me.  \n\nThat sports ceremony was a week after I was with her.  I was drunk when I told her about the road trip and the Christmas bar crawl, but we still had a laugh and though she was hurt, I clued her in and was there for her, made her less sad.  The next morning I asked her how bad I was since I was quite fucked up talking to her.  She took four days to respond which is rare enough in itself, but then she said \"Hi, just seeing this now...\" which is a barefaced lie but not a big deal, to be honest.  \n\nThe problem is a switch flicked in my head and I subconsciously thought 'Oh, she's going to be a stranger for a while' and I pushed her out of my mind.  The day after she and I had our quick catch up (over text) the jock said he needed someone to go to his gig (that I had already passed on) and it seemed like he needed a favour.  I said okay while depressed as hell (around birthday (which I hate) and an old girlfriend was pregnant and trying to talk to me (not mine)).  \n\nI went and didn't invite her; I didn't even think of inviting her.  She found out on Facebook (fuck Facebook) and she got mad at me before my phone died mid-conversation.  I left it there and when my birthday came during the next week she sent me a message saying \"I was at work until now, happy birthday.\" at 11:25 at night.  We had a shallow and meaningless three messages before it became painful.  A few days later without contact, I texted her \"Are you going to let me apologize to you before Christmas?\"  This caused a fight since; of fucking course it did, I was stupid for presenting my apology to her like that.  \n\nThat fight was our last communication.  I went out over Christmas, I'm doing that road trip soon.  I did try and convince the jock to include her in things and he sees her as just hurting herself and there's nothing to be done about it.  She blocked me on everything after I went out at Christmas. I dropped a letter into her for Christmas with a present I know she likes.  That's the end of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been a rambling mess but I shake when I feel strong emotion and this has stopped me shaking.  I feel better just sharing.  I tried to paint this whole ordeal in a fair light, I assume I failed.  So, am I the asshole?  Do you guys think she is going to talk to me again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would honestly consider her a soulmate and I don't remember the last time I saw her because I was almost blackout drunk.  I don't want our last uttered word to be \"The two of you are cunts\".  I'm over my sad spell after Christmas was torture.  I have no idea how she's getting on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I didn't think to invite my best friend to the event of a guy she is stupidly in love with.  I then made it worse by being resentful that their shit was becoming my problem.  I see the hurt from her perspective but there's nothing wrong with the way I treat her.  I feel like I'm getting 100% of the negativity she feels towards him. ",

      "description": "So I get at least 3 scam calls a day from completely random numbers. My phone is normally silent so this usually doesn’t bother me. Sometimes I will be on my phone and I get a call from a number I don’t recognize and I answer it. \n\nThe call always starts out as automated and it’s usually talks about lowering health insurance rates or credit bills or one time regarding my viagra prescription. I’m a male in my early 20’s. I don’t need viagra. Anyway I always press 2 to talk to a representative and without fail it’s someone with poor English skills and has a very foreign accent. I usually lead them on for a bit and I end it with “huh that’s fucking weird you called since I don’t have a credit card.” Another time a guy and i got in argument on fucking each other’s mother. \n\nAnyway it’s just another cheap thrill I get by arguing with people scam calling me. Am I the asshole for doing this because I imagine people having to do this are not in the best situation. What they are doing is illegal and all but sometimes I feel bad but it also amuses me more than it should arguing with an Indian dude on how many of his relatives I’ve slept with. ",

We were in the back of T's car and somehow we all started making out with each other E kissing T me kissing E and T.\n\nAfter that day E started texting me a lot more often and I soon realized I really liked him, more than T. Which left me in a predicament because I had to choose between the two of them. E and I kept our 'relationship' a secret for a while in front of T, for example when ever he wanted to hold hands I'd cover the hand holding with my leg or if he went inside a gas station when we stopped we would let go when we saw him come out the door. \n\nOf course T wasn't too dumb and eventually realized what was going on he expressed his dismay and how upset he was to me and E's sister. He ended up calling me a whore. Am I the asshole in this situation?\nTLDR; I led on a guy for a few months and ended up with their best friend.",

      "description": "Hey all. Long time lurker here, throwaway because some people know my other user. \n\nSo, let’s get down to business. My boyfriend does not have a vehicle of his own for reasons that aren’t important. Because of this, I drive him around a lot, including to and from work and his extra curricular activities, but I truly don’t mind because I love him and it makes me happy to help. I know he really appreciates it, but lately I’ve been finding myself becoming increasingly upset because he keeps offering rides to his friends without asking me and expects me to go out of my way to bring them home.\n\nI may slightly be a jerk, but I don’t want to give these people rides to and from destinations that are often over an hour apart. It’s uncomfortable for me riding in the car with a perfect stranger and trying to make small talk. They never offer me gas money, I always get stuck driving them home (like I said), and I feel I shouldn’t have to he responsible for making sure these people (who i usually don’t know through a hole in the wall) have a ride to and from their own engagements. If I were asked and given the chance to say no, I would do so. And the chances are, I would probably be nice enough to take home these people every now and again too, I do realize these are his friends and I don’t mind helping sometimes.\n\nWhat prompted me to write this post is today, we are at an event that is close to 4 hours from home. Like usual, one of his friends suddenly discovered that they do not have a ride home, so he offered for me to take them. After a long ride that probably won’t be over until at least 10 o’clock, I don’t really want to spend more time going out of my way to drop this person off at their house. My question is, would I be the asshole if I refused to take his friend home and made her find another ride? ",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nI have had health problems my entire life, including a bout of cervical cancer that was detected very early and successfully treated with a surgery that preserved my fertility in my early twenties. In September I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and am undergoing treatment (because my luck is just that awesome). I was also diagnosed with moderate endometriosis on Monday. There are several treatment options, one of which is a hysterectomy. This is the treatment option I want to pursue for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it has the highest success rate and after all this chemo I'll probably be sterile anyway. My husband is opposed to this because \"we might want to have kids someday\" and doesn't want to adopt. I have always been ambivalent at best about having children, and have been both forthcoming and consistent about that for our entire seven year relationship. I won't lie and say that probably 10% of the appeal of a hysterectomy is that I unequivocally do not want to have children with my husband anytime soon, if ever. While I love him more than I can say, he is a combat vet with severe PTSD and a really angry (sometimes kinda scary) drunk. It's getting better, slowly but surely, but I can't think of anything more cruel, irresponsible, or unfair than to bring a child into this environment. AITA here?",

      "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nSorry in advance if this is long, it's a bit weird to explain. I ask that everyone is honest with me here, as I would really like to resolve this issue and obviously if I did something wrong I should apologise. I could really use some objective third party advice here.\n\nMy bf, D (23M) and I (21F), and I have a friend, S (20F). She is his best friend and they dated briefly almost 2 years ago but decided they are better as friends. I want to preface all of this by saying she is absolutely not the problem. She is always very respectful of our relationship and I think she is a good friend for D. They have known each other for about three years. \n\nWhen D introduced us, we instantly got along. I knew about her through the grapevine already before I even met D and I had a little bit of a girl crush on her. She's beautiful and very sweet, a literal angel. I love her to death and am very protective over her.\n\nD and S had irreconcilable differences that made it clear they are not good together for a relationship. I have never had even an inkling of doubt that he would cheat on me or still has feelings for her or anything. She was the last person he dated before me and it's been a long time since then. I don't want anyone thinking this issue has something to do with him having feelings for her or anything like that. Trust me, I have been cheated on multiple times and know the signs and gut feelings and all of that. \n\nAlso, for the most part, me and D have a great relationship. We're both child-free, have been together for almost a year and he was my best friend for a year before that. We live together in a very cute one bedroom apartment which me moved into recently in December. We split everything 50/50, I go to school full time for Finance and work at a very prestigious country club in our area, and he is a professional musician. We both make good money and support ourselves (I do get a little bit of help from my mom with paying for school and medical stuff and the like since I'm unable to work full time during school). I am very happy with him and generally enjoy our relationship.\n\nWe do however have our issues like every other couple. The main one is communication which we try to work on every day. I try to work on keeping my tone calm and not yelling and also bringing things up at appropriate times, and he works on not shutting down and getting mean and aggressive. One of the arguments we had recently ended with him telling me he wanted me to be more direct about what I want and just coming out and saying it instead of hinting or beating around the bush.\n\nThe other night we hung out with S for the first time in a few months. She is very busy and although they talk for an hour or so once a week-ish on the phone, neither of us see her very often. I text Snapchat and call her regularly as well and consider her a close friend. We went to Starbucks and got coffee. Immediately, I guess D could see something was wrong with her, and started asking her repeatedly to tell him. I could tell she didn't want to talk about it and kept trying to change the subject and hoping he would get the hint. She told him over and over again that she didn't want to talk about it, it wasn't a big deal, etc. and I was starting to feel VERY awkward and uncomfortable being in the middle of this situation and was getting quite anxious (I have chronic anxiety that I have seen a therapist for).\n\nWhen she went to take a bathroom break I decided to do what he asked the last time we argued and be honest and direct. I told him I know he means well and isn't trying to be an ass but he is putting both of us in a really uncomfortable position by continuing to ask her what's wrong. She probably doesn't want to talk about it in a public place and he could always talk to her about it privately. She'll talk to him when she's ready, all that stuff. I didn't even make it about myself and my feelings, because I didn't think that was as important as there not being weirdness between the two of them, and that was the only source of my discomfort, so if that was resolved I'd be okay. \n\nThroughout the conversation he was being extremely argumentative and snappy saying he knows her better than me and that he knows if he just coaxes it out of her she'll tell him. He was upset that she picked a Starbucks because they wouldn't be able to talk there. I told him she likely picked the location on purpose because she wanted to just be chill today and not get into heavy stuff since it was the first time they'd gotten to hang out in a while. He got very angry when I said this and said he didn't ask for my advice, he's known her longer than me, and I'm butting in where it's not my place. \n\nHe was quiet and moody the rest of the night and when we headed home he was silent. I brought it up again in the car because I felt the issue was unresolved and didn't want us to go to bed without fully discussing it. We argued the whole way home and he stood his ground that I should have basically sucked it up and not said anything because she's mainly his friend and he knows her better. I didn't understand why he was upset since I was doing what he asked by being honest and direct without being mean.\n\nSo honestly, am I the asshole here? I know people shouldn't give unsolicited advice and believe in the \"nobody asked\" rule. I don't like people giving me unsolicited advice and although I typically try to refrain from doing so (unless I think it's absolutely necessary, i.e. I think a person is actively going to ruin their life or get hurt or something if I don't give them advice) I thought since this situation involved me and I kind of had to sit there and feel uncomfortable by all of it, and I didn't think it was fair for him to put S or me in that situation, I had a right to say something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any advice; it's all appreciated! I'm always trying to better myself as a person, so any input on how I can be a better person and girlfriend, and improve communication between me and my bf, is welcome. Also, I will answer any additional questions if needed! ",

      "description": "My wife and I are going through a really tough time, as we have a few big stressors in our life. We have a 2 month old son and an almost 5 year old, I am going through an extensive job search, but most recently, our landlord is selling the house we rent, causing us to move months before we expect to. This is causing us to not only have to move twice in a matter of months, we have to find a rental property that rents monthly. I work full time and my wife stays at home, and recently has been very worried we won't be ready to move because of how little time we have to devote to packing. \n\nSo, my wife's plan is, among other things, to cut back my sleep schedule to only 6 hours daily for the next month. I barely get the recommended 8 as it is, I'm no longer the young kid who could pull all nighters all the time. By the way, that 6 hours includes taking showers, brushing teeth, etc. \n\n Frankly, I'm worried about what my health will become and how my job performance will be affected, on top of me always being grouchy due to lack of sleep. I've brought this up and she says I'm being selfish for allocating 8 hours to sleep when she doesn't and can function fine. She doesn't believe that I need 8 hours of sleep and that I'm putting my job before my family. AITA?",

      "description": "When I was about 20 I back to my homeland (we had moved when I was five). I spent quite a while there as I was doing uni there. I met a girl who I bonded with. Sarah and I had a lot in common both being away from our families and main country of residence. We also looked a great deal alike which resulted in a lot of jokes as we pretended that we were fraternal twins and such. After awhile Sarah confided in me that she was pregnant. She did not want an abortion nor did she want to keep the child. She wanted an adoption but could not afford the hospital fees. As this was my country of birth I was a citizen and entitled to everything a citizen has including free health insurance. I then told her we could swap identities for health and she could sign in under my name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe used my insurance at the hospital and then things went wrong. For starters, the hospital put my name on the application for the birth certificate so we had to follow through and put my name on the birth certificate. That meant that my name was on the documents when we handed her over for adoption.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 25 years. Marcy has contacted me on Facebook asking if I am her mom. She gives the details and stats of her birth and the birth certificate details of her mother they are definitely my friend's child. I contacted Sarah and she is adamant that no details are to be given to Marcy. As far as Sarah is concerned she did her duty by taking care of herself and having a child she didn't want. Now Sarah has a beautiful life with 2 kids and a husband and definitely does not want an illegitimate child coming out and making a scene as her family is not tolerant of a love child's or pre-marital sex. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I kept quiet and respected Sarah's wishes? I do not know any of her father's details so I can't help there either.",

      "description": "I have a pet which requires an inordinate amount of care and needed a pet-friendly place when I moved. \n\nI located somewhere an hour and a half away. When I told this to a friend, he went away and found me an offer with a shorter commute which did not allow pets. I refused it. He asked: would I take it if *he* kept ‘Snuffles’ and I came over to his house to look after her? He said he could put her in the dining room and give me a key.\n\nI was appreciative but refused again. I emphasised just how much work went into looking after Snuffles. I would need to be there for *a* *minimum* *of two hours every single* *evening* playing with her, cleaning, preparing food, dealing with medical issues and clearing any mess she made. She is lovable, but also noisy, destructive, demanding and not house trainable. No matter what I said, he insisted it would be fine and that he’d put up with it. He said verbatim that *he and his wife never used the dining room outside of special occasions and would only insist that I not be there later than 9pm*. I still said no. \n\nI was abruptly told that the far-away place was going to be given away if I did not accept. I texted my friend that I was going to take it. He called me back and yelled ‘Don’t! Our arrangement is so much better!’ He said he’d give me complete logistical freedom. On the basis of that, I accepted.\n\nIn hindsight, I think he pitied me, since I’m down on my luck, and just said whatever would get me to agree to his idea. \n\nOnce I'd moved Snuffles into his house he did a 180. \n\nI said I would do my best not to intrude on special occasions, but could guarantee nothing and would usually be there between 5 and 8pm, which he accepted. I immediately got messages about how nice it would be if I left before 6pm, so we ‘wouldn’t be in each other’s way’. This would mean my dropping everything at 3pm or earlier on many days, which isn’t possible. I told him so but he then *insisted* I *had* to be there early, especially on weekends. He talked about his family ‘deserving to enjoy their own dining room’. I understand, of course, but this directly contradicts what he said before. It turns out he hosts cookouts in the dining room on both weekend days as well, so I often have to give up much of my weekend to work around his guests. To hell with my plans, he wants me out of sight, not unlike a cleaner ^((no disrespect)). He also, incidentally, snuck Snuffles lots of unhealthy food.\n\nRecently, he told me he was hosting a birthday, so I agreed to be out by 5pm Friday. On the *Thursday*, I walk into a room of guests having a movie night. They confirm that today is not the birthday, they just didn’t say they were bringing guests over the night before. I got to work, and all the while the mentor began whispering about how rude I was, disrupting their movie. They never looked at me as they said this. I was out by 18:45, the best I could do.\n\nI can’t move again anytime soon.",

I agreed even though it was out of my way.\n\nThey kept playing music I didn't want to hear the entire time and I asked them to turn it off because it was late and I didn't want to hear it. She started complaining and I told her it was late and I didn't want to hear that music.\n\nI didn't have to pick her up in the first place. Everyone else usually says no, especially this late, and she doesn't even say thank you.\n\nShe started saying \"Well I can find my own ride no one told you that you had to.\" And saying it wasn't even that late and I told her to remember that next time she needed a ride and she said \"okay\" in a way that just pissed me off. I pulled over and told her to find her own ride if she can do it that easy. \n\nWe sat there for twenty minutes until her friend apologized and asked me to let it go for now and at least get them home. I agreed just because I needed to get back home to get ready for work anyways.\n\nToday she texted me asking for a ride to work and I told her \"You said you could find your own ride, ask someone else.\" She didn't even apologize for what she said to me on Friday. She stopped replying after.\n\nWas I wrong here?",

      "description": "TL:DR below \n\nOkay this is a complicated story so stay with me. I (31F) dated a guy, let’s call him J (26M). We dated for two years and had a horrible relationship. Don’t get me wrong, we had our good times. But he was basically verbally and emotionally abusing me. He was the king of gaslighting. He would call me a piece of shit. One time he looked at me dead in the face and said “I fucking hate you. Everyone hates you”. It was hurtful. I would drink, it would make things worse. I’d say things that were hurtful to him when I was drunk. We basically ended up abusing each other. \n\nTaking a step back, I’ve been dealing with mental illness my whole life. I had a rough childhood and have been in therapy/on medication/in and out of hospitalization programs since I was a kid. I was finally diagnosed bipolar in my late 20s and here we are (I’m 31 now). So I know my reactions to things can sometimes be emotionally driven.... after J and I broke up in April I had a complete mental break down. I became paranoid that he was coming to hurt me. I thought I was going to die. It was bad. My mother admitted me into a partial hospitalization program (basically a day program where you go through intense psychotherapy every day). I was in the program for 8 weeks. Things got better. I moved home, we separated completely (blocked on social media, no contact, blocked number, etc)\n\nFlash forward to last Saturday. I was having a rough day so I was talking to my best friend of 16 years, let’s call her M. I asked if M wanted to hang out and she said she was going to a concert with some ppl but J might be there so I wouldn’t be able to go. She actually phrased it as “I know this is going to fuck you up mentally but I really want to go”. Okay, fine. “Have fun with J” I say. I was hurt, it prob wasn’t the best thing to say but I said it out of hurt. She flips. “How dare you talk to me that way” she says “I have cancelled plans with J and friends countless times to hang out with you”. “Okay, I’m sorry. You’re right, I didn’t know that. Have fun at the show. I’m going out with some friends to our local bar. Done”. Done. It was done. \n\nLater that night, I was at our local bar with some friends and she texts me. Says “are you still at the bar, shows over, I wanna stop by”. I say “yeah, cool, come on by”. She gets there, I’m deep in convo with someone so when she says “come to the bathroom with me” I shrug her off. She comes back from the bathroom, sits next to me and blurts out “J is on his way”. I think “shit I have to get out of here.” I grab my stuff and head outside. I proceed to have an earth shattering panic attack. My friend from earlier comes outside. I’m panicked. I immediately revert to that paranoia. He’s coming to kill me, he’s gonna hurt me. My friend goes inside and closes my tab for me, I couldn’t go back in there. M comes out and tbh I don’t remember what was said cause emotions were so high and we had all been drinking but I remember it not being helpful. Definitely didn’t end in an “I’m sorry let’s hug and make up”. \n\nThe next day I went for an emergency psych evaluation and got treatment. I start another program on Friday and seeing a therapist in the mean time. So I understand that I had an emotional and psychological reaction to things and am actively taking steps to fix that. \nI haven’t spoken to M since then, I haven’t spoken directly to J since we broke up. (When we broke up it was so volatile that M INSISTED J and I speak through HER, which is a whole diff story of fucked up ness). \n\nIt’s a very complicated and nuanced situation so I’ll prob have to edit to add more details as questions arise. \n\nTL;DR I guess my question here is; AITA for being upset that my best friend hangs out with my abusive ex? And more so, AITA for flipping shit when she tried to bring him around me? ",

I was, and still am, struggling with anxiety and depression and he knew from the start. Stil he didn’t do anything to make my life easier. If I started crying I was a drama queen, and if I asked him to stop doing something, like stop swearing, he accused me of trying to censor him in his one house. \nWhen I was better at him in something he would also get angry. Like if I got a better grade than him he would say I didn’t deserve it, and that he worked so much harder than me. \nNow I have low self esteem. And he often had me on the edge. Braking up whit me and than taking me back whit-in hours. \nWhen he found out I had started to think about leaving he said he would kill him self if we broke up. That terrified me and so every time I went to stay with my mom I quickly returned in fear of him having hurt himself.\nThen he told me he was transsexual. He wanted to become a woman.  \nA had known him for years and know this...\nThe following months he became more and more unstable, and I urged him to get help. To talk to someone professional. But even though he eventually did, I was still being his therapist at home.\nHaving my one problems it all became to much. And whit a lot of help I was able to move home. \nWe cut all contact for a few months and when I talked to him again it came out that he had attempted suicide four times. We had contact for a while after that. Trying to find out if we could save it. But after several nights of him pressuring me in bed it became to uncomfortable. I left once again. \nKnow I feel awful. Like I have let him down. He is going through, not only working through the memories of a difficult childhood. But also working his way towards a sex change. \nIts all just to much.",

      "description": "The title is a lot less detail oriented so hear me out.\n\nMy wife and I will have been married 5 years this summer and it falls on the 26th of the month. My brothers birthday is on the 1st of the following month and he is turning 30. His wife wants to do a surprise trip for him with my wife and I and my sister and her husband. My SIL knows that my anniversary is a few days before and is totally trying to compromise so the trip works out well as an anniversary trip as well. The plan is for my wife and I to pick the destination, go there and spend a few days alone together, then my siblings will come down the following weekend to finish off the trip. \n\nMy wife is saying how she feels like our anniversary is unimportant to me and the trip is all about my brother and his birthday. Which it will be, for 3 days at the end. The rest of the time we'll be alone enjoying our anniversary. She's making planning it very difficult because she keeps saying how I'm putting everyone else before her which isn't the truth. I'd understand if we weren't choosing the destination and having alone time, but the fact is that her and I are picking where we all go, and we'll be alone for a good amount of time before everyone else comes. \n\nNow for the fun part. My wife's mother apparently booked a timeshare in the Caribbean for the week of our anniversary for the entire family and invited us along. My wife jumped at the opportunity about how much fun it would be, and I told her that hurts my feelings. She's willing to go spend the entire week with her family, but somehow the idea of spending a few days AFTER our anniversary with my family is somehow making her feel unimportant? I told her we can split the time between the spot with her family and then jump to wherever my family goes, but she wasn't having that either. She's unwilling to compromise.\n\nI got very frustrated and told her she can feel free to go with her family, but I'm not going and she can stay home while I go for my brothers birthday party weekend. AITA for trying to combine the trip with my brothers birthday party and making my wife feel unimportant?",

      "description": "Don’t get me wrong, his siblings are great when they’re not trying to mooch off of us. Frankly, none of them have their shit together except one. They’re all 20-30. 3/4 of them have 1-4 kids. One of them was recently homeless, one quit his job, one refuses to try to get a job, and the other one has a job and a kid but never asks us for money. They all also have a boyfriend or girlfriend that they live with.\n\nHis siblings call almost every day. I can say that his brother who quit his job is the only one that calls to actually talk. But even then he’ll imply how he’s struggling with money or he’s stressed about it. And of course my husband will offer money to him. $25 or more every single time we give them money. \n\nHis sister was recently homeless. She asks for money from us the most. She was living in his brothers house for like two months because she her and her husband would keep spending the money that everyone gave them. We’ve had to give them hundreds before. She’ll call him and make small talk and then ask for money. Or she’ll butter him up and say something like “by the way if you want to send me $20 I’d appreciate it” at the end of the call. \n\nHis other brother calls only for money and my husband knows that. He doesn’t fake like he wants to talk and he’ll straight out ask for money. We don’t even answer his calls sometimes. \n\nYesterday, his brother and sister both called asking for money. They both actually talked to him for a long time so I thought they really weren’t going to ask for money. But no, they did near the end of the call. It pissed me off. Now my husband is asking me is it okay if we send them $50 each. I told him I’m really not okay with that. Then he started telling me the sob story they told him on the phone. It sounds like complete bullshit. I tell him I’ll be fine with you sending them some money but not $50 each. We just sent them $25 yesterday. \n\nHe tried to convince me to be okay with giving away $100 for some bullshit excuse. It’s always diapers, food, clothes, etc. I offer to get it delivered to their house the same day and they make another excuse as to why they’ll just do it. I told him that I’m tired of having to give away money almost every single day. He says it isn’t every day. It’s probably more like every other day but overall we give about $300 a month to them collectively. I told him that we can give them $25 each and then we’re done. I said “They only call you for money and it’s petty as fuck”. He looked kind of hurt by what I said but if he’s hurt then doesn’t that mean he thinks so too? Idk. \n\nWe go back and forth about this almost every day because it never stops. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n",

He also have several headaches, body itches, and chest pain. \n\nEver since the start of the relationship, I’ve been too caring. I wouldn’t sleep till he’s home, and now I’ve notched it up. I have alarms for all his medicines, and make sure i sleep after he’s sleep as the medication also tends to make him overthink and confused. \n\nFor the past week, I’ve been getting three to four hours of sleep. His job timings are 3pm to 3am (remote CS job) while mine are usual 8am to 3pm. And today i feel as if I’m losing it. I’ve a history of PTSD. \n\nWIBTA for toning it all down a bit? ",

      "description": "We’ve been dating for 3 months. She’s an accomplished academician and was born very wealthy. I am an entrepreneur who is doing alright and looking to grow my business. She’s based in North America and I am based in Asia. A long distance relationship.\n\nIn the course of a casual late night chat over text, I was posed a question of, what would I do if I’m rich. I responded that my immediate blood family comes first, I will like to provide a comfortable life for my parents. I then said that I would love to enjoy the luxury of traveling and eating well.\n\nShe asked , “what about me?”. My immediate response in verbatim was, “you? You have plenty of money you don’t need any money from me.” This was immediately followed up with a serious response, “ if I can afford to, I’ll love to fly to visit you more often.” \n\nShe is very upset and unable to get over the fact I ‘joked’ about her not needing money. This is despite my reassurances that that was not the crux of the message and it was intended as a light hearted jab to her family and personal background. In the course of our relationship, I have never once let her wealthy background or personal finances come between us. I am generous by nature and offer to pay for all dates and outings and she does acknowledge and offer to split every time.\n\nI apologized for getting her upset. She accepted my apology but is insistent that I should not have said that she’s rich and doesn’t need my money. AITA here?",

      "description": "Ok first up we are non-monogamous, so shagging other people is legit and above board.\n\nMy (M37) boyfriend (M36) has a new relationship with this guy who lives 4 hours away. I don't like the new guy tbh, he gives me the creeps, and I think he takes advantage of my bf. But anyway my bf likes him so I guess I just have to deal with it. I don't like it but I wouldn't ask him to stop seeing him (they're in love and in that new relationship stage).\n\nSo while he was away visiting the new guy and I was feeling lonely and sad I thought I'd try to take my mind off the situation by having a hook up with a guy I've seen once before. I know my bf isn't a massive fan of him, but I figured I'm a big boy and can take care of myself and I'd quite like a no strings hook up with a hot guy so I went for it. It was nice and we talked about hey maybe we should make this a regular thing. Told my boyfriend afterwards that we hooked up and he got really upset and it turns out apparently he really HATES this guy.\n\nSo now I feel bad about upsetting him. Tbh I could try to find someone else to hook up with in future that doesn't piss him off. But yknow his other partner pisses me off, and I don't wanna be sat at home like feeling lonely while he carries on dating a guy that I don't approve of. What I do not want is for resentment to start to build up. So I kinda want to keep seeing my new fwb because otherwise I'm just gonna become resentful of my partner's other relationship and that would not be healthy.\n\n(Just to clarify this is not a pure jealousy thing, we each have other partners who the other is perfectly happy with. It's about having a specific problem with somebody based on 'red flags' or whatever.)\n\nAITA for wanting to keep hooking up with this guy even though my partner hates him??",

So I have on my different form of social media many guys who are from my tinder. Yesterday I talked to a guy who was to a famous party and I asked him how it was and we ended up chatting all day ! But please don’t get me wrong! Nothing of flirt we talked about weed and music and Argentina (because he has visited it and I’m from there) and that all ! We even say‘ that we will not meet up ! So I told this to my boyfriend today and he got really upset to the point he said “well I will go on tinder too and find some friends for me too and we will see if you like it !” And honestly it sure upset me but like ... I don’t try to justify myself it’s just a talk we’ve matched and we talked but we have never see each other in real life so obviously we have never hooked up together and will not because honestly I love my boyfriend with all my heart and normally I’m the one jealous and he is not, so it make me think that I’m the one in the wrong. All my ex cheated on me and I understand the position of being cheated! And I don’t want my boyfriend to be in this position and nobody else too ! It’s super hurtful ! So it’s not even considered ! And I’ve told him because If I don’t it will be like a secret no ? Please tell me if I am wrong or if he’s overreacting \n\nAnd I forgot to say ! He had a lot of friends who were sexfriend and he keep to talking to them but again not in a flirty way (sometimes sexual meme but it’s just because now they are just friends) and I never been scared of this girls because I see how they replied to him and it’s only friendship!

It's on her bucket list of places to go to and she missed out on doing it last year. I'm a fairly outdoorsy person and it looks pretty cool so she's totally convinced me and I'm totally down to do this. Alice is a planner and does all the research for when the best times are. We talked about it together after the research and decide on a couple of possible time slots. The day that tickets open up, we both wake up at 7 am and proceed to click refresh for around an hour get into the website to buy the tickets. Finally, I manage to get in after 50 minutes of clicking the page and buy a reservation for 2 for a time slot we picked under my name. This means I have to be there to claim the tickets the day of. Keep in mind, these are really hard to get and were completely sold out for the year by the end of the first day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were talking in the car yesterday and I made a joke that even if we broke up, the tickets are in my name and I'd keep them. She says in that case, I should transfer them to her (which is totally possible via the website and of course she would pay me full price of the tickets). She thinks she should get the tickets since it was her original idea to go and she did all the research for the best times. I think I get to keep the tickets since I'm also excited to go now, spent the time to acquire them and it's under my name. We both read this subreddit so we decided to let reddit users vote on who is in the \"right\". So in this scenario, WIBTA if I didn't give transfer her the tickets in that scenario? ",

      "description": " My sister is high-risk pregnant and just moved houses. Her baby is due in a few days, so when she asked me to paint a mural on the nursery it was go-time. She wanted [mountains](https://i.imgur.com/XosK7eI.jpg) on one wall, and birch trees on another. Now, my sister's mother-in-law(SMIL) normally is the go-to artist in the family and I think this is why things went wrong.\n\nMy sister provided paint, but the top two blues were too close in color. I mixed them with white and a darker blue to get them to contrast a bit better. Every other range is base color. After 10 hours the project is done barring a streaky spot at the bottom that needs to be filled in-we had run out of paint. She had posted pictures of my work on facebook to help promote my budding business and I got a lot of nice feedback/inquiries.\n\nSMIL also painted rainbows on my niece's wall, but had stated she didn't want attention, so she didn't get a FB post. She also left a somewhat bitter comment on mine, so my sister messaged her to tell her that they appreciated her work, and that my niece loves her wall. SMIL responds with how she was exhausted from the work, it took a lot out of her, it's unfair, and how she feels taken advantage of but does painting because she loves her family.\n\nThe next day my sister calls me up crying. It turns out SMIL was over to help with last minute things and had snuck upstairs with the paint. She filled in the streaky spot, then began \"touching up\" my mountain ranges--the range that I had mixed paint for, and used the paint straight out the can. When my sister caught her she flipped, and SMIL panicked and tried to wipe half-cured paint off the wall stripping it down to the raw white bottom, effectively ruining the piece.\n\nOver-stepping boundaries has always been a problem with SMIL. I **don't** think she was trying to ruin my piece. I think she was trying to play the hero (\"I fixed some mistakes Readylamefire made!\") and get involved in something that didn't belong to her. The portion she was 'touching up' was a part I had gone over with a fine tooth comb because I knew there would be no second chances on it since mixing the exact color again would be near impossible. My sister demanded she leave but she ignored her, continuing to try and fix it. Now I have to go actually fix it.\n\nNow, I have a right to be mad, but here's where I think I might be the asshole:  \nI want to send a firm worded letter to SMIL. She constantly does stuff like this. This was my first time doing something like this for my family, and I worked really hard. She had no right to start trying to alter the work I had done. It meant something to me. **However if I do send something to her, it'll trigger drama, and my very pregnant, stressed sister will undoubtedly be caught in the middle.** It's the one thing holding me back, and I'm leaning to being the bigger person/not saying anything to SMIL at all.",

Jane and I talked for about a month and a half and really hit it off. However, I broke things off for personal reasons (I was the asshole here). About a month after that, Jane and I start talking as friends again, and a few weeks later decide to pick things up again. But, in the time that we were apart, she began talking to my best friend (referred to as John). John and I are both really good friends, and decided that no matter what had happened, we would still be friends on the other side. I told Jane that we would need to go slow to spare John's feelings (he is head over heels for her). It eventually comes out that John and Jane slept together, but her and I were not talking at the time so I am not mad at anybody, just upset that it happened. I didn't try to break up their friendship, because I think it is unhealthy to tell SOs who they can be friends with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward a bit, Jane and I are together, but don't commit because I am still working through the fact that she slept with my best friend, plus John is mega depressed and I don't want to hurt him. Four months go by, and she is still hanging out with John and talking to him every day. We communicated pretty well, and she knew that I was still messed up by the whole situation. I decide that its best if we just continue as friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn and I agreed that if things ever went south between me and Jane, that he would stay away, because Jane and I had gotten fairly serious. But, the day after I broke things off, John drives a pretty long distance to go comfort her. They went back to college now and spent the first few days together. John messages me and tells me that he is going to try to be with Jane, only a week after we broke up. I told him it bothered me, and he said he knew it would. Meanwhile, Jane is calling me every night and telling me that she would never talk to John again if she could be my girlfriend. Yet she still hangs with John everyday. I never told John I was angry, but he tells me that he is angry at me because I don't want him and Jane to be together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis past weekend, Jane asked me to come see her, things went south and we ended up sleeping together. That night she went and got drunk with John, not sure if anything happened. This whole situation is childish, and I don't want to be involved in it. The reasons I am upset are because 1.) I feel like John is preying on Jane while she is in a vulnerable state (she calls me crying frequently because of what happened between me and her) 2.) Jane is using John to get over me, and has basically admitted to that 3.) I feel betrayed by both of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for being angry that my best friend immediately went after my ex girlfriend after our breakup, and that she is using him to get over me?",

      "description": "I work in a crowded downtown district. Every day impatient motorists muscle their way into crosswalks while pedestrians are still crossing and come within a foot or less of hitting them while making a right turn. The traffic law where I am says you're supposed to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk, regardless of if there's room for you to pass.\n\nI don't care much if I'm all the way across the street and someone turns through the crosswalk anyway as long as they're not close to any pedestrians, but the other day I was walking back to the office from getting a sandwich, and as the light turns green I step into the crosswalk. This guy in a fancy Mercedes SUV is waiting to make a right turn but he has to wait for me to cross first. Meanwhile, across the street, a large group of pedestrians are coming towards us. He begins turning into the crosswalk while I'm still totally in front of him, and by the time I'm about to pass him, he's fully in the crosswalk about 2 feet away from me, with his car pointed at me. I can tell he's going to try to get through the crosswalk before the group of pedestrians coming the other way get to him, but if he does that he'll be driving through a gap in pedestrians that's only slightly wider than his car, basically getting really close to pedestrians in the crosswalk.\n\nSo instead of continuing walking, I just stop. Just long enough that the group of pedestrians approaching from the other direction are now in front of his car too, forcing him to come to a stop and yield as he's supposed to. At no point was his car even stopped to wait for me, he was inching forward the entire time, so when I stop walking he has to abruptly apply the brakes while partially in the crosswalk still. Once the pedestrians coming from the other direction are in front of his car I continue walking. He stares daggers at me the whole time.\n\nDick move or no?",

      "description": "So, I've been living with 2 friends as roommates... first mistake there, I know. One of them has been so frustrating to live with. My grandma owns the place so she rents it to us for 500 a month (pretty fucking good imo). That's only 170 a month and i'm really appreciative of this. The first battle that started, is how often his girlfriend is over. The agreement was 3 nights a week. My thinking was anything over that is half the month and thats not fair to not pay anything. That's for any guest, that way I wasnt singling her out, but i've known my friend for a long time and know how he is. So of course, here comes the first battle. She starts staying 4-5 nights a week. Months of endless battles about this. My grandma is the one renting it to us, so I felt it was her decision. I didn't feel like it was my place. It pissed her off as well, but all he would do is apologize, say he understands and would do something about it. It'd get better for a couple weeks, then rinse and repeat. I eventually just gave up. My grandma is just too caring and forgiving so I was like, whatever.... so now. The new problem that i've just been letting go one without saying anything. For that past 2 months I have refused to stop cleaning. The kitchen that is. I have been the only one to ever take the trash bags out to the bin. I also stopped buying groceries, so i dont use dishes. Take note, theres not a single time where his girlfriend has helped clean. So i got tired of cleaning up their shit. Other roommate doesnt want to clean for the same reason, doesn't buy grocies so doesn't use dishes. So now there's constantly so many dishes in the sink they're on the counter and like 5 trash bags in the floor. Just because you don't fucking \"live\" here i guess you cant make a mess. Huh? Well. My brother lives in a mold infested basement right now and is constantly sick so I want to kick my roommate out so my brother can move in... AITA?",

      "description": "WIBTA if I told the girl my ex cheated on me with about me? \n\nSo I was with a guy for about 6 months, and it was going really great. We had a lot in common and similar goals and we saw each other every weekend and just generally things seemed to be going well. Unfortunately he said he lost feelings towards the end and was trying to find a good time to break up with me. He didn’t want it to do it before I went on spring break and then he wanted me to see his new house. So when I got back from spring break he had me over to his new house. Everything seemed fine we hung out and just did whatever, I stayed the night and we slept together. The next morning I woke up to a text from a phone under a pillow. It said good morning baby. My heart kind of sank and I went through his phone and found a lot of texts between him and a girl he was hiding under a coworkers name. \nOnce I saw enough to make sure I wasn’t seeing the wrong thing I woke him up. I told him I knew and I left. He saw me later that night so we could talk it about and have a real break up. He told me he didn’t want to hurt me and was planning on breaking up with me the next time I saw him, and that he never intended it to go this way. He lost feelings and met someone else, and from the texts I read it seemed like it had been going on awhile but he wouldn’t tell me how long. I’m guess around 3-4 weeks. I didn’t know who the girl was and then she popped up on my Twitter feed and not realizing who she was I followed her. That resulted in an immediate phone call about me poking around and I explain I wasn’t. We talked on the phone for two hours and I told him I knew I would get over this but right now we can be friends, and we again texted after and I told him I really can’t talk to him at all. He did kind of mention this girl was a “side piece” but I think he might’ve just told me that to help calm me down.  \nThis morning I woke up and the girl had blocked me. I can only imagine he told her to and that I’m some crazy ex and just to block me. But the thing is if I was in her position I’d want to know, and I don’t want him back. Sure we had a great relationship when we did but he did have a lot of things I didn’t love about him and I could never be with someone who cheated on me.\nI mean he didn’t break up with me the night he saw me and then he initiated sex. And the night when we had our break up we still kissed and hugged for a long time. So WIBTA if I tell her? Part of me says I would want to know if I was in her and place and part of me says bud out and just leave it alone.  ",

      "description": "If you don't know what twitch is it is a website where ppl broadcast themselves playing video games. \n\nI've been streaming on twitch since 2014 first on my ps4 and about a month ago I built my own pc and started streaming on there so I could make it look better then it looks on the ps4. My reason for streaming on twitch has never been for money or to make a career of it. It been to meet ppl and talk to them about gaming. I also don't really care for the fact that people kind of make their living on Twitch by people's generosity and if your popularity kind of dies out then your livelihood kind of dies out as well. that's just me though.\n\nI used to have a lot of friends who I would stay up late with and play video games with but as the years went on people grow up get jobs and become too busy. I am unemployed at the moment so I have a lot more time than my friends to play video games so I use twitch as a way to interact with people who have the same interest in video games as I do and kind of make gaming a little bit more interesting for me.\n\nSo one day I was watching twitch while in a party with a female friend of mine's and I was telling her how much a few girl streamers are making on the website and she was saying that since she is in college she wouldn't mind making some extra money on Twitch to help her with her College.\n\nI told her that if she started streaming and had a camera that her streams are probably going to do well because girl gamers tend to do well on the website these days. So she gets her stream setup and she builds herself a computer and start streaming after a month she becomes a twitch affiliate and has already started to get donations subscribers and bits. \n\nAt first it doesn't bother me because I knew that it would play out like this but I think it started to bother me when she would suggest that we play games together to help both our twitch streams and we would play a game together and her chat with start to blow up with 15 20 30 I think the max being 50 people that I remember coming into her stream and chatting while no one came to mine even though we would put up a multi twitch so more people can watch both streams at once.\n\nSo after about a week of doing dual streams with her a pattern started where we would start streaming her chat with start to get Lively and me and her would stop talking because she was pretty much just communicating with her chat and I was pretty much just playing the game in silence the pattern ended with me saying that I wasn't really feeling that great and then I would leave because I was in a bad mood I didn't want to be rude to my friend and say something that would be mean because I was upset about her successful twitch Channel and she noticed this and asked me about it and I was honest with her and told her that I was a little jealous of her success on Twitch even though it didn't seem like she had put that much work and effort into her twitch stream as I had. And that it was in no way her fault I know it's just the way the website is and it's annoying.\n\nAt first she seemed to be understanding and agree feel bad about it but as we kept talking I pretty much said that it sucks because the only reason that your Twitch is blowing up so quickly is because you're a girl with a camera playing video games. And that's when she got really upset saying that people come to her streams because she's a good Entertainer and has a great personality. Which I told her I do believe but her being a girl with the camera is the first thing that people see when they're scrolling through Twitch and that is what causes them to click on her Channel at first.\n\nSo she was upset about this and we have not talked for about 2 weeks AITA for trying to be honest with my friend about what my problem was?\n\nI did apologize because I didn't want to ruin my friendship over something that I knew was small in the grand scheme of things. But the situation still kind of rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nTL:DR female friend start streaming years after me and is more successful even though less effort was put in. I am jealous and tell her about it honestly when she asked me about it. At first she's understanding then becomes upset when I say her success is because she's a girl.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for kicking a player out of our D&amp;D group because they can't do math?",
      "description": "I'll try and keep this short.  Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.",

She decided to date one of my friends Long distance, despite protest from all other friends, and they didnt work out. That friend she dated hates me now and no longer talks to me. She talks to me about her issues with guys and school and drugs. But she doesn't do the same for me. When being confrontational with her, she likes to make you feel like the bad guy for being honest. She is also a pathological liar, even though she says she never lies. She lied to my entire friend group saying she was in the hospital because of \"coke withdrawals\" yet talked to me on the phone that same night while she was at home chilling. I blocked her on all social media, and any way she could possibly reach out to me. AITA here??",

      "description": "(going to go ahead and apologize in advance for grammatical errors, English isn't my first language)\n\nHello, the title probably sounds bad alreadyso allow me to give some background info. I work at a very popular, green coffee shop. I don't work super often because I am in school right now (by that I mean I work 15-20hrs a week usually). My store manager is super chill, very understanding. However, our store is a tad understaffed, meaning my manager will often try to contact me to see if I can come in on my days off. I have a lot of days off so you'd think that would be no problem for me, right?\nWell, not necessarily. As I've already stated, I am in school. I have a very heavy course load, but that's not my main issue. \n\nI have a lot of mental health and family issues. To put things bluntly, I had a SEVERE breakdown earlier this month and I am still recovering, emotionally. I was put in counseling (not hospitalized), and have those sessions once a week. I am still having a very hard time and its been very difficult to even go to my scheduled shifts (I still do). For reference, I've only ever called out once. Anyway, the point is that it's been extremely difficult for me to come on my days off. \n\nMy manager doesn't like that I can't come in on my days off to cover shifts. I don't necessarily blame her, because every time she has asked this month, I have declined. However, I can't help but feel angry because she doesn't understand what's going on in my life. I've tried to explain to her that I'm going through a really hard time and it's difficult for me just to even get away from my family for a couple of hours. She doesn't seem to care, saying that I'm not committed enough, and that she needs more from me. I'm extremely conflicted because sometimes I think \"no screw her I have a lot going on.\" But sometimes I really do feel like she's right. I understand why she's upset with me, sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough for my store, and sometimes I feel like I need to push myself to go to more shifts. Am I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "A bit of background: For the first two months of college, i was really close with these friends. They’re really cool people and i genuinely like them. About a month ago, all of this started. I’m typing this up while eating lunch alone where we used to eat every single tuesday. \n\nRecently, my friends have not been responding to my messages in our group chat, and when I bring it up they just say “oh I didn’t see it” or “oh, we were busy”.  These messages can range from “do you want to study for x exam with me?” to “hey, when are you eating dinner?” since we used to study for all our exams together and the rest of the group still eats dinner together every night. I also study better when I have them around because i’m good at subjects the rest aren’t, and vice versa. \n\nSince they haven’t explicitly told me they’re not interested in being friends anymore, and I have a history of overanalyzing, I’ve been holding on to the lingering thread of hope that everything’s still fine. I know the few meeting spots where they like to congregate, so if I don’t get a response, I usually check these spots and “accidentally” run into them. They’re never upset to see me, and usually go the lines of “we would’ve invited you, but we thought you were busy”. Which strikes me as odd, because all 7 of them hang out together. This leads me to believe they have a secret group chat without me. However, they still do include me in group events, like buying movie tickets all together, and our secret santa gift exchange, so i’m not “cut off” from the group. \n\nAnyways, tldr: my friends stopped responding to my messages in the gc (and pms sometimes if im asking where we’re meeting), i know where they usually hang out and show up to spend time with them anyways.\n",

      "description": "Last week I totaled my truck due to some bad weather (I hit a patch of ice and lost control). Despite me driving the truck for 4 years, putting gas on it and covering maintenance, the title of the truck is still under my parent's name. The truck was given to me as a graduation gift. The only thing they currently pay for on the truck is my insurance (the truck is paid off). \n\nHowever, after they surrendered the vehicle to the insurance company, they told me I better \"start saving up for a new vehicle\". I kind of expected to at least receive the payout for the truck so I can put it towards a new vehicle (I estimate the payout to be at least 5,000 USD). \n\nAm I the asshole for expecting the money? I understand that they did pay insurance and gave me the truck, but I still feel kind of blind sighted by this. I'm a full time college student btw, and I don't have that much saved up. My dad, meanwhile, is a well-off lawyer. Idk, am I wrong? ",

      "description": "It all started in September of 2018. My roommate and I have been friends since high school and are now in our second year of college together. We’ve got a group of friends up at our school and we were all pretty cool with one another until September. \n\nSo my roommate, I’ll use A to identify her from here on out, had been on again off again seeing this guy for the better part of our freshman year. He was an absolute creep that made everyone uncomfortable, yet A always brought him around even when we told her we didn’t like him.  He strung her along for many, many months, despite the friend group urging her to cut him loose as he was causing her substantial amounts of anxiety. \n\nThen in October of the same year she held a party at our apartment, without asking if I was okay with it. To be honest I’d be fine with her hosting one, but I found out that she’d told one of my friends that I’d said it was okay to host one when I didn’t even know that it was a plan in motion??? That kind of pissed me off but I didn’t make a fuss about it. \n\nThere’s also a girl in our group, C, that is the nicest and most caring person I’ve met in a while. But A only talks to her whenever she needs a ride somewhere and in that time she verbally berates C and the rest of the friend group for not inviting her to things. But for hanging out it’s an open door policy, we show up at C’s apartment and chill and do homework, none of that’s planned so I’m not sure why she gets angry at that. \n\nSlowly since then she’s been isolating herself from the group, and then a few days ago she went on a twitter rant. She said that it was the friend group’s fault that she was depressed and that we should’ve reached out to her and seen if she was okay and that we should just assume that she was alright. But the thing is, I don’t think anyone wanted to help her because of how awful she’s been treating us for the past few months. Whenever someone went to her to confide in she’d just brush it off and not want to help them so I’m not too sure what treatment she was expecting.  \n\nWe’ve tried to tell her about this but she’s such a hardheaded and stubborn person she can’t see that she’s done anything wrong either, she just assumed that we all are maliciously trying to get rid of her when in reality we want to help her but she won’t let us. I’m starting to think she wants to be miserable?\n\nAll of this has led me to believe that moving her out of the friend group would be a stress reliever for the handful of us that have been dealing with her shenanigans for the past six months, AITA for thinking this and leaving her?",

My parents live in Malta (not really but I'd rather no one be able to ID me by chance). \n\nIn January, ticket prices were $1600ish for my daughter and I.\n\nThe prices shot up to $2000 because we didn't book. The trip was effectively cancelled as a result.\n\nA few weeks passed and on a Skype call with my mom, she mentions to me that she will pay for half the trip. Cool. Great! Thanks! \n\nI tell this to my wife and she books the trip for my daughter and I (she's the type A, she insisted on doing the booking).\n\nNow my parents are visiting us. My mom approaches me yesteday and gives me $500 and some local currency. Quite a bit actually. I say thank you.\n\nI tell my wife and she becomes angry, starts crying and tells me I manipulated her in booking this trip under false pretense. \n\nThe pretense, of course, being that my parents would pay for half when in fact, they \"only\" payed about 1/4 of the trip, arguably 1/3 with the other currency. \n\nShe starts going off on how she can't afford this with her Amex card. How she wouldn't have done any shopping today if she knew we'd only get $500 towards the trip. \n\nAm I supposed to go to my mother and say \"This isn't enough money. We agreed on half. This is 1/4.“?  I think that's pretty damn generous to begin with. \n\nIs my wife out to lunch here? Am I the asshole? I mean, I can't look a gift horse in the mouth. I consider this very nice of my parents. \n\nWe aren't broke as a couple, my wife and I, but yes, this trip IS gonna stretch us a tad when all is said and done. I also receive retroactive pay each year when my raise goes in in January which is usually a couple of grand. \n\nAITA?!",

This was a major trauma in my life.\n\nI have also ended up in unemployment and I have no drivers license which makes my life very difficult rn.\n\nMy parents were raised in a very conservative way. To them depression simply doesn't exist and they think the cure for depression is \"To get up and get a grip of your life\". They're also very career minded and money is a top priority.\n\nThis obviously leads to tensions. They ask me almost every day about job searching and drivers license. These two topics are very important, I get that, but they make me feel like a total loser when talking about them and I often get very sad and self-loathing when they're brought up.\n\nMy brother (16 y/o) also thinks it's hilarious to push me to talk about said subjects (usually through asking multiple times until I answer just to make him shut up) and it often ends with me being super angry of crying. He always get away scot-free. \n\nAfter one such incident I texted my mom and told her how I feel. I also asked her polietly to talk with my dad and brother about avoiding these subjects in future coversations. She them answered that she can't force somebody to not speak.\n\nI never said I wanted them to never speak but to just avoid two out of a million things to talk about. She didn't answer.\n\nFrom then on I just ask as polite as I can if we can change the subject whenever they're brought up. My brother always yell out \"FREEDOM OF SPEECH\" while my parents tell me to be more tolerant.\n\nSo to end this wall of text, Am I the asshole? ",

This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA",

Her family thought I was just trying to use her even though we were never dating and I've never taken money from her. \n\nMy bestfriend is fully aware of this but still feels like I need to make amends even though they hate me based off a false assumption. \n\nI felt like it was messed up to dismiss our plans and then try to guilt me into spending time with people that have made it clear verbally, multiple times, that they don't like me. So I canceled and took another shift at work because I figured I might as well be making money instead. My coworker said I was cold blooded and wrong. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend found out her grandpa is sick in the hospital and tells me the same day she is driving 9 hours to go see him and will be gone a week. Apparently it is not looking good and no one knows for sure if he will recover. Normally I would tell her of course you gotta go but not now and here is why.\n\nFirstly we are behind on a couple bills and just barely paid rent this month. My gf lost her full time job and now only works a couple days a week and doing food delivery apps plus donates plasma. All together it doesn't bring in what we need. I have 2 jobs to try to make ends meet and now I'm looking for a 3rd because she is not covering her half. I told her I need you here applying and interviewing for new jobs.\n\nSecondly she is a terrible driver. She's had multiple accidents the last couple years and has not driven long distance before. I'm worried because she is going to be by herself. She has no idea how to change a tire, check oil level or tire pressure for that matter. On top of that it's icy and snowy where she's headed.\n\nLastly I really depend on her for rides to and from one of my jobs. It does not sit on a bus route. So I'm either stuck walking 45 min to an hour one way in freezing weather or spending anywhere from 40-60 bucks on uber over this week, money I can't afford right now. If she had a full time job I could quit that one and not rely on her.\n\nSo yea I told her she shouldn't go see her sick grandpa, but AITA for it?",

      "description": "Sorry it's a little long, TLDR at the end.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have had a few rocky fights from time to time, usually nothing too big and over menial things that we both agree we shouldn't be fighting about. I still love her after the fights and I usually want them to be over and resolved as quickly as possible because I don't want to damage what we have over something stupid and meaningless to us. \n\nRecently we had a brief argument about the Gillette 'We Believe: the best men can be' commercial. She told me that she agreed with the commercial on a whole because to her it only told men that they should be better and there's nothing wrong with that. She supported this by saying that her own personal experience with horrible guys in her life is why she believes some men need to do better and that we should welcome this message. I told her I disagree but that I am sorry with the experiences she's had. I don't want to open the whole can of worms over the Gillette ad on Reddit either because I know we all have our own stances on the topic, but mine branches more over my belief that businesses should try to remain as apolitical as possible (although an argument could be made that the ad was no political based, and I partially agree) and that the ad does more than just imply men should be better, it also puts the onus of many detestable actions (typically singular to men) at the feet of all men while said actions are largely not as prevalent as the ad implies they are. Sorry for the tangent, but I believe at least some of our stances were required to understand where we stood.\n\n At first our argument was not heated at all, we just disagreed. My girlfriend tried to push things further to say that I was not seeing things from her perspective and that I can't, to which I countered that I try to see it from her perspective as much as I can but I know I could never truly see things through the eyes of a woman and that same caveat applied to her with my perspective. She kicked me out of our room and told me that if I didn't shut up she would 'literally break up with you right now.' Of course I left and kept my mouth shut because I didn't want to end us on something so petty. \n\nFlash forward maybe an hour and I returned to our room and apologised to her. I told her I shouldn't have come to her with something I disagreed with, expecting her to support me and that it was a horrible mindset to have for someone you love. I know she usually avoids political conversation while I myself try to stay up to date. I told her that I felt it was unhealthy for me to feel the way I felt about the ad and that it was a very petty thing to be worked up over, and regardless I believe it got under my skin. I told her I was sorry and that I'll try my best to avoid coming to her over political things again, as it's not right for me to use her as a filter for my views. I told her I knew we wouldn't always agree on these things and I accept that, I won't push it further. She accepted my apology and we moved on as normal. That was three days ago now and I have been actively avoiding making comments on anything relating to that Gillette ad. At one point she was laughing and I asked her what's up, she said she was just reading a Facebook post that had a meme about the Gillette ad. I just smiled and left her on her phone, which felt freeing to just ignore something like that. \n\nAnyway, today she shared a post with me on Facebook regarding a girl's reaction to a recent horrific murder in a city in my country of a woman making her way home at night. I truly deplore what happened to this young woman and believe it was a great tragedy, but the post drew parallels between men's reaction to the Gillette ad at the same time as the occurrence of this girl's murder. After reading I did what I always do upon receiving a meme or post from her, I asked my girlfriend why she sent this to me. She said she thought it would show a different light to the Gillette ad that I hadn't thought of. I told her that I had already seen posts relating to this but the situation was vastly different between the ad and this girl's murder. She got exasperated and told me I don't understand, I told her I do or at least try to. She said that she knows men get murdered too but probably mostly by men too (this seemed like an odd comment and I hadn't said anything to spark it), to which I said yes they are. Then she said see! I said they're still different points but I don't want to argue about the ad. She then said \"You got angry at me because you expect me to agree with you all the time\", to which I said that I didn't believe that, and I had even apologised specifically for that line of thinking just the other day. I told her again I was trying to avoid talking about the ad because it's meaningless, to which she also shouted the same thing back at me. She then started yelling at me and calling me far-right, which I disagreed with because I'm mainly centre-left. I told her about the alt-right and how I disagree with them. She proceeded to say I've become blinded and don't want to hear other opinions. I told her all I try to do is hear other opinions and debate to understand which views to hold, that only through discussion can we prove each other right or wrong and that I always look for opinions to prove me wrong so I can correct myself if needed. That was the climax, she started making her lunch in the kitchen and slamming around dishes, I left the room because I don't feel comfortable near her when she gets like this (in brings up past memories of family before shouting matches). This is where I am now, in a separate room and trying to cool my thoughts. \n\nSo I guess to summarise this; AITA for not backing down to her and instead trying to shut down the conversation? I believe I tried to see things from her perspective and let her know I'm okay with disagreeing on certain things and that I didn't expect to always agree, but I won't denounce my opinion just because it angers her. I don't think I should be expected to give in just to appease her, when she hasn't won me over with her reasoning to begin with. AITA?\n\nTLDR; My GF and I argued over the Gillette commercial a few days ago, we apologised and made up. I avoided anything relating to that ad but it was brought back up again regardless, and now we've had a fight over it all over again. I didn't back down but instead tried to end the conversation. AITA?",

      "description": "I (32f) have a child (1m) with my boyfriend (41m) of 7 years. Over the past four days or so, our son has been pretty sick with a respiratory illness -- not bad enough for the hospital, but bad enough to keep him home from daycare as he is coughing up massive amounts of phlegm and has been very listless and fussy.\n\nYesterday, my boyfriend said he wanted to take our son to the mall to \"get out for some exercise and fresh air\". I said that isn't a good idea, considering he was on day 3 of a very bad chest cold and currently has a compromised immune system. We live in a relatively populated area and I just don't think a sick baby needs to be at the mall, for various reasons. He argued with me about it, but then relented and said he agreed with me.\n\nToday, he stated  -- again -- that he wanted to take our son to the mall. This annoyed me, considering the fact that I already told him yesterday that I was uncomfortable with this and I reiterated the exact reasons why. He is still quite sick and has been having coughing fits where it is difficult for him to catch his breath. He proceeded to tell me that I was \"keeping our son cooped up and not letting him get the exercise he needs to get better\". He said I'm keeping him in a bubble. \n\nI reminded him that, yes, we've taken him to the mall and other places plenty of times, but not when he is sick; there is a difference. He became very cold towards me and basically refused to engage further in the conversation until I relented and allowed a compromise of taking a short walk outside instead, if the weather wasn't too bad.\n\nWe then took a walk with our sick toddler outside where it is -10 with the wind chill. I expressed that I didn't think it was a good idea to go on this walk, but he continued ahead with our son, so I followed. When we arrived back inside the apartment, our son's face was alarmingly red and I began checking his skin because I was afraid he might have frostbite. My boyfriend then said: \"yeah maybe that wasn't a great idea, we're bad parents.\"\n\nI responded that this was not my idea. He said \"fine, I'm the bad parent.\" I didn't correct him.\n\nThis is not the first time we've had problems like this. I admit that I do have problems with anxiety, and my boyfriend frequently uses this against me. Whenever I express that I am uncomfortable with something because I feel it's not in the best interests of our son's safely, I'm told that I am being unreasonable and he either straight up ignores me or fights with me until I am too mentally stressed to fight back anymore. This is just the most recent incident, and I really need some outside opinions on this.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to take our sick child to the mall?",

      "description": "My wife and I were with good friends the other night, having drinks and playing games. Later in to the night the party unconsciously divides itself between the men and the women. The women were sitting down at a table talking, and I was watching March Madness with the guys. We’re all talking and laughing when one of the girls walks up behind me, cackles, and says for the whole group of people to hear, “Your mom is the blow-job queen!”. I was so surprised and put-off I responded with, “...hehe...what are you talking about?” Another girl walks up behind her and follows with, “Ya your mom gives the best blow jobs, hahaha, she’s the queen.” Nothing more is said. At this point I’m so surprised two people have repeated that, so I shutdown. I’m not making a frown face, crying, or being aggressive or mean. I just decide to continue watching TV and not talking. \n\nMy wife quickly tells everyone that she has to work early in the morning (which was true), so we will have to leave. After some awkward hugs goodbye (I’m sure our friends could sense something was up), we get in the car. Immediately I am pressed with how I humiliated my wife, how I made it awkward for everyone, and how I was being selfish and unreasonable. I’m so shocked at my wife saying this I get angry. I ask her how she would respond if someone talked about her mother that way. She responds with, “We we’re talking about a game at my bachelorette party and your mom won the game!”. This is the first time I’m getting context. She then proceeds to continue trying to tell me I am wrong because our friends intent wasn’t malicious. I then get upset because not once did she try to understand things from my perspective (zero context to the mom statements, no clarification from friends, etc). \n\nI felt like she wasn’t on my side and didn’t try to understand where I was coming from, or why I would be upset. I’m embarrassed for shutting down in public, and now I’m dealing with a marital argument. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Two years ago, he and I broke up after he was abusive toward me, and at one point I sent a message to our shared friend group explaining the situation and why I wouldn't be around anymore. (We're all late 20s.) Now, he's gone through therapy/anger management and we're giving it another shot. \n\nHis female best friend and I haven't really spoken since then - she took issue with me telling the group about the abuse and didn't seem to believe me. When my boyfriend recently let her know we're getting back together, she claimed that I had told her back then that he'd raped me. \n\nThis NEVER happened. In my two-year-old message I was very clear that the abuse was emotional with one instance of physical. Sexual abuse was NEVER a part of it and as someone who takes sexual assault very seriously, I would never make something like that up. This girl claims she deleted the messages where I supposedly said this but it \"stuck in her mind.\"\n\nPartner told me \"she'll apologize eventually\" and expects me to \"make nice\" (his words) with her when she does, because he wants us to get along. He doesn't seem to understand what a serious accusation that is and how much it hurts me. I am not interested in being around this girl and would not be comfortable spending time with her. I also feel somewhat betrayed that he doesn't seem to be angry with her at all, not on my behalf OR his (this is someone whose hair-trigger temper has been an issue in the past.) If the situations were reversed, I'd cut out that friend. We had an argument about it and now he's upset with me for \"bashing\" him and refusing to get over it \"because I love him.\"\n\nI genuinely don't know if I'm being unreasonable or not. ",

      "description": "Me (F19) and some friends (about the same age) were meeting up to catch up on our lives. The plan was to get together at around 5pm at the subway station nearest to my appartment (roughly 30min walk). This was arranged by one friend, N (F18), so that I could guide her to the place and not get lost.\n\nMost were already on their way, and when I got there at about 5pm, only N was missing. At 5.30pm, I sent a message, asking her where she was. Two stations away, she said, so we waited. Another fifteen minutes go by and she's nowhere to be seen. I asked her again and she said she was on her way to her home to leave the things she'd bought.\n\nI though, \"What the hell?\" and asked her what she meant. N told me she'd gone to the mall and bought some clothes she needed, and was gonna go back home to leave them. I got mad, so I told her \"But its going to take you at least an hour and a half to get here!\" to which she replied, \"just wait for me, I 'll be there\".\n\nI was furious and asked her why she'd done that, and told me she bought some stuff for her appartment that she needed. I asked my friends if they would mind waiting for her, and decided we would.\n\nTwenty minutes go by and I receive one last message from N, saying she was exhausted and wouldn't meet with us. I sent her \"Ok, then we're leaving for the appartment. This is the adress if you change your mind. But, for the next time, be respectful with other people's schedules and tell us if you had to do something beforehand. What you just did is messed up.\"\n\nI locked my phone and began walking to the appartment with my friends. When we got there, I check my phone and there are at least 20 new messages from N.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nN: I didn't expect this from you. I hurried up, have blisters on my feet for running and you don't even care for my efforts. I always put up with you and you can't even wait for me.\n\nMe: It is basic human decency to arrive on time. And don't you dare to forget that we set the time to be 5pm because of you. You can't go around changing the time when you feel like it.\n\nN: When I feel like it? You don't even understand what I've been through, so keep on living in your perfect fantasy world with no money issues, no depression, with appliances that do everything for you and a family that loves you. You are incredibly stupid for not even having the decency to guide me to your appartment when you know I've only been living in this city for a week.\n\nAnd then she blocked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm aware that I've had a pretty assholish behavior in the past and that what she said could make some sense. We aren't rich, but we don't struggle much. I moved to this city about a year ago from a place where you could get everywhere by walking, and I got used to it just fine. She did the same, a year after, and has only been here for a week, so maybe I'm really not putting myself in her place and I was the one who did something wrong.\n\nI just don't know what to think anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I am planning on writing and drawing my own comic i want it to be fairly realistic in full color with painted backgrounds possibly some parts even being animated, it’s gonna be a bitch to make. So I came up with the idea of sculpting pose able models of my characters out of clay so that i could take pictures of them in hard to draw angles and poses to save time. The first one i made took around 3 months it was extremely hard but all together I’m very happy with it especially the face which was the hardest part. I had never sculpted anything before so I was pretty proud of myself and showed my friends and told them my plan and they said i would be cheating if i took pictures of my own handmade model and traced it for my comic. Also one of the friends who said this is an artist too who regularly traces other people’s art for collages or other things she won’t lie if you ask her if it’s traced but she tells people she ‘made’ it but is careful to avoid the word “drew”. I was very hurt when my friends said this and i told them that and they were very annoyed with me and told me they were just being honest and i would be cheating if i followed through with my plan. Which i personally feel is like telling a 3D animator they are cheating because they didn’t draw every single one of their frames but instead made models. What do you guys think?\n\nTLDR: my friends said i would be cheating if i traced my own handmade model of my characters for my comic book which i made to save time drawing hard to draw angles and poses. \n",

One of them even exclaimed it was “just like Clifford the big red dog”. I was sitting on the other end of the classroom on my laptop, but the lesson hadn’t started yet so the room wasn’t too full of people or conversations. I turned in my seat and said “You guys know that was an April fools joke right? It’s all photoshop.” They asked if I was serious and I said yeah, and then they just kinda gave me the side eye and started talking amongst themselves much quieter. I didn’t feel like I sounded rude or judgmental, but am worried it came across that way. I don’t feel like I am very popular with the people in my major to begin with, mostly due to being introverted and socially insecure, so I may just be overthinking it entirely.

      "description": "AITA for telling my mother that she was being selfish for wanting to abandon her kids ASAP to persue her other life interests? \n\nYesterday me(17M) and my mother(43F) were having a very real, very irritating conversation about her no longer wanting to live with me and take care of me anymore. My mother wants me to drop out of school, and live away from home because she wants to \"follow her dreams\" and not have to wait a year for her to be able to \"legally\" leave me. The legality of the situation is the only reason she hasn't thrown me out already. She essentially wants me to \"choose to leave\" as soon as I get my own income, so that she can't get in trouble for it. Otherwise, she'll just straight up kick me out the day I turn 18. What are her dreams that are oh so important, you ask? She wants to live on the streets so she can save money so she can afford new teeth and breast implants. Yeah, I know...but you really just can't make this stuff up. So she was doing her usual of hounding me and saying she hates being my carer(this sounds like I'm playing it up so people will think \"he's in the right!\" or whatever, but this is something I hear from her almost constantly), and that she can't take care of me and that she wants to move away as soon as I find my own income. \n\nUsually, I'm understanding with this. I don't really want to live with her anyway, because everything is always a problem. There is no conversation with her that doesn't somehow turn into an argument lately. And not just with me, but with pretty much everyone. But yesterday (and honestly, still today) I was already hearing and dealing with a lot of bad and unrelated shit from other people, so I really didn't want to hear her ramble on about stuff I was already in the midst of working on. So after what felt like ages of her flipping out about it, I lost my cool and told her that she was \"Extremely selfish because she'd throw her kids away at the drop of a hat so she can persue her ridiculous plan\". As you might expect, she absolutely lost it. Continued to tell me that I'm the reason that she now wants to smoke again, because I stressed her out? She went on and on about how I'm the selfish one, because I \"force her\" to stay with me. Her whole thing only ended because she decided that she wanted to go out and get drunk because of \"how stressed I made her!\".\n\nSo since I spoke back to her yesterday, she's been angry as hell and just completely ignoring me. I feel like an asshole, but I also kinda...don't. Like, I felt like it was something she did need to hear, but maybe not in the moment. I've been contemplating apologizing, but I also just don't feel like I should have to. :/ I'm conflicted, really. I mean, maybe I am the one who's being selfish here? Obviously, she really wants to live elsewhere and do her own thing, and according to her, I'm the only thing that's been in her way to going ahead with it. But like I said...I already was looking into finding a job and somewhere else to stay, so I'm literally doing exactly what she wants. But yeah, that's the whole point of AITA, Reddit. So what do y'all think? Was I the asshole in this situation? Should I just do exactly as she says and apologize? \n\nA little extra information- Me and my mother usually get somewhat along...a few arguments here and there, but nothing terribly serious. She's only been extremely moody since she developed her \"plan\" a few months ago(when I was 16). In more detail, her plan is that she wants to move away from our current house to live on the streets and save money on rent, and other bills that she would be paying if she were still living here. She wants to save this money, because she wants to \"fix herself up to look young again\". This involves quite a lot, but the two main things are that she wants to fix her teeth and her boobs. Worst thing is, she doesn't even want to do all this for herself, or or her own self image. She wants to do it so she can \"find a rich boyfriend who can buy her whatever she wants and also love her\". She believes that it's almost impossible for a man to respect her with how she looks now(she looks fine, she's not at all \"ugly\" or anything like that). So when I tell her things like \"Your teeth aren't a problem!\" She flips out and says that she wouldn't date a man who would be okay with her teeth (her teeth are fine, not perfect, but really average). Also, I'm not a \"problem child\" by any means. Just wanted to put that out there because I know how Reddit loves to jump to conclusions. I do extremely well in school, I'm generally respectful to adults and I haven't been in any legal trouble, heck, I don't think I've even been I'm trouble since I started highschool.\n",

      "description": "I have a son (12 months old) that was scheduled to start daycare next week.  We'd booked a spot half a year ago with a daycare and already submitted our first months schedule.  A few days ago we learned through Facebook that the daycare provider got a one year old puppy (will not name the breed to prevent bias) that I must mention is untrained.  The pictures posted on Facebook showed the puppy playing with the kids, sharing the same space as where the kids play.  We decided to notify the daycare that we were not going to have our son attend there because we feel uncomfortable with the puppy.  The reaction was quite hostile, Facebook \"shaming\", for being dog haters etc.  I actually love dogs but it's a trust issue with a strange, untrained animal.  Are we over-reacting here?  It's wasn't an easy decision to make as daycares are hard to come by on such short notice.  ",

      "title": "AITA for abandoning my friend",
      "description": "So a couple months ago I cut ties with one of my friends (we will call her A) because I couldn't deal with how she would treat me.\n\nFor context, due to past experiences I tend to be closed and untrusting in person, this has led to me putting on a persona of a cocky joker, to an almost arrogant degree, in order to try and push people away.\n\nBack onto A. We had been friends for about 2-3 years and I was more open than I was with anyone, talking about my problems and feelings, and I was there for her. I remember that within a month of being her friend she invited me to her place which surprised me a bit (she seemed introverted and being alone with her in her room was a bit odd).\n\nBut as time went on she seemed to like me less. Saying \"LMAO sucks to be you haha\" when I talked about my problems. She started complaining about my choice in music and nicknames I gave. While I still talked to her about my issues and she occasionally said things about hers. \n\nShe would often times come over to me, and tell me how \"so and so thought I was being especially rude today\", or how \"such and such said you were very quite when the movie we saw was on.\" never really talking about how she thought, she would also take anything I said about anyone and directly tell them it without warning, (I once said that I didn't know if someone liked me as a friend, and A went and asked them. I only know because they told me after) \n\nEvery so often I would ask if she hated me or imply though conversation that she would, each time she acted surprised. \n\nI would try to hide how it hurt me each time something like that happened bc I was so lonely that I wanted someone to be there, she would reply instantly to my texts and that felt nice.\n\nEventually it got to where I might show her some photo of a garden I took hours getting right, to which she would point out how terrible it was (\"you could have at least done -x-, how bad at this can you be?\") which again I would hide my hurt.\n\nSo after a couple months of this I decided that enough was enough and stopped talking to her, I stopped texting her, I stopped sitting near her, and I would leave when ever she came near. I burned all the bridges I had with her.\n\nAfter a week or two she texted me asking if I hated her. I said that I didn't but that I didn't want to have anything to do with her anymore. She asked why, to which I tried to explain. The last message she sent was \"haha maybe I should just stop talking\" I didn't reply.\n\nSince then a number of mutual friends have expressed how they think I did the wrong thing. One claiming that I was a worst friend of his because of it. Another said that she was morally justified because she had a crush on me at one point. A third Claims it is the worst most evil thing I have done.\n\nThis shook my boat a bit and I tried to look back to see if there was any hint that number 2 was right, that she did like me, and there was. On one occasion A and I were talking about crushes and decided to play a yes or no game. I narrowed it down to me and one other person and she said no to the other (I was sure she didn't like me at the time). On a different occasion I was joking about how no one liked me to which she said that she would date me (I thought it was a joke so I moved on). And I even found a note I had received in similar handwriting to hers saying that I was pretty good looking.\n\nSo now I don't know what to think. It seems that most people think I was the asshole here. But a few others swear I wasn't.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI had this friend called A, she would say things that made me feel bad, I was trying to hide how I felt and didn't really acknowledge the insults. Enough was enough so I stopped talking to her. A few friends said it was a bad choice. I don't really know anymore.\n\nLet me know if you need any more information",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this brief.  I think IATA in this situation but decided I should seek an official answer so I can finally rest easy either way.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was on a mission trip and there was another family there including a young boy, maybe around age 10, whose parents I'd gotten to know.  For part of the trip we were near a beach.  This kid pocketed a salt water sea snail.  Later we were doing some work on a building that was being renovated and eventually would become a sort of community outreach place.  The kid (who I was on good terms with) approached me to show me some things he collected at the beach.  A few pebbles and a snail that was literally on death's door.  We were a far bus ride back to town and there didn't seem to be anyway for this snail to survive.  There was no running water at this building though water bottles were available and it was located near a neighborhood.  This snail looked to be minutes from a cold, lonely death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my non expert opinion, it seemed there was literally no hope for this snail to live.  Rather than let him walk around with a dead snail in his pocket, I told him we should \"let it go.\"  Well what I meant by this was basically let it die outside of his pocket.  He later told his parents who seemed furious (in a very passive aggressive way) about this whole matter; pretty much ruined the relationship I had with them.  But really, would it have been that much cooler for me to just let him walk around and then see the snail die in his pocket?  I feel bad about it but need to verify I should.  Or maybe I should've stuck it in a water bottle? but that seemed pointless (not sure it can even survive outside of salt water).  Thanks reddit.  I await your advice.",

      "description": "I'm asking because I genuinely have no idea whether I'm doing the right thing. \n\nMy sister has mental health issues that are particularly ill at evening and night-time. I've been there for her for months, but tonight I just didn't have the energy. She has called me a few times tonight and flat-out asked if I can come over to help, but for the first time, I have said I need some rest and to get some work done.\n\nI've moved back home with my parents to help her, and she lives in her own apartment in the same building. There are only two people that calm her down (to some extent), and that is me and my brother. My brother can't be there for her because he is going through a lot too, and is battling his own mind.\n\nShe is in treatment 3 times every week, but it hasn't helped. She has been severely depressed for over 10 years, and it only continues to get worse.\n\nA normal night will start with us playing games, but she will gradually become hysterical. This happens every single night. She begins with becoming hyper, then hysterical, and then become delirious. A regular night involves self-harming in front of me, running outside to hurt herself, locking herself into the bathroom with medicines or a knife, being aggressive and violent towards me, crying hysterically and over-eating. It's clear that she is just looking for an outlet. She feels so hysterical and desperate, but nothing seems to give her peace... \n\nI don't know what to do, but I have no more energy. It just doesn't get better, and I think she needs professional help. The doctors believe she is in the right treatment, but I can't see any improvement. I'm certain she will hurt herself tonight while I'm gone, and worried she will do something worse. I don't know what to do, but I have nothing more to give.   \n\n\nStill, it makes me feel like an asshole to not be there for her even though she is suicidal, should I pull myself together and go another mile? I can hear her crying hysterically through the wall, but I'm just sitting here enjoying a few hours of my own company.",

      "title": "AITA for being upset that I wasn’t part of my brother’s wedding?",
      "description": "So my brother and I have always been fairly close (we have no other siblings), and a few years back, he told me he was going to propose to his long term girlfriend. I was ecstatic for him - I offered to go ring shopping with him (I’m female and he said he was clueless about rings), I jokingly asked to be best man or a groomsman (I wasn’t seriously expecting to be either), or literally anything else in the wedding, as I was (and still am) genuinely really happy for them.\n\nThe wedding day gets closer - I’m getting excited and my brother’s keeping me in the loop about who his groomsmen are going to be, venue, etc. Myself and my now sister-in-law have never been very close (as far as I’m aware, there’s no bad blood between us, we’re just very different people and have never really ‘clicked’, but she’s a great match for my brother and we get along well enough), so I’m not in the loop on her side of the planning, and that’s fine - I didn’t expect to be. I get the impression from my parents that she’s doing most of the wedding planning, as a lot of brides tend to do. Anyway, I hear through my parents that there probably aren’t going to be any bridesmaids, so I don’t think about it any further, and I’m just getting excited for the big day. \n\nBig day roles around. We’re in the church service, and both her parents and my parents have certain roles in the ceremony (speeches etc), so for a good portion of it, I’m stood in the front row alone while they’re all up by the alter. Still, it’s no big deal, and I’m not questioning anything at this point. My sister-in-law starts coming down the aisle, and her sister (her only other sibling) and her best friend are bridesmaids. This is a surprise to me because I didn’t think she was having bridesmaids. \n\nAfter the ceremony, we head to the reception. We’re all about to take our assigned seats for the meal, and my mother rushes over to me as I’m making my way to the head table (I’d just assumed I’d be sat there with my immediate family), and she tells me I’m not seated at that table. I’m really confused at this point - it’s just me, my brother and parents in the immediate family (and we’re not at all close with our extended family, particularly those on my father’s side, some of whom we hadn’t seen in years). My sister-in-law’s immediate family is just her sister and her parents, who are all seated at the head table at this point, along with my brother and my dad. \n\nMy mother tells me it’s not traditional for anyone other than the parents and the bridesmaids to be at the head table. She says it’s traditional for all other relatives to sit with the family they share a last name with, so I’m therefore seated with my dad’s family, who I barely know. I had and still have no real clue about traditional wedding etiquette (does this set-up sound right?), so even though I’m bummed I won’t be sat with them, it’s their day, so it’s their call, so I go and sit with dad’s family without complaint. \n\nSo for the whole meal, my immediate family are eating on the head table stage, having a great time, making speeches and taking tons of pictures. It was getting harder and harder to not cry as the meal went on (particularly when my bitchy aunt asked if I was upset that I wasn’t sat with them... ugh), but I managed to keep it together and act normal because i didn’t want to ruin their day. I was just really sad not to be part of it, and that was compounded by being sat with people who, frankly, are basically strangers to me.\n\nThe after party went on for a while and I barely got a chance to talk with my brother and now-sister-in-law because they were partying with their friends and her/my parents. When I did manage to speak with them, I made sure to congratulate them, tell them how great the venue was, how lovely her dress was etc etc, so I made sure not to make it about myself. \n\nTowards the end of the night, everyone was drunk, and being an introvert at a social event, I was mostly either awkwardly trying to mingle with strangers, or awkwardly sitting by myself and trying not to appear awkward. It felt like being at a party with strangers, so I eventually called a taxi back to my hotel before my parents etc left (I don’t think they or my brother even noticed I left early).\n\nAnyway, I didn’t say anything about it for about a year, because I don’t want to be THAT person - the a*hole who makes someone else’s wedding day all about them. \n\nI did eventually ask my brother why it didn’t seem like he wanted me to celebrate with him - I also wasn’t in any of the photos throughout the day (or in the professional photos taken at the church before the ceremony), so it always just seemed strange to me. My brother said that his wife did most of the wedding planning, he mentioned the tradition thing like my mom had said, and he also said that it was basically just an oversight that I wasn’t really included on the day. \n\nAITA for still being upset/confused by this? I keep thinking maybe I’m overreacting, but if I’m not overreacting then.... why didn’t they want me to be a part of their wedding day? I really don’t understand it because if I got married, I would want my big brother to be there with me throughout. ",

      "description": "So there's a girl from my old job who's in a group that keeps in touch with one another. I like everyone BUT this chick, and I'm the only one who calls her out on her crap. She's a very mean, douchey person who regularly makes others in my group of friends feel bad. She constantly criticizes people to their face or talks bad about other behind their back, but people are too nice in our group to ever kick her out or say anything. For reference, she told one of my other female friends that \"she looks like she did her makeup in the dark.\" \n\n\n\nI think it's because they know she's lonely but honestly you're over 21 years old, start to act like it. She even told one of my friends (who I'm pretty inclined to and have a close relationship with) that at another party I walked her out, gave her \"a look\", and then realized that people were around so I didn't make out with her, but that I wanted to. I can't even describe how much that made me want to projectile vomit everywhere, and the person she told that to was trying not to laugh during it. \n\n\nSo I'm having a Christmas party where I invited my old work friends and my friends from around the area that I've known forever. Everyone is cool and gets along except for this girl. I had a party at my house over summer and while there, she got too drunk, hit on one of my friends and made him super uncomfortable, puked in my backyard and on my bathroom wall, and just overall sucked. She actually went up to other girls at the party and said \"Im the ugliest one here\" and while hitting on my friend, who just met her, said \"You only remember the pretty girls' names\" when someone he already met had been brought up in conversation. On top of that, she never apologizes for being a straight up cunt. \n\n\n\n\nSo I'm not inviting her to my upcoming party, but I feel like I'll be labeled as a huge asshole for not inviting her. After all, I'm going out of my way to invite everyone individually instead of our group to keep her out, but she just sucks the life out of everything. She's rude, awkward, and not funny or cool enough to give her a pass on these sort of things. Am i the asshole, should i invite her and hope for the best?",

      "description": "Usually I’m (24m) the one who tries to comfort my gf when she’s sad and be there when she needs me, but this time roles are reversed.\n\nIn my childhood i went through a pretty traumatic period that I haven‘t told anyone about. I just kind of suppressed it by holing up and  and later started with bodybuilding to get my confidence back up. last week I met one of the people who made my life hell back then, and when he told me i look better than the pussy i was back then, the memories just came back. When i got home i just started crying and wanted my gf to hold me for a while. She seemed more disgusted at seeing me like this (i believe it‘s the first time she saw me cry and the first time i cried in years) and left for a while. I feel like shit for getting emotional over it, and even my friend told me i was just being a pussy when i told him about it.\n\nIn the end i couldn’t take it and just packed my shit and have been holing myself up in a hotel again. I ignored all calls and texts from my gf, but now my friend called me and told me i was an asshole for ghosting her for no reason and leaving her only with the cash we had at home (she has no access to my account and I used to pay for almost everything, but she does work part time and i own the house so she should be fine for now). I just want to be alone for a while now. The one thing worse than being alone is being alone when someone is right next to you. AITA for running away?",

      "description": "I (29M) was in a long distance relationship (26F) that was non-exclusive. We had great physical and emotional chemistry and fell in love fairly quickly. Since we were VERY far apart and both had healthy sex drives, we mutually decided to date/hook-up with other people until we were living in the same city, and then we would re-evaluate. There was a sense that even after we were living in a new city, we might continue to be open because we’d both previously been in relationships where our sex lives stagnated.\n\nWhile we were living apart, a different girl and I hooked up after at a party. She told me she didn’t have any sort of STDs. I had been tested recently and hadn’t had unprotected sex since I had been tested. She was on birth control so we had sex without a condom.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out she did have, and thus I contracted, an STD (chlymidiya). I got tested as part of a routine physical and it came back positive. I immediately went on anti-biotics for a week and then got re-tested and was clear of all STDs. \n\nFast forward a couple months and my girlfriend and I meet up and continued having sex. We always wear protection, and at this point, I’m completely clear of having any STDs. I never mention anything about the recent STD to her mostly because it’s embarrassing and because I took the necessary steps to make sure she wasn’t at risk.\n\nShe later was helping me pack and found some papers in my bag related to the test. When she asked me about it, I came clean and told her I got one, but that I made sure to take care of it ASAP, and that I’ve been clean every time I’ve slept with her. \n\nShe was very, very upset and said she never wanted to see me again. A couple days later she said she would try to move past it because we love each other so much. When we tried getting back together, it was clear that there was too little trust between us for the relationship to work so we ended things.\n\nWhile I deceived her through omission, on a scale of 1-10, how big of an asshole am I? Also, on a scale of 1-10, how upset is she justified in being?",

      "description": "This may sound like a typical run of the mill sibling rivalry, but I’m sick of everything and I can’t do much because I’m young.\n\nLets start off with my brother. Annoying, a druggie, high school drop out, and overall fucking jerk. 25 years old. Is “sick” and had/currently still has autism. My relationship with them is nonexistent, and always has been. I’ve tried to make amends, but its always ended in them just yelling at me and my parents taking his side for stupid situations that are clearly his fault. I’ve been verbally and physically abused by them ever since I can remember, from them busting my front teeth out while they were in high school over a slushie, to them constantly butting in to conversations and disrespecting my parents, constantly arguing with both me and my family, always threatening to smack me and cursing at them. My parents have done the best they can to help him out, from offering to give him money, get him a job, funding rehab and therapy classes, and he simply doesn’t want to do anything.  All I’ve witnessed are constant fights over him stealing money and using any of the money that my parents DO give him to buy drugs. Theres not a single day that there isn’t an argument in my household. Its come to the point where I absolutely just hate being home and in my brothers presence in general, because all he does is call me a worthless brat, a bitch, and a few threats to bust my face in. He’s overstayed his welcome in this house, but my parents refuse to do anything with him and just baby him by putting him on a pedestal. When I did get extremely frustrated and voice my concerns to my mother in a car ride one day, she called me crazy, yelling at me that he’s my brother and that to not pay attention to him because he’s “sick.”\n\nHowever, I simply cannot just ignore him anymore when it’s been happening for all my life, and him having a mental disorder doesn’t give him any more of an excuse to be an asshole. I’m pretty open in saying that if this man got into a car accident one day, then I wouldn’t feel sorry or worried at all.\n\nAITA for feeling this way towards someone who I SHOULD be relatively close to?

      "description": "Alright, so first I'd like to apologize for my english, as I'm not a native speaker.  \n\n\nSecond, this is a throwaway account, as my friends know my usual tag.  \n\n\nNow, onto my story. Basically, we're 8-10 guys, who all know each other irl. Me and the server owner have known each other for around 10ish years, and we're basically best friends. Now, about half of the server plays League of Legends, and the other half makes a few jokes about it. Nothing serious, usually it's stuff like: \"Why don't you stop playing that shitty game and play \\[insert random game the whole server could play together\\].\" It's usually all in good fun, ( at least that's what I thought) and we all have a good laugh about it. But today was different. I make the same joke as always, but instead of the usual laugh all of us have, the server owner creates a voice channel and locks it for all of the people that don't play League.   \n\n\nIt's also not the first time he's done things that are - in my opinion at least - a misuse of the admin priviliges on the discord server. He moves people into different channels randomly, mutes people for everyone, and stuff like that. It's usually only small pranks that last for maybe 10 seconds tops, and we usually laugh about it. It's just today that I've realized that stuff like that has gotten more and more frequent.  \n\n\nAfter talking to another person that doesn't play League for a bit, I decided to leave the server. Am I the asshole for getting all pissed about what's basically my best friend excluding half of our group from talking with the other half? Obviously I don't know what the League players think about this, since they've been in the locked channel. So I'd like reddits opinion. Am I the Asshole here for getting pissed about what's basically a running gag under friends, or is he for taking it too far?",

He is very outgoing but also socially awkward, so it makes a weird mix. He’s desperate for attention, and he’s still a virgin and he’s obsessed with losing his virginity. I am also a virgin, and I have reassured him not to worry about it. I never bring it up with him and every time he brings it up with me (which is every time I see him, in some way he brings it up) I assure him that he’s getting worked up about nothing. He thinks that people need to laugh at everything he says so he try’s wording everything like a stand up skit, even when it’s very important to be serious, he is still joking. And a lot of the humor is self deprecating which I have already told him is unbecoming, but it’s the only way he gets any attention. He can’t whisper or keep a secret for his life either. He has 2 modes, this comedian mode, and his networking mode where is more serious, but it’s very ingenue.  \n\nWould I be an ass if I brought up my concerns with him? \n\nTL;DR would I be an ass hole if I brought up my friend’s social awkwardness?",

He lives for trolling and antagonizing people and insulting them, and he thinks it's hilarious. He finds excuses to make everything political because he likes getting into arguments. The few occasions I \\*do\\* see him, I would much rather not. I don't like who he is as a person.\n\nWell my mom asked if I was inviting him and when I said \"no\" she threw a giant guilt trip. I explained my reasoning and she said she was disappointed in me that I couldn't do this for her. \"I just really wanted an opportunity to see all of my children together.\" (Idk why she can't make her own opportunity. Like on Mother's Day. Or her birthday. Or literally any day other than my wedding).\n\nSo I told her \"I will invite him if it is that important to you, but if he gets political or starts an argument or offends me or any of my guests even if he 'doesn't mean to' or 'is just joking', he is being told to leave immediately and you need to back me up on that. And if you don't, I'll ask you to leave too.\" \n\nShe hasn't responded but my close brother thinks it was unnecessary to put that responsibility on her and that I'm being an ass about it. I think that if she \"knows\" my oldest brother won't be a problem then it shouldn't be an issue to agree to my terms.\n\nAITA",

      "description": "My wife and I have a good marriage.  We have been married for 4 years.  However, one of the things we sometimes argue about is where we sleep on the bed.\n\nI sleep on the left side of the bed, and she sleeps on the right side.  It's a queen bed.  I'm 6ft, 180 lbs so it's not a size thing (and she's much smaller than me).  It's just that I feel like I need variety in my surroundings, and switching the side of the bed every few months fills that need for me.\n\nOn the other hand, my wife feels like she needs consistency.  She feels like she needs some things to be hers, and one of those things is her side of the bed.  She feels like switching sides violates that need.  \n\nIn our first year of marriage I slept on the left side.  Then we moved residences and I was able to switch to the right side of the bed.  We switched without talking about it - I wanted the right side and my wife didn't care (because we just moved).  Honestly I think she didn't even notice; I spoke about it with her recently and she didn't even remember.  Then after another year we moved to our current location and I again switched to my current location: the left side of the bed.  Like last time, I wanted to switch and she didn't even notice.\n\nNow, we've been living in the same residence for 2 years and I'm getting antsy.  I've been sleeping on the left side this whole time and I still am.  I've been asking to switch for months, and she's been asking to keep her side.  She has tried to compromise by switching for one night, and it was nice, but it's only one night and we only did it twice.  She also tried to compromise by giving me the only nightstand, but I don't really need it.  \n\nWhat I ideally want is to switch every 6 months, but I'm open to different time frames or ideas.  The reason why I'm posting here is because she says that nobody regularly switches sides of the bed and I'm weird for wanting that.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "TLDR @ bottom.\n\nI [M30] broke up with my ex [F27] just before Valentine's day. We are on lease at a two bedroom apartment, and stay out of each other's way. It's basically come down to me moving in with my parents at the end of April and splitting my half of the rent so we can try to move on.\n\nI've tried to keep thing quite and drama free. But last night she asked if I could write her a review for animal watching. I have seen her take care of co-workers pets. She did well with a bunny, feeding it twice a day. And I helped with a cat by going over myself after work one day. Those examples are good.\n\nBut for dogs... I took a lot of responsibility for. We would watch her roommate's dog or my step Brothers dog. I felt I took most of the walk duty. This eventually burdened me when she wanted to get a dog. We are on the 4th floor. I can't handle that by myself, so I warn her and she assures me she will help. But next dog sitting we had, she bailed on a promise to walk it before bed, saying she will take early morning. That didn't happen either.\n\nOn top of that, I really feel she has negected her cat after the break up. I love this cat and happy to take care of it, but when it tries to play with her, she ignored it and even locks it out of her room. It's really disheartening. She doesn't want to change the litter since I took on that chore, and is expecting me to refill his water fountain.\n\nSo when she asked me for a review, I ignored at first. When she followed up, I said \"sorry, you should ask people you pet sat for\".\nShe has said \"I dunno why you're being difficult but whatever.\" \"But if you don't feel like helping for whatever reason, that's fine.\" And ended with \"I just don't understand why you have to continue to make my life difficult\". \n\nI've said nothing in response. She doesn't need this review for money, she has a better job than I do, and recently just accepted a job offer after turning down a promotion. Lastly I fail to see why she even needs it from me. \n\nAITA for not writing a bullshit review to make things easier?\n\nTLDR: my ex wants a review for animal watching, I have honest, mixed opinions on her experience and told her no. she has a great job and lots of friends, so I don't think she needs this from me, but still claims I'm making her life difficult.",

      "description": "It's safe to say that I am a dog person. I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?",

      "description": " My bipolar brother who is heavily dependent on his medication revealed to me tonight that not only has he stopped taking his meds but that he also stopped seeing his therapist as far back as a month ago.  And purposely kept it from everyone.\n\nI LOVE my brother completely. We're four years apart but we've always shared everything. People sometimes confuse us for twins but we just roll with it, and, honestly, love it. We have \n\nsimilar interests and love debating most things, especially, \"hot topics\" like religion and politics.\n\nWe both suffer from depression, anxiety and ADHD, however, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was in early high school and, most recently, borderline personality disorder. His manic/depression made it very hard for him to make friends with other kids and opened him up to a lot of bullying; to the point that he had to withdraw from public high school and finish the rest online. I've always supported him and been his number one fan, although, I was quite cruel to him when I was in middle school. I think about this often and regret my every action during this time. I was a hurting kid with no outlet and I, without mercy, rained my suffering down upon him. \n\nBecause I believe that I had a substantially negative role on him growing up, I have since modified my behavior towards him now that I am an adult and not some awful, hormone ruled monster. I try to be everything to him that I had the inability to be to him before: supportive, generous, loving, excepting. He truly is an amazing human being...except when he's not on his meds.\n\nThat's when his mania is unleashed. I have been around him all his life so I know when he is manic. It's something in his voice, the way he gestures, the way his face contorts when he thinks no one is looking. He's not my brother anymore. And it's only made worse by alcohol because that's when he starts hallucinating. He starts telling me about how everything he's ever told me is a lie and that he's never cared about me. How he's lied about seeing a therapist and how he's manipulated everyone around him for the sheer joy of doing it. The ways he's used me and taken pleasure in my pain. There have been multiple times where he has made me cry in public or made me remove myself and himself from certain circumstances in public.\n\nIt makes me extremely distressed to see my brother go manic so I usually start crying. Literally begging him to calm down and see sense and if he still doesn't listen, I involve my parents as a last ditch effort.\n\nThat's when he starts gas-lighting me. Tells my parents that I've just gotten upset at nothing and he doesn't understand why I'm acting so hysterical. That it is unfair and harsh and \"weird\" that I should be reacting to him in this way.  That I'm \"freaking him out\" because I expressing remorse over the news he so casually tossed me. Of course he sounds all calm and reasonable while I can't get a word out because I'm so upset that this is happening again.\n\nThat's when my parents turn on me and tell me to stop bullying my brother, literally yell at me for the way I'm behaving. He's got anxiety so he's somehow afforded a leniency, dudes, I HAVE ANXIETY TOO! But they always take his side because they haven't seen the physically hostile, manipulative, arrogant, lying person my brother turns into when he's off his meds. \n\nI'm afraid of him. He showed himself tonight. Saying it was all cool that he had lied about seeing a therapist and taking meds for about a month, but then when I tried to alert my parents to this, he completely diverts the discussion in a way that invalidates what I have to say. I'm the bad guy, apparently. Nobody has seen him at his worst but me. I don't think that I should be shamed for being angry at him for ignoring his regimented medication.\n\nHe's on my parents' healthcare, there's no excuse for not seeking treatment. I'm so disappointed. I can't go through this toxic rollercoaster again. Now I'm going to have to face my parents in the morning because my “hysterics” woke them up when he came clean that he wasn't on meds. By the way, he swears up and down that he didn't actively lie, he just didn't communicate what was going on.",

      "description": "Just looking for some clarity on this situation because it is getting very muddy and convoluted and I can’t think straight about it anymore. \n\nAt my one sisters 18th bday party at a Japanese steakhouse, my whole family came out to celebrate. At the end of the meal the manager came by to say hello and that she hoped we’d enjoyed our meals. when she walked away, my OTHER sisters bf (we are all in our twenties, he is in late twenties) pulled his eyes back and mocked what she had just said, talking in a fake Japanese accent. IN A PUBLIC PLACE WITH PEOPLE RIGHT BY US. It was hibachi so there was a whole row of people facing us. \n\nI was mortified and so was my other sister whose birthday it was. I told him it was not acceptable. Then we all moved on. (My sister whose boyfriend it was just laughed along with it, which baffled me). \n\nTwo days later I asked that sister via text “how did (her boyfriend’s) imitation at the restaurant make you feel?” to which she replied with an insult totally unrelated about my boyfriend. All hell breaks loose. I say really mean things. I was trying to be nice and lost it and instead went full blown telling her exactly how I felt, that what he did was immature and embarrassing and racist. \n\nA week goes by. She asks for an apology. I apologized for losing my temper, then followed it up with the fact that I still stood by my stance that she should have condemned his behavior instead of changing the subject to attack my bf. All hell breaks loose again as she replies thanks for the apology BUT I have decided that I don’t want to discuss my relationship with you anymore so you don’t get to ask me about that. \n\nIt devolves into a giant mess of her accusing me of wanting to control his behavior and her reaction to it, and results in him texting me that I am a horrible person and I have no sense of humor and that I can’t infringe in his freedom of speech (he is extremely right wing) and how it was just a joke. Now we may never speak again. She told him literally everything i said, even texts where I was upset after she attacked me and was being very harsh about everything. \n\nShe says it’s not my right to dictate if she approves or disapproves of his actions and it’s none of my business if they talked about it. I say that he can’t be doing that at our family gatherings. He said he doesn’t care if he offends me because I’m a sensitive snowflake libtard, basically. (I’m not, I’m moderate.) Everyone in my family disagreed with what he did and said it was rude. We may never have a relationship again because we can’t agree. \n\nAITA In this whole mess? I can’t tell anymore. ",

      "description": "Set up: I got out of the Army in July and started attending college on the west coast in the Fall. Most of my old Army buddies are in completely different areas of the country so I basically never see them and only stay in touch via text. About a month ago one of my best friends (let's call him Brian) from the Army committed suicide. Shot himself in the head, left no note. We knew he was struggling a bit in his transition out of the military but none of us, including his girlfriend, knew it was hurting him that bad. A friend (let's call her Ashley) I made here at college looked after me the entire following weekend to make sure I didn't lose it.\n\nStory: A few weeks after the suicide Ashley, myself and another mutual friend of ours (let's call her Angela) go out to a bar and Ashley finds a guy to dance with while I go and have a few drinks. I have a few too many and everything about Brian committing suicide hits me all at once. I just completely break down at the bar. Angela finds me, comforts me (turns out she had a friend who also committed suicide) and offers to take me home. I'm pretty trashed at this point and the bar was closing soon anyway so I accept, get home, and crash.\n\nApparently neither me nor Angela had thought to text Ashley that Angela was taking me home. Angela went straight back to the bar after dropping me off but in the meantime Ashley had realized she didn't know where we were and had gotten kicked out of the bar while looking for us (apparently she was trying to push her way through the crowds and the bouncer thought she was trying to start a fight).\n\nEver since then whenever that night has been brought up she's been semi-angrily accused  me or teased me about leaving her at the bar, even after I've apologized numerous times for not texting her where that I was leaving (though in my defense I was pretty hammered). She knows I was upset about something but I don't think she knows exactly why, though she is aware of my friend's suicide.\n\nEvery time she brings it up and uses it as an accusation or way of teasing me it makes me angry because it feels like she's trying to make me feel guilty about grieving for one of my closest friends. I don't think she would ever actually try to make me feel guilty about it, but it's how it comes across. Also worth noting Ashley is kind of emotionally closed off as a result of some bad experiences she's had that affected her pretty deeply.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

However, every time I catch a lift, he charges me quite a bit of money. I think this is unfair, as we have the same destination, and where he drives to means that I'm late for work every time I need to rely on him (although we work at the same place, I work at a different part of the site, so I need to walk for 15 minutes after he's stopped).\n\nHe's unwilling to change his routine to be earlier so that I'm not late, I've tried that avenue before. And public transport can't get me to work reliably, which is why I rely on lifts.\n\nI'd understand if it was to help pay for petrol, but he's usually very tight fisted with money anyway, despite being very well off - and seems to be taking advantage of the situation to profit off of his friends.\n\ntl;dr: My friend (been friends for years) charges me for lifts to the place we work, despite always making me late, and not having to change his driving route to pick me up.",

It was causing her a lot of stress.\n\nDuring this time, she seemed to basically invent problems for herself, constantly operating at very high emotion, as if the latest 'thing' was a complete catastrophe and she would then decide to just give up and not try with anything, until the issue was either resolved on its own or was fixed by me. These problems are mostly of her own making\n\nWe talked by this, as I eventually couldn't really cope with it anymore (my friends started getting very worried about me being depressed) and it got us both down even though there wasn't really much 'bad' going on in either of our lives. She said she didn't realise she did this at all, and that she was just making normal conversation etc. and would try to be a bit calmer.\n\nI wasn't expecting a major difference, but there's not really been much of a difference at all. When she texts/talks to me now with a new 'thing' followed by the usual stuff she sends like 'i give up' etc. I just ignore it and let her be upset with me, because she is going to be upset anyway and there's nothing I can do about it, so at least then it doesn't effect me quite as much.\n\nDoes that make me an asshole?",

      "description": "So I’m a heterosexual male and my girlfriend is a bisexual female. Throughout my life I’ve been asked  if I’m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don’t mind telling people that I’m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I’m gay, it’s no big deal I don’t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I’m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn’t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I’m gay. She asked me and I told her that I’m actually straight. Well since then she’s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I’m not watching gay porn. Well it’s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she’d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it’s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it’s frustrating that I’m not taken seriously when I say that I’m straight. I think it’s a little hypocritical that I’m not taken seriously when I tell her that I’m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn’t accept that I’m straight.",

      "description": "So my friend I have known since kindergarten ( I’m almost 40) married my wife’s sister. Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her “my Betsy”, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he’s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It’s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won’t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that’s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?",

I asked if they could fix it and they told me it would cost extra since its difficult to fix when it’s done and it’s not “their fault” if I didn’t say anything during the WIPS but I didn’t notice??? Besides it’s the artists job to get the drawing right not me! They shouldn’t have messed it up in the first place, that’s a huge red flag. I said I wasn’t paying extra and would file a chargeback if they didn’t fix it (spoiler alert: I did). The artist is not happy but obviously I’m not either, I didn’t get what I wanted.

      "description": "So I belong to an organization at school and know plenty of people there. We have our own “families” with people we share interests or whatever based on a survey. Anyways, I have a big “sister” and brother, some siblings and my own little. The big “sister” I was assigned last year has always treated me differently. I’ve always tried to be nice but she always condescends me or argues.\n\nFor example, these guys who are her friends did something then I did the same thing and she said what I did was childish and she also said I shouldn’t do it. There was a time she yelled at me because someone outside was smoking and I told her to close the window and also said who cares when she wanted to report him. Apparently it’s against the lease to smoke outside of your house? But this girl supplies alcohol and there’s people under 21 so I’m sure that’s MORE illegal. She does lots of computer science and talks shit about her co workers or other classmates in class like, “oh they never do anything” or she complained how people send short resumes to where she works on campus yet I’ve applied before and the place to put your resume has a small space to type in\n\n\nWhen I’ve asked her questions she responds like, “yeah...” and gives me that look people give when you think they just asked the dumbest question ever. Anyways, she hates me, she’s turned this one girl I liked against me. I don’t know WHY she hates me, I’ve tried telling her sorry before and talk but she shuts me down. I can’t NOT be around her, we have family nights at my house since my roommate is in the same fam so sometimes I have no choice.\n\nIdk what to do, but honestly, maybe I’m sexist but if a dude talked to me the way she did, they’d be getting into a fight. I wanna call her out or something but I don’t want people to be mad at me. She’s totally fine with most people except me. \n\nNever knew why and it’s like I wanna give her a reason to hate me now. If I call her out or start being a dick then at least she’d HAVE a reason to hate me. ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing my grandparents a funeral plot?",
      "description": "I‘m a 22 and a caregiver paid by the state to care for my grandparents. With the paycheck I receive, I pay my bills and every now and then some of their bills or other miscellaneous purchases ($200+ one time because my grandmother saw a “free trial” for a back massager but didn’t know she’d have to pay after 20 days; she’s learned since then).\n\nA year ago, my grandma befriended a woman that sold her on beginning a payment plan for a combined funeral plot for both herself and my grandpa. She would need to deposit about $4,000 and then monthly payments of $294 to eventually total $22,000+ for the combined plot - she ended up throwing together whatever she had saved and borrowed the rest from friends because she couldn’t afford the rest of the deposit. My dad mentioned that I am “responsible for it since I’m making money off them” even though I protested to both him and my grandmother. To me, it didn’t make sense to pay for something even I couldn’t afford.\n\nThis was met with anger. \n\nMy dad said that I’m letting my grandparents die and he refuses to pay for such bills as he already pays for their apartment utilities and my grandpa’s bank loan.\n\nMy grandma, who I explained to many times that I cannot afford this nor can she, insisted I keep paying as the money she both borrowed and saved would be wasted. For both sides, there was an implication that since I was working for them, they had a right to guide where that money I earned from them went to. \n\nAs of right now, I’m currently alright paying off the funeral plan, my car, insurance, student loan interest, and credit card bills. In about 6 months, I will possibly be losing the home I’ve been living in due to my parents divorcing and have mentioned to my grandma that with rent and my own utilities, I will not be able to pay everything as apartments where I live typically go for $2,000-$4,000+. I’ve told her when the time comes for me to move out, I will cancel the funeral payments and even find her a replacement caregiver so I can focus on school. I’ve been constantly listening to her crying about my living situation, my parent’s relationship, and how I will earn my money but she still insists to keep the funeral payments. She even calls me every now and then to make sure I’ve paid the monthly charge, which I’ve assured her I have.\n\nAnyway, what do you guys think? I love my grandparents a lot but as a struggling college student, I don’t know if I can keep this up. \n\nTL;DR - Getting paid to take care of grandparents by the state. Grandma gets set up to pay for a $22,000+ funeral plot that she cannot afford; borrows money from friends and gives up her savings for deposit. I’m paying $294 every month for it, but I have bills to pay and need to save for apartment deposit since I’m losing my house. AITA for wanting to cancel the payment due to my own financial situation?",

Talk to more people in their life, get them something they really want.  Sounds ok to me. \n\nMy issue is my aunt and her immediate family.

      "description": "My inlaws (FIL, MIL, aunts, cousins, all much older than my husband and I) are a group of tight-knit, racist, classist, conservative Christians who identify their politics with their religion. I am a liberal, not racist or classist, second generation atheist, military brat who really doesn't care what they think or believe as long as they keep it away from me and my kids. My husband, a secret atheist apparently ashamed of our atheism, won't stand up to his parents when they do bring their shit around me and my kids unless I force him too. He also won't tell them that we are both atheists which really grinds my gears. But that's a different battle. \n\n\nEvery holiday, my husband's extended family meet at his parents' place for lunch/dinner (same food served twice...) and generally spend all day baiting myself and my husband into a talk about politics. We are both pretty skilled at avoiding these talks but this Thanksgiving, I finally lost my temper when they had some nasty bullshit to fling at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Medicare for All. Of course I lost my temper, these idiots aren't the ones trying to figure out how to pay 17K in costs from having triplets this year or the future surgery my son will need. Or having to listen to them complain about how my father-in-law can't get Medicare yet and will have to pay for healthcare this year. I'd like to see their sorry butts do the leg work I've had to do to get everything covered that should be and to make sure my family is not falling prey to predatory insurance practices. PSA: Never pay a medical bill you have not received the EoB on. It'll save you a ton of money.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I've been around these people way too much this year and my usual tolerance for their shit is gone. I need a break from them and a chance to recharge my bullshit tolerance. They've made my parenting experiences hell thus far. They've taken advantage of me while I was in a terrible position. They don't listen to the things my husband and I ask to them do or not do with our kids. They've caused no end of fighting between my husband and I. They've accused me of denying them access to my kids 'every time I get mad' and that I have no right to keep them away from their grandkids. \n\n\nI am **DONE**. I don't want to go to Christmas at their house and they are damn right, I don't want their racism laden, sorry selves around my kids. They were piss poor parents to my husband and I certainly don't want to give them a chance to abuse my kids like they did him and his brothers. Even further, I don't want another generation of racists on my hands. It's bad enough that of the three siblings his parents raised, two are as racist as them if not worse...\n\n\n\nI'm willing to compromise since it seems this is the hill my husband is willing to die on. We can go to Christmas at their house, unwrap presents and then **LEAVE**. Same way all his cousins and other family does. But my husband says his mom will be upset if we don't stay to eat and the whole nine yards. If I let it, it'll end up being a 12 hour visit where our 6 month old babies will not get any rest at all. He says getting presents then leaving would cause drama. I say, sticking around will cause more drama because I have nothing left nice to say to these people. Not to mention, this is our first year with our kids. I want to start traditions of our own and maybe rekindle some of my own family's traditions that got lost when I got married.\n\n\nAITA for not wanting to spend all of Christmas with my inlaws?\n",

      "description": "I don't have many friends to begin with because I'm really not all that social, especially  being married with kids and a busy work schedule. I treasure the few that I have, but in the last year, I got pretty fed up with what was my best friend of more than 20 years. I've always treated her and her family like my own family and I started to feel like our hospitality was being taken advantage of when she and her husband and kids would come over, both she and her husband would get wasted, so we always insisted that they stay over. Thing is, they have a history of driving drunk with their kids in tow, and despite voicing my concerns, they always waved me off. So problem solved if I make them stay, right? Nope. They wake up in the morning and immediately begin administering the \"hair of the dog\" remedy (not a real cure, I know) and wind up wasted all over again. By the time they finally go home, it's often evening the next day and their kids have demolished my house, my friend and husband never insisted on the kids helping with the cleanup, and I'm so frustrated with the amount of cleaning I have to do just to get my house back to halfway livable. I know I can ask them to help, but they're so drunk things tend to be hastily shoved under beds and in cabinets, not where they belong. I feel inclined to say that when we visit their home, this is not what I do. I clean up their kitchen, put food away, ask my kids to put things away, etc. The state of their house is in better condition than when we arrived. Now part of my issue with the drinking is that I no longer drink due to having a drinking problem in the past. I notice the annoying drunken behavior much more now that I'm not drinking, but don't want to sound like I'm better than them for not drinking. It bothers me though, and I've tried to bring up the subject in a subtle way, suggesting that they cut back on consuming so much alcohol. It's quickly dismissed. The last straw was when they came over to celebrate my birthday, and my friend showed up at my door already blitzed. She tried to downplay how much she was consuming by continuously \"checking on her car\". It was obvious she had a bottle in her car. I ended up so annoyed at the reckless mess (food being dropped on the floor and stared at without cleaning it up, repetitive conversation, etc.) that I went to bed early. The next day was the usual wake and drink routine, and when I walked out to my driveway, I noticed a wet spot on the asphalt next to her car and the overwhelming smell of pee. Not sure who squatted to pee in my driveway, but it may have happened during one of the many \"car checks\". That was it. I pretty much just stopped talking to them after that, and I haven't given any explanation about why, mostly because I know the truth would fall on deaf ears and cause substantial embarrassment that would probably result in resentment towards me. Also, in a way, I don't feel like it should be be my responsibility to spell out how inappropriate and rude they've been. They're grown adults, and should know better. \n\nMy other friend was a good friend who I've opened my doors to when he needed help. He doesn't have much family or friends, and I've often been the only one who would talk to him. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, which he was candid about, and having been in his situation before, I could understand his situation without judging. The last couple of times he visited though, his drinking was out of control and he ended up saying really awful things to me, and having inappropriate conversations with not only my kids, but other people's kids who were staying over. He had no recollection of the previous night, so how do you chew someone out for something they don't remember?  He knows he has a problem, so what's the point? Same thing, I pretty much just abruptly stopped talking to him. \n\nI feel justified in cutting ties with both parties, especially since my kids don't need to be exposed to this kind of behavior, but wonder if I'm being cowardly in not tell them why I stopped answering texts/phone calls. Do I owe an explanation? These are both friends I've known since I was a teenager. Does that factor in a certain amount of responsibility on my part to be a good friend and lay it all out? Is it partly my fault for allowing it to get to this point?",

      "description": "I went to the club last night with a couple friends, had some drinks, and met a girl I matched with on tinder. From even before I recognized her she looked like she was confused but she was with her friends and upon recognizing me she approached me.  I asked if she would like to dance and she said yes. We danced for a bit and I asked if I could kiss her. This is where I became very confused. She either said \"no\" or \"oh\" because there was a pause and the music was loud. I assumed she said \"no\" because I didn't hear a \"yes\" so I just kept dancing but 2-3 seconds later she turned around and started to kiss me. This had me confused and I'm not really good at reading signs so I asked if she would like to keep dancing and she said yes. After another 10min or so of dancing/kissing I felt she was uncomfortable and I told her I was going to meet up with my friends and asked if she would like help to find her friends as she didn't know where they were. She said \"no\" and I said \"have a good night\" and then I left. I don't know why she may have been uncomfortable. I don't know if that was just her general demeanor or not because from the second I saw her (before she saw me) she looked uncomfortable to be in the club surrounded by people. I should mention that I am almost certain she wasn't drunk because she and her friends were going to the bar when she saw me and the drinks were particularly cheap so it wouldn't make sense that she would drink before. Also I didn't smell any alcohol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her afterwards if she was uncomfortable at all last night but have not got a response so I left the conversation at that. Did I do something wrong?",

      "description": "Throwaway account because my main account username is my real name. \n\nThis is more of a ‘Are we the assholes’ case than just myself. \n\nPreface: The annoying flatmate recently broke up with her boyfriend of nearly 2 years and was already quite an eccentric and unstable person to begin with, so it doesn’t help that she was pretty shaken by the sudden breakup. That being said, they had been broken up for two months by this point probably should have calmed down a bit by now.\n\nAnyways, on with the story:\nMy friends and I are all university students and we had planned to get baked at their flat and watch tv and listen to music etc. \n\nWe ended up getting super high and pretty vegetative for most of the evening, so when their flatmate came through and wanted to talk uninvited, we weren’t overly excited by the prospect. That sounds bad, but it has to be noted that she’s really, really annoying. She only ever wants to talk about herself and vent about her day, quickly changing the subject back to herself if someone mentions something else.\n\nShe can also be rude as shit and be completely unapologetic about it. Previously she had mentioned that only one of our group looks like he actually goes to the gym, and whilst she’s not entirely wrong, it’s still a mean thing to say, and she didn’t even think she’d been rude when confronted about it. \n\nSo none of us were really interested in talking, so we suggested watching The Big Lez Show (Which she hates) to get her to leave. She responds by sitting at the computer and playing her own music. We’re all quite open to new music, but this was really not good and she refused to change it, so now we’re stuck with no Big Lez and some pretty shit tunes. \n\nAt this point, we’re too high to deal with this, so we all kind of just started moaning at her to change the song and let us watch something. She keeps laughing as we keep asking her to change the music and let us watch Big Lez, and even keeps laughing and trying to talk as we straight up tell her to fuck off. It wasn’t until we brought out a nerf gun and threatened to shoot her with a dart that she finally left. Whilst one of held the nerf gun and lazily pointed it in her general direction, the rest of us all screamed “SHOOT HER” repeatedly until she left in a strop. We weren’t entirely serious and were quite surprised that it actually worked. I don’t think we were in the wrong since it’s not her room and she was unbelievably annoying, but I think we might have just destroyed her spirit. Are we the assholes?",

      "description": "A bit of background info: I'm a freshman in college. I've made friends with a bunch of guys (my roommates included) on my floor and we all hang out. We recently chose our dormitory housing together for next year, and the way it worked out had 4 rooms of 3 guys each all on the same floor. We were all psyched about it. Fast forward to two days ago. My brother who is a junior at the same college has been apartment hunting with his five friends who are also juniors. They find a big place that houses twelve people, and its very cheap and close to campus. My brother offers to me to bring myself and 5 friends and we can have a big apartment for all of us. I'm super psyched about the idea and I suggest it to my current roommates who both bite. the three of us choose to approach the one of next year's other three rooms with whom we are closest. They also bite. within a day the details are settled and we decide to take the apartment. Now the tricky part. We have to tell the other two rooms (6 people) that we won't be on the same floor as them next year. The 6 of us are saving thousands of dollars, and I'm taking what is likely my last opportunity ever to live with my brother as he plans to live in Europe. It makes logical sense even though it is shitty to renege on our prior setup. We told the other six guys, emphasizing that we're only 10 minutes away and we'll still be taking classes together so the only difference is physical distance. Some of them didn't take it very well. Am I / are we the asshole(s) ?\nFor clarification - the 4 rooms were separate so it's not like us leaving affects their housing in any manner. ",

He won’t be back until September so I figured I should put all his stuff away while he was gone.\n\nI decided I would pack up all of his clothes and things and put it in my shed so that I could have a room to myself for six months having shared one with him for the last 17 years. \n\nI knew that I would be moving out of my house by August before he got back so I decided I would put everything back where it was like nothing happened and it would be fine for when he got back.\n\nNow my mom saw that I had packed all of his things up and freaked out but gave no reason as to why. I kept trying to ask her why and she wouldn’t budge in letting me move anything and demanded I put it back.\n\nI decided that I would put it all in the shed anyways what would happen. What came next was beyond anything I could imagine.\n\nMy mom stole my laptop, music equipment, Xbox, Amazon Alexa, and DJing equipment, all valued over $2000 compared to the maybe $200 worth of things of my little brothers I put away until I moved out. I almost filed a police report since I thought that was blown out of proportion for a reaction.

      "description": "Sorry for the long post...\n\nTo give a history, he struggles with alcoholism \nand anger issues among other things when he drinks heavily. He has been very nasty and uncaring to me frequently in the past, because of this I gave him an ultimatum which consisted of him only drinking a certain amount of alcohol a week so that he no longer treats me this way or else I’d leave him (except on special occasions and such or when he wasn’t going to see me that day/night). Dragging his heels all the way and telling me I was being controlling etc etc even though he admitted he has a problem and that he does not treat me at all well in these scenarios, he decided to cut down his alcohol and work on being nicer when drinking as it is a big part of his social and familial life so I was subject to it on a weekly basis. These issues worsened my anxiety and gave me increased panic attacks/hyperventilate and caused me to be very depressed and feel hopeless in the relationship as he constantly promised to change and do better and never did no matter how much it hurt me. All this led to that final ultimatum.\n\nHe did not hold up on this agreement yet his behaviour improved, I asked him to consider showing me that he could actually cut down to a certain amount as it would show me he respected the ultimatum and also for his health that he could not drink so excessively/spend loads of money. He hated that idea with a passion and so we agreed that he could decide how much he drank and that he would be trusted to do so responsibly.\n\nSince then he has got extremely drunk and lied about how much he drank, which upset me a lot considering the history and our agreement and took him a while to understand why I’d be bothered. And now today (a weekday, he works 5 days a week full time) he went to the pub after work like usual, and instead of having a couple pints like normal, he drinks around 8 pints and is completely battered, this is while I’m at work. He texts me saying his sorry and that he’s taken the piss etc etc. I can’t really respond as I’m mid shift in a busy environment. He normally would meet me from work and walk me home as I work until relatively late at night and it’s quite a long walk and not very nice to do alone in the dark. I get a call from his mum while I’m at work who lets me know he came home and just passed out at like 7pm. I accidentally left my bag at home containing all my necessary belongings (including my wallet) except my phone. I am quite upset he chose to do this and so ring my parents and ask if they can please bring my bag in so I can at least pay for a taxi back to his as I explain the situation. My dad offers to just take me home so I accept. I finish my shift and my dad picks me up sympathetically which I am grateful for. My boyfriend wakes up and grills me and starts being very passive aggressive for not going back to his and that he’s just “cold and waiting for my gf who doesn’t want to see me” and that it’s not a big deal and that I should essentially just get over it and that I shouldn’t have gone home and that he would’ve paid for a taxi back to his. To which I reply that I think it’s best we just see each other tomorrow and he get some rest. He continues to kick off about me going home and how I’m overreacting and how upset he is. \n\nThis whole cycle has gone on for way too long and if this incident was just a one off it would be okay, but it’s not. This situation is EXTREMELY mild compared to some of the shit I’ve had to deal with when he’s been drunk (there’s so many things I can’t even put into one post) Idk what to do am I the asshole here, am I just over sensitive due to the past? Should I just get over it?",

      "description": "Some background info, I do all the cooking in the house. We have a deal where he does the dishes and I make sure he has lunch and dinner made (does breakfast himself) since I am a good cook. He’s tried to make meals for himself in the past but because he can’t make anything as good as me he’s given me the responsibility.\n\nWhen I make a new food dish that tastes really good I get excited and want him to share in the experience but he always refuses. Now it’s nothing crazy, just a pasta dish or sandwich or something along those lines. Something I know for a fact he would like if he gave it a try. I just get bored cooking the same things over and over and want him to try and branch out. On the off chance he does try a new food he typically always likes it, but says it’s not something he’d ever eat and that he just likes the regular meals I make. We’re both in our early 20s so I don’t see why we shouldn’t be trying new things\n\nTL;DR boyfriend recently told me it bugs him that I ask him to try new foods, because I should know by now that he’s not going to want to eat it (even if he does like it)",

My mom broke up with her BF of 2 years a month ago, and got back with him last week. BF hasn't been very good with respecting my CF and relationship with my mom. He wants mom to himself, and thinks that since I'm extremely healthy for having CF, that he doesn't need to get vaccinated or wash his hands often. He's also promised to take me fishing and stuff like that, but hasn't done any of that, and instead makes up excuses to not do those things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen mom and BF broke up, I was happy, but my mom got really sad. My mom did recognize that my time with her is very important, and so is my health, and promised to prioritize me. However, she got too sad, and got her BF back without telling me. I found out when I came home after spending some time with my dad. I was pissed, and am still just as mad. BF still disregards my health and time with my mom. My mom said that if BF got sick again, he'd get a hotel until he got better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis last week, he got a really bad cold, and didn't leave. I did my best to avoid him and sanitize everything, but I still got sick because we eat from the same fridge. I haven't said a word to BF. The only communication I've given BF have been death glares and the occasional \"back off\" if he's gotten too close, especially since he's been sick. My mom thinks I'm over-reacting and just need to get over it, and be glad that she's spending time with me, but now that I'm sick in bed with a really nasty cough and stuffy nose, I can't help but be pissed. BF has done other things in the past that have further pissed me off, but I'll have to edit that in as to not exceed the 3,000 word count. \n\nAm I the asshole, or am I justified. ",

      "description": "My identical twin sister (we're 22) and I have been roommates for nearly a year. Over the summer and into the winter I suffered with major depression, on a scale that was unfamiliar to me. I ended up leaving my job in the autumn and would spend days/weeks living in my bathrobe barely able to take care of my basic needs (I.e shower, eat...). When my depression worsened my sister took on more house work which I appreciated. She eventually came to me angry about the extra chores she was doing. She would be upset I hadn't thought to do the dishes or take out the garbage out. I explained to her that in my current state I couldn't see how the house was in disarray. \n\nVery shortly after this first upset, I found, what I thought to be, the best solution. I told her if she left me with a list of chores I would do it. From then on, every time she told me what to do, I would, not fluattering once. I began to feel good about contributing but because of my mental state I still needed her to tell me what she would like done. I felt this system worked well and was proud of myself for keeping up my end of the bargin. \n\nHowever, she soon started to become angry/resentful again, she would be upset about having to tell me what to do, she said things along the line of \"you are an adult, I shouldn't have to tell you what to do\" and \"I cant bring myself to ask you to do the chores because of how you are right now\". This upset me, I felt she was being unfair, I was doing my best to find a middle ground and her only \"task\" was to assign me chores. But she wouldn't and then be upset that I hadn't done the chores. \n\nThis conflict was never really resolved, I just eventually got on meds that helped me deal with my depression and I now contribute eveningly, without being asked, to the housework. But this issue resurfaces often in fights between us. She will go off about how much more she had to take on, and how she should have never had to ask me, and that she didnt want to ask me because she saw how much i was suffering. I remind her that I asked her to ask me, and that she cant be mad at me because she decided not to meet me halfway or decided that I was too \"fragile\" for chores.\n\nI resent that this is still thrown in my face during every argument. I know I was not the ideal roommate, but I tried to compromise and I feel that I shouldn't be held responsible because she decided not to give me chores when I all I asked was for her to tell me what to do. AITA here? Am I not considering her side enough?\n\nTDLR while depressed, my sister took on more housework, I asked to be given tasks so I can contribute, she is upset because I am an adult and shouldn't need her to assign me chores, she still continues throws this in my face even though it is a none issue now.",

      "description": "**TLDR at the bottom. I'm not a total asshole.**\n\nI'm an 18 year old college student with autism/asd. It's not too severe, and I'm able to bumble and stumble through my day normally. One thing that sort of sets me off, though, is isolated loud noises. Ambient noise like a crowded mall or heavy traffic is fine, but things like a baby screaming or a dog barking put me on edge.\n\nAt the beginning of the year I tried living on-campus, but the lack of privacy and random noise ultimately drove me back home. Things are better here, but they're not great. Moreover, they're beginning to unravel a bit. \n\nWe have two dogs, used to have three. They have their own little yard to do their business in before being let inside. Ever since the second one died, it seems like the third dog has learned to be as loud and obnoxious as possible to be let back inside.\n\nWe also have a wonderful grandmother who lives with us. She, of course, is becoming a bit senile with age. But she's not meek, she's a strong fighting mfer at heart. Unfortunately this means that when she misplaces something, she gets paranoid and shouts at people who she believes \"took it\".\n\nAnd in the spring, we'll be fostering a teenager for the first (and supposedly only) time. He will be in court-ordered residential therapy for the next three months before being released to us, probably in March. I was supportive of the rest of the family making this decision, but it's really begun to sink in that this will undoubtedly be rough. \n\nI try, and mostly succeed, at bottling up my agitation over small things like these, since I'd like to think I'm a well behaved son. But I already have so many other things I bottle up, because I'm too afraid and guilty to bother other people with it. And it gets damaging. I resent myself for not being able to take it easily, but that's the way it is.\n\nOn an entirely different storyline, my parents decided a while ago that they would get me an apartment close to school for my sophomore year. I'm currently commuting 45 minutes each way. Of course, I'm incredibly grateful for this, and I'm sure they're getting a kick out of me looking up all these properties relentlessly (it's something I've always been fixated on, some aspies do trains, others do real estate). But I'd really like to move over spring break in March instead of in June or July like originally planned. \n\nIt just makes more sense - I'd be out as the foster kid moves in, it would be during a semester break, and I'd have a 10 minute drive. They'd have more room for the foster kid, and we'd all be less stressed. But I can't help but feel selfish for even asking. It's not entirely about the money; they make enough in a day to pay the rent, and they got a refund for the dorm this semester. I'd be willing to help them pay it regardless. But I feel ungrateful, and I hate hurting other people. \n\nSo am I a spoiled ungrateful asshole that's trying to take more than he's been given, or am I being reasonable in asking?\n\n*TLDR: Autistic college student commuting long way from home. Home is a bit stressful and is only going to get worse as time goes on, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to take it. Parents getting me an apartment this summer, but I want to ask them to make it March for various reasons.*",

I just didn’t feel as strongly for her as she did for me, and neither of us took it too harshly. \n\nShe still considers me the ‘perfect’ boyfriend and all these other things, said she wouldn’t dare look for someone else until she’s completely over me, and sincerely wanted to remain friends, and I’m okay with that, she’s cool, just wouldn’t date her. \n\nA few weeks afterwards we were talking and she mentioned she wanted some ‘fun’ and asked if I’d be willing to come over and help her out. I expressed concerns at first, but she seemed kinda desperate and I’m not actively dating either due to extensive work schedules. If we’re both single I don’t see an issue with a FWB type of deal. So we messed around. I did tell her early on that she shouldn’t expect it to reignite the relationship, and she understood. \n\nLong story short, after a few yippee sessions, she told her friend, who told her little social group, who are expressing deep frustration towards me for doing this, telling me “I’m messing with her emotions” and “why do I fuck her if I don’t want to be with her”. I told her about and all she really could do was apologize but said she doesn’t want to stop doing the dirty. \n\nAITA? I see it could be kinda wrong considering she still has feelings for me whereas I don’t as strongly for her, but if she is actively telling me she wants to do the dun dundun, I don’t see much harm in it and wanted another opinion. \n\nThank.

      "description": "I wanna figure this out once and for all. This is a really bizarre and unnecessary fight I had with my friend. This happened a few months ago over the summer. My (19m) family owns a cottage on a lake about 2 hours north from my home. It is a very special place to me and I always like to go up there to relax. \n\nOne weekend, I decided to bring up my close friend (17m) at the time. The whole weekend went pretty smooth until the night before we left for home. I thought watching a movie on Netflix would be cool. I had a movie saved that I had been wanting to watch for a while and I asked my friend if he wanted to watch it. He says sure, so I load it up. About 5 minutes in, he starts watching YouTube videos without earbuds. He’s playing it louder than the movie, so I pause it and ask him if he actually wants to watch it. He says he is watching, so I continue playing it. Once again, he starts playing YouTube videos out loud. \n\nI said something like, “I actually want to watch this movie, so if you’re not into it I’m just gonna go to bed and watch it another time.”  He responds by asking me what the fuck I’m getting so mad over and how he was actually watching the movie. I get into bed and he says, “I’m just gonna go home then.” He proceeds to call his mother and tell her to come get him. \n\nMind you, it’s about a 2 hours drive from where we live and it’s about 12 at night. If someone were to come get him, that would be 2 hours up to get him and 2 hours back to go home. I start freaking out and say, “You’re seriously gonna make your mom drive that much because I didn’t want to watch a movie?” He says yeah and insists that she will be there soon.\n\nBy that point I had had enough and decide to go to bed. The problem is I can’t fall asleep because I’m so worried that his mom is gonna be angry with me or my family and that my parents are going to be mad as well. I try to sleep for about 2 hours but I still can’t. At 2 AM I finally look up and see he’s still on his phone. I ask him if he really called his mom and he continues to insist he did and she will be there soon. \n\nI called him a selfish asshole or something like that and go downstairs for some water. When I come back up he just starts laughing at me. He says, “I never even called her.”\n\nI immediately blow up and start yelling at him. I tell him how rude it was that he did that and how he will never be invited back up. His only response is “fine.”\n\nThe next morning we pack up and head home. When we finally arrive at my house, he calls his mom and we wait for his ride. He asks me if I’m still mad and I say yeah. He just starts laughing at me again. \n\nWe didn’t really talk for a few months after that. The next time we hung out he did give me an apology I thought was sincere, but to me it was a little to late to really mean anything. I have no desire to spend time with him anymore. \n\nI’ve had my other friends tell me both that I over reacted or that I was right in this. I just feel like I go up north to relax and all my friend did was stress me out. It would have been one thing for the prank to have lasted 5 minutes but he let it go on for 2 hours. He wasn’t even sorry about it when he knew it upset me. AITA in this for reacting the way I did?",

      "description": "So little backstory, we have a family of 4 and a data plan that just barely supports it if we’re all being responsible with data. My brother is 11 years my senior and is currently living on his own with his fiancé. My brother as an early Christmas present bought his fiancée a phone and added her to the family plan. My mother is in charge of the family plan, and agreed to allowing her onto the plan. Since then, our data has run out twice as quickly, and since we have a protection mode on, any data we try to use past our cap is severely throttled. (I’m talking 0.00005 mbs). \n\nMy elderly father depends on his map service to navigate around when he gets lost and he is unable to use it if the data is throttled. My brother and his fiancée would be unable to use their data either for the things they would need it for as we are only getting 14 ish days of data rather than a month.\n\nI contacted my brother and told him since he’s living on his own and getting married maybe it’s time that he gets his own phone plan. Since his fiancée was added, it seriously affected all of us and my suggestion was a solution to that. I was hoping to continue dialogue with him trying to figure out what was going on with the data, but instead he sends my message to our mother and she and my father got angry with me telling me I was very mean and it’s none of my business. I’m in hard times right now so I don’t pay for my portion of the bill, so I agree that I can’t make decisions for people, but it was merely a suggestion posed to instigate conversation, not to attack my brother. \n\nIn my mind I thought I was doing a good thing bringing this fact up so we could work as a family to fix it but my mother wanted nothing to do with me for the rest of the night. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "So one thing I'll confess right up front, is that I know I'm the asshole for not acting on my intuition of what I KNEW my family would want when the visited me for the first time in NYC. I come from a pretty simple family, our family's favorite restaurant is Outback steakhouse, my parents eat at Chili's when the travel across the country, their idea of exciting is seeing a new mall, even if all the stores are the same as we have in Tucson. I fucking knew this and i'm kicking myself. I have started drama and one thing my parents love is fucking drama. \n\nSo like I just said I'm from Tucson, AZ. I moved to NYC this past summer to pursue my dream of being a freelance photographer and am basically apprenticing with an older lady who has lived in the city since the 1950s. As such she has shown me the most amazing, off the beaten path things that you would never, ever get on a circle line tour. In over six months of being here, I've only been through times square, I haven't been to ESB or 1WT or statue of liberty. I've absolutely loved it. \n\nThis weekend my parents and two younger sisters came to visit me for the first time since it was a 3 day weekend. My mom was very clear that she wanted an \"authentic\" New York experience. I was like cool...lets do it. I got them a pretty sweet Airbnb just around the corner from the room I rent from my photographer friend in Brooklyn and set about. I knew there were signs of trouble when I took them to an absolutely amazing Italian place in Bensonhurst that is almost 80 years old. My sisters hated it because the menu was seafood and my mom lectured me that she KNEW that the only place for authentic Italian food is in Little Italy. I tried to tell her that as sad as it is, Little Italy is actually very touristy now and these people were serving dishes they learned from their family when the immigrated from Sardinia. Well the hated it and I saw at their Airbnb the next morning that all the leftovers were in the trash.  The next day was worse because we spent the whole day touring around Brooklyn and Queens and about 5 my sisters starting whining \"when are we going to see Times Square?\" I told them I thought that the wanted to see authentic New York. They told me all the stuff I was showing them was \"boring,\" sheesh thanks...these were all the places where I've done shoots.  \n\n\nSunday my dad's diabetes feet were acting up so they decided to just stay in the Airbnb all day Sunday and actually ordered in grubhub from Hooters. Fuck it, I went and did some work with and Instagram model I do TFP work with. Today I was like cool, lets just go see Times Square and Empire State and part of Manhatten but my mom was absolutely freaked the fuck out by the subway and was worried about getting to LaGuardia on time so we just came back and again spent the day in their Airbnb. My mom blamed me for not booking them a hotel or Airbnb in Times Square because she had no idea I \"planted\" them so far away from all the activity of the city. \n\n\nI just paid a fucking Mint to get them an uber to the airport and on the way my mom sent me an incredibly nasty email basically blaming me for allowing them to spend all their money and see \"nothing.\" I don't even know what to respond because I have email and text after email and text of her explaining to me that they wanted to see \"authentic New York.\" \n\n\nI can add more info as needed...but while I admit to being the Asshole for not acting on what I KNEW to be the reality, am I the asshole for acting on what the asked of me?",

Mellie divorced Grant. Grant was devastated and was depressed because not only had he just lost his father and best friend ( they both died) he now lost hiw wife. \n\nWe met a year later and started dating. Its been a bit over a year now and things are well. But my anxiety has me so fucked up i cant think right right now. \n\nAnyway, I was there when Grant received this news from his mother (who is friends with mellie on fb).\n\nWe were both devastated. Its very fuckin tragic. Now, I was not comfortable with Grant reaching out to mellie. Grant knew this and told me he didnt want to cause anything between us if he were to reach out to her. Besides, there isnt really anything that he can do for her. But later in the day he came to me with a heavy heart and told me he was going to reach out to her. He told me he didnt want to throw away what we have, cause what we have works and that hes happy but that he just needed to tell me what was on his mind.\n\nI didnt like the idea because of my anxiety. It can get pretty bad. We talked, and eventually I had to put my feelings aside and told him he should message her and send his condolences. I asked him to be very transparent with me, tell me what they talk about. He agreed and said thats fine. She didnt say much and conversation ended pretty quickly. I thought that was the end of that and I felt fine.\n\n He texted me today saying he reached out to her again, and now Im afraid that itll come down to him wanting to see her.\n\nI was kinda pissed... i mean its obvious shes a wreck but she has a support system, her family, her deceased bf's family and her friends. He said he just wanted to make sure she was ok. \n\nI really think its going to come down to him wanting to see her. This isnt respecting my boundaries and its something i dont think i can handle, given my anxiety. I feel like feelings will rekindle, and i just dont want him to be her emotional support... I know that shit isnt rational but my mental health is important to me and i dont think i can handle that. I just wish his past would stay dead.  I would understand if they had kids together, but there is nothing tying them together. Were talking tonight and i just dont want to say some dumb shit. \n\nFor fucks sake, she left him during his darkest times, why should he be there for hers? \n\nso am I the asshole for not wanting him to be there for his ex wife?

      "description": "I’ll start off with some backstory.\n\nI’ve(25) been in a LDR with my gf(27) for nearly 2.5 years and things have been going a bit rough the last few months. We’ve been fighting over basically nothing, a lot, so we’ve discussed the issue and decided to both work on not getting upset over small things.\n\nWe had plans to move in with each other in 2021 and to keep the relationship healthy until then, we try to voice chat every day, where we catch up, discuss how our days went and sometimes watch movies and series together.\n\nMy girlfriend is into competitive video games a lot, where as I am not really into them. I sometimes join her for an occasional game, but generally let her do her thing when she wants to play. She has a lot of male gamer friends that she plays with, that she has known for over 10 years. I trust her completely around them, because if she had feelings for any of them, then she wouldn’t have chosen to start a relationship with me.\n\nNow onto me being a potential asshole.\n\nGf tells me that we will have our voice chat a bit later because she promised one of her friends, let’s call him John, that she’d play with him today. I say it’s totally fine and asked her to give me a headsup when she’d be nearly done. She then asks me if I want to join them, I thanked her for asking me, but I declined, as this would be a great time for me to visit my sister and nieces again.\n\nFastforward 3 hours, I’m at my sisters place, and girlfriend messages me that John will log off after their current game. So I started making my way home. When I got home i got another message from my gf, that John wanted to do an extra game so she’s doing one more. I got a little annoyed at that, because if she told me that in advance I could have spent more time with my sister, but told myself not to overreact and responded that it was fine. So I decided to just browse reddit for a bit while she was playing. When 50 minutes passed and I didn’t hear anything I decided to check if she was done already. And there I saw that she had started another new game. At this point I’m pretty upset that she didn’t even message me beforehand so I asked her if she started another game and she responded that John wanted to do one more and that she would leave after this game, even if he wanted to do more.\n\nAfter her game ends she tells me to come voice chat with her, but I tell her that I’m not in the mood anymore. We argue a bit about how we aren’t supposed to get upset over small things anymore. But I tell her that I think I am allowed to be upset over this, because I was waiting on her only for her to start another game. She agreed that she should have told me before starting her last game, but because she promised John to play with him until he would log off, she felt she wasn’t in the wrong. I told her that she also told me that she was doing one last game, twice, but she said that didn’t matter because she promised John first.\n\nAITA?",

My wife has been making comments about how lonely she’s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don’t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I’ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had ‘the talk’ about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that’s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother’s situation and I told her that that’s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn’t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn’t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn’t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  ",

(Especially for the few days im here im glad to help) But i have an exhausting schedule, i do track and have practice afterschool and i have saturday rehearsals for a musical im in. So im generally tired. (My parents arent home so the “conversations” are done thru text)\n\nThis is where the problem arises, i was asleep and they wake me up telling me to clean the cars. I have no problem with it i get up and get the supplies then while im cleaning they tell me “if u WANT, you can take you and ur sister to chik fil a” i say, “i would but im really tired thanks for the offer” my sister comes along and calls me an asshole for not wanting to take her, then they say “give her your card and her boyfriend can take her” (my personal card that they did not open. My mom did and they will cashapp me the money) (mind you this isnt the first time it happens, they had me do it for shopping and i was actually forced to do it, and give her my card) i say “no i dont feel comfortable with her having my card” and thats when i get a text from my dad saying “go take (sister) to eat. And stop been a fucking asshole” if i could show u i would. I text him explaining its not me wanting to be a pain in the ass its just be being tired and i dont want to go.  I then im forced to go and take them to \nchick fil a. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL:DR Im tired cuz of my schedule, i get woken up, to wash then car and asked if i wanted to go me  and my sister to eat. I said no they asked me for my credit card so they can cashapp the money to her i said no because its my card that has money ive earned and i was called an asshole by my parents and sister.",

      "description": "WIBTA, So my roommate recently got an $82 bill for internet I never used. When I moved in I set up my own router and modem. I cut the bill from $82 to $55 dollars and had to set up new internet because she was being uncooperative. She claimed that she didnt know who the internet was registered under, even though she was paying for it. \n\nSo I told her to call comcast and send back the router when I set up my internet. She said she would and a few days later I texted her about it. She again said shed do it. \n\nToday she got a charge for $82 from comcast and is saying we (me and the other roommates) must help her pay for the internet. I sent her a screenshot of me telling her to send back the router and I have not yet flat out refused but I sure as fuck am not paying. AITA?\n\nBackground, she is 27 and partially owns her own company. She always complains about how hard she works and never has time to do anything. This all happened during my week away from the oil patch. I work 120-168 hours per week. I was bombarded with messages. \n\nLastly she does occasionally watch my dog but really my other roommate does that. ",

      "description": "We recently moved to the town. We have a large, mixed breed dog. He is highly trained, fully licensed and registered in accordance with local law, and fully vaccinated and up to date on all shots. He's part of our lease by name and the landlords (two-family, they're the other floor) gave us full permission to have the dog here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor 3 months, we have had no issues with anyone in the neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of a sudden last night, one of our neighbors flipped out on my fiance and started yelling at her (mind you, from across the street and one house over - where this neighbor lives) about our dog because he was not on a leash. He was on our property at the time, not barking, and just following my fiance around. The local ordinances do not require a dog to be leashed while on the owner's property. It is very clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tried to de-escalate the situation and even put him on a leash. The yelling and harassing continued. They she threatened to call the police.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came home to a very upset fiance, so I called the police and made a report about what happened, but declined to have an officer come over and address anyone in person. I thought maybe it would not happen again and at least there was a record.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure enough, I'm outside cleaning snow off of everyone's cars and I'm approached by said neighbor. She starts off friendly, but then side-tracks onto a ton of invasive questions about who I am, who owns the dog, etc. So I say I live here. That's my dog. What's the problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same nonsense as the night before starts. You can't have him off leash. He has to be fenced in. I don't want any other dogs out on this street. I'm afraid of your dog. You can't have him outside like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say I'm sorry, but you're just not right. The law is clear. We are not in the wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes nowhere. She continues to escalate the situation verbally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I just sort of said okay, forget this. And called the police. I did not want to waste their time but I felt this needed to be addressed and it is so unfair that we're afraid to walk our own dog because of this nonsense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police agreed with us and instructed the neighbor accordingly. It was ridiculous and should never have even escalated to that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for calling the cops?",

      "description": "This is my first post here, and I'll talk about something that happened some time ago.\nI met this boy and we chatted for a bit. He was depressed at the time and I helped him. A few weeks after we met he starts acting strange. He randomly complimented me, and things like that. And I was happy because I felt like I was helping him. He was a bit creepy tho, he once told me he was touching himself (wth..?) and things like that. After three weeks of knowing each other, he confessed to me, telling me that he's in love with me. And at first I didn't believed him. We've been knowing each other for a short time, and I thought it was weird that he fell for me. He also lives really far away from me, we don't even speak the same Language. Anyway, I told him that I don't feel something for him because it's too early, and that we should just wait a little longer. Now, I tried to tell him in the nicest way possible, but he didn't get it.\nWe kept talking, and I realized I'd never fall for him. He kept telling me he wanted me to be happy with him after I told him that we didn't need to be in a relationship to be happy and I just wanted to be friends.\nHe then started to make weird drawings of us kissing or hugging. At first I was okay with it, but after some time it started to make me feel uncomfortable. I felt like he was forcing me to be with him, but I didn't told him that, hoping that he would stop. He kept referring to us as a \"couple\" even tho I never really agreed on that, so I told him that he should first ask me if I want to be in a relationship with him. So he asks me to if I want to be his girlfriend, and I say no, because it's too early and, even if I feel something for him, it's not it the \"romantic sense\", and I hoped he would've understand. I didn't wanted him to be sad about it, so I didn't told him straight that I only saw him as a friend. And that was a mistake. The day after I rejected him, he sent me another drawing of us, knowing that it makes me uncomfortable, and then he starts saying things like: \"we are a beautiful couple. We feel the same way about each other, you're maybe just scared of how you feel but it's okay, we can make it, because we're in love\". Now, I'm a really calm person and I rarely get mad. But as I was reading this I knew I couldn't take it anymore.\nI told him that he clearly didn't understood what I meant the other day. I told him that I'm not in love with him, I'm not interested and I'll never be interested, and also that he needs to stop drawing us and referring to us as a couple because it's cringy and I absolutely hate it. We have a discussion and then he blocks me. So, that's it. I actually felt a bit bad that I attacked him like that, but he wouldn't understand. On the other hand, I feel like he's the one who should feel bad, because if he didn't made me feel like I was being forced into a relationship, we could've been great friends. Anyway, thanks for reading this and tell me your opinions about it!",

      "description": "Throwaway account because they also use reddit and browse this stuff. \n\nSo about a year ago I went to a different school and tried to be a very friendly person. I met this girl named Anna. Anna was kind of a piece of trash. She was wealthy and didn’t realize it, treated people like garbage, and was a dick about how super smart she was. \n\nWe met because we had a couple of the same classes and both played a little bit of video games during our down time. She was nice to me and we hanged out a bit. Like I said earlier she was super smart. She didn’t need to take any notes or do any studying to get A’s. This eventually lead to her annoying me everyday asking for me to ignore class and to play games and talk. At first I didn’t care too much because we were in an easy spot in the semester and I was cruising along, so I agreed to. But eventually the classes got harder(duh) and I needed to pay attention but she wouldn’t let me. I could tell her to screw off from time to time, but I always felt like a dick doing so.  She even convinced me to stay after school to do ‘studying’ which just ended up to be more of her playing video games and me either playing with her or trying to study while she again nagged and annoyed me. This did eventually lead to me failing the classes while she passed with an A. So needless to say my GPA tanked and I was pissed, but I was still nice to her because I knew it wasn’t 100% her fault.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of the next school year and for personal reasons I’m forced to move to a different area/school. I had lived in a trash neighborhood and didn’t have many friends so it wasn’t that bad of a move. I still had her added on steam and on my phone so she still talked to me a bit. Eventually I realized that I didn’t really hangout/talk with her because she was a friend, but more out of pity that not a lot of people liked her. This lead to me deciding that I shouldn’t have to talk to her if I didn’t want to and completely ghosted her. I don’t regret doing it, but it was kinda of a dick move. I still feel like a huge asshole and I wanted to ask you guys for your opinions. ",

      "description": "I have a friend who has been staying with me for a few months. He has a dog, who also stays here, cause well, theyre a package. However on Friday he left to visit his daughter and said \"I'll see you in a bit\", and never came back. \n\nI was going to say something the next morning asking why he never bothered to see if it was okay, but I remembered tht he was visiting his daughter, and thats probably where he still was. So I left it alone until this morning when I had finally had enough and let him know I was quite upset that he had been gone so long without his dog and never bothered to check in or see if I had plans. \n\nThis started an argument about how he didnt think he had to and he was with his daughter so he assumed it would be okay. \n\nI said it would have been okay had he taken 2 seconds to text me to let me know what was going on. Again he said he didnt think he had to and he would watch my dog if I left. I told him I wouldn't just leave without saying anything or checking in out of respect and responsibility. \n\nIt just continued to spiral from there and during which he kept bringing up that he was visiting with his kid and I should be more understanding. He insisted on bringing his daughter home to her mother from his moms because I made him feel bad so he was going to \"fix it\". I even told him that i wasnt telling him to to come back, but i was telling him that i was displeased after not hearing from him since friday. \n\nSo, am i the asshole because I got upset my friend left friday to see his kid without his dog and never messaged to check in to see if it was okay?",

      "description": "It’s my first semester in college, and I would be lying if I said I had tons of friends. I’m in my school’s honors academy, and all of my close friends are also honors students.\n\nMy classmates know that I work hard in school because I am always doing my best to participate in class discussions. I know that it can be discouraging to professors to not have anyone answer their questions, so I’m always trying to actively be a part of the class discussion.\n\nThat said, whenever exams roll around, I’m always getting emails from people who I can’t even put a face to the name asking me to help them study. Today was our last class day of the semester, and I had a group of 5 or 6 people swarm me in my first class asking for my number “in case they needed help”.\n\nNow, I’m perfectly fine with forming study groups and collaborating to study for the exams. This actually happened during midterms as well, and I agreed to help form a group study guide for one class on Google Docs. However, I was the ONLY person who was contributing to it, so eventually I just made a copy and did my own work.\n\nI’m okay with studying with people, but when tons of people ask me for help and I’m not benefitting at all, it just feels like I’m a free tutor. I’m trying to see this from the point of view of people who might be struggling in class and just want help from someone, but it feels like I’m being taken advantage of just because they know I’m smart. Some of these people have literally never talked to me before beyond asking for exam help. AITA for just wanting to ignore them and do my own studying alone?",

      "description": "Sorry for poor formatting I’m on mobile.\n\nSo my science teacher recently told me that I was going to be recommended for honors science, even though I’m not in the more advanced math class ( which normally is the standard to be put in this class, but isn’t a prerequisite). I work very hard in my science class so the teacher recommended for the honors class regardless of my math class. I had told 3 of my friends that I was put into my class, two of which were also in that class and one who wasn’t in that class (though I thought he was in the class). I had struggled with school the year before so I was very enthusiastic about my achievement, so I came of as kind of loud and excited. My friend who wasn’t recommended for honors class (let’s call home 1). Expressed happiness for my achievement, like the good friend he is and then we shortly left school on our respective busses. When I get back home I start scrolling through reddit and notice 1 had texted me through the app a couple of times, where he goes on about how self centered I am and I shouldn’t brag about being in the science class due to the teacher liking me. When I was telling him about this I didn’t try to come off as bragging, and was just very proud of myself (as I said before I had struggled in school the year before). I completely disagree and the science teacher isn’t the type of person to play favorites. He also talked about since he’s in the harder math class he should have honors science, which came off kinda entitled but he was pretty obviously upset about this so I let it slide. He said that we were the same in science (which isn’t true I have a higher grade for this trimester and the yearly average) so he used that as further “evidence” of favoritism from said science teacher. 1 said he was also going to bed and not responding to any messages that day so I decided to wait until school tomorrow. When we arrived at lunch ( we have no classes together, so that’s the only time we really hangout at school) he didn’t say anything about it so I assumed he was no longer mad, and I’m non confrontational do I didn’t want to start any problems so I didn’t bring it up. I thought that we were done with this whole dilemma until I went into science class and the teacher told me that “someone” complained about me being put into honors math. This was on Friday so no further update on the school part, but AITA for telling 1 that I’m in that class, or is he TA for trying to get me out of honors class and getting mad at me for being the “favorite” of the science teacher. I honestly think this is an ESH situation but I need some feedback, so tell me Reddit who’s TA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "(First post, not a native english speaker, maybe a little bit long post?)\nIt is not like I hate them, but I just can't seem to like my parents and brothers in any sort of way.\n\nI feel this way for my parents because I was always forced to be like my two really intelligent brothers, so I never had the option to try things for myself. When I was in elementary school I had to always get 100s on tests or my dad would be insatisfied and I would have to study until midnight memorizing everything for the exams.\n\n Not being able to sleep properly made me always be in a bad mood and angry so I wasn't able to make a lot of friendships through elementary school. I understand that its important to have good grades for your future and stuff but it still was a pain that I couldn't get a single \"good job\" if I got a 96 or 98. And it would get me angry some years later in middle school when my sister got a bad grade on an exam yet he didn't seem to care about it. I would get forced to play soccer or karate even if I wasn't good at it just because my dad wanted me to play and I would never actually play in anything official since I just naturally suck at most sports, yet I would still be looked down upom just because I'm not athletic enough.\n\n As for my brothers, they didn't want me to hang out with them so I was always stuck on my parents room playing by myself. They mostly stayed on the living room and whenever I managed to be in there for a while my brother would talk about why do I even want to be there because I'm not talking at all or stuff like that. My sister mostly ignored me, but my brother was more like the asshole older brother you see on TV, so I was stuck being made fun of by him or treated roughly, and since we slept on the same room he would sometimes just throw my out of it for hours. Seems reasonale that being a little kid you could be annoying to older kids, but not having almost anywhere in your own house where you could feel comfortable and playing monopoly and LEGOs by myself for 7 years wasn't really fun at all. \n\nAfter starting middle school and nowadays on my last year in high school my parents act like they were always nice and want me to talk with them more, yet I don't really have anything that I would like to talk with them about. My brother just sends me messages like if we were best friends or something and it annoys me a lot so I just never reply. I mostly am \"accustomed\" to being by myself both in school and at home, since I never experienced that much what it was like having fun or talking with others.\n\nI sometimes feel I could be playing victim as those things happened in the past and I should move forward, but even if I try I don't think I can ever get to like my family.",

I told her that she chose to have a child, not me, and that you have to choose to be a father. I'm a sperm donor.

      "description": "This happened almost a decade ago, but I think about it from time to time as it ruined a friendship and I find myself retracing the incident to see if maybe, as I grow older, I get a different perspective on the story.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I had a major crush on a female friend of mine. For the sake of conversation, we’ll call her Hannah. Hannah was beautiful, funny, brilliant and had a heart of gold. She was truly a beacon of happiness for all of those around her. She would bring in homemade snacks frequently, and would make sure to make everyone feel special on their birthday, popular or otherwise. She was a very nice human being.\n\nWhen we were freshman, Hannah started dating a junior who we will call Marcus. Marcus was honestly a pretty cool dude, but since he began to date my crush, I didn’t like him very much. As time went on though and I saw how happy they were together, my feelings for Hannah subsided. I dated other girls and came to be best friends with Marcus. Some of my best high school memories were hanging out with him (with or without Hannah).\n\nWhen Marcus graduated high school, he went to a nearby university to pursue a degree in business. His goal was to finish his degree while maintaining a relationship with Hannah, and it started out very well. As time went on, their relationship began to strain and you could feel Marcus wanting to potentially end it.\n\nHannah was determined that they were soulmates and that they would be together forever. They lost their virginity to one another and had dated for nearly 4 years.\n\nAs the relationship continued to fall apart, everyone around them could see the writing on the wall. Family and friends were already prepping for the “divorce,” where each person gets a subset of the friends and such. The two of them continued to struggle to make it work. Even watching a movie together would usually somehow end up with bickering.\n\nMarcus and I both happened to work at the same dead end job (perfect for a high schooler/college student though). Since the university he was attending was so close to home, he continued to work at the same place while going to school. He already knew the ropes and management knew he had a really good work ethic.\n\nAt our job, a new young lady was hired. She was a nice, and obviously had a crush on Marcus. Marcus quickly realized this. He asked me what he should do. I said, “You need to do what you feel is right. If that happens to be dating the new girl, that is fine. You just HAVE TO break up with Hannah first.”\n\nHe dreaded breaking her heart, but he decided that it was time to end the relationship. I honestly don’t know how he did it, but I would guess that he did via text message. It goes without saying that you should do something like that face to face, but that was his decision.\n\nAnyways, the next day in school, Hannah says to me, “Marcus said that he wants to break up, but he didn’t mean it.” I was shocked, and assumed that Marcus had talked to her and decided that they would try to make it work.\n\nThe next time I worked with Marcus, I asked him how his relationship with Hannah was going. “What relationship...?” “Well dude,” I said, “She says that you two are still going out.” Marcus is clearly upset and says “I told her I wanted to end it, and she said that I was just confused and didn’t know what I was saying. What should I do?” I told him that if he actually told her that they were breaking up, then he is no longer in a relationship with her. The end. With my agreement, regarding whether or not his relationship was actually over, he proceed to spend time with the new girl at work.\n\nA few days later in school, Hannah approaches me in Calculus. She is yelling, in front of the whole class, about how I betrayed her and how I encouraged Marcus to cheat on her.\n\n“Did he tell you that you two were over,” I questioned. “Yes, but he didn’t mean it,” she shouted back. “Then it’s over! He has the right to end a relationship! The same right as you,” I told her. She stomped off and never spoke to me again.\n\nWhile she was nice and kind to everyone over the four years I knew her in high school, she had become manipulative and mean towards Marcus. Not to say that he was a perfect boyfriend by any means, but she just wasn’t as friendly or nice to him as the years went on. It made me grateful we never dated and almost like I dodged a bullet.\n\nAnyways, I haven’t talked to her since that day in Calculus. I did, in a very “what are the odds” kind of moment, run into Hannah and Marcus in a coffee shop in my hometown last year. None of us live in that town anymore, let alone that state. It was the Christmas season though, so I’d assume we were all back to visit family. Regardless, I walked up to them and said “Well I’ll be damned. Look who it is!” I quickly realized that my presence wasn’t welcomed and I grabbed a table on the other side of the cafe. Even though I clearly saw them, they made sure to slip out the side door, even though they were parked right in front of the main door and I could see their entire “getaway.”\n\nI know this was a long story, but essentially, AITA for saying my friend Marcus was actually broken up with Hannah, assuming what he told me was the truth?",

I've always been a bit heavier than my other friends, but that doesn't say much when most of my other friends are dancers and athletes. In fact, we've both always been usually the heavier people in the group until about 2 or 3 years ago when I lost 15 pounds and my BMI became around a 20. She was now the \"odd one out\" when it came to weight. \n\n I recently entered a relationship while my friend has been pining for someone for a while. One day, she just straight out asked me, \"Why doesn't anyone like me?\" I explained that it wasn't her, it was them, and that being in a relationship should not define you. I thought it was the end of that. Turns out that instead, she became depressed and gained 25 pounds. She was now obese. I supported her until she got better, but her complaining just continued. \n\n Recently, she's been trying to find clothes that she can wear to a party, complaining that everywhere she goes, nothing is in her size. One day, I got fed up and told her, \"Maybe you should try going on a diet or something.\" She didn't take this lightly and accused me of calling her fat. I told her, straight, that maybe it wouldn't hurt to lose a few pounds so that she has something to wear, but she didn't listen and has since then ghosted me. \n\n Am I in the wrong?",

      "description": "This happened yesterday. I went skiing with a couple friends and eventually split up for about a half hour so they could grab something to eat. As I was getting on a lift, the guy in the seat in front of me lit a cigarette. He kept puffing on it over and over again until he looked like a fucking chimney and wouldn’t stop. All his second-hand smoke was going straight back into my face and I was starting to get annoyed. I tried pulling my mask over my nose and mouth but that didn’t help at all. Eventually, about halfway up, I asked him “hey man could you put that out until we get to the top? It’s blowing right back into my face.” He turned around, told me to “deal with it” and kept smoking away. The lift is about 10 minutes and even though that’s not much, it was enough to push me to the brink. Once we got to the top, I asked him again to be more courteous to those around him when he’s smoking. He replied “man shut the fuck up” and gave me the finger. I said “if you’re that hooked on cigs that you can’t cut it out for ten damn minutes, maybe you should seek help” and slid away. He swore at me a couple more times as I was heading down towards one of the hills and said I’m a cunt for “giving someone shit for an addiction”\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Some backstory (and I'm as I'm sort of emotional over some of the things that were said to me, I am trying my very best to be even handed but may not be successful):\n\nI married my wife 5 years ago and went to work using my MBA. I quickly got sick of feeling like I was just trading emails around so I quit. My brother in law offered me temporary job in his business. I don't want to be specific but it's a skilled trade type job where we make medical appliances for individuals. I quickly found the work fascinating and since we work in things like gold, silver, plasters and acrylics, it's a very \"artisan\" oriented job and I actually really enjoy my finished products. Plus there's some satisfaction that I am helping people live more comfortable lives. \n\nBut my brother-in-law hazed the fuck out of me for the lack of a better term. He was just shitty to me. My sister says he's always been like this but unlike my MBA job I could clock out at 5 and be done with it, plus I like other people I worked with. \n\nSo three things happened in the last year. One is that I found out my Brother in Law was paying me about 3/5 of what he was paying everyone else who does my job and I was making even less than a brand new hire who had just come on. At that point I started looking for other work.  2nd thing that happened was I overheard a dinner conversation between BIL and another brother in law in that the one I worked for was wasting close to half a million dollars a year because he just wasn't getting stuff out on time, losing customers, being inefficient and his employees stealing precious metals from him. He also said he was helpless to do anything about it. Thirdly, I was doing a delivery and one of the doctors who installs our stuff asked me who did a certain piece. I told him that it was one of mine. He said the quality was heads and tails above anyone else and that he was so sick of my BIL's lateness and dismissive attitude that he would happily provide me with some financial backing to start my own business. \n\nSo I went home that night and talked with my wife and she was in full favor of it. This was in late October so I quit my BIL, started doing as much as I could at home with the tools and equipment I had. We hired a lawyer who drew up incorporation documents and as of today I am 55%/45% owner with the doctor. We have 10 employees and I've been literally working myself to the bone but happily doing so. \n\nI figured there was plenty of business in the state but wanted to avoid stepping on my BILs toes but when other clients found out I was in business, the abandoned him en-masse. So much so that he has had to dramatically drop his prices in order to keep the ones who would stay. But I still get calls almost daily from his clients. At this point, I have to turn them away because I'm too busy but I am in the process of hiring more people (some of the worked for my BIL). \n\n\nI'm sorry I'm getting to the point. My Father in law had a birthday lunch today. We were invited by my mother in law but my wife and I didn't even make it through the door before pretty much all her brothers and sisters (7 of them) told us that we were complete assholes for what we've done and we are no longer welcome at family events. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\ntl;dr: I opened the same type of business as my brother in law after working for him for 3 years. He was complete shit to me both in attitude and pay and I found out he wasn't a great businessman. I was invited by one of his clients to start a business with him so I did. Now we are not welcome at family events .\n",

We had been on and off for nearly 9 years and it was mostly hell for me. Calling me pathetic, stupid, bitch, cunt, literally anything you can think of. Throwing things at me, choking me, getting belligerently drunk almost every night and starting fights over TV shows and really dumb things. On more than one occasion he left marks on my neck and arms because of grabbing or choking or holding me against the wall. I'm still not really over what happened if I'm going to be honest. \n\nI've learned through other sources that he's been seeing someone, and I have access to her Facebook account. I have a strong urge to send her a message telling her to be careful and maybe send her some screenshots I still have where he admits to the physical and emotional abuse. I'm torn on the morality of this though. Everyone in this scenario is an adult and can make their own choices, but I honestly just don't want anyone to be treated like I was. ",

      "description": "Back in 2011 I met this girl who was amazing in every single way at least in my eyes at the time. Before we started dating, we revealed facts about ourselves that we think the other person should know. One thing she told me was that she was no longer a virgin at 15 years old. (She thought it was a deal breaker because her ex told her so. I didn't mind.) One thing I told her was that I was a virgin and I was devoid of any sexual experience except making out. \n\nWe started going out and we would hang out all by ourselves and nothing sexually would happen because I was trying to be respectful while getting to know her. Anyway, when we would make out, she gets frustrated that I was not making a move so she would grab my hands and put it in places that she wanted to. That started a few months of me pleasuring her without her doing anything to me because I would decline politely. She always took the lead at this point. A few months later she really wanted to do stuff to me too so that happened and it eventually led to her wanting to have sex. I expressed my hesitations to do it but she would get mad and offended as to why I don't want to go through with it. I explained my anxiety about the whole thing and that I was just trying to be respectful whenever I don't make a move during our time alone. It was a constant friction for us that one time I finally said screw it. Let's do it. \n\nWe finally did it and it slowly turned into a daily thing. I finally got comfortable with it but I was still not making the first move usually whenever it happens. Because she complained about it, I started making the first move when I feel like something's about to happen. Months of this happened and she said she was happy about the sex life. If we didn't see each other for 4 days she would throw herself at me for some action. That kind of thing and frequency. Further down the line, one time during sex which started organically, she started crying in the middle. I stopped and asked her what happened. She told me that she felt pressured to have sex with me for as much sex as we had. I was confused by this because she pretty much set the rules for what she wanted from me regarding sex. She didn't want to talk about it and we didn't.\n\nI stopped making moves starting that day but we still had sex when she got turned on but a lot less often. She would still get mad at me even if it was her making the first move. She ended up not wanting to make out because it might lead to sex. So after these, we had a couple of years of relationship where we only held hands, hugged, and a quick kiss on the lips at most for intimacy. Other than the sex, the relationship day to day was good until the last few months before breaking up. The whole relationship lasted for 6 years and we only broke up due to an unrelated reason.\n\nWe never got another try to discuss what went wrong in our sex life. I've been thinking about it for a while now and I just want to know. Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "*Mild Spoilers for Captain Marvel*\n\nSo yesterday was my birthday and I went to see Captain Marvel. I generally enjoy the MCU so I thought it would be fun. I went with some old work friends and my dad tagged along.\n\nThe theater for the most part is empty. There were probably 3 other groups/pairs for this showing. \n\nWhen the previews started the first one was for Shazam and that's when it started. I have heard the term \"Legbeard\" before from reddit and have seen people that by appearance would be described as such but I never thought of them as such because you never know how a person will act.\n\nThis person acted the part. She started yelling at the screen saying how \"Carol Danvers is the REAL Captain Marvel\" and going on saying DC was shit. She acted up again during the \"Dark Phoenix\" preview yelling for Jean to kill all the males. Then there was this preview of a movie with Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson. I was unable to catch the name but basically the two are thieves/grifters. A scene played for comedy is Rebel Wilson pretending to be blind and she gropes Anne and says something like \"Sir, could you please give me some room? Sir?\" basically a small boob joke and this woman did not like that and said it was Hollywood misogyny.\n\nThe movie starts and she is quiet. I didn't say anything during the previews because they were previews and I was hoping it would end. But it didn't.\n\nThere are scenes in the movie where guys are being assholes. Like a pilot saying \"You know why they call it the cockpit?\" and a skeezy guy on a bike whistling at Carol and asking her to smile and even her mentor does some shitty stuff. Anyway whenever there was a shitty dude onscreen or a \"girl power\" moment this lady would keep yelling shit at the screen like \"fuck that asshole\" \"Yeah carol kick him in the dick\" or other stuff. Luckily there were no younger kids in this showing. One group looked like late Jr high or early high school but they seemed uncomfortable because they were all guys.\n\nAnyway I had enough so I went to talk to some of the workers there to see if they could quiet her down. I told and usher and a ticket taker but no one came to the theater. I got up again and talked to the concessions manager but nothing happened then either. Finally afterword I found the actual shift manager and he came in and talked to the woman. No idea what was said but it did not help because she was back at yelling at the screen.\n\nMy friends who I went with were upset because they said I should just let the woman have her fun. Usually when we go to movies we go to a place that serves alcohol and is known for getting rowdy so they are used to this behavior. I purposely had us go to a Cinemark because I didn't want that behavior for this movie because it was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy it.\n\nTL;DR - My friends think I am the asshole for trying to get a loud person kicked out of the theater.",

      "description": "Last summer I moved into my sisters, well, shed basically. There’s no insulation so it’s impossible to heat (this winter dropped to 9*F), there’s a sort of kitchen but no counter space or cupboards, a breaker trips if I have more than a couple things plugged in and running, and it’s full of spiders and beetles. I pay rent &amp; utilities similar  to what I’d pay for studio in the area. My boyfriend and I have been talking abut getting a place together, and then this month his rent went up by a ridiculous amount. We decided to start looking for a place immediately, but I said in the mean time he could stay with me. Now, he’s been staying with me nearly every night for the last 3 months so I didn’t think it would be an issue. I told my sister what was our plan was, and she said they were fine with it. But then a few hours later she said that she talked with her husband and he wants to run a background check on him and draft a rental contract. I feel really uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I’ve been paying them cash at their request to rent a crummy shed (I also dog sit for them and shuttle their kids around as needed). And my BF isn’t a stranger to them; they’ve met, we’ve had dinners and board game nights and drinks together. And like I said, he’s basically been here for 3 months already. I understand I am in their space and I want to be respectful of that, but I feel like it’s an unnecessary invasion of privacy. Am I the asshole if I don’t want to agree to a background check? ",

      "description": "My mother is someone who wants to be the “cool mom” and often gangs up on me with my brother and his friend who lives with us. For example, my minor brother drinks all the time and openly talks about it, when I told him not to drink  and drive he got angry and began yelling about how I act like a second mother and just need to shut up, my mom then will get involved and tell me to be quiet because I’m acting like a “pretentious bitch”. Anything can set them off, I admit, yes sometimes I say things that I probably shouldn’t, but sometimes I’ll just say I don’t like a tv character and they will start. On top of this my brother is extremely disrespectful in every regard, especially to my mom, but when he’s yelling at her she sits there but when he leaves she takes it out on me and gets angry about mundane things I do that didn’t rectify the situation. At this point I’m old enough to get my own apartment and everyday I get closer to getting one in a different city and not looking back. Part of me feels bad but I just don’t care I’m the long run, I want to leave and not talk to them or visit them. I’m tired of being an outsider, however when I bring this up people tell me that I shouldn’t do things like that to my mother and that I should change my attitude \nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, I'm currently a student in my second year at a business college. So far, I've taken strictly online classes and been put in many group projects.. and I've hated every single one. As a preface, online classes are on 7 week terms, so they are really fast-paced. So, I'm in a project management course right now and we were assigned groups for a 5-week project.\n\nSo, I created a slack channel for all of the members to join so that everyone can respond on time and have no excuses. This was created Tuesday afternoon. All throughout today (Wed) they have been joining the channel. I greeted each individual as they joined and only one responded throughout the entire day (we'll call him Member #1). Keep in mind, at midnight tonight (Wed) we have a project due on software we were assigned. I started messaging our Slack group chat at around 7PM and Member #1 was the only one that responded to me for 2 hours. We ended up figuring out everything we had to do and finished the work with no sign of the other group members. Keep in mind, in Slack, when you swipe to the left, you are able to see who is online and physically looking at the chat. I saw the other group members online and looking at the chat multiple times while Member #1 and I were talking. I then asked if they were in the chat and able to respond and got no response. Long story short, Member #1 and I finished our work at around 10PM.\n\nNow that Member #1 and I were done, I filled out an evaluation form for the group that's used for tracking our progress throughout the 5 weeks. I marked the other group members as 0 participation and noted in the spreadsheet that they did not discuss with Member #1 and I about the work even once. I mentioned it's not a huge deal and that I talked to them about it individually in hopes that things will improve in the future. I then messaged the Slack chat and told the non-participating members that I marked them as 0 participation, that it's nothing serious, and that I hope that the communication can improve for the future. I honestly would've waited for them to respond until midnight, but they literally did not say a word to me all day in our group chat in addition to ignoring my message throughout the conversation when I asked them if they were in the chat while I saw they were online.\n\nI personally think I was a little harsh about it, but I also think that it was a solid leadership move to keep them accountable. I asked my dad about it and he said \"if I was a 30 year old guy in that class and some young kid was talking to me like that, I wouldn't respond just out of spite.\" I thought that was an extremely arrogant POV and still warrants them to be kept accountable.\n\nTLDR; college class group members didn't respond once after being in a group chat and watching the conversation while me and another member got the work done. I submitted a review saying they had a zero participation ranking and told them they need to better their communication for the future. AITA?",

      "description": "I’m (24F) in a fairly new relationship with this guy, let’s call him M (23M); we’ve been together for about 3 months. He’s slightly more “traditional” in some ways; he likes to open doors for me, wants me to walk in front of him, etc. (this is relevant). \n\nWe live in a huge city, and it’s extremely common for people to cross the street when the WALK sign is not lit if there are no cars coming, or even if there are cars but they are a block or more away.  I noticed recently that when we’re out together, whenever I try to cross the street like this-- even when other people are also crossing-- his reflex is to snatch my arm and pull me back, as if I were about to run in front of a car. At first, I found it kind of endearing, like “aw, he’s worried about my safety”, and chalked it up to his other “traditional” behaviors, but now I’ve started to dislike it; it startles me, is unnecessary and feels a little insulting, like he doesn’t trust me to handle myself.  I hadn’t said anything until last night because I still felt that his intentions were good.\n\nCut to last night. We were heading back home after drinking with friends. I was definitely drunk but not blacked out or sloppy; I wasn’t falling over or confused. I started to cross a street that had very slow traffic, but I was not near a car and there were lots of other people crossing. He grabbed me and pulled me back as he usually does, and at that moment, it pissed me off. I didn’t say anything, but I yanked my arm back and continued crossing without him. \n\nOnce we were alone, we got into an argument about it; me giving him attitude by pulling away really hurt him. He said that he was just trying to look out for my safety, it wasn’t just because I was girl and he would have done that with any of his friends, and he thought I was going to run in front of a car because I was drunk. He was mad enough that he said didn’t want to see me for a couple days. \n\nI apologized and thanked him for looking out for me, and explained how it made me feel. He apologized too, but he’s still unhappy with me.  Reddit what should I do? AITA? ",

      "description": "Obligatory sorry for mobile\n\nSo my gf left me the day before my birthday. I had recently gone to uni and she couldn't handle the distance. She claimed to loved me a lot and wanted me to be the one, and I loved her to bits, but it was a mutual break up as the distance was soul crushing.\n\nThat night, I spent the early hours of my 19th birthday opening 2 gashes ln my lower stomach. It's dark, but you get the idea on the feelings I had for this girl (I don't want sympathy, I'm doing better now that my meds have kicked in).\n\nThe break up went pretty smooth and I have been managing since, although there definitely still are feelings, I know it was for the best.\n\nWell it's now 2 weeks later, and I learned that she's sleeping with a work colleague. It felt a bit off, and I don't feel jealous, but it felt a bit disrespectful that after 2 weeks she jumps into hooking up with friends. I told her how I felt, and she started getting super defensive and gaslighting me saying I have no right to involve myself in this and we're no longer together I can do whatever I want. And I get that, she can do what she wants. \n\nBut I feel completely betrayed, the fact she gets so defensive and tell me she wishes she didn't tell me and blames me for how I feel tells me that she knew it wasn't right to do that so soon. And it makes me feel that the whole 2 years of relationship we had was more about attention (which was a long suspicion I had but put out of mind, and this suspicion was well-founded) than it was genuine feelings.\n\nLearning this has made me feel like I don't know her anymore and has really torn me apart a second time since the break-up. I get she can do what she wants, but 2 weeks, I feel, is way too short to be respectful to feelings the other person may still have, and the way she manipulatively defended it feels like the whole relationship was just superficial. \n\nI feel like I don't know who she really is anymore.\n\nI don't know.

      "description": "I was supposed to have a doctors appointment today during school hours and my dad was supposed to pick me up at around 10 o’clock. He tells me before I leave that he’s picking me up “a quarter till”. I have absolutely no idea what that means and it’s really hard telling time with my dad so I ask him again before I had to go. He keeps telling me a quarter till like I’m supposed to understand what that means. I was pretty sure he meant 15 after 10 and I was already late so I had to go. \n\nIt’s 10:15 and I wait outside for my dad and he doesn’t show up. I call him and he said he already left and it’s my fault for not showing up. He said he already took my Xbox and I won’t be able to use it the entire weekend. Keep in mind, he didn’t call or text ONCE to ask where I was and just left. I don’t think it’s justified at all to be treating me like this especially after knowing I have trouble understanding what he’s saying a lot of the time. I send him a text explaining this and he calls me disrespectful and “to stupid to understand” and that I need to “shut up and listen.” He continues to insult me over text and at this point I’m just mad cause I’m gonna be bored. Called me a POS. Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: My dad doesn’t pick me up after giving me  confusing instructions. He punishes me and insults me over text. AITA?",

      "description": "So my friend invited me over for dinner the other day and made pasta. It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I don't usually post my problems, but I really don't know what to do. \n\nSo my older brother(29) and I(17) have always had problems. He's always been mean to me and doesn't seem to care about my well being like he does our sister(19). We both live with our mother(54). My mom had gained custody of me 2 years ago. I brought my stuff and I had a Keurig. He really likes coffee, so I let him use it under the condition that he cleans it just enough that it doesn't get disgusting. I rarely use and when I do I use it for hot water, which is another reason why I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole or not. He had been using it for awhile and I decided to use it so I could have some tea. I thought that since I was using it, I should wipe it down a little. This is what I call his \"first offence\". The tray was so sticky that the top wouldn't come off and when it did come off I discovered that there was mold growing inside of it. I was disgusted and told him to clean it or he would lose the right to use the Keurig. He didn't, until three days later when my mom yelled at him for it. He started buying water filters for it after that, so I let him continue using it. \nThe \"second offense\" came a little later. This isn't as bad, but after the mold incident I was less forgiving. He wouldn't clean out the ground that would collect in the top. So I asked him that if he was going to use it for coffee, if he could clean out the grounds that got left there. He didn't, until my sister got involved.\n The \"third offense\" is actually four of the same occurrences. When he would switch out the filters he would always misplace one, or he just wouldn't see it sitting there on the self. If he didn't see it he would yell at mom and me for moving his things. After the fourth time of this I took my Keurig, cleaned it out and packed it away for until I move, so that he can't use it. \nIt belongs to me, so I feel like it shouldn't be a big deal if I take it away, but why do I feel like the asshole. Am I the asshole for taking it away?",

      "description": "First time poster on this sub, have mercy. This happened about 5 or 6 days ago and is still bothering me, therefore I'm posting this. This post is a little long, sorry about that!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background that will become important later. I am 17 years old and my parents have been divorced for about 10 years now, separated for more. My dad took all 4 kids because my mom had a gambling addiction and couldn't support us. She doesn't call us to see how we're doing normally, and if she does, it's because she needs something. She'll ask simple questions, like \"Have you eaten yet?\" and then repeat those questions during the same call because she doesn't really listen/care about what we say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the day these phone calls happened, I was driving to a city about 30 minutes away from where I live. I was running some errands for my uncle (I'll refer to him as uncle 2) and a friend wanted to go eat in that city. Sure no problem, right? I receive a phone call from my mom while I'm driving to that city. These calls are translated from another language, so they might not be exactly correct.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11 AM\n\nMe: Hello?\n\nMom: What are you doing right now?  \nMe: Driving to \\[city\\].\n\nMom: Do you have uncle 1's number?\n\nMe: He doesn't have a number, but I'll give you his daughters number when she's out of school.\n\nMom: Oh okay, let me know if you stop by their house \\[30 minutes away from the city I'm driving to\\] and give me her number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimple reply of okay and I have to hang up now, I'm driving. I thought all was well and I would just text her my cousin's number at 3 PM when she gets out of school. I reach the restaurant that my friend wanted to eat at and we get seated. I receive another phone call from my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12-12:30 PM\n\nMe: Yes, hello?\n\nMom: What are you doing right now?\n\nMe: I'm out eating.\n\nMom: Are you at uncle 2's business? If you are, tell uncle 2 to give me uncle 1's number.\n\nMe: Mom, I already said uncle 1 doesn't have a number and I'll give you his daughter's number when she's out of school.\n\nMom: Okay, let me know if you stop by uncle 2's business so I can ask for uncle 1's number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimple reply of okay and I hang up. Now this is where the background information comes into play. I already told her it is literally impossible to contact uncle 1 right now. She has to wait until 3 PM when my cousin gets out of school. But as usual, she doesn't listen to what I say until she gets what she needs. So at this point, I'm a little agitated because my mom keeps asking for me to do the impossible but nothing out of the ordinary. About 10-20 minutes go by, and we get our appetizers. In the middle of eating the appetizer, I receive another phone call from my mom. Note: There were people that sat directly behind us and I didn't want to them nor my friend by being on the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12:30-1 PM\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nMom: What are you doing right now?\n\nMe: I'm eating.\n\nMom: Do you have uncle 1's number? I need to talk to him.\n\nMe: I'm eating right now, can I give it to you later?\n\nMom: Okay, \\[asks about father's personal business, that he specifically told me not to tell my mom\\]?\n\nMe: I slipped up here and told her.\n\nMom: Good, do you have uncle 1's number?\n\nNow at this point, I'm really annoyed. There are people behind me trying to have a nice conversation. My friend is sitting in silence while waiting for me to finish the phone call. I can't eat because I'm on the phone.\n\nMe: Mom, I already told you! You physically cannot contact him until his daughter gets home! Why do you even need to know his number?\n\nMy mom blows up and says something along these lines.\n\nMom: MY BUSINESS IS MY BUSINESS! YOU'VE ONLY GROWN SO MUCH AND NOW YOU'RE SO RUDE! WHY DO I NEED TO TELL YOU MY BUSINESS? I'M JUST TRYING TO CALL UNCLE 1 AND TALK TO HIM! \"WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND\" WHEN YOU GET MARRIED AND YOUR WIFE ASKS YOU ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, YOU'LL SEE. KARMA WILL GET YOU!\n\n  \nI just sat there shocked because I didn't expect that reply. I normally don't ask about my parent's business because it's not my place to do so. But my mom usually starts drama in my dad's side of the family, so I wanted to make sure this wasn't the case seeing as she desperately wanted to talk to uncle 1. I say okay bye, and I hang up. I thought she was being hypocritical because she asked what I was doing and about my father's business but she said I was rude and was never taught manners.\n\n  \nSo AITA for asking my mom about her business?  \n",

      "description": "This happened about 2 days ago. A friend texted me, (we'll call her A), asking if I thought another friend, (we'll call him B), cared about her. I immediately said yes. A and B are great friends, they trust each other with their lives, and can almost always be seen together. They also have very confused feelings about what they exactly want to be. I tried to console A and told her that she was wrong and that B absolutely does care about her. She thought he might like a different girl. I don't know B well enough to know who he likes, but I said that it was definitely possible. I told A to pursue a relationship if she wanted to. She asked me if I knew anything and I responded by telling her that B hold told me earlier that he wasn't sure if he liked her or not. That was the end of my conversation with A.\n\nIt should end there, right?\n\n B texts me about 20 minutes later and asked me what I said to A. I recount what I said, and he immediately backpedals and says he never said that. He gets mad, calls me a cunt a lot, and then starts leaving me on read. The next day at school seems totally normals until the last hour where I was trying to talk to B. He told me to shut the fuck up, and that I was acting like I didn't do anything. This put me in a pretty shitty mood. Right before I get on the bus, he told me to keep my hands off A. I hugged A about a week ago in lunch because she was feeling sad. I texted B asking him what his problem was. He responded with, \"I've heard you've been doing more than hugging.\" I asked him what he was talking about, and he responded with a confused mess of jealous babble and trying to be a badass. (He even told me to mind my own business and then texted \"GOT IT\") At this point, I'm just really tired of the whole thing and told B I wasn't going to keep arguing with him. I feel bad, but A was completely normal, and was even on my side, though wanted to be kept out of it. Some of my friends are agreeing with B and are saying that I should've minded my own business, some are on my side.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?   ",

      "description": "Background:\n\nI made these 2 friends (let's call them Brenda and Hope) when I was in a mental health group.Brenda and Hope knew I had no money because I had told them about the struggles of being on disability. \n\nWe started to go out for coffee weekly, either Brenda or Hope paying for everyone. Hope had come over a few times, two times paying for pizza was her idea (I didn't even ask for pizza, she wanted to share with with my roommate and I), Hope called me up wanting to end her life and to meet at a restaurant for a meal (I dropped literally everything after a day of full classes to make sure she was ok) and was with her the whole time she was in the waiting room and ER (she paid for coffee and food there too), I asked her for deodorant because I had none (which I agreed to pay her back for), and we went out to one other meal so we could stay warm.\n\nShe also offered me a bag of skin/hair care products because she is allergic to them. She said if I don't take them she would throw them out.\n\nSo, Brenda messages me after we went out for coffee one day and said that she can't keep paying for me and that we all would have coffee again when I could afford my own. I was upset because I was actually getting out of the house and socializing, but I understood. This was kinda the start of Hope not speaking to me.\n\nThis month Hope messaged Brenda in a group chat I was in and mentioned that they were going out for coffee and I got super upset because I had tried to make it work where they could come over and I would make coffee n such. I got told no by both of them. Hope then says that she feels that I took advantage of her.\n\nI figured that I owed Hope $350 for everything she paid for and gave me, which she agreed to. Tonight I told her I would start paying her back when I could afford to.\n\nKeep in mind that 97% of the money I got this month from student loans and rental supplement went to rent. I got a whole $13 from disability. \n\nHope said that I owed her $450 before the products she gave me and she was being generous with that figure. When I asked her to explain how I owed that much money, she backed down and said that I only owed her $350. I actually wanted to total it up so I started to list everything. She included literally every interaction we ever had. I only got to about $300 before she started to guilt trip me. I caved and said that with all the products I would make it an even $1,000. I knew that she would start to demand I pay her for the products she gave me. Keep in mind that these are used products, almost all of them are half filled.\n\nHope started to demand that I pay her in one lump sum. I told her that I would start paying her back in 6 months, after I get out of the hole with my bills. I explained that if I don't pay my bills that I won't have a phone, internet, or a place to live. She still demanded that I pay her in a lump sum.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": " So here's the thing, I live in a house of 4, we are all at university, we split bills and each individually pay our own rent.\n\nAt the start of the year there were 3 of us, we've all known each other pretty well so we shared plates and cooking equipment. This was fine considering all 3 of us were generally clean people, if things were unwashed they generally would be washed within 24 hours and wouldn't be more than 2-3 plates.\n\nA few months ago we finally found a fourth housemate, let's call him Brandon. Brandon didn't have many pans or cooking equipment so was very happy when he realised we share most things in the house. He's the type of person that eats 5 meals a day, has managed to get himself in so much dept he can barely afford food at the moment or in this case sometimes his mother pays for it.\n\nHe does not wash things properly, assumes we share food and doesn't let us know afterwards what he's used. Much of my cooking equipment has been destroyed or damaged because he leaves them dirty for more than a day during which I can't use them. He does not take conformation well and will cause an argument as he has so far. In the past I've asked him not to use something of mine but was ignored because \"he was super fucked high of his ass\" and used it anyway.\n\nA lot of things he does to the rest of the house frustrate me but if I keep going on about this I will genuinely be typing for hours. Either way I have an idea to give him a week to start using things properly around the house otherwise I ask not to share cooking equipment anymore, that from now on we only share plates and I clearly double wash my utensils because who the heck wants to be eating soap really, he just won't rinse the soap off them no matter how much someone in the house says he should.\n\nWIBTA if I withdraw sharing pans knowing that he has none and is in a very difficult financial situation but my equipment and things are no longer getting further damaged? Considering I barely get to use them since most of them are dirty when I wish to use them now. I understand that he has fucked himself financially at the moment and I am sure this will cause many issues for him so I can see how this may be a giant asshole move. But I'm tired of not being able to use my things? So WIBTA?",

      "title": "AITA For breaking up with my High School sweetheart but letting her keep doing \"Girlfriend Things\" for me?",
      "description": "The title is basically a TL;DR, but for more background I'm two years out of High school and mostly single. I say mostly because of my predicament. Her name is (Here at least) Sweety. Sweety is a tall, loud, and very pretty latina girl who is as kind and caring as the name implies. I met her my freshman year and instantly there was a connection. This however might have been because the theater teacher asked her to check on me when she saw me not engaging anyone at my first theater club meeting. I'm naturally introverted and lanky, as well as usually the tallest in the room, so with her being almost as tall as me her friends started shipping us even before we considered the possibility. Still, she made an effort to break me out of my shell and introduce me to some cool people, some who stuck by me even after the break up. She also helped with my style and confidence.\n\nWe were almost inseparable, even after she graduated (she was a year older than me) and gave eachother lots of THE FIRSTS. We considered each other as our first loves and even talked freely about marriage. That was until I graduated. When I got my car and found a good enough job to not be broke all the time. Thats when things changed, mainly my emotions. Slowly, after a year, I could no longer say I love you with the same feeling as I used too. I started chatting people up online and cybering every once in a while, finding reasons to be annoyed with her and looking for flaws. When I could finally see clearly what I was doing, I felt terrible. She loved me as deeply or perhaps deeper than she did in school, and the fact that I wanted to replace her made me feel like shit so I told her that.\n\nI tried to explain as gently and decisively as I could to her, I felt that it was unfair to her and until I could figure out what I wanted, I couldn't give her what she was giving me. This went about as well as you'd expect  with lots of tears and confessions on both sides, though mine were by far worse. After that, even when I was seeing other people, she would check in on me, and after a while she seemed to spiral from depression to full self destruction in the form of fledgling alcoholism. She would call ranting to me about feeling numb, hollow and being completely uninterested in other guys. This combined with an equally hostile home/work environment made me feel responsible for her, after all she more or less fixed me up like a dingy old car and got me out into the world. So I let her do \"Girlfriend Things\" i.e: sharing meals, cuddling, kissing, and more intimate things. Of course I skirt any mention of getting back together indefinitely, I just can't right now. I still care about her, but its been months and she still cant seem to find interest in anyone else, and its getting harder to skirt the question since I'm recovering my own broken heart. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Recently a mutual friend of Sweet and Mine (Who has been working with her to move on, not knowing we were doing things together) told me that Sweet had \"Lost her phone\" and that's why she hasn't responded to some questions I posed. I doubt this only because she knows where I live obviously and loves dropping in on me unexpectedly. Not to mention she's close to a lot of my family, altogether she should have no problem contacting me. I think she's finally blocked me.",

      "description": "Together for four-plus years. 31m, 30f. \n\nI'll say up front that the complicating factor here is that her parents told her about five weeks ago that they are getting divorced. After forty years! I can't even imagine the thought process going through her dad's head here.\n\nThis coming summer, we have her friend's wedding in another state that's close to her state and far away from the state we live in together. That is something I committed to and I will go there. Now, however, she just told me that we need to go spend time in her state afterwards so she can see her friends, she wants me to be there for the first time she has to actually see her parents. \n\nThis is an issue because she is a teacher but I am not. She's just \"off\" for this time - she doesn't have to take any vacation time and her work does not pile up. I don't have that particular luxury, and if I did, I really, really want to spend my vacation time traveling internationally instead of to her home state. \n\n(I admit this is a \"me\" thing - I spent a week and a half there during winter, too, and it is just godawful boring and terrible. I do it because I love her but I hate it.)\n\nSo here is the logic: \"I want to see my friends in my home state\" --&gt; \"If I don't go see my parents while I'm there, they will be angry\" --&gt; \"I want you to be there the first time I see my parents after they've told me they're getting divorced\". And it's worth noting that she brought up \"we always see YOUR family\" because they live much closer to us - we see them probably ten times a year on weekends. \n\nI feel trapped by her logic. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So a couple days ago I met up with my friend and to talk and just hang out and the topic of my wedding came up. My fiancé (31F) does not want his girlfriend to attend and I don’t really either, not because she’s a bad person, I just don’t have an appreciation for who she is anymore and I think she’s annoyingly self-centered.\n\nFor the most part, I side with my fiancé that there’s no reason for her to be there, and that my friend should just accept it and deal with it. I’ve explained that essentially it’s my fiance’s big day and we should just let her have the best day she’s always wanted. My friend out right stated that if he’s invited and can’t bring his girlfriend, then there’s going to be drama. \n\nAt the time I just laughed it off and thought…. Well this is gunna get trashy. But after thinking about it, I think it might be best to just not have him (and by proxy her) be there at all. Which sucks because he’s been a close friend for 30 years, and I want him there. But the evident and outright threat of drama just makes me want to not invite him at all. ",

      "description": "I'm 22 been working in software sales since last June so about 8 months. My job right now is to primarily call up prospects and see if they're interested in our product and set a meeting for an account exec (closer) to actually sell them the product. The VP of sales in our company called me a phone monkey (I'm brown) last week as a joke I think and my co-worker who sits beside me heard it. He said something along the lines of hey phone monkey, did you get my email earlier? Now I don't really think its racist as people do refer to my job in the industry as being a phone monkey but just the way he said it he knew he fucked up right away. Didn't apologize but I just looked at him and said oh yeah I got it and he basically darted away. \n\nThe next day what do you know I'm in a meeting with HR, the CEO of the startup and the VP of sales. The VP first says he's very sorry about what he said it just slipped out and he'd never say it again. CEO just also aplogized and made me aware I could take some time off outside of vacation days to cope with this. I thought about just blurting out oh it was no problem I didn't even think it was racist, but I put on a sad face and said its been a hard day since and I don't know how I'm gonna get over this. The look on the VP's face and the CEO was hilarious they were scared shitless, HR lady asks if I have any reccomendations on how we could all move forward from this. I said that I know I've only been in my current role for 8 months and usually the promotion to a closing role (account exec) comes after 16-24 months but I am doing very well and I think I would feel a lot better about my job and my role here if I were to get that promotion immediately. They all look at each other and say they need me to step out for a sec, I agree and go to the bathroom. When I get back the CEO shook my hand and the VP shook my hand and said welcome to the big leagues and they gave me the promotion. I ushered them to sit back down and negotiate the terms then and there with HR present. I negotiated an extra 10k base salary and a few more days of vacation, which no newly promoted account exec has ever done here I'm pretty sure. I got the offer letter today and everything was in proper shape so I signed and I moved into a bigger cube today. I went over to the VP of sales who's still my boss and said great to be working even more close to you again all is forgiven now lets all make some serious commission. I did this so he'd know everything is normal now and him and I are fine. \n\nI told my gf this and she said it was an asshole move to make because they basically had no choice to promote me and I put them in a terrible situation. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Okay so I feel like I just fucked up really badly especially with someones life being at stake here but I also am unsure because my intentions were pure.\n\nOkay so one of my best friends who has recently gone though a really rough breakup and is having issues with his family, recently told me that he wanted to end my life. Having been suicidal in my past, I told him that it wasnt worth it and everything gets better and he needs to stay strong (which is cliché but it seemed to help him a bit)\n\nAfter that, almost everyday he was saying he wasnt feeling good and was in a bad place to which I told him that I and a lot of other people love him and he needs to hold on and stay strong.\n\nTonight was different though. He told me he couldn't do it anymore and he was ready to end it. This is how the conversation roughly went:\n\nFriend: \"I wanna do it now, I wanna let go\"\n\nMe: \"it's not worth it. You don't need to do this\"\n\nF: \"I'm losing everyone who is important to me constantly and its always on bad terms\"\n\nM: \"What you're considering isn't going to fix that problem\"\n\nF: \"It will kill the problem though, it'll be over\"\n\nOkay so this is where I'm going to start directly quoting what both me and my friend said to each other with sight changes to names and other personal information to avoid any bias. This is where I feel that I fucked up:\n\nM: \"One of the most important people in your mum, dads, sister, step dads and my life is you. You talk about how you lose the most important people on shitty terms but at least those people are still walking. The shittiest term is someone who is in your family leaving for good. I'm sorry if I'm coming off as harsh but you need to hear this stuff because just telling you that \"it'll get better\" ain't gonna change how you think.\"\n\nF: \"Sam, Fuck off. You dont have a clue what my family go through, what they have gone through. Tell me again about family leaving and i'll kill you\"\n\nSo I can see that he thought I meant that his family would leave him because I said \"The shittiest term is someone in your family leaving for good.\" By which I actually meant that thats what his family would go though if he left and not any of his family members. Anyway, I went on to try to explain this:\n\nM: “No [Friend], I'm not saying I know anything about what they go though and I'm not telling you about them leaving. I'm trying to tell you that they fucking care about you and you leaving would put them though more shit that I can tell they don't need. I'm trying to save your life man. Not ruin it\"\n\nF: “Stop, just leave”\n\nI know he’s in a bad place and at the end I was clearly getting panicked and somewhat annoyed that I wasn’t helping but I don’t know if I was being an asshole or not. I care about the kid I just don’t really know what the right thing to say to him is I guess.\n\nTL;DR: My friend is considering suicide and I was trying to help him by telling him how he would make his friends and family feel if he did go though with it and I think I may have said the wrong thing but I’m not too sure",

      "description": "Me and my roommate (R) are both college kids, with him being a year younger than me. The house we live in is a house my mom bought for me and my brother to go to school. R just moved in at the start of the fall term while I’ve been in he house for a few years.\n\nI knew he wasn’t the smartest kid before he moved in but I’ve come to realize he just doesn’t think all the time.\n\nI continuously have to remind him of things and repeat myself whenever he does something I’ve specifically stated I don’t want to have happening in my house. It’s never been anything outlandish, just like turning off electronics when not used or picking up after himself or keeping items that we share or are mine on the side of the room that I use.\n\nI don’t talk to him about these actions often outside of the times he does them so when we have had friends over and he does something that I’ve mentioned to him before, I’ll call him out again. It’s gotten really annoying always having to repeat myself so my tone isn’t always friendly and could potentially make the room feel uncomfortable which I understand. \n\nI just think that R should focus more on fixing the issues that I have to repeat instead of asking me not to bring them up with people around.",

      "description": "My husband (28m) and I (29f) are both full-time working professionals, and we have a one year old son. I’ve been working 60-80 hour work weeks for the last month, so my husband has had to help around the house more than usual (dishes, laundry, tidying up, etc). When he brought up a preplanned “guys trip” early last week, I thought it’d be fun for him &amp; encouraged him to go. It’s not the best timing, but I’ve been grateful for his extra help around the house. \n\nOur son and I are just getting over the flu. I asked him to take our son to the doctor for a follow up after work before he left for his guys trip on Friday (&amp; to ask the pediatrician about mysterious hives he’s been getting). \n\nHe did, and as soon as I got home from work, my husband took off for his trip. I called him around 9pm to let him know I was falling asleep &amp; to text me when he got in since his ETA was 1:00am (it was a 6 hour drive) and he had been up since 4:30am the following morning. \n\nThe next morning, I wake up to a text message saying he was just getting in around 1:05. I texted him “how’s it going” and an hour later, he sends me “it’s good.” I’m dealing with a one year old and a long grocery list at that time, so I don’t feel my phone go off until I’m back home and have put our son down for a nap. I reply letting him know the weird hives are back &amp; my mom (a nurse) is in town visiting us and she’s just as perplexed. The rest of the text is “hope you’re having fun. Love you. Please check in later so I know you’re alive.” \n\nThe day takes a hellish turn for me with nausea, dizzy spells &amp; vomiting. Around 6pm, I haven’t heard anything but I’ve taken enough medicine to pass out at our sons bedtime, so I call him (no answer) and then, text him: “Just calling to check in for the evening. Not doing too well on my end so not sure how long I’ll voluntarily be awake. Spent the last few hours throwing up. \nVery grateful my parents are here. Please reply when you get a minute. Good night babe.”\n\n I had a rough night and would check my phone periodically—nothing. Finally this morning, at 8am, I send: “Good morning. Haven’t heard from you since “it’s good” yesterday around 10. Not sure if youve tried and I just haven’t gotten anything or you haven’t gotten my texts. \nPlease plan on heading out soonish. I’m still not feeling well and dealing with blackouts and vomiting with our 1 year old won’t be ideal.” He also knew before he left that I might have to go into work Sunday.\n\nHe told me beforehand this boys trip meant getting drunk and smoking weed 24/7.  While that’s not our current lifestyle at home, I told him I was okay with that (and I am). I just didn’t think I was also acquiescing to him going MIA. \n\nI’m AITA for texting him and expecting a reply (especially given what he knows is going on at home)? I’m agitated, but I’m trying to also give him the benefit of the doubt that reception is bad wherever he’s at. Do I just need to chill the fuck out &amp; not be butt hurt? Are we both being assholes? I’m just looking for some perspective.",

      "description": "My last attempt at making a post because I've spent an hour at this.\n\n\nBackground: I grew up in a house with five people. My parents were only ever at home for lunch and to sleep, and my sister was always at her friend's. I grew up mostly with my grandmother. My parents didn't let me go outside and got me hooked on the PC because that's safer(no internet in my country back then)\n\n\n1. I've never had many friends until high school. We're a tightly knit group of 20~ friends and we still talk almost two years since we finished HS. After HS ended my results were really good and my mother and sister refused to let me go to the University I planned to go to. They forced me to go to a country very far away. I still talked to my friends while studying at the Uni. \n\n\n2. Uni life was terrible there. I lost all will to study, and I'm someone who loves studying. I'd hear about my friend's life at their Uni and that was depressing. \n\n\n3. I became a hermit. I never left my room for about two weeks until I felt comfortable to do so, and in this time I lost around 15-25 kg of weight, and now I'm severely underweight.\n\n\n4. My extended family, seeing how bad in shape I am immediately started judging me. I was always introverted and was told I spent too much time on my phone/laptop. I'm slowly learning to get rid of my hermit ways.\n\n\n5. My mother came back soon from a trip and I was judged very harshly for too much screen time. She forced me to socialise and I really didn't like it. I ended up with spending more time on my phone to help me deal with it, and she judged me even more. Positive feedback happened and I became more of a hermit again and got more lectures etc.\n\n\nAITA for just not liking being forced to socialise? Did I not try hard enough at the Uni they wanted me to go to? ",

And I did not clean the shared kitchen because my roommate was laying in his bed watching YouTube while I was cleaning so it kind of set me up. \n\nSo 1 week later when bathroom gets dirty again (which should be their turn of cleaning) the administration comes to our room and says if we do not clean the kitchen and bathroom they will kick us out. \n\nMy roommate still did not agree with cleaning and told me they reported us because they saw my used razors inside the trash can in the bathroom.

      "description": "Some background first; I play indoor football/soccer. You play with 5 players to a side. My team comprises of a group of 8 or 9 friends and we play on a weekly basis. We're not good, but neither do we suck. This year we're not doing so well. Some of the players have sustained injuries and as a result we're always a bit short on active players.\n\nLast week we had a very important match. We had to win in order to prevent us from being demoted to a lower league. In the days running up to the match it became clear that we would only have 5 players, which means we wouldn't have a sub. A tough situation, as opposing teams generally have 3 subs, but manageable.\n\nOn the day of the match one of the players-who consequently is also the guy who is our \"coach\" sent a text message 1 hour before the game would commence. The message was posted in our group chat and basically stated that he couldn't make the game, as he was still in a theater watching a movie. All other players reacted incredulously, after which the guy said he'd try to make it. He made it clear though via his text messages that he thought we were in the wrong for being pissed at him.\n\nAs a result of all this we had to start the match with 4 players, so 1 player short of a full team. I also had to make the arrangements with the ref (registering players), pick up the jerseys etc. After about 5 minutes of playing the guy who was at the theater angrily barged in, stepped onto the field, and played the rest of the game with us (we won by the way).\n\nAfter the match I approached my team mate and told him that when you play a team sport you cannot just plan a theater visit and only notify the rest 1 hour beforehand. And especially not when you're the coach. He got pissed off, saying he actually took his new date to the cinema and this totally trumped him having to play football with us. He also said I shouldn't complain \"because in the end I was there, right\"?\n\nNow I'm wondering; am I the asshole here getting annoyed with my team mate and confronting him, or am I in the right?\n\nTL;DR&gt; my team mate planned to leave the team hanging during an important football match, eventually did show up after we complained, and now he says I'm the asshole for confronting him about it afterwards.",

I can feel an air of awkwardness but she stops talking and goes back to sleep.\n\nAnyway I woke up a few hours later and snuck out lol. I told my friends they said I should have ''sucked it up'' and listened to her mind numbing crap and that I'm an asshole for not doing so, AITA?",

      "description": "My brother is a heroin addict. It started with pain pills and evolved from there. \n\nI have given him thousands of dollars in the form of bail, flights to go get “treatment,” Lyfts and Ubers because he lost his license for a while.....you get the picture. He also completely ruined my credit after I co-signed a car loan for him and he allowed the car to get repossessed. I didn’t find out about it until I went to renew the lease on my own car. That was fun. \n\nWell he was down in Florida until last night staying with my father. He was supposed to seek treatment down there and maybe possibly find a job. He has an in demand skill (HVAC technician) however he can’t find a job because his driving record is so awful that no company will trust him with a company vehicle. He has no home and is totally broke. His drug dealers are also looking for him because he owes them money (however I’m *pretty* sure they don’t know that I exist, but they have called my mom as well as his ex girlfriend looking for him). \n\nMy father is a complete and total asshole and I’m not going to get into that however despite all of this, I can understand why he would want to come back up here (New Jersey). The biggest reason being that he has a son here. \n\nWell he stayed with me last night and swore that he was going to be entering a sober living home today. \n\nI just got a message from my mother asking me if my brother is staying with me again tonight. I said no because I thought it was only for one night. She said that he doesn’t have the $600 deposit needed to stay at the sober living home but that he *should* be getting paid tomorrow. I told my mom that he’s not staying with me. I was told it was one night and already that’s turning into two. I feel like if I say yes, that’s going to turn into three nights, then four and on and on. \n\nThe guilt of saying no is eating me alive. However not only am I tired of being an enabler, but I have roommates and as gracious as they were about him staying last night, I can’t ask them to keep doing it. Especially knowing what I know about his drug dealers. \n\nMy husband is currently living in another state. I’m moving there too in a few months and finally getting away from all of this but for right now, my main support system is gone. \n\nI’ve cried so much about all of this that I busted a capillary under my eye.

We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  \"Jung Yong Hwa\". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a \"you look nice\" or \"you're really funny\". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of \"he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said \"Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said \"... Do you expect me to lie?\". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off.

      "description": " \nBackstory: I've always had a lot of male friends. I know the stigma behind a girl that hangs out with a lot of guys, but I've been like this since I was a kid. Grew up Fixing cars, airsoft,videogames, etc. So its just people i can relate to a lot more due to the demographic of things I enjoy.\n\n\n\nAnyways, this has caused a lot of strain in past relationships even though i swear by the guys I spend time with or get to know. \n\n\nThis has been a lot harder recently with my current bf, been together for almost 2 years. But he is insecure about me spending time with other guys.\n\n\nWell, he has recently been the most uncomfortable about guys spending money on me, mainly offering me food. To which most of the time, doesnt matter who it is, I'm stubborn and decline the offers because I can't pay for myself. A lot of the time they insist and I end up saying that the next time i will treat them or give them money for my meal, etc. Even if they say i don't have too.\n\n\nMy bf thinks I do this a lot and thinks they only want sex from me...which in some situations I know thats the case. Generally I will cut that person off if they are acting in such a way. Even though i always make it clear that I am in a relationship to everyone that i become acquainted with (i go so far as to calling him my fiance at this point). Anyways though, a lot of the time they seem to just be acting friendly, and more times than not I will buy the next meal we have, or the next round of drinks, etc. I will try to at least\n\n\nHe is still very against me doing it and it seems to piss him off more than anything when it happens. I know he worrys about someone trying something but i always carry my knife or stuff like that incase something like that will ever occur. (Thankfully it hasnt) I will admit that I can be to trusting of new people sometimed though.\n\n\nI don't want to breach his trust just because i have guy friends, but he also thinks i let them pay for me too much even if i pay them back or try too. I don't know what to do with this situation as the whole topic in general is kind of a tender spot in our relationship. \n\n\nSo anyways, AITA for letting guys pay for me?\n\n\n",

My ex had their current \"friend\" in the car with them and the person rolled their eyes at me.  I chuckled and casually and sarcastically mentioned that they might want to read up on being in a relationship with a narcissist. I walked off before I got the full reaction from either of them.\n\nNow my kid is saying that person isn't coming around anymore and I'm torn between smugness and a little guilt.

      "description": "We’re both currently attending different universities and we both work so we don’t even get to hangout as much as I’d like us to, but I understand that it’s the best we can do right now and it’ll change. 3 nights ago, we had around 3 hours to hangout before she had to work so we decided to go to the mall food court to get food and talk in my car. As I’m pulling in to the parking lot, one of her friends calls her and I spent the next 30 mins waiting for her to be done the call. I told her that I would prefer if she didn’t spend 30 mins on the phone with someone else while we’re together and she said he(I’ll come back to this later) needed her and that was why it lasted so long. Except this isn’t the first time this has happened. I can recall at least 10 times this has happened where he “needed “ her while we were together and I brought this up with her and her response was that she wasn’t sorry that she did it, that her friend needed her and that she was sorry that it made me feel that way. Same thing happened today where she spent around 20 mins on the phone with him. I asked her if it’s always going to be like this and she couldn’t give me a definitive answer. I made it clear that I’m not asking her not to help her friend, I’m just saying to do so when we’re not together and she started crying and saying she was torn and she doesn’t want to have to pick one of us. She said we’re both important to her, and there’s no hierarchy or anything like that. A little more about the dude -they’ve been close friends since they were younger and he lives in a different province now, so I’m not really worried about her being friends with him. Is it too much to ask that she tell him she’s busy when she’s with me and call him later? I would understand if this only happened a few times, but I feel like she’s just pushing it at this point. We just got in a fight about this and I’m not sure what to do next",

A broke it off with D to be with me instead, and still called D her 'best friend'. \n\nDuring A and D's time together, I was told (by D) to kill myself on 2 seperate occasions, and that he would kill me if I tried to 'steal his girl'. A has multiple panic attacks and breakdowns because of D and I'm left to try and fix things (which I have no problem doing, but the problem is that it's him and she KNOWS it's him but won't cut him off completely because of attachment issues). This has really tested me, it pushed me to the edge having to try and fix things, and I decided there was only one thing I could do for my own mental wellbeing, and it'd hopefully help with A's too; I told her 'choose either your friendship with D, or our relationship.' She chose me, and I was happy about that. She has been speaking to him behind my back which hurt me a lot because she broke a promise, but I've tried to move past it. Our most recent confrontation (following A telling D she would self-harm, to which D responded \"yeah. I don't care, remember?\") with D and 4 friends attacking me, calling me abusive and manipulative, and D saying he would curb stomp me if he wasn't in another country. D has also told A to leave me, which you can imagine I'm pretty upset about. \n\nA few minutes ago, he logged in to their old shared Instagram account to try and talk to her again, but because we have eachother's accounts, I blocked him. I'll tell her when she's awake tomorrow.\n\nSo, my question: am I the asshole for trying to cut this toxic, abusive person out of both of our lives?\n\nI'm only asking because I have no clue how this is REALLY affecting her, but she seems to have less panic attacks and breakdowns now. \n\n**TL;DR abusive ex who I have a terrible relationship with wants to remain in my girlfriend's life, but I refuse to keep dating her and putting up with her breakdowns if he stays because it fucks me up too.**\n\n",

      "description": "Im friends with a woman named Laura. We both have kids the same age. She has had a divorce, suffers heavily from PD, &amp; has ADD, but she is on meds.\nThere have been a couple instances that make me not want to continue our friendship, but my DD loves her kids. I feel guilty b/c she will FaceTime us &amp; her kid will be crying for mine, she will tell me how her kid wakes up in the night crying for mine. I feel guilty that she might need support and I’m slamming the door in her face.\nSo here’s why I cut her out:\n\nShe had an affair w/ her married boss who recently had a baby\nWe would have girl talk about her hot boss or how he would flirt &amp; I would make comments like oh gonna work late w/ your boss? But after they slept together I expressed how I thought that wasn’t right. \n\nWhen she moved into her house she didn’t have trash service, she said it was to overwhelming to figure it out. She threw all the trash into the garage. The smell was putrid &amp; bugs started coming into the house. She hinted at wanting to take my car to load up the trash &amp; go to the dump but I wasnt having it.\n\nAt a play date her kid took a party favor from a bday &amp;  lied to her about it. She said they gave it to her, Laura confirmed with the party host that it was not true but they had extra. Laura let her keep the party favor after lying &amp; stealing it. I was irritated by this b/c my daughter was crying &amp; didn’t understand why she couldnt have one.\n\nShe is escorting. \nWhen she first told me about the sugar daddy website I thought it was a joke like if all else fails I could be a stripper!  We laughed &amp; talked about the guys profile, &amp; how cringey it was. I was saying things like oh 65 isn’t so bad! Just close your eyes! Money is money! She told me about a foot fetish guy who would pay her $100 just to rub her feet. I said sign me up! Sign up Zach (my dh) too! Will he pay for me to get a pedicure? We didn’t talk for ~2 months afterwards, then she told me in passing at a bday party she was actually escorting.\n\nNow this may be petty but she has borrowed my car and used over half a tank of gas. I asked her to pay me twice but she never did.\nWill show up at least an 30 mins to 2 hrs late. \nWill say she can’t find her wallet, asks me to pay while she dumps out her purse onto the floor, never pays me back. \nThis is petty but she embarrasses me. Kids have no shoes, matted hair, she has had old suckers stuck to her phone. She will bring 2 diaper bags b/c she she doesn’t know what is in it, throws dirty diapers in a pile outside while the kids are playing, house is a mess, car is a mess. She has had to call her kids (under 4) over the intercom at play places &amp; sent workers to look for them.\n  \nI deleted her off of Facebook but her sons birthday is coming up &amp; I know she is going to reach out.\nAm I TA for judging her on these things &amp; should I give her the benefit of the doubt or is cutting her out the right way to go?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a bit of background, im living in a house with 3 other boys and I've been friends with them since the first year of university and this is the first time we've shared a house together. It's amazing, we all get on, do the same substances and we never have arguments and im planning to live with one next year when we do a master's. \nHe (Steve) met his gf (Jess) last year when we were all on placement year and have been going out ever since, when he told me about her and I was excited to meet her as this was his second serious relationship and I wanted to meet her. My first impression of her was that she was polite and quiet (due to nerves I assume)\nThen she came around a week later (she comes over every weekend without fail and has booked train tickers for the foreseeable future) this was when things started to go wrong. A friend of ours who lives in another house invited us over for a smoke sesh (weed) and we brought her along (we made sure she was comfortable with us smoking and told her she doesn't have to if she doesn't want to) she sat down with headphones on, didn't speak to anyone or pay attention to us, \"fair enough\" I thought \"must be nerves\". Boy was I wrong\n45 minutes in she stands up and began screaming at Steve saying \"I can't believe you aren't talking to me, this is so rude and inconsiderate\" and goes off on one, then storms off slamming doors and yelling in the hallway and causes a huge scene, this went on  for about an hour. Everyone was shocked and didn't know what to think/do so we ignored her. They leave together and she ignores him the whole walk home. When I asked him what happened, he told me Jess claimed it was a \"panic attack\". (I understand mental health is complicated but this didn't seem like a panic attack) She also makes him call her every hour or so and send photos of who's he's with and where he is when he leaves the house, constantly accusing him of cheating and not caring about her \n\nThis has happened every weekend she's been coming over and has been constantly arguing with him, telling him that he's stupid, causing drama on nights out and has just been rude to all of us. I've told her \"im gonna respect your relationship but don't expect us to be friends\" and have told him many times that I don't think she should come around every weekend as it's not healthy. It's gotten to the point now that when I get drunk and she's there I tell her what i think about her (like she's not good for him and she's controlling) and it's not getting better as i can hear everything she says in his room so I can hear her talking shit about us \n\nI understand she's a human being with issues but there's a limit I can take and I think I might be taking it too far now and it's now straining my friendship with Steve but I honestly can't take it anymore. \n\nAm I being an asshole? Should I let them have their relationship and focus on being his friend when she's not around? ",

      "description": "It's not easy writing this. I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I cut all three of my sisters out of my life, rather than just the toxic two?",
      "description": "The family drama is long and complicated so I'll try to summarize. I'm the youngest of 4 girls in my family, we're all in our late 20s/early 30s now. My two middle sisters, K and S, have always been very toxic and downright mean which came to a spearhead at Christmas 2017. We all used to go to our parents house and that year it ended with a screaming match between me and K. I left Christmas morning on the 10 hours drive home and haven't  spoken to K or S since (fwiw I made separate plans to spend time my my parents without siblings).\n\nI'm certain of my choice to cut K &amp; S out of my life because they're honestly terrible and manipulative people. They even make our mom cry from bullying her too. My question is about how I reacted with my oldest sister, B.\n\nB and I are 6 years apart and were not very close until I was an adult, so still in the last 5-6 years really. Prior to Christmas 2017 I had tried to talk with B about my issues with K &amp; S, and how they make me feel like utter shit, but every time I tried to bring it up B shut it down. She'd outright tell me \"I'm not having this conversation.\" I respect that she has a different relationship with our sisters and I understand why she doesn't want my issues with K &amp; S to taint her relationship with them. I'm okay with that, but it means that B has never heard my side of why I can't be around K &amp; S and presumably she's given them the same stonewall on the issue. I respect that she doesn't want to choose sides so I don't push the issue.\n\nAfter the Christmas 2017 fiasco, B was upset with me and while I was packing up my stuff she accused \"So you're not even going to try?\". I literally said nothing back to her, I knew I was too upset to say anything I wouldn't regret.\n\nI was angered and hurt by her accusation, particularly because every time I tried to confide in her about my problems with our sisters she would shut that down and not hear a word. So it never occurred to me to explain to her my decision to leave and I was more thrown aback that she'd be upset with me for it. I own up that I was acting selfish by leaving but I stand by my decision for the sake of my mental health (which is another point of contention with K &amp; S).\n\nAll that said, when I cut out K &amp; S, I also cut out B. At the time, I was not in a good place to deal with any family. But I haven't reached out the B in the year &amp; change since. And honestly, I've never been happier than in the time since I've cut ALL my sisters out of my life.\n\nSo WIBTA if I continued to cut B out of my life? I definitely think it's selfish but would it make me an asshole to continue cutting B out of my life since she never did anything directly wrong? ",

      "description": "   For context: I [18m] live with my girlfriend [18f] and her step-mother and her father. \n\nThis morning I woke up and there was a big text from my girlfriends step mom (Who we will call S for now) in a nutshell shell it says “Hey good morning I need you to do something for me can you turn on the dryer, it was beeping all night.. and can you also pour our the water in the garbage cans and bring them down oh and by the way I have s package for you” the text is was longer than that but that was it. \n\nNow I had just woke up when I read that so I kept going on with my morning and don’t really think much of it at the moment. Later she gets back and texts me she has a package for me, naturally I go upstairs and get it (she doesn’t mention the trash cans to me at this point which I’m not sure why she didn’t) fast forward a few minutes and I have to take my girlfriend to her internship.\n\nOn the way out we see her shop-vacuuming our garage because it floods when it rains. She says “Do you remember me asking you last night if there was a lot of water and you said not too much, well a lot of stuff got wet down here. Also You forgot to bring down the garbage cans if the city sees us leave them out after 12 I could’ve been fined (she had never told me this by the way) ,it’s pretty shitty that you come running up for a package but won’t help me, I need you to step up I have to go teach for 3 hours” again not exactly what she said but along those lines \n\nNow I know as an 18 year old living in their house that I should do pretty much any chore they ask. I just didn’t realize that you could get a fine for leaving a garbage can past 12 (which if hats what she started her text with I likely would’ve done it as soon as I woke up). Also I feel like it wasn’t exactly a big deal. In case you’re wondering I did go shop-vac as much water as I could (no one has ever showed me how) when I got back because I kind of feel bad. \n\nSo who is the asshole here. Am I an asshole?

But this situation was different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight so basically, I was in a discord server with about 4 other people. These people knew each other in real life, so they were very close with each other. Let's call them Chloe, Sam, Jill, and Tim. Anyways, there was a channel in the discord for art. Someone would show off their art and everyone else would compliment the art. But Chloe's art was a bit suspicious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer digital art looked very nice. Very good anatomy. That didn't bother me. But when I went to look at the art on her Instagram, something didn't add up. Her traditional art was very poor compared to her digital art. That's when I figured out she was using bases. But I decided to keep quiet since I might not have all the facts. Perhaps everyone else knew that she used bases and I was just out of the loop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later she shows another piece of art and Sam compliments the anatomy. That was a red flag. I felt that these people didn't know that she was using bases. I guess it ticked me off that she was basically claiming that all the art was her's. Someone worked hard on making these bases, it didn't feel right. So I went on the internet and found the base. Then I basically exposed her. I didn't want to go all out so I tried to casually bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: That's a nice base... who made it? (I suppose maybe this could have come off as a bit rude)\n\nJill: That's a base?!\n\nTim: Dude...\n\nSam: I don't think that's a base?\n\nTim: That doesn't matter.. you don't call someone out like that\n\nSam: They were just asking an innocent question\n\nMe: Yeah!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChloe ended up leaving the server. But she ended up coming back a few days later. We ignored the incident but every once in a while Chloe or Tim would call call me an asshole or something like that. So, am I the asshole?",

I was upset as I had put in a lot of effort to create a solution for both sides.\n\nBut because of this I installed fences all around my property, the results aren’t great as a lot of people badmouth me when they see me outside.

I, with a very, very joking tone said “ooooooh [weird girl’s name]” and poked my brother playfully. He flipped his shit. He started yelling at me in front of our cousins about how he hated her and how much of a freak she was. Then he just flat out started insulting me about random shit that was unrelated. \n\nIt was really embarrassing. I quietly told him to calm down, but he wouldn’t budge. He was pissed at me for the rest of the night, so I’d clearly touched a nerve. \n\nWas I the asshole for bringing it up when I didn’t know it would bother him that much?

      "description": "I (24f) share a 4-bedroom apartment with three other women around my age. The apartment has two huge bedrooms and two smaller, but still bigger than average, rooms. One of the smaller rooms is a bit smaller than the other, but not by much. We decided amongst ourselves before move-in that my housemate “Jane” and I would have the small rooms, but never discussed which of us would get the slightly bigger one. It didn’t matter that much to me at the time, and since Jane never brought it up I didn’t think she cared either. Again, the smaller room isn’t that much smaller.\n\nJane had to work on move-in day, so her mom dropped off some of Jane’s stuff earlier in the day. That morning, I got a text from one of my other roommates saying that Jane’s mom wanted to know which room I preferred so she’d know where to leave everything. I said it didn’t matter to me and that Jane could have her choice.\n\nWhen I got to the apartment I found Jane’s stuff in the smaller room, so I assumed the bigger room was mine and proceeded accordingly.\n\nWell, it turned out that Jane actually wanted the bigger room. Like, REALLY wanted it. When she arrived at the apartment that night, she asked me over and over if I’d trade with her. I asked her why she hadn’t said anything earlier, and she said that her mom had put her stuff in the smaller room without checking with her, and if she’d been there she would have done differently. I still said no, because by that point I was completely unpacked and moved in, and I really didn’t want to pack everything up again. \n\nJane was not happy about this, and has been really cold toward me ever since.\n\nOn the one hand, I feel like I gave her many opportunities to let me know in advance which room she wanted, but she chose not to say anything until I’d already moved in. But on the other hand, she seemed to have a much stronger preference than I did, and the only real reason I had for not trading were because it would have been a hassle (and, okay, also because I felt like she was being unreasonable and I didn’t want to give in). But I don’t know. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\nAlso on mobile. \n\n\nOkay so my friend, “Linda”, is my closest friend to me. I love her more than anything and about a year to two years ago she started dating this guy named “Aron”. At first everything seemed fine between them and she was saying how much she loved him etc etc. She was also having a lot of family problems and we were having some drama between us as well, so while she spent more time with Aron, we drifted apart and spoke less and less. A few days not speaking turned into a week, which turned into weeks, then months. After about six months (and a fight) we reconciled and started to rekindle our friendship. \n\nBetween that time she had also broken up with Aron, citing that he was very controlling and not a good person. We still weren’t very close at that point but slowly started building up our trust again. About three months ago, she admitted that he was abusive towards her, although she left him before she got seriously physically harmed. She also admitted to me that since then he had been creating fake Facebook accounts to talk to her and even though she would block him, he would create more and more. She would also catch him randomly appearing wherever she was and he knew where she lived. She was/is fearing for herself. She recently got into a new relationship, but this guy knows Aron. He doesn’t know he was abusive though. \n\nOne time Linda was helping her new boyfriend out in his neighborhood when she spotted Aron lingering nearby. She really freaked out and had a panic attack and left early. She tells me that at night she cannot sleep sometimes she is so scared (she lives alone aside from roommates she shares her apartment with). \n\nSo, I suggested to her to contact the police but she was hesitant because she didn’t have any proof. I completely understood this, being a survivor myself. She admitted that he is an undocumented immigrant, so I then suggested that she report that to the authorities so then that gets him out of the country for good. It would eliminate the threat forever. She said that it sounded like a really good idea, but the actually going through for her was a scary thought. I showed her the steps and said that she didn’t even have to go in person, you can just file a form online. She hesitated still, and said “let’s just go to sleep.” (I was staying the night)\n\n\nA week or so later, we were FaceTiming and she was feeling anxious and so when we hung up, I just felt so powerless. I knew that she might not ever report him so I decided to then go on the ICE.gov website and report him myself. I did that and also wrote down the abuse he did to her (not naming her) and what she said he had down in the past to other girls, though I don’t know if it was here in the US or his home country. \n\n\nNow ever since I’ve done that, I feel that I absolutely cannot tell her. Did I completely betray her trust by doing this? AITA?\n",

I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

She is doing very well in her classes and is about to graduate early, but she is always depressed and stresses out quite frequently over all of the things she has to worry about.  Also, her family does not support her sexuality and she lives in a low-income home.\n\nBecause of this stress, she tried marijuana for the first time.  She wasnt thrilled about it at first but she is starting to get dependent on it.  My other friends are even trying to sell her edibles.\n\nNow I am VERY against the act of substance abuse, no matter what it is.  Alcohol, cigarettes, pot, or hell even chicken nuggets.  I do not care.  My family has a really bad history over marijuana as my older brother used to steal from us to support his habit.\n\nI was not thrilled about this.  I mentioned that worrying about getting high is only going to add onto her things to worry about.  It is also still illegal recreationally in the state I am in if I am correct.\n\nMy other friends who support her habit believe that I am just being a dick, and that marijuana isnt even that dangerous or addictive (which is only true in a chemical sense but you can get addicted to anything).  They believe that marijuana will help her become much less stressed and that it isn't even none of my business to begin with. \n\nI dont care if it is dangerous or not, it is just not smart to get hooked on something when you cannot even monetarily support it.  She has a low income family and she doesnt have a job.\n\nSo am I the asshole for this?  Am I justified for not supporting her habit, or am I just sticking my nose in where it does not belong?\n\n",

      "description": "Background: I am the president of choirs at my high school, I have had leadership issues and micro management problems in the past but I am making really good progress and I don’t think it is really much of an issue anymore. \n\nSo our choir was about to go onstage perform at Disneyland and I was trying to settle everyone down and help warm them up while our director did some last minute things with the tech booth. \n\nOne person in the choir. Let’s call her Beth, was being very distracting. Flailing her body around, distracting everyone around her and getting other people to focus on her instead of getting ready. So I calmly and privately told her “hey let’s try to focus on choir now”. And she rolled her eyes and snapped back “okay, i already am focused on choir”. From my perspective she was not but I kept going with warm ups. Throughout those she was just talking in a group. Distracting other people in the choir, talking instead of warming up and focusing. I noticed and said to the whole choir “alright let’s focus, singing not taking”.  (Not specifically pointing them out, although that was my objective). And then again ... nothing. \n\nSo after warm ups our director was still talking and asked everyone to not talk for a few minutes. So I tried to calm down conversations and once again went up to Beth. Frustrated I asked her to please stop talking and she just told me no and to stay in my lane (which I’m pretty sure is my lane as the president) and in the moment I said “fight me b*tch) \n\nAfter our director finished with the tech group I immediately went up to her and apologized for getting flustered and asked her if there was anything we can do to make sure this doesn’t happen again. And she just rolled her eyes and said something along the lines of “you can stop micro managing me” and I tried to explain my point of view and she would just cut me off with “okay” every other word and wouldn’t even say anything herself. \n\nAfterwords she went to all of my friends and started complaining to them too. I was already pretty ostracized from the group and now they are all avoiding me. \n\n\n",

      "description": "About 6 weeks ago I was having drinks with a friend I shall call E. At the time I was not in a great place mentally, I had been off my meds and was spiraling a bit. And then I started talking about how tough it is being single. Which led me to asking E why she was with her boyfriend and not me. I didn't mean it in a bad way. E had known for a long time that I have feelings for her but she made it clear she wasn't interested, which I accepted. I consider us getting together as likely as me learning the ability to fly. But the fact that she described her boyfriend as quiet got to me. My self conscious tells me that I will never have a relationship with anyone because I am quiet so it was difficult to hear she was with someone that's quiet. I was just looking for a reason, like I am not her type, whatever. Just something to stop them stupid voices in my head. \n\nMe asking this clearly upset. I definitely regret it and felt guilty and I apologised. I thought it was a dumbass fuck up but AITA to say that to her?\n\nAnyway, I find out recently that she is still mad at me. I had no idea she was mad at me at the time, let alone still. I didn't think what I said was that bad. The way we left it on the night, she said things were fine, that I could still call her, later in the week or the next day. I instead sent her a message as she had said that she wanted space, so I just apologised and said I would. She never responded to it but she wished me a Merry Christmas. I tried organising to go for a few drinks and she would agree but then cancel or something would come up or she was busy doing something else. I understand she was asking for space but I really wanted to go for drinks one last time before the end of Jan. As we was both moving away and I knew it would be months before we could meet up again. I also messaged her at one point asking if I can talk about mental health things as she was someone that often said to speak to her if I was struggerling. \n\nAnyway, roll on to now, I found out she is still mad, that she has been lying to me to avoid conflict. She also tells me, that she don't want to be there for my mental health. Which I accept she has every right to not want to go for drinks or want to speak to me about my mental health. But I am just really pissed off that she didn't tell me any of this. We are supposed to be close friends, I feel like she should have told me if she was mad so we could talk about it and I could try to make things right. I feel like she should have told me if she didn't want to go for drinks. It's also very difficult do\n\nI had another friend stop speaking to me for a long time for reasons unrelated to me and that really fucked me up mentally. Then when we started speaking again it was fine for a bit but then when I annoyed her she didn't tell me and just blanked me. I am only beginning to get over that now, but I struggle to believe anyone likes me and just assume everyone hates me. So when I found out E has been lying to me about going for drinks, it felt like that all over again, which really hurt. \n\nIt's also very difficult for me to open up about mental health becauae I am constantly worried about bothering people. So, it's really difficult to not be told if someone doesn't want to hear it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being angry at her for avoiding me and not telling me the truth?",

      "description": "Some background: my (26f) fiancé (24m) and I have been living together for about a month. Previously we both lived with our parents. I however, have lived on my own before, just moved back for financial reasons. My fiancé on the other hand has never lived alone. My fiancé’s parents used to rent the house we currently live in and after they moved out, my fiancé said he wanted to “live like a bachelor before I moved in” which is fine by me. He kept delaying my moving in for almost a month longer than anticipated, eventually citing that he “wanted to learn what it takes to run a house and realize all the things his mom did” for him so he didn’t take me for granted. \n\nSince moving in (and before really, when I’d stay on the weekends) I have shouldered the majority of the household work. Cooking, cleaning, laundry etc. I have a job, internship and grad school all going on at the same time meaning that most days I leave the house at 7 am and don’t get home until 6, 8, or even 11 pm. On the days I’m home early, I don’t mind having to do dishes or cook or take out trash but on the long days, that is the last thing I feel like doing when I get home. \n\nNow, I understand that my fiancé doesn’t feel like doing this stuff right when he gets home either, and I definitely do not think he should be waiting on me but when I get home at 11 pm and see a sink full of dishes, or an overflowing trash can I get frustrated knowing he had all night to clean up. \n\nI brought up the issue that I needed/wanted more help around the house and was met with a “well, you always do the dishes before I get the chance. I’d do them before I go to bed but I go to bed late and you already have them done.” Except there have been nights where I’ve decided not to do anything and there will still be dishes or trash piled up when I get up the following morning. \n\nAnything that I said next during he conversation was met with “well you just need to ask me to do it” and once I stated that I shouldn’t have to ask for help with these basic things, he curtly replied, “fine. I’ll help more.” I ended the conversation and walked away so a larger argument didn’t start. \n\nSo, AITA for asking my fiancé to contribute more to keeping our house clean without having to prompt him to do it? \n",

      "description": "So a little context. I’m a 15 year old male. Last night (April 4th) I was doing my families’ dishes as I have to contribute to the household chores. My parents both put their dishes next to the sink even though they could have put them in the dishwasher. I asked my father-figure “Could you please put that in the dishwasher?” \nHe replied with “No, that’s your responsibility.” I got a bit angry but my reasoning was that since they always ask me to put my dishes in the dishwasher and I comply, That I can ask them too. So I got upset and told them my reasoning but then it turned into a full on argument with my father-figure leaving and my mom screaming at me to “go fuck myself” and that I’m an “entitled bitch who should buy their own damn food.” Safe to say I cried a bit because my mom hasn’t ever screamed at me that way. Sure, this story isn’t very exciting or dramatic but I feel like an asshole and need a solid answer. So, AITA?",

      "description": "My little brother and I used to be fairly close since we enjoyed many of the same things (music, tv shows, hobbies). I got him his first, his second and his current part-time job and in general I rather liked hanging out with him. When I came out he was very protective of me and gave my girlfriends the \"If you hurt her, I'll hurt you\" speech, which amused both me and my then girlfriend immensely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, more recently my brother has gotten very into 4Chan and inceldom and general alt-rightishness. He thinks it's fun to 'trigger' me by saying stuff like \"I don't think women should be allowed to have abortions\", \"All immigrants should be shot dead.\" (My current girlfriend is an immigrant) and \"lesbians should be forced to have sex with men\". I've told him politely that I feel uncomfortable hanging out with him if he keeps saying things like these. This makes him angry because \"clearly they're all jokes\". He thinks I'm the asshole for not wanting to hang out with him and talk about his hobbies, just because he occasionally makes a tasteless joke. He can occasionally be very nice but I just don't feel comfortable being around him when he makes these 'jokes' that don't respect my personhood and of people close to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for thinking this is enough reason to want to avoid him? Or should I just lighten up and still hang around my brother because we do have other things in common?",

      "description": "Tonight my SO and I went to a local community non-profit that is open 24/7. He was going to work on a project, but I had just gotten off work and was tired, but I didn't mind going. In fact I usually enjoy going here, but this time I was mostly just going to wait for him to finish. We got there around 9PM. At 10:40 I went to find him, feeling very tired now with an upset stomach. I asked how his progress was going, and if we could leave soon. He said if we left then he'd have trouble finding his place again, and we agreed to leave at 11:30. Well this time has come and gone, and I go to find him at 12:15. He is still working and lost track of time. I'm annoyed but don't make a fuss. He starts getting his things together. By the time we actually leave it's 12:40. He notices I'm not my usual chipper self, I haven't smiled, etc and asks what's bothering me. At first I try to play it off and not say anything, but he asks again so I tell him I'm a little annoyed we're leaving so late. He responds dismissively, asking why I'm making a big deal out of it, and this pisses me off - I snap at him and tell him not to bother asking if he doesn't want to know what's bothering me. He asks why I'm acting like this, it's not like he did it on purpose, and how I don't \"normally\" get so upset when he's late. I said I know he didn't do it on purpose, or I would be a lot more upset, but it did hurt that he would be so inconsiderate as to not check the time at all, especially since I had already told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted to go home much earlier. He says he's sorry we're leaving so late but he didn't do anything wrong b/c it was an accident, I can't be mad at him for losing track of time. I tell him it was thoughtless and inconsiderate, he says I'm implying it was intentional. I tell him he's blowing it up and he's the only saying anything about it being intentional - I was upset based on it being an accident. I'm getting more upset b/c of 1. He was thoughtless, but that was a small amount of upset 2. Instead of apologizing he insisted he had nothing to be sorry about. We argues the whole way home, to the point where I said I was tired of debating, neither of us were changing our minds and I was tired of him trying to convince me that I was wrong to be annoyed. \n\nAnother bit of information - my birthday is this Sunday, and we're going out to dinner with my folks. We've been together for 6 years, but he's not doing anything for my bday, no present, no date, no anything, the only reason I'm getting any kind of special treatment is because of my folks. I'm trying not to show my disappointment, trying not to feel selfish, but I think I lashed out at him b/c of these feelings. However, I still think he was inconsiderate tonight. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?",

All great qualities, and ones I’ve longed for in a SO. \n\nI’ve been severely depressed since 18, and it’s gotten progressively worse. I’ve also attempted suicide on two occasions. Battling these demons has been very hard, but I truly want to live. I am currently in therapy, and going back to anti’s this month. All of these things were made well known to her (met in October). We fell for one another quick, and I told her that a relationship just wasn’t in the cards for me. I’m 24 and just started my career so my life is hostile as is and I knew tackling on new love would be hard (last relationship was a broken up engagement). Each time she assured me that she was in this with me, and that she wants to be there for me. I always gave her a chance. \n\nThis last month I haven’t been well. I stay up late having empty thoughts. We spend a lot of time together, and I just need a break. I don’t even love myself right now, and it’s hard to force myself to love someone else. I lack showing her affection &amp; I know it’s taken a toll on her. I feel so damn bad cause she’s damn good to me, but I feel like I’m wasting her time. \n\nShe’s really heart broken right now, but I hardly feel anything. Am I wrong, family? \n\n",

      "description": "There’s a couple that lives below me. Well, the girl lives there and her boyfriend is always there. I’m constantly woken up at 7am, or 3am to them shouting and him calling her names. Horrible stuff like: “you stupid fucking bitch, I hope I come home and you’re dead. Retard!” Just constantly calling her a bitch and telling her to shut the fuck up at the top of his lungs. I’ve attempted to intervene by A) stomping twice to let them know I can hear them and B) calling the cops. Option A) has been met with retaliatory smashing on their sealing telling me to shut the fuck up, and that he’ll come up here and beat the shit out of me. He’s even came out of his basement apartment and jumped on my balcony/patio and smash on the door to my living room threatening to beat me up. She screams for me to leave it alone too. B) was met with her coming to my door and screaming at me, telling me she’s happy and if the yelling bothers me to put on headphones and mind my own business. It even got to a weird argument where she said “if it bothers you, come down there and do something about it” to which I said “I would never do that - it’s obviously violent and that’s just dangerous” and she said “is that a fucking threat?” Having just threatened me (lol).\n\nMost recently at 8am, I woke up to her screaming and crying saying “you don’t touch this body” over and over and his response saying “fucking hit me then!” It’s so loud and vivid because their room is under mine, which makes my roommate dismiss it. I think the right thing to do is to call the police in case someone gets hurt.\n\nThis is a student dominated area and they are not students. Im 24 and they’re probably 27/28. It shakes my floor, knocks stuff off of my mantles and happens two or three times a week. Am I the asshole? It makes me incredibly uncomfortable, scares my girlfriend and my guests.",

      "description": "\nWarning: it's long. TLDR at the bottom\n\nSo about 3 months ago some new neighbours moved in next door. Kinda quite, with some small children, and at first we thought that everything would be ok, since we didn't talk to our previous neighbours much either. Alas, it wasn't quite for long. \n\nThe neighbours got the kids into soccer, and proceeded to use our fence as a goal, which, because of the way our house is built (i.e badly) causes the shock to be heard in the entire house. We asked them nicely multiple times if they could please stop, or at least move the activities somewhere more appropriate, since there are 3 massive parks within a 5 minute walk of our houses, 2 of which have goals that anyone can use just sitting around. \n\nThey refused, and told us that we were bring incredibly selfish and gave us the classic \"think of the children\". They continued doing this for a month or so, before the balls started coming over the fence as the kids presumably got better at soccer and kicked the balls harder. \n\nFor the first few times we brought them back, each time reminding the neighbours that we didn't want them using our fence as a goal, adding that there was a big glass window on the other side which the balls could easily break. Again, little to no consideration on their part, and the games continued. We then decided to stop throwing the balls back, to which they proceeded to trespass on our property to get the balls back, even when we were home in our garden.\n\n We called the police, who informed the neighbours that they can't do that (obviously), but said that there wasn't much else they could do since it wasn't malicous. After a few days, they continued their behaviour. A week ago, it finally came to a head when a stray ball hit a weather cover (the plastic sheets that stop rain), and broke it. The police were unhelpful in the extreme and passed the buck to the housing agency responsible for the neighbours house (it's a state owned property), who told us their was nothing they could do. We then decided to stop throwing the balls back and just keep them in our house, and are now being blamed by the neighbours for \"ruining their kids' childhood\", and that I haven't been clear enough that they shouldn't get the balls back.\n\nAm I the asshole for not doing more to stop this situation from coming this far? Should I give the balls back or leave them in the yard, with them continuing to trespass to get them back?\n\n\nTL;DR new neighbours use our fence as a goal, kick balls over said fence, trespass on our property, eventually break something, and are now blaming us for everything.\n\n\n",

I had an altercation with my supervisor today because of how backed up my part of the store got yesterday &amp; ended up being sent to talk to management.\n\nTheir general position is that I'm not seeing the big picture, that what's good for the store is good for everyone, &amp; that we all need to give our level best every day no matter what.

To me all babies look the same for a start, and they don’t really do much else except from sleep and cry. I simply cant fake excitement to meet a child I have zero connection to.

Then I said to her that she's insane and that I don't need to talk to such unstable people and that she needs some serious help because I'm not a punching bag to consult her problems even if I suffer, after which I blocked her on everything.

      "description": "I have recently stumbled upon a subculture of women on twitter who call themselves “radical feminists”. These women believe that transwomen do not have the right to call themselves women, and that they are dangerous because they were born as males. Some of them are intersex, some lesbian, and some straight white women. All of them are extremely hostile and hateful toward anyone that disagrees with them or has anything to say that does not align with their personal views.\n\nI have spent the past 24 hours or so engaging with these women. I have been called countless names, and attacked for my personal appearance and identity, just for suggesting that these women are being oppressive in their rhetoric. I have reported many accounts that exist solely to erase transgender identity. I have reported many accounts that claim to be “gender critical”—a term used to justify their stance that transgender is an invalid identity. \n\nTwitter has a clear policy about hate speech and “abuse”. I report people that I believe incite and perpetuate a toxic culture of hate and misinformation. I have been assertive with these women, however, I have not resulted to personal attacks. I don’t think.\n\nSomeone who believes that trans people have no right to identify as female suggested that “prancing” had something to do with my intelligence/opinions. I am a queer person, so I told them that they were a homophobe. From a quick glance at their profile, I was also able to tell they are a transphobic cis-gendered white woman. I do not want to identify this person, so I am not going to provide direct examples from their profile. (If I am not the asshole, perhaps I will post examples.) \n\nThat said, my response to this woman was reported and my account was suspended, temporarily, for “abuse”. None of the accounts I have reported have had any repercussions. I am at a loss as to what I have done wrong. I thought I had been civil, and that these women were the one’s with the oppressive opinions. Now I am seriously wondering if it is bigoted of me to be calling these women out. I am a cis-gendered male but I did not think that meant I could not have an opinion on feminism.\n\nHere is how the exchange went (the final quotation has been taken down and is what I was banned for):\n\n“Yes, it’s the prancing that makes the difference.”\n“Homophobe.”\n“Name caller”\n“LOL! Which is worse? Name calling is an honest artform. PS. I never said homophobe was your name. You took it that way. Because it is who you are. A hateful, ignorant, bigoted, self righteous, priveleged, homophobic cis-gendered white woman.”\n\nTldr; I was temporarily banned on twitter for calling out trans exclusionary radical feminists for being oppressive.\n\nAm I the asshole for not letting these women express their opinions?

I'll be there, at the place we said to meet and she will advise me \"I'm on the train\" or \"I'm on the bus\" and so many minutes later, she will say \"I'm sorry I'm actually at home in bed, not well.\" This hasn't just happened once, it's happened quite a few times.\n\nAnd if I make plans on a full weekend, she gets mad at me for \"never making time for her\".\n\nI've tried to cut her off 3 times, but every time I try and cut her off, she says \"Why are you cutting me off because I have depression?\" and it starts a massive argument.

This started to make me super anxious and I began to try to get her help I would constantly tell her to get help and I offer to go with her but she insists to stay and cut herself because she doesn’t want too. Now I admit I did fuck up and was a dick for threatening to tell the counselor one time but I was trying to drive her to do better and I understand I fucked up there and I apologize and have only kept it to myself. Last Wednesday I told her I’m taking a break from Social media to focus on me. This is because her negative energy and threats to kill herself has been giving me crazy anxiety because if something happens I feel responsible for not being the one to get her help. I feel like if she dies it’s all my fault so we haven’t talked for a few days. Fast forward to today I get back on Snapchat and she texts me angrily saying why haven’t you text me and all mad and I told her that her negativity has been messing with my mind and giving me crazy anxiety and I don’t wanna fall back into my depressed state that I was heavily in last year. She then sends me a picture of her crying and saying don’t worry I’ll be out of your life soon. I then instantly felt like shit for everything and feel like I’m responsible if she decided to do something to end her life now. I told her I’m still gonna check in on her. She told me I don’t have to and it’s fine and that she’ll just leave my life slowly. So now I feel like shit for everything that I did and feel like I should apologize for everything. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I (F22) I'm on vacation with my parents, their friends, my brother(M20) and my boyfriend (M25) in a developing country.\n\nToday we went on an excursion with a private guide (M40s, previously lived in Europe and 20 years experience as a guide). We are in a group of 11 people, and when we got out of the bus our group got separated while officers were asking for passports. Half of the group entered first with the guide and the other half was left behind (me included). We felt really uncomfortable and unsafe, since we felt that it's part of the guide's work to keep the group together. My parents and their friends are non confrontational people, but I felt that I should say something to the guy.\n\nHere comes the situation: I went to talk to him (its important to include that we are southern European and I was speaking with him in Spanish, whish isn't my first language nor the guide's). I don't know if I came off as rude but I basically told him that he should have waited for the whole group, because people felt unsafe and it was really non professional. I didn't insult him or anything, I know we southern European tend to be very passionate and when we are mad people can tell, but I didn't insult him or yelled like he did, I just explained to him why I didn't liked what he did.\n\nThen he started yelling at me, saying things like how he had to go purchase tickets or else we wouldn't get on time in the boat (he didn't warned beforehand) and then starts saying rude stuff like how I am the \"youngest in the group\" and stuff like that. He didn't apologized, what infuriated me the most was that he went to talk to my boyfriend (as if he needed to apologize to him lol). If he had explained rather than yell, I would be okay with that and everything would have been fine. \n\nThe thing that is making me question if AITA or not is that everyone in my group turned against me and defended him (including my family and boyfriend, which didn't even heard what I said to the guy before, they weren't there, only heard him yelling), not even my parents stepped in (I know that I am an adult, but I feel if I was in their position I wouldn't let anyone scream to my kids that way). Needless to say that this ruined the trip for me and I just cried alone in the boat since I was so sad and so alone. I felt disrespected as a woman and a costumer. And like I am the \"bad sheep\". I know that this can be attributed to cultural differences, but the guy lives in Europe 8 months each year and is a guide for 20 years! He should have known better. I can't even write this without crying reddit...\n\nSo AITA reddit?\n\n(English is not my first language either, sorry if there is any spelling mistakes) ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months and we are about to graduate from college. A month or so ago, he mentioned that his parents want to take their family a European cruise after graduation, and would like me to join them (along with his sister’s long term boyfriend). He said that “they really want to spend some time with me” (because I haven’t seen them since the summer, unlike my parents, who have taken us out to dinner every time they visit). \n\nHowever, when he had first brought this up, I had just returned from my spring break cruise with my friends. This was my parents’ “graduation present” to me. We aren’t struggling by any means, but we don’t have too much money just lying around for unexpected trips, especially after I just took one. On the other hand, my boyfriend’s family is very well-off, and a $3000 estimated trip cost would not set them back at all, which it would us. \n\nWhen I started crunching the numbers and bringing it up to my parents, I just knew that we didn’t have the numbers to make it work. When I told my boyfriend that, he was really disappointed, since he really wanted me to come. The whole thing has been very embarrassing and tough for me since he still kept talking about the things he wanted to do on the trip with me, and of course I really wanted to go. \n\nI feel awkward because they invited me along knowing that I had just taken a nice trip and I don’t have the resources that his family has. He’s made no mention of thinking to try to help me out, and my friends have said that I’m not alone in thinking that that’s not a crazy thing to expect. He keeps saying how it won’t be the same without me, and sometimes I just want to come out and say that it doesn’t have to be that way!! He has stopped talking about it, but I just can’t shake this feeling like I’m disappointing him, but maybe that’s just on me. \n\nSo AITA for being annoyed that my boyfriend’s wealthy family invited me on a trip that I can’t pay for and is not making any effort to help me come with?",

She lives in a 750ish sq ft studio apartment by herself.\n \nMy school break that I hope to go is also a week before my boyfriend and my 5th anniversary. I asked if he could come (NOT on their dime, him paying) and my parents said that would be fine. I expressed that I wanted to find somewhere to stay with him(him and myself paying, I made this clear), and they said that they would not be interested in paying for my ticket anymore. \n\nThe reasoning is that if they pay for my plane, I should save my money. My brother is with my Grandma right now and he is staying in her apartment. I understand that they want to help me, but I don't quite see the connection. \n\nThanks a bunch for reading\n\nTL;DR: My parents offered to buy a plane ticket, will not follow through if I choose not to sleep on the floor of my grandma's studio apartment",

      "description": "Hi folks. \n\nLong story short— my lease is up in March, and I am planning on leaving when it ends. My three flatmates all plan on staying until May, and renting from March-May on a month-to-month lease. I’m the only one with plans to leave when the lease is done in March.\n\nSince we are not all vacating at the same time, we have to go through the tenant removal process, which requires my roommates to each pay a $75 fee to reapply for residence on their own (without my credit/participation reflected on their new lease). \n\nMy roommates blindsided me today when they confronted me and asked me to pay their application fees ($225) on behalf of my departure. They think that because I am not choosing to rent month-by-month after our lease is up, that it’s inherently my responsibility to pay their application fees. \n\nTheir reasoning? Apparently, they’d love to keep my name on the lease until May, and in their words, I could “move into my own place and pay nothing for the [apartment they live in].” If I’d simply agree to stay until May (not physically living in the place but having my name on the lease), no one would have to incur this fee for reapplying. \n\nHowever, I still don’t plan on paying. I shouldn’t be made to feel guilty for leaving when a lease is up, and it’s not my responsibility to cover the reapplication fee. It’s their choice to remain in the apartment after March, and I refuse to cover the fees they must pay to apply on their own. \n\nAITA here? They’re making me feel quite guilty for not paying this fee and for not agreeing to keep my name on the lease and avoid this fee, even when I wouldn’t be living there. ",

      "description": "So me and my girlfriend (A) had been together for over three years when we broke up. Near the end of our relationship A warned me that a female friend (B) of mine was being overly flirty, and A had become quite paranoid about B and I spending time together. This is fairly out of character for her and I hadn't given any reason for her to be suspicious. Me and A broke up around November for completely unrelated reasons (I ended things to focus on work and generally needing some time to myself. About two-three weeks later, B stayed at my house after we had gone to the pub with some mutual friends (she lives quite far away and was too drunk to drive). B ended up trying to sleep with me but I said no due to the fact that it might hurt A. B then got quite upset and threatened to drive home/ leave and sleep at another friends house. I managed to calm her down and she told me she respected my decision to not sleep with her. But then tried to sleep with me again until I gave in and had sex with her. I should clarify here that I did want to have sex with her but was in quite a bad place with the breakup and mainly wanted to feel wanted. After that night B and I continued sleeping together frequently for about another month. I ended up seeing A in December and told her everything that had happened. She was reasonably hurt and explained that she had been having a hard time with being broken up and wanted us to stop being in contact so she could move on. \nI never really wanted the break up to be perminant and I said to A that I hoped we would get back together eventually. Recently, A and I spoke and I explained that I still loved her and wanted us to be together again, she said that it wasn't feasible at the moment as she's still very hurt from everything that happened between me and B, and she still wants to focus on moving on. So, AITA? I feel like a monumental tool, and all I can do is sit around and think about the mistakes I've made. Do you think this is something that we can recover from or have I been to much of an asshole? \n\nTL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend and ended up sleeping with a female friend who my grilfriend was - quite rightly - suspicious of. Now I want my girlfriend back but she's understandably hurt by my actions.",

      "description": "First off, I’d like to acknowledge that I’m probably the asshole in this scenario but I just kinda want to know if this is an ESH situation or whatever, yknow. Out of curiosity.\n\nAnyway, I was with this girl for about 3 years and things were rather good between us, great actually. The only problem with our relationship was that our sex life was rather dull. She still lived with her parents who were pretty much ALWAYS home, collecting disability, which made any real fun virtually impossible and I was living in my van at the time to cut down on costs (yeah yeah laugh it up, not the best place for a lay). That was always ok to us though, for we thought it made the time we did have alone particularly special.\n\nHowever, a couple months ago, I was diagnosed with Peyronie’s disease, an uncommon form of ED. When I next saw my GF, I mustered up the courage to come clean about my condition, so that she wouldn’t wonder what was up with my ding dong when we got down (or attempted to at least) to business. But after I told her, she laughed in my face and called me impotent. We then got into a heated argument. I felt so wronged by her because I honestly thought she would at least be understanding. In the end though, she did apologize and claimed she was just fooling around and we ended up successfully making love that afternoon. But her comments REALLY irked me for next couple of weeks.\n\nI finally let it get to me one day and I decided to go to a gentleman’s club to prove that I was good enough to get any woman, ED or not. I snapchatted myself getting a dance from multiple strippers and I really only intended my friends to see it but my gf, who I guess was stalking my socials, saw it too and got pissed off big time. We had a major falling out but she ended up forgiving me and accepted responsibility for making me do what I did. \n\nBut a couple of weeks ago, I realized that I don’t really have to prove myself to anyone. I shouldn’t have to be self-conscious about my condition and I shouldn’t need acceptance from women to feel confident. And at the core of this struggle for acceptance was basically my gf all this time. So I weighed my options and ended up ghosting her, since I have no permanent address. I mean, she did put me through that ordeal and she was a little racist and perhaps islamophobic as well. So I kinda feel like I might not be the asshole in this situation since she at least partially deserved it. Idk you guys tell me. ",

I'm a senior in HS and the year is almost over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my French class and we have an assignment that we are doing atm and my friend plays a hilarious meme that makes me laugh pretty hard. My teacher notices this and gets angry at me and tells me to stop laughing. I nod but I can't help but still be laughing so i'm holding it in to the best of my abilities. So we're working on something else and two people are just reading like as if it was a play of some sort, most of the class is doing their own thing, i'm still working on something else and then my friend plays another funny meme and I die of laughter again. I wasn't obnoxiously loud but if you looked at me you could tell I was laughing hard.  And my teacher looks at me again and tells me how would me and my friends like a zero in the grade book. And i'm thinking, \"for laughter?\". She goes back to her desk but eventually calls me over to see what my grade was for an assignment. She said she had given me a 43 due to my laughter and I was upset. And I checked the grade book and she had put it in TWICE just to ensure my grade dropped to a C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "So background here, we met around two and a half months ago on Tinder, and started a relationship a few weeks after that. We go to separate schools but live close enough that it's not a problem to see her whenever I want, and vice versa. \n\nReally, the relationship is going great. I like her, and while I obviously don't speak for her, it does seem that she likes me.\n\nI guess to be complete, I'll include this: I was a virgin before I met her. She wasn't, and we've had sex a bunch since we started dating. The sex too is good, obviously for me and I think for her as well. \n\nThe reason I want to break up with her is I just know that I'm not going to marry her. She's great, but I see this as a fun relationship that will at maximum end after college (a year and a half more for me). Also, she has a few personality traits that get on my nerves. I attribute this more to us being slightly incompatible (or me being a jerk) rather than her being annoying, but the effect on me is the same. \n\nI want to clarify that I did genuinely get into this relationship for the right reasons (I liked her, love of my life and all that), but now that I see this isn't going to a permanent thing I feel inclined to cut my losses and move on. \n\nI don't want to break up with her without having a genuine reason why, as I still very much enjoy being with her. I'm just afraid that I'm going to sink so much time into her that I won't want to end it. \n\nOn the other hand, if I don't break up with her, am I just using her for intimacy when we could both be looking for more compatible partners?",

We have our ups and downs but hey who doesn’t. \n\nRecently she invited me to go to a concert with her in a town that’s 4 hrs away, I said of course I would go and everything was fine, we booked tickets, parking, etc. (our plan was to drive down and back home straight after the concert) flash forward 4 months to 2 weeks before the concert and she turns around and says I can’t go anymore because she wants to go with her other girlfriends, so I’m like that’s cool, I’ll just stay home. \n\nBut she asks me if I will drive her and her friends down to this concert 4 hrs away, then sit in the car and wait in the car park for her for another 4 hrs and then drive 4 hrs home. I say no and she looses her mind, saying that I’m a horrible boyfriend and why won’t I take her down to this concert and sit in the car, in a car park and wait for 4 hrs with nothing to do. \n\nShe goes on being cranky at me for a week about it until eventually I give in and say I’ll drive her and wait, but her and her friends have to chip in for fuel. But then she gets cranky all over again saying no. I “offered” to take her so I should pay the fuel. \n\nSo now I’m sitting in a car park, it’s 8pm. I’ve been here since 6pm wondering.

I always give pedestrians the right of way. If a car going \"left to right\" cuts me off when I have right of way to make a left turn, I will hold my horn at them until I finish my turn.

Now we’re friends again and talk, he always asks about my day and me and is genuinely a nice guy. I know he still has feelings for me, he took me out on Valentine’s Day and spent a lot of money on me an also takes me out to the movies and dinner often, granted I pay for some of the times as well so I’m not using him to get anything. I am wondering if I am the asshole for not telling him I most likely am not interested but I’m not even sure because I don’t know what I want. We’re only 21. When we first started talking again I felt like it could work out and I told him that but I didn’t tell\nHim that I now feel differently. I don’t want a relationship and do not like him like that or even as a friend anymore but feel awful to hurt his feelings so I still invite him to hang out with me and my friends and still hang ok with him (not very often anymore).

      "title": "AITA for refusing to donate sperm for my sister and her wife?",
      "description": "Background, I'm 25, my sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?",

But let me explain, I had to tank at a tank station I don't know very well. Apparently there was one person waiting in front of me but I thought he was not in line. Eventually when I was tanking he takes the pump next to me and says 'Do you always do that?' in a very angry tone, I answer with 'I didn't know you were waiting in line'. Just as I was about to apologize he then says that I should get myself checked out and that I'm not really a man, he was really angry and made some hand gestures. I told him not to stress out so much about a small thing and drove off. If he would've just gone to me before I was tanking and told me that he was waiting in line than I would've let him go first. But since he started off rather angry I kept my place. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I know this situation isn't really that big but I he really seemed to think that I was an asshole)",

      "description": "Obligatory “I’m on mobile” preface.\n\nMy partner and I are not married, however we have been together for upwards of 6 years now and have started to really get into very serious discussions about the future. I’m 24 and she is in her late 20s for context. I am currently still in school pursuing a professional degree with a future annual income of $200k+ assuming I do decently well in my courses. She has a degree and currently is in a position where she makes &lt;$30k but she is very happy.\n\nI have always been supportive of her career choice as it’s exactly what she wants to do. I have no issues with contributing significantly more to the communal pot and understand that, once married, this is shared money. However occasionally I will talk about the 2 nice rewards I’ve planned for myself after paying off my debt. (Added together they cost &lt;$40k and I don’t see them as unreasonable or unnecessarily spendy in a “just to show I have money” way).\n\nWhen we discuss these, she always belittles them and tries to steer me away from them, continually asserting that “this is exactly why she will be in charge of the finances”. It irks me but hey, I’ve grown used to it.\n\nWhat really rubs me the wrong way is that she knows absolutely nothing about finances or anything other than simple depreciation in cars and similar items. Despite this, when I showed her the hotel I wanted to stay in for a honeymoon or big vacation, she said it would be too much and would be a waste of money.  Am I an asshole for feeling really resentful of the way she tells me I will be able to use my future income? Or, in the inverse, is this an indication that I will grow resentful over time if she’s not contributing and still controlling? \n\nI’ve told her I’m perfectly happy with her being a SAHM if she would like, as she wants several children. She likes the idea but doesn’t want to be responsible for cooking if I end up taking more hours to afford that. I just feel like there’s a lot of take and not much give. She’s so kind and has offered to help pay off my debt with her savings (something I don’t intend to accept whether we’re married or not) but I just feel like it’s been such a sensitive topic when my career path and success thus far should point towards the exciting exotic life I’ve imagined..",

      "description": "$jason = my roomie\n\nMe and $jason live in a 2 bedroom basement, each with our own room and mine is closer to the door.  \nI'm a working freelancer, and he was doing odd jobs until he recently got a job with more typical work hours.   \nSo we both have (had) odd hours and are usually up very late, I would often hear him up at 4-5am. Since he got that new job he has obviously been on a more regular sleep schedule.   \nSo last night I'm sitting in my room getting stoned and doing some computer work and I hear knocking on the door.  after the 2nd knock and $jason doesn't get it (I'm not expecting anyone), I open the door and it's his friend. He's looking for $jason. I tell him I have no idea if he's home (or sleeping), I haven't seen him today. He knocks on his door and I kind of go back to doing my own thing and then he leaves. Some time later this guy knocks on the door again and I let him in. He inquiries about him, I tell him I still have not heard anything,  knocks on his door and then leaves.\n\nSometime later I hear $jason come out of his room, I open my door and tell him that his friend came by. He was  very pissed and says yeh thanks for waking me up. He asks why would I let someone in at 12:30am?  \nI shoot back that I'm not gonna get mixed into his business and it's up to him to tell his friends not to come by after midnight (or whatever time).  \n\n\nMy feelings are that I don't know if he's expecting a friend, or would be happy to see someone or wouldn't. I don't want to care about that. If someone knocks on my door I will answer it, and if its someone that I recognize and have seen here before with $jason, I don't see a reason to not let him in. I was also totally oblivious to the time when this happened (as I said, I was high).  \nNow all of this is obviously unless he specifically tells me, never let in anyone after whatever time. I can respect that.",

I mean he’s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it’s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he’s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some “pot” if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He’s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it’s her choice who she dates so I’ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He’s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom’s and he’s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren’t always specifically referring to actual family, but it’s just what it’s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, “You’re not my family.  You’re the guy my sister is dating for now.”   He just said “alright” and I walked away. \n\nHe’s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend’s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven’t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n",

      "description": "I am 25, English of Pakistani background with not particularly traditional parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up - parents had a terrible relationship. Dad had a high paying job and a daily alcohol habit. He would force us to study for exams many years ahead and heavily restrict us because a lot of things he perceived as \"dangerous\" and distracting. His restriction meant that I was really timid. Wasn't allowed to go to parties or near alcohol, I turned down most social invitations.  He was angry - I'd get hit a lot and verbally insulted every day. But he cared a lot for me and worked very hard for me - worked 24h/day sometimes accumulating a large \"trust fund\" for us. I'm not allowed to use the money but it is there for the long term. The reason he was so stressed is because he wanted us to do well - probably at the cost of a happy childhood which it seems he must not have prioritised over long term happiness. I was still miserable most of the time.\n\nLeft for uni, had a great time. Finished uni, I have a free flat provided by work. I chose to return and live with my parents because it was expected of me and I would feel guilty otherwise. They have nothing else and devoted themselves to us. However I am miserable. \n\nGenerally I just don't talk to my dad all. I just don't feel like he's a friend, just this authoritarian figure. And casual conversation is difficult with him. I feel like exposing myself to him even by being my natural self would make me vulnerable.\n\n The house is in need of renovation and he gets angry that I don't do this. I'm not happy most of the time and don't feel like it. I wish it could be easier. I feel like my life needs to revolve around what dad will think. I don't feel free to do what I want. He's still restrictive about drinking etc. Luckily I very rarely drink but I'd like freedom to make that decision. I chose to move away for work next year. Stressed about choosing where to live because I know dad will have a problem with what I want. When I applied elsewhere initially he ordered me not to then called me selfish when I insisted and didn't speak to me for a week or so. Later (after I applied) he said he would support me.\n\nI frequently anger him e.g. spending weekends away with very short notice, spending most of my time in my room and not doing the house / interacting with him. When I've tried to talk it through he doesn't respond until he wants the dispute to end. It feels very intimidating, honestly I feel a pit of negative energy initiating these interactions. \n\nI've just become more and more withdrawn. I can't be bothered to make any effort to interact genuinely with him. I just want to move away so hopefully I can find my own feet and be happy. But they did so much for me and still care for me very much, the guilt is phenomenal.",

      "description": "Sorry will be a bit long.\n\nI have a friend I'll call C.  She started at my work a few years after me and knew noone in town.  I introduced her to 99% of her friends here, we are very close and have worked together for several years now.  Shortly after meeting her, I introduced her to another close friend of mine I will call D.  D is from the same country as C.  They become friends and hang out etc.\n\nD and C fight on and off over the years.  D becomes very bad at keeping in contact with us.  When C got married last year, D pitched a shit fit because D expected her daughter to be a flowergirl and C said yes, but asked that D keep her daughters hair long until the wedding so it would be in keeping with the bridesmaids etc.  D also cracked it because C said while the kid could be flowergirl, no children were to come to the reception .  Plenty of warning was given to allow for childcare etc.  D refused to come and made a bullshot excuse for not attending the hens night.\n\nAll through this I listened to C vent and get upset, I offered support and all that.  She tells me she wants nothing to do with D anymore, deletes her off socials and everything.\n\nFast forward to now.  I am really keen to go to a museum exhibit 2 hours away from home.  C says yep she will come with.  Day before, she messaged me saying she couldn't come because she was having problems with her husband and they were going to stay home that weekend and work on it.  I said that was all good, told her I was here for her etc.  I checked in over that weekend to make sure she was ok.  \n\nOne week later, guess what pops up on the book of faces.  D tagging C in a post about how they went to that exhibit and has a great day.  \n\nAITA for being pissed at C?  I am 99% sure she lied about having problems to get out of coming with me because she knew I couldn't 'get mad' at her for that.  I feel like she suddenly made up with D and decided to ditch me so they could go the following weekend.  C can be pretty immature and dramatic.  I wouldnt put it past her to lie about it.",

      "description": "On mobile so formatting might get messed up.\n\nI understand that at sitdown restaurants it is courtesy to tip, and I make sure to give a good 20% tip every time I go to them, but here are some situations that I ran into last week that make me question whether I should always tip.\n\n1. I got $3.50 bubble tea, and saw the barista make it in 30 seconds right in front of me, and when I swipe my card I get an option to tip. I saw no reason to tip.\n2. This happened in another, similarly priced bubble tea place. After filling out $0 as the tip in the receipt the waitress looked at the receipt, frowned, and then proceeded to make the bubble tea. It took 2 minutes to make and I walked up to the counter to pick it up, as all customers do. I dont think such service calls for a tip.\n3. I ordered a takeout udon bowl at a normally sitdown restaurant, and it was ready in 3 minutes. Because no one waited me and all that happened was an order was filled out, I dont think I need to fill out a tip.\n\nAITA for not paying tips in these scenarios?",

      "description": "Funny how i found this subreddit after breaking up with my \"girlfriend\"\n\nSo From the start\n\nI'm a 20 yo m and never had a \"real\" relationship, kissed girls and hooked up, but not a \"real\" relationship and thats something I wish I could have honestly but anyway\n\nI've been on Tinder for a while and things go ok but usually just chat with some girls is all, until one day in Early October I meet this girl and we hit it if off pretty well and the next day we ended up meeting for a date to the movies, and it was perfect we ended up making out in an empty theater showing venom. Week later, go out again to a day in the city, and date 3 was her just coming along with me to do some errands. Within the span of about two - three weeks it felt perfect, too perfect. We texted back everyday until little by little we would slowly stop.\n\nSo the first week passes were we wouldnt text each other, I was busy with work and school and I knew she was going through the same, so when Saturday came i asked her how she was doing and of course just saying how I missed her and that we should get together soon. Slowly but surely it went from heart filled and monkey emojis into just talking. She had work that day and asked where was her job so that I could actually stop by a perhaps bring her some food and snacks to cheer her up and see her for an hour. But I didn't get a text back and a few days pass. I send a goodmorning text saying im sure youre busy but I hope you have a great day and please just get back to me when you can. I had assumed something had happened that she had to worry about, great thats fine I thought. Then another 5 days pass nothing back.\n\nAfter a week and half of having some texts ignored I thought it was just weird how she wouldnt even send a text saying hey sorry ive been busy but ill text you soon. or cant talk rn right.\n\nSo after two weeks early nov she writes back \"in class\". I was kind of surprised I got a text back. Finally we're catching up a little but it just didn't feel the same as before. I've been wanting to see her again but feels like she didn't have the time.\n\nThen another week passes and I felt kind of left behind, thinking here I am texting her asking to see her to, but im not even good enough to be left on seen apparently, and I see her having fun with friends on social media too in between.\n\nI think if anyone has responsibilities they should be taken of sure, but all I wanted was a text back, was that too much to ask?\n\nA few hours ago I check snap and see that her icon is gone and I cant see her, I thought she had blocked me and just moved on ghosting me.\n\nConfused and upset honestly I text her saying I wish her good luck and to take care, I never wanted to yell at her or blame her I guess\n\nShe replies saying how I had just assumed she blocked me instead of texting her to ask. Yet here I was texting her for the past 3 weeks, how was I supposed to know if or if not im even blocked. After an argument she says \"you're free\"\n\n​\n\nI've had bad experiences in the past before and honestly I didnt want to fall in love but I really did like her and thought for once in my life I could start a real relationship and be happy, but as I think from my lack of dating experience maybe theres something im missing here. Is it normal for couples to not text for 3 weeks? for one in a relationship to be only one texting the other?\n\nI feel used, like I was just a guy to take her on dates at the start, when she wanted it, but then ignored when she didnt care but I did. Just want to know if Im the asshole, what should I do to change. Was I pushy? I feel like a text back takes   \njust seconds but I dont know. feel kind of pathetic but I know ill move on and be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**; start relationship with nice girl, three dates go perfect, cute texts slowly turn into normal conversations and then just words back to back; text her then my texts get ignored, argue, break up",

      "description": "My dad has a bad habit of not flushing (number one only, always flushes number two) which I personally find disgusting. This morning I finally snapped and yelled at him to come flush the goddamn thing. He in turn was pissed off, and said he's trying to save money by not flushing.\n\nI just stood there in shock for a moment because really, THAT'S the reason? Whipped out my phone and googled that flushing costs less than a cent. He was even angrier and said that we always need to try and save. Then it clicked, this is why he always has the thermostat down and only turns lights on when it's so dark as not to see anything. I fired back that he goes out for lunch three times a week and there are far better ways to save money than with utilities. \n\nAnyways, my mother said later that I was out of line, it's not hurting anyone, and it's his money to save. I really don't think flushing is an unreasonable standard. Reddit?",

      "description": " It's a pretty long story but I'll post a TLDR on the end of my text. Also please excuse grammar and writing, English is not my first language. \n\nThis whole subject started some months ago between me and two of my friends. Let's call them H and F. My friendship to F began because we were roomies and she kind of introduced me to H. Me and H realized over the time that we share a lot of interest, like languages and traveling, sports etc. So we spend most of our free time and also university time together. We wanted to learn new languages like Arabic and French and these are offered at our uni. We always asked F, if she wants to participate or wanted to do something different but she always declined. Then we got the opportunity to study for some time abroad and again F said that she isn't interested in that sort of stuff. I'll come back to that later.. More and more she excludes herself from activities in our group (also with others) and spends more time with her bf, which was okay for us all the time. But she always started arguments about how much we exclude her from our friendship and she feels sad. H and me always tried our best to do other things with her but she used to get pissed when we also talked about our share interests and behaved like we weren't allowed to pursue our hobbies, if she doesn't like them. It escalated when we planned a holiday with our three bfs for next year. When we wanted to start booking F said she doesn't want to go, because she rather wants to go to Japan with her boyfriend alone and needs the money and vacation days for that. Okay for us, but later I told her that I met with the others to plan our vacation she suddenly blocked me and ignored me at school. Her boyfriend told me that she feels excluded again and needs time for herself  to be alone for a while. H and me didn't really understand what was going on because she didn't want to go with us and now ignored us and even ran away when we got close to her, so we left her alone and didn't talk to her anymore. Some days later she texts me that I am the worst friend ever and should have known that she needs me although she didn't show it and we should have asked her about our aktivities like the languages and the vacation more often. I'm sorry but how am I supposed to know that I can't read minds?\n\nTLDR\nMy friend accuses me of excluding her and leaving her alone when she needed me the most, although she ignored me and told her boyfriend she needed time to be by herself.

      "description": "So I'm now in college and I'm still dating the girl I've been dating for around 3.5 years. She initially had a problem with me living on a co-ed floor even though my roommate was male, but she seemed to let that go by. Now however, she's asking me to not be friends with any girls on the floor or in general. \n\nIt seems petty at first, but she repeatedly asks me about certain girls I've mentioned and if I hang out and will sometimes complain that I'm \"replacing\" her. Now, I call her everyday and text her when I'm not in class or doing work/practice or eating with friends, but she insists that I can't have friends who are girls as its a \"compromise\" for me going away to college (we're long distance now).\n\nAITA for having female friends (who I have no sexual or romantic interest in) against my girlfriend's wishes if I feel as though it is unfair to me? Whenever I confront her she gets upset over it.",

      "description": "I’ve never seen the show but from what I’ve heard, it’s got all sorts of horrible stuff in it. Brother/sister relations, killing children, etc. I mean I’m sure the action is cool. But from what I’ve heard it’s all really confusing with all the characters so I just don’t really want to watch it. But she keeps insisting it’s an amazing show and she’s sure I’d love it if I just give it a chance, maybe watch a couple episodes, and I just don’t want to. It sounds like it involves way too much thinking to keep track of everything and I prefer to just relax and not watch stuff that’s too mentally exhausting. So AITA for shutting her down on watching “just a couple episodes” to see if I like it or not (I already know I’m not going to like it, I don’t know why she doesn’t get this). I just don’t see the point of wasting a few hours watching a few episodes of a show I know I’m not interested in.  ",

      "description": "So, Xmas of 2017 my brother in law and I got into a huge fight. He has always been kind of a dick to me but this specific time was my tipping point. We were all drinking, having fun. HE brings up race/white privilege and I welcome the discussion because as a grad student in cultural studies, I study/talk about this shit all the time. Fine. He fancies himself the “devils advocate” in any and all situations. Things get intense and just in time, a friend shows up and he has to get up to grab the door. As he does so, he makes some drunken comment to his friend about me along the lines of “She always says stupid shit and pretends to know what she’s saying” when asked about why we were shouting as they approached the door. This does it for me and I tell him to fuck off, and I go to the guest room to cool off. \n\nI overhear him talking shit about me to his friend, talking about how “he didn’t even try that hard and my whole snowflake worldview came crashing down.” “He has to handle me with baby gloves,” etc. literally nobody else agrees with him, and I come out and mention that I don’t care about the discussion about race because I have them all the time...but I don’t appreciate being belittled. This makes him laugh and continue to be a dick, so I go back to the guest room and that was that. \n\nNow my question is not necessarily about him; most people agree that he’s an asshole...I am mainly concerned with my sister, who is frustrated because I’ve actively avoided him since this event. I understand that she doesn’t want to pick sides between her husband and her sister, and she is the type of person who just wants harmony with everyone. But her husband adds nothing to my life but frustration and I don’t feel like I owe her any more attempts to hang out with them both (this is not the first time he’s been rude to me/we’ve gotten in a big fight). \n\nSo, two weeks ago we happened to be in Virginia at the same time randomly (we live in separate states.) she suggested they drive to where my partner and I were on a Sunday because her husband had the day off (he was there for work). I told her the truth, which was that my partner and I wanted alone time. She ended up coming on Monday alone, and she confronted me about why I have been avoiding her husband. When I told her I had no interest in being associated with him she got really upset, and I told her I’d try one more time to hang out with him. But I REALLY want to take that back now because just the thought of interacting with him again gives me anxiety. She wants to bring him to my graduation in May and I don’t want him there. \nAITA if I go back on my word?\n\nThanks in advance. \n\n",

      "description": "This woman (Betty) 29F and I (28M) have been dating for 3 months and its been amazing! We have a strong relationship but that has recently been shaken by three exes from her past (all of whom she has blocked).\n\nRecently she got assigned a coworker Ryan at the tool service desk (works in an Engineering Company) because she's been manning it alone and it has gotten super busy.\n\nI was ecstatic about this since she finally gets some support. Her job is support/service and some of the stressful times with terrible people causes her to be emotionally exhausted (lots of ppl take out their frustration on support/service workers) and since Im an engineer at a different company I get it. I once made a joke about \"do you not have work friends?\"\n\nWell she took my joke a bit seriously and started befriending two dudes that work with her. Ryan is one of them and they work closely for 8 hrs a day. During the stressful moments she'd call me after and she tells me how supportive/helpful I am. Recently she speaks about how helpful Ryan has been. She has mentioned how they've eaten together and she has bought him food and such. In addition, we are watching now an anime Ryan and Jim(another coworker) watch. She also mentioned Ryan has a girlfriend who he is considering proposing to. What recently bothered me is that she buttdialed me twice accidentally and in both calls I heard her and him talking as I just kept saying \"hello\" and they waited for the shuttle together and chitchatted a lot. She even texted me during the call??\n\nI guess it just bothers me that she is getting closer to a male colleague. She has often lied in the past about related things (she once met an old colleague for a work thing and told me they were just friends, but later it slipped they had a dating history). I realize that she is a female in an engineering firm so she will have to deal with men.\n\nKey point is my trust in her is really low. I guess because of past betrayal, I'm hyper aware and trying to nip anything in the bud before it happens. There is also the fact she has dated or been involved with 3 coworkers/employees from that company before and has lied about it at first or hid texts in the past also make me nervous. She has emotionally cheated early during our dating phase.\n\nThis morning I just mentioned that Id like it if she could create some distance between her and her coworker Ryan. Do some combination of: eat less together, put headphones on, socialize less, take breaks away from the desk and walk separately to the shuttle.\n\nWhen I said all this she seems exasperated and said you wanted me to have friends at work. He's dating someone. She said she'd try to tell me somethings she doesnt like about him. I just replied saying, \"Look this is how I feel and I am not accusing you, but would love if you could make an effort to distance yourself and make me feel more at ease.\"",

I gave somewhat harsh words about how they’re an adult now and should stop being stupid (not those exact words). I kind of want to let IBS’ manager know what’s up if this continues.

She takes any situation and makes it about her.   I moved out when I was 16 and I've done well for myself ever since.  I have an older sister who is bi-polar and worse than my mother (havent spoken in 5 years)  My little sister tolerates Mom because she is the only parent we have left. Dad passed 1.5 years ago. Little sister and I get along pretty well. I'm close with her kids.\n\nMy mom is a leech. Always trying to play on peoples emotions and anything she can get for free, she does. Uses guilt, blackmail, what I call \"Fake nice\" to get what she wants. In other words, if you dont believe the way she does or act the way she wants you to, you are wrong. She takes and takes and takes...and its exhausting. To the outside world she is a good Christian lady, former nurse and all around nice person. This is the furthest from the truth.\n\nSince Dad passed I dont have a reason to \"make nice\". The last straw is when she called me and said, \"I took care of your Dad for years, I dont want his cat. Come get it or I'm taking it to the pound. Today\" I told her I needed time to fined a home. (I cant have her-my cat HATES other cats) Thank goodness my friend from out of state was visiting and was able to take my Dad's Cat.\n\nI have 2 other women in my life I call Ma or my 2nd Mom. I dont need my bio mom. I dont want to see her. I am not fighting, haven't spoken to her in months. I called my sister and asked if I could work around her plans for Turkey Day. Come early or later to visit her and my niece and nephew. Or even another day. Her plans do not need to be disrupted because I dont want to see Mom.\n\nWas told I was stupid, get over it, its the holidays and I can make nice for a few hours. Dinner is at One. Be there or not. \n\nI have an offer to got to a friends house, which I think I will do. I will probably go there for Christmas too. (This is my 2nd Mom's family-her daughter has been my best friend for 30 years)\n\nAITA for not \"Making nice\" because its a holiday? I dont want to see my Mom. I dont want to fight.

I can’t afford that. I said that I would stick to fitness instead then. But she told me she didn’t want to pay for that now either. Of cause I asked why. Same response.

I was mildly concerned something illegal may have been going on there, but there was never any drama so I left them alone. Then a young couple moved in. They had the odd party but for the most part, no problems. \n\nThen one day, about 8-9 months ago, the house fell vacant and a for-sale sign went up. The owners stopped by the place every couple of weeks but there was next to no activity. It was quite nice, very quiet, and I’m afraid to say I kind of got accustomed to the peace and quiet of having that house vacant.\n\nBut about two months ago, that for-sale sign came down and some new folks moved in. I have attempted to introduce myself but never received more than a grunt from any of them. From what I can tell so far, there are 3 men between the ages of 25-35. I’ve seen others, but only 3 regularly so I believe the other guys must be friends or members of a club or something. They have two large, noisy, diesel trucks which tend to sit idling in the driveway for hours at a time. When it’s just the Duramax running it’s not that big a deal, but the Cummins rattles my windows. They also have a couple trailers and about 6 snowmobiles.  \n\nI don’t know what they do for a living because from what I can tell, all they do is take their snowmobiles out. Maybe they’re snowmobile mechanics or part of a local snowmobile racing club or something, because I can’t find any other rhyme or reason for the sheer amount of loading and unloading they do.\n\nEvery day since they moved in, they have loaded and/or unloaded snowmobiles at least once a day. Sometimes it's 3 or 4 times a day, particularly on weekends. This usually involves several guys hollering at each other, the revving of the snowmobiles, the idling of a diesel, and plenty of scraping and grinding noises. It’s not too bad when they do it on the street but when they’re in the driveway it’s right outside my bedroom window and they often come within inches of my vehicle, often crossing onto my side of the driveway to get around their truck. Sometimes they do this in the middle of the day, which is fine - but sometimes it’s 11pm... midnight... 2am... 4am. It wakes me up. This also seems to be affecting my neighbours across the street – there’s a young family in one house and a very sweet elderly gentleman next to them, and i’ve seen lights come on at their houses as well when these disruptions occur at night. I’ve considered going over to talk to them about this, see if it bothers them as much as it bothers me. However, i would hate to be a nosy, meddlesome neighbour. I like this neighbourhood for the most part and i don’t want to create problems with anyone.  \n\nPart of me wants to confront them about why they load and unload their machines so often. Why not just leave it on the truck if they’ll be taking it out again the next day, or later that same day? They aren’t even putting them in the garage, they’re just putting them in their unlocked backyard. It’s no safer there than it is on the truck or trailer, so it’s not a security thing. They generally don’t leave again with the empty truck after they remove the machine, so it’s not for the sake of taking the weight off the truck so they can use it for something else. I just cannot comprehend why they do this.  \n\nI’ve tried to introduce myself, as i mentioned earlier, but have had no luck doing so. They disregard me entirely when i wave to them or say hello. I want to talk to them, i want to understand why they do this, but i can’t seem to get into a conversation with them and i would hate to be overly confrontational. No one else in the neighbourhood has confronted them either, as far as i can tell, which makes me wonder if maybe I’m being overly sensitive about this.  \n\nI live alone, and I never have visitors, so hearing disturbances around my house tends to make me nervous. I moved here from a bigger city with a much higher crime rate, and I had some bad experiences there so I do tend to be a bit overly cautious about people. I'm afraid to say I spend a little more time staring out my window at people than I probably ought to. It's possible that I may be perceived as being a bit odd or paranoid.\n\nI’ve considered calling in a noise complaint when they’re doing this at night, but i would hate to spark bad blood with them. I don’t know if they’re renting from the new owner, or if they own the place. If they own it, i have to deal with them for as long as i own my home or as long as they own theirs, so i really don’t want to make an enemy here.  \n\nPart of me wonders if i’m just the bitchy, grumpy, fun-crushing neighbour who won’t stop staring out her window. “Get off my lawn”, and all that. Since the family across the street with young kids haven't complained, and the elderly fella hasn't complained, is it possible that i'm just being overly contrary?\n\n**So, TLDR; AITA for wanting my neighbours to be stop running vehicles and loading snowmobiles all the time? Have i become an old, grumpy lady at 26?** ",

      "title": "AITA for platonically talking to my best friends ex with him? (WARNING: wall of text)",
      "description": "I have a friend, Andrew, who I've been amazing with for about 7 years. He and I had a pretty good friend in Ellie, his former girlfriend, and eventually we stopped talking because they had a nasty breakup and she decided it would be best not to talk to me because I'm his best friend and that would be fucked. \n\nLater on down the road, about two years later (this all happened yesterday), we ran into her while getting pizza for a party. What I expected to be a situation where I had to do damage control for my bro turned into everyone reconciling and making amends, with EVERYONE involved apologizing and wanting to make nice. In short, Andrew, his ex, and I are now talking again and shit feels pretty cash.\n\nIn comes the problem: the night that we ran into Ellie, we go back to the party and explain what had happened to the two friends we had there who knew Ellie and all the drama that occurred between her and my best friend. One of them, Sam, doesn't like that she is making nice with him and recommends that he leave her alone cause she is basically a snake in the grass waiting to strike. I talk to my best friend about it and tell him he ought to do whatever he wants, but from the fact that she looked really uncomfortable talking to us (their breakup was pretty bad, with their last interaction being one where he told her to quit talking shit about him) at the pizza place and took the time to talk to us and even gave us a hug showed that she cared bout us still and with that knowledge, putting a good end to that relationship, at the very least, wasnt a bad idea. We agree to talk, with differing goals: Andrew to get a feel for what he wants and I to start being friends with her as soon as possible.\n\nSo I'm texting Ellie at the party after dropping off Andrew, and Sam hears that I'm texting Ellie at that moment. She makes a passive aggressive remark about how I am being kind of a creep talking to my friends ex and I get incredibly livid and leave after we're done hanging out. I shot her a text asking to talk and told her the next morning that I didnt appreciate her calling me creepy and questioning my intent with my best friend of 7 years and she responded as follows:\n\n\"No it's fine, I didnt think you were being creepy, It just didnt seem very cool, like a violation of bro code or something. Obviously you can do whatever you want, but I'm completely against it cuz ik Andrew was really sad about how things happened with her so I feel it would be best to completely leave it all in the past rather than trying to patch it up, and the knowledge of you being buddy buddy with her might actually upset him when he wasn't expecting it to. Idk, it's just how I see it. I don't want Andrew to get hurt. It still hurts me whenever I hear that one of you guys is hanging out with Jacob because theres still a part of me that misses him and is jealous that they get to hang out with him and I dont. And I think that Jean being polite to Andrew wasn't cool at all, it's just stringing him along and giving him hope when she isnt planning on giving him any. Alex did the same\r\n to me, and it just made it so much more worse. Obviously she's probably different than alex and being nice because she thought it was best, but with an ex it's just best to leave it alone and let it stay in the past\"\n(Context: Jacob is a boyfriend that she had for a few years and broke up with, and Alex is a boyfriend she recently had who she knew for a couple months, of which she dated him for one of those months, and he broke things off. It really crippled her emotionally)\n\nThis further frustrates me as it implies I'm putting my best friend in harm's way because I want to be buddy buddy with someone behind his back (he knows and approves of us talking) and he had stated several times he doesnt plan on dating her in any scenario. I talk to Andrew about what to tell her, and after a bit of deliberation, tell her the following:\n\n\"He had said a few times that he just wants to squash the beef there, he isnt interested in pursuing anything. And I wouldnt Express interest in someone who is going to fuck with my friends (let alone Andrew), and i wouldnt advise him into a shitty situation.\n\nI do appreciate your concern for him, however. While we both have differing views on what's best for him, I do value that you are bold enough to express what you think is best and care enough to give thought and input into the matter. Again, I dont agree with your take on it, but I do like that with important things in his life you dont just go 'eh, whatever' about and ignore it.\"\n(Context: the last bit was me trying to put a good spin on the situation, as I felt I was being a bit rough about what I was saying, and I've been trying to make her feel more at home in our squad, so I wanted to make it clear that her care, as wrong as I think it is, is appreciated because care is care)\n\nSo that leaves me at this: I've been overthinking this whole thing and I feel like I might have been a dickhead SOMEWHERE in all of this. Maybe I'm fucking up in advising him to talk to her, maybe I fucked up in how I talked to Sam, idk. I just feel I fucked up somewhere and want to know where so I can correct it.\n\nAITA in any of this?",

      "description": "Im 17 , I’ve had a crush on this girl for 3 years. She’s ruined me mentally and emotionally. She is very extraverted, and talks to many guys. She’s told me that she see’s them all as friends. With her being an introvert, Id always get jealous. When I told her I liked her and if she would consider dating (after 1 year of knowing her), she rejected and said it wasnt me, she didn’t want to date in high school. So I decided to wait till the end of school. \n\nI’d been the best person I could to her, I treated her with so much care. But it seemed that she’d never noticed. She’d always hang out with guys that have been assholes to her. I’ve confronted them to her request for treating her like shit. Yet, she’d hang out with them again like they were best friends. Just to clear something, she’s not the slutty type that has sexual needs, she’s quite the opposite and is against things like that. But regardless, Ive never understood this, and my jealousy grew. \n\nI reached my breaking point when she dated a guy she barely knew that had came to our school for a month  (after me waiting for 2 years to date her). I felt like all the waiting, treating her with so much care, and fighting the pain of jealousy was useless, I was shattered. She never noticed until I told her the relationship was going to kill me (literally) and I had to distance myself. We both go to a small high school (200 ppl), and we are in all the same classes. So I had to see them together everyday. She got mad at me and told me I wasnt being fair and that she still wanted to be my friend...  She didnt help me with my pain and ignored it. A month later they broke up and the guy dated her best friend. I still helped her throughout the breakup. I hated how some random dude could get with her, then proceed to date her best friend, when I’d been my best to her, staying loyal being in a very close relationship with her and her family, and I get this? She told me afterwards she didnt think she hurt anyone when she was with him which completely baffled me. How could a person be so ignorant seeing how much pain their friend could go through. I still liked her, through all my pain and tears and treated her the best I could. She always tells me how she is thankful she has me, and that I am like no one else she’s met, and that I mean so much to her. She’s said shes told me things she’s never told anyone else and that Ive always been with her through her hardest times. But she still hangs out with other people that treat her like shit, and does not seem to care much about me. \n\nI feel like everything she tells me is BS and I am being used. I’ve had so much pain over these years, worst pains of my life. Yet I still like her?? I always wish I never met her and that my feelings for her would end, but my feelings wont go away no matter how hard I’ve tried. Its like a curse that tortures me every single day I see her. Am I the asshole for not letting go of her?",

      "description": "There's quite a bit of background and story to this, so I'll try and made a condensed TL;DR at the end.\n\nI am the eldest of 5 siblings, 3 girls and 2 boys.  We were raised to value our family and each other, and are quite close due to this. \n This past weekend, my first brother finally got married to his SO of 12 years.  My second brother was his best man.  He was very honored and excited to fulfill this role for our brother.\n\nMy second brother has been dating his gf for about 2 years now.  They met at the small grocery store where they worked together, and she still works there while my brother has moved on.  Mom and my youngest sister, who is very close with this brother didn't like her from the start, claiming she was self centered, gross (due to being a smoker), slutty (because she was known to have sex with her previous bfs), and using him (brother is generous and old school romantic, and frequently helps buy her groceries, helps finance things she wants here and there, and spoils her on her birthday and holidays.  AFAIK she reciprocates in kind to him on holidays and his birthday, so in this case I know it's just my mom and sister being judgementaly bitchy).  Mom and sis also hate that they're sexually active and that he wants to move in with her after graduating college next year.  For the record, I personally don't care, but was a little squicked out when they did it at the house we 3 (me, youngest sis, and second brother) lived at because he has the basement suite (it's fully finished) and it carried up through the vents, so we heard....everything.  Other than that awkward instance, I have had no issues with him dating her, or her personally, I think she's perfectly nice, but don't see her often as they prefer to hang out at her place.\n\nSo, as stated before, family is very important to all of us 5 kids.  We frequently have get togethers for birthdays and holidays, and sometimes everyone goes to mom's house for a meal because she wants to see us.  Those with SOs generally bring them along once the relationship starts getting off the ground, which I am lead to believe is generally the norm.  The thing is, this young lady barely attends anything.  Despite what they say about her when she and brother are not around, mom and sis have never shown any hint of this hostility the few times when she has been.  It's a little coincidental too, that when she does come to things it's usually something like Christmas or Easter, when she's guaranteed to get something.  When it's something like a meal or a small gathering for a birthday (some siblings live out of state, so who ever is in town usually goes), her \"anxiety\" flares up and she can't go.\n\nNow, I won't say that she doesn't have anxiety.  Many people do.  It just seems strange that it prevents her from coming to a meal with people she knows and who go out of their way to make sure everyone is comfortable at the event, and not from her cashier job at a very busy grocery store where the majority of customers will get very pissy if you're not fast enough, or the item won't scan, or what have you.  She'll attend work parties and meet friends at bars frequently too with no issue.  Again, I'm not saying she doesn't have anxiety, or that it can't apply to the family situations specifically.  From an outsider's perspective it simply seems fishy.  That, and there was an instance when she claimed anxiety to not come to a get together only to go to the mall with work friends instead.  It was posted on facebook for everyone to see, even.  By the way, my brother attends all her family gatherings and parties with no issues.\n\nSo, knowing this, it was incredibly important for my brother for her to come to the wedding.  This is his only brother- he will never have the chance to be best man for him again (assuming all goes well with the marriage, obviously).  He was absolutely devastated when she told him she wasn't coming.  She absolutely knew how important this was to him.  She knows how important family is to him.  She says she loves him, so if that's true, why the hell didn't she even try?  I am autistic and have dealt with anxiety myself as well.  I was a bridesmaid.  I was given accommodations at the hotel where the reception was held to get away from all the noise and stress.  I know my brother would have assured her that any accommodations could and would be available for her as well.  So long as she was able to go, even if for just a little while, it would have meant the world to him.\n\nSo I ask you, reddit- Are We the Assholes for being mad that she didn't come to the wedding?\n\n**TL;DR** Brother's GF of 2 years did not attend our only other brother's wedding, where said brother was best man.  It was a very important event to him and our family and we're hurt and angry with her for not even trying for his sake.  Are we the assholes here?",

      "description": "I'm 21f, still living with my parents bc jobs in this area are all parttime and I can't afford travelling to 2 jobs and cannot drive, hence why I'm stuck with them. I get God awful pain when it's \"that time\" alongside getting a bit lethargic and usual stuff. I'll often curl up and rest myself, sometimes using one of those lavender wheat bag things. It doesn't get so bad that I can't function but I will twist myself in unnatural ways to try and rid of the pain. It has caused me to pass out numerous times, however. \nMy dad hates it when I try to take ibuprofen and the like and says I should only take it when I really need it and that I'm wasting it, but I do take them rather sparingly. I usually buy and stash my own painkillers so I can try to avoid being confronted about it, but we do generally have some in the cupboard for all to use too. But it's always obvious that I've heated up a wheat bag since it'll stink the kitchen out when microwaved. \n\nNon of us have any chronic pain issues, so the painkillers aren't super important in the house. I get muscular pains all down my right leg or my right shoulder due to some physical issues but I can usually avoid it with special exercise. It gets agonising sometimes though.\nMy mum gets lower back pain on occasion from labourous work, and my dad only ever needs to take painkillers when he gets headaches/migraines, usually after a lot of drink, or for muscle pain also from labourous work. But I'm made out to be the selfish one who wastes them. \n\nTl:dr: my family don't like it when I take painkillers for lady pain, am I the asshole for needing painkillers to deal with the pain? ",

Well, fast forward 8 months (now) and we're together and everything is great. Well, mostly everything. In the beginning, i told my mom about him, not too much information just the basics of him. Then she asked how old.... I kinda froze but didn't make it too obvious and just blurted out that he was 28. I have no idea why but i just kept it up thinking he and I wouldn't have ended up together 8 months later. He knows that i told my mom he was 28 and not 33 and he seemed uncomfortable then kinda understood why i would lie about it.  But i feel like an asshole.. i mean eventually i wanna have him around family events and stuff, i just don't know if i could go back from that and it feels shitty.\n\nAm I the asshole for lying about my boyfriends age to my family?

      "description": "My ex-boyfriend and I met on a dating app, and we really liked each other. He and I had amazing sexual chemistry, and he was frankly the best partner I ever had. He’s really smart (going to Yale Law School next year) and seemed to be really into me. We saw each other for around 2 months, but I was already sort of planning our futures together. \n\nAnyway, I’m not fat, but I don’t have any real muscular definition nor am I slim. He, on the other hand, went to the gym everyday. He wasn’t muscular, but he has a six pack and a very lithe, toned body. (It may be important to note that I’m gay, and gay men tend to be pretty fit.) \n\nAround a month ago (a month into the relationship), he said that he really liked me, but he thought it wasn’t fair that I didn’t put as much effort into looking good as he did. That he had assumed I had a good body because I was in the navy, so that’s why he met me off Tinder without seeing a body photo. I promised that I would try to get healthier, but I’m honestly so tired after work that I never really bothered going to the gym and didn’t think he was so dissatisfied with my body. I didn’t bring this up to him, but I was the one who paid for all our meals, so I assumed that he would take that into account into his dissatisfaction. \n\nThis morning, he texted me that I didn’t take him seriously when he brought up my body, so I should never talk to him again. I think he blocked me on iMessage because my messages won’t deliever. While I would kill to turn back time and have gotten a trainer when he signaled his dissatisfaction, I’d just like to know whether AITA? ",

They had a 2hr trip each way and were in a hurry to get home as it ia very cold today and we have about half a foot of snow on the ground, which makes everyrhinf worse. First I had a who're of a time tryinf to get the car unfrozen as it has sat for a year. So after an hr I get it unstuck and head inside to wait for them. Well they show up 15 mins later and begin doing their thing while i get the title ready. Well they have the car half way on the trailer when this elderly couple shows up in there car trying to get by. Well I live on what can best be described as a goat.path. it is barely wide enough for 3 cars and the people buying the car had a 2500 Chevy Silverado or some shit like that with a trailer behind it so no one was squeezing by. Well the elderly couple aita there for a few minutes and the husband finally gets out and says can we speed it up. Well we were trying but you want to make sure.that care is strapped down or some bad shit will happen. Then his wife starts honking on the horn and doesn't let up and the husband says you can just pull forward and we can squeeze by. But since the car wasnt strapped down that wasnt possible and we explained that and he got mad. I guess he knew my grandfather because he threw his name out there saying this isn't the (insert my last name) I kbow. Which is funny because my grandfather would have told him to fuck off way quicker than I did. Which I told him while i told him to fuck off. It is really annoying how that generation calls my generation entitled when he couldnt be bothered to wait literally 10mins to strap a car down properly to avoid injury and possible someone's death if that car came loose.

(For the people who are not into CSGO, it doesn't matter because it's not much relevant to my story, but for the people who are into it, just because of winning a round doesn't always make you win the whole tournament). And by seeing how she won one round convincingly, some 'prominent' gaming cafe owner gave her some job, which the page doesn't mention, neither the job, nor the name of the cafe. She got a job while she was in first gear of engineering (It's kinda pretty big deal here) and they further went to say that the principal didn't believe and they congratulated it too. Since I thought this was a pretty far fetched story with no details of any college, competition, the name of the girl or the job that she got, neither the name of the cafe, I asked the Moderator team of that page to ask the girl whom they featured for the details, and if she isn't agreeing of the details being shared publicly, atleast share the details with the Facebook page. One random girl saw my comment and said that I'm being misogynistic for not believing that girl are more better than boys and I'm fishing for private information of the girl. Am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: A page featured a girl (without her name, name of the college which conducted tournament, name of the cafe where she got the job) who got a job offer because she won a single round of CSGO in her college tournament.

      "description": "So my husband and I had a rough year. He cheated, i caught him, we tried to work through it but it blew up so we separated and went to see counselors and have worked through everything. \n\nSo before all of that happened my husband and i had been getting really close with one of my husbands coworkers and his wife and family. We hung out a lot, at least once a week and we texted every day. We would have them over for holidays and even if my husband was working I'd go hang out with them without him. \n\nMe and his coworker really became good friends more than me and his wife because we had a lot in common and the main thing was we had the same sense of humor. A kind of raunchy humor and we would send each other funny videos or memes all the time. \n\nBut they were really like family. If we needed advice, we'd go to them. If they needed anything they could come to us. \n\nSo when I caught my husband cheating I was devastated. I went to them and confided a lot in them. As my husband and I tried to work through it they were there for us helping us both with all the things we were feeling. But when it all blew up and we separated they immediately boxed me out. It was radio silence. I reached out to them and nothing. They never answered the phone or called back or replied to my texts. They were my only friends so I was completely alone. They never once were there for me.\n\nSo after me and my husband started to figure things out and started living together again they invited my husband to a bar/restaurant. I said I wasn't ready to see them again so I stayed home. When he got there they started begging him to invite me. I said no but I was trying to put my best foot forward for my husband and I eventually caved and went. \n\nI was not very nice. I basically gave them the cold shoulder. They asked how I was doing and I said I was doing fine on my own. And then they got defensive. He(coworker) said the reason they picked my husbands side was because they work together. And then he told me to stop being mad because I was just looking for things to be mad about. I ignored this and left.\n\nAfter that he(coworker) started spamming me with funny videos and memes. Not any real conversation just memes. I'd say lol or funny but I eventually stopped replying altogether. \n\nIt went on for a bit but I got tired of all these raunchy videos. So I told him that I was sorry I was rude the day at the restaurant but if he thought of me as just his coworkers wife, then he shouldn't be sending me those things anymore. I told him he was my best friend and I had confided a lot in him and I felt abandoned when he and his wife stopped talking to me.\n\nHis reply was \"it didnt have to be like this but if that's how you want it to be fine. All you have to do is apologize and we can fix our friendship.\"\n\nI didnt text back. I dont know what else to apologize for. I've asked my husband and he doesnt know either. Am I being an asshole? Am I missing something. I miss their friendship every day but I feel like they aren't good friends. Am I crazy? \n\n",

      "description": "My (17M) friend (17M) is in two of my classes and my lunch this year. I had a class w him last year and we became good friends but kinda poked fun at each other. He’s a nice guy and it was all in good fun.\n\nThis year his dad died. I was there for him but he had seen it coming for a long time so he was as prepared as a 17 year old can be. This didn’t really change anything about him but it was around that time I started to be annoyed by him. He CONSTANTLY complains about everything. The temperature, homework, tests, classmates, you name it. He also keeps making little jabs at me that he’s always made but they’re just piling up. I’m somewhat of the same way, but they were never mean spirited. I think they may be becoming that way though. I feel like I’m becoming kind of abrasive towards him. \n\nWhen he was going through everything with his dad, I backed off completely. I was only a friend. No jokes about anything personal. But recently I’m went through a rough patch myself. A hard breakup and a few other things. Obviously nowhere near as hard as the death of a parent, but still some other things. He was aware of the things that be been happening with me but still made his little jokes, and I think they got more mean spirited. I don’t think he understood how low some of the things he said made me feel. I was also diagnosed with OCD and I’m praying he doesn’t find out about that. \n\nI understand I’ve been abrasive since then, but AITA for seriously starting to resent this guy? I can’t help feeling like I am with all of the things that happened with his family. He’s a good guy but I think he’s like this with a lot of people. He just starts to annoy people after a while",

I did ask him why he doesn’t back the documents onto a thumbdrive or cloud drive but he just gives a half-hearted “I’ve thought of it but never got around to it” answer.\n\n3 weeks pass and he doesn’t follow up. I had to text him again before we arranged another date for him to come over and send the documents to the unis. So he comes, and realizes he didn’t upload some other docs cos he didn’t check the required ones. So gfdi now he’s coming over again.\n\nAnd holy fucking shit, maybe I’m just really petty, but he keeps changing the timings and so I gotta change my other plans. He also says “Yo don’t delete my stuff on your com” and I go “then when the fuck u gonna finish your thing”\n\nIn the end I straight up told him he’s an irresponsible asshole who kinda makes me feel used and at his disposal. Like it’s your future not mine, why the hell do I have to be so accommodating. And at the very least say “thanks” or “so sorry for the trouble” but then he says “Dude, I know.”\n\ntl:dr feel my friend isn’t taking responsibility for his own future and acting like a self-entitled cunt it pisses me off (lowkey feel I’m being petty tho)",

      "description": "The friend in question we will call Tom. Tom has always been kind of homophobic. Specifically the \"I'm not a homophobe, but if I see a gay couple I'm going to call the a couple of f-\" brand of homophobia.\nYou might imagine how difficult it was to come out as bi to all my friends, him included. He was suprisingly alright with it, and continued treating me as normal, which was nice. However, a certain meme began to spread around, particularly on Instagram. It was the \"Anti-LGBT Emoji\"(And yes, I know that to some it means \"no homo\" but that isnt the case for Tom. The specific memes on Instagram he was liking all referred to it as the \"Anti-LGBT Emoji\")\nI saw him liking these memes on Instagram. I was kind of annoyed at the meme and Instagram as a whole, but all I had to do was close the app and it was gone. This wasnt good enough for Tom though, and he started sending it to our group chat. I had told him to cut it out and made it clear he was getting me mad. Of course, this only made Tom want to do it more. He kept spamming the emoji and eventually I just muted the chat. I was thinking \"He's being annoying and purposefully trying to make me angrier, but it's fine. As long as he's dropped it by the time I'm back, I'll let it go.\"\nSo then I decided since I came out privately to everyone who mattered to me, I was finally ready to come out in a more public way. I made a profile picture for myself on Facebook with myself in front of the bi pride flag. Uploaded it, and sure enough...\nTom, in the comments, with the Anti-LGBT Emoji on my profile picture that I used to come out publicly. I had enough. I didn't care if it was just some emoji.\nYou see, I remembered a few monthes ago when Stan Lee passed away. Tom was very upset, and fell into a slump for a while. I did my very best to help him out of this slump, and I remembered him telling me \"He was my hero, man. I really wanted to meet him. I wanted to go to cons hoping I'd meet him.\"\nI saw an opportunity to hit Tom where it hurt. I replied to his comment with \"Haha! Good one Tom, wanna know whats funnier though?\"\n\"Is it [Emoji]?\"\n\"Nope! That you thought youd actually get to meet Stan Lee before he died!\"\nand thus followed a long comment chain where he tried to justify his emoji and even some of my friends jumping in trying to convince him to just stop (mind you, this is all public, including to my parents.) \nIt ended with me explaining to him that even if it was a joke, everyone has jokes they dont like, even him. He said he would stop doing it, though he didnt apologize.\nIt has been almost a week since then now, and I've been thinking it over. In my head I think I did something good, but in my heart I think I feel bad. We havent talked since then, and the rest of my friends have started pulling away from him. This situation isnt entirely why theyre pulling away from him, but this was the straw that broke the camels back.",

      "description": "Hey, so some backstory. My mother works for a company that inables mentally handicapped people to live on their own. This particular house has anywhere from 3-5 individuals living in it. This one individual, who I'm call B, has never had a problem with my mother or any other worker (to my knowledge). I don't know if B has Downs, ASF, but definitely has some sort of retardation (I'm not saying this in a bad way here). This house is about a 5 minute walk from where I work at a grocery store. So B frequents the store a lot and buys cigarettes there almost every day, and I would always say hi and all that. B knows that my mom works at his house.\n\nSo, about two or three months ago, another individual hit B with some keys on a lanyard and B started hitting my mother brutally in the face. After punching her repeatedly, she finally got away, managed to grab her phone and locked her self in the bathroom. B then started shoving newspapers and paper towels under the door and pouring bleach on it and the door. He has easy access to a lighter and could've/would've lit it. The only reason he didn't is because my mom called the cops and they just pulled up.\n\nI hate him. I really do. Every time I see him my chest gets hot and I feel my adrenaline starting. Even writing this I'm a bit shaky. He still comes to the store. Almost every day I have to see his face and am reminded of what he did. I haven't said a single word to him and I haven't sold him a single item. If he comes to my line, I call someone else up and have them help him. I would ask my boss to van him from the store, but haven't because I'm afraid he'll take it out on my mom, who still works there (it's stupid I know, I've begged her to quit, my family has begged her to quit, but that's another story).\n\nSo, am I an asshole for hating him and refusing to sell him anything?",

This resulted in literally like a hundred coins spraying in all directions all over the pavement.

      "description": "Was at an NBA game recently. In front of me a couple was sitting. The woman kept getting texts from another man. She would keep her phone facing away from who I presume to be her husband (both wearing wedding rings). Some of the texts were pretty suggestive, one being something like \"I really wish I could be with you right now.\" She would quickly delete the messages after sending them. This made me extremely uncomfortable. I immediately thought about saying something or at least warning the husband somehow about his wife's texts. I contemplated tapping him on the shoulder and whispering something toward the end of the game, I thought about writing a message on a piece of paper and slipping it to him when his wife wasn't looking, or even taking pictures of her screen while she was texting to have as proof. I mean I'd wan't a stranger to tell me if I was in his spot. But ultimately I chose to do nothing. At the time I rationalized it in my head that he would believe the word of his wife over that of a complete stranger. And I felt like it might be weird to be taking pictures of a woman's cell phone if somebody saw me do it. \n\nI'm also almost 100% sure they were married to each other. They kissed once during the game and had two kids with them. The husband had his arm around her most of the game.\n\nI keep having second thoughts about what I should have done, and I feel like a complete asshole for not doing at least something. ",

      "description": "I dog sit as a secondary source of income, and have for about a year and a half now. While most of the people I sit for are strangers, I've watched a fair amount of coworker's/friend's dogs as well, and they have always offered to pay me for these services, even when it's only for a night or two. \n\nThis particular friend, we'll call her E, asks me to watch her dog somewhat frequently. I love her dog, and don't mind watching him too much, but I obviously still have to go out of my way to make sure I come home often enough to walk him, clean up after his messes (he has frequent accidents), etc. She has never so much as offered to pay me for watching him, apart from buying me a latte here or there as a thank you. From the very beginning--and we became friends after I had started dog sitting, so she knew that this is a service I typically charge for--she has just expected that I'll watch him for free. When it's just for a weekend or something, it's not the biggest deal. But she has, on many occasions, asked me to watch him for 5-10 days at a time, completely for free.\n\nI agreed to watch him for her the last week in January, but the longer this goes on, the more pissed off I get. I know we're friends, but I often feel like she takes advantage of me in this way, and I'm tired of it. Not to mention, when I'm watching her dog, I'm potentially losing money from other clients because I can only watch one dog at a time. \n\nAITA if I ask her to start paying me for this? I know I already agreed to January, so maybe I should suck it up and do that for free but then ask that in the future she pay me for it? I feel bad asking a friend for money, but I feel like she's using me past the point of a few friendly favors. ",

      "description": "Apologies in advance for the long story.\n\nBackground: I'm 34. My grandmother is 91 and lives in a nursing home in a small city. The area where she lives isn't rural by any means, but it's not exactly accessible either. It's basically an all-day trip to get there (two flights), and when you arrive there's not really much to do given it's a small city. There's no meaningful public transportation, no Uber or Lyft, and what few cabs there are charge a fortune to take you anywhere. I don't know anyone there other than her.\n\nShe's actually doing pretty well for being 91, she's not bedridden or anything, but she basically just spends her days watching TV punctuated by going down to their dining room for meals. Her hearing isn't very good and she doesn't like wearing hearing aids, so conversations with her consist of you saying something and her responding to what she thinks you said, which usually doesn't like up with what you actually said. Make for a lot of awkward conversations. I think she's well-taken care of, the nursing home she's staying at actually sounds pretty nice. And other than her loss of hearing I think she's in generally good health.\n\nShe lives by herself, my grandfather died 5 years ago. After he died we tried to get her to move closer to family but she refused on the basis that her friends still lived in the city. But all her friends are dead now, so she lives by herself in this small, faraway town. The closest family is my uncle (her son) who is unemployed/on disability and lives 4 hours away. He rarely visits her despite having nothing going on in his life (his disability does not prevent him from traveling to visit her, and he has the means to do so).\n\nI used to visit her every year, but I stopped 3 years ago. It's a long and expensive trip to just go sit around and watch TV for a couple days. The last time I went I had such a miserable time I felt resentment toward her for not taking our advice and moving closer to family when she was able to (she says she's too old to move now which is probably true). I had never felt that toward her before in my life. I decided then to take a break from visiting her, because I didn't want to resent her, and I didn't think she would want me to resent her. That was 3 years ago.\n\nThe way I see it, we all have to live with the choices we make in life, and she chose to live in a city that's far away from family, so we can't be expected to visit her that much.\n\nI call her every single week without fail on Sunday evenings before she goes to dinner. Every week she asks me when I'm coming to visit and tells me she misses me and that she's not going to be around forever. Every week I tell her the same thing, which is that I'm definitely planning on it, which is a lie. Sometimes I cry after talking to her because I miss her to and I feel sad about the situation. I'm crying right now just from typing this. \n\nBut at the same time, whenever I think about visiting her, it stresses me out and makes me start feeling resentful toward her again.\n\nReddit: Am I the asshole for not visiting my grandmother?\n\n",

      "description": "Background info: all of us are 5th year medical students, 22-23 y/o, and my boyfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 yrs. \n\nMy bf and I have been experiencing problems bc I can’t stand his friendship with a certain girl in his group. I’ve known her since school, and she was a bully, and after we both got into med school and I was part of her circle for the first 2 yrs, she would make fun of me in front of other people, make plans with the group without me, and generally make me feel not welcomed. My friends knew what was going on, but no one ever took action. \n\nAfter crying and feeling insecure, I abandoned that group of friends and made some new friends who treated me well. \n\nFast forward to the beginning of this year, when I learned that my boyfriend and her were both assigned to the same group, I was kind of annoyed, but I assumed that it would just be casual and that she’s not the kind of person my boyfriend would be friends with. \n\nEventually, the entire group got close and started having frequent lunches together, celebrating birthdays, a Christmas dinner, carpooling, doing night shifts... but my issue is not with the group, it’s this specific girl, not only because of all the things she did to me, but she was getting increasingly annoying; she playfully joked around with my boyfriend, did annoying shit to get his attention when we’re talking, and acted like a diva. After a while I just stopped caring about the way I acted. \n\nMy bf has been telling me that she’s changed and has become a nice person, and that she’s really nice to him. He wishes we were on better terms. We’ve had so many arguments about her, and I tell myself I’m going to tolerate it for his sake, because I want him to enjoy his time in uni and to have people that he can study with, &amp; it would be awkward if he just cut her off for the rest of the year. However, it has really put a strain on our relationship, made me cry many times, and has been making it difficult for me to focus on my school work. \n\nBecause I don’t think she’s a changed person, he said that he would try to get her to open up about what she thinks of me, and if she doesn’t seem like she regrets what she did, he would end the friendship. So, last week, he asked her why we weren’t friends, and her response was “it’s not that I don’t like her, she doesn’t like me, I don’t like people who pretend to like me and then just suddenly start to ignore me”. This was it for me; not once did she mention the reason of why I wouldn’t like her, &amp; made it sound like I was rude. We had an argument &amp; my boyfriend asked if not being friends with her would solve our problem. I said yes. \n\nIs it mean of me to expect my bf to end his friendship with someone because of my issues with her? I feel really bad about it, but I just can’t stand it anymore. I really love him, especially that he’s really nice to people, assumes the best in them, &amp; would never be mean to someone who’s never done anything bad to him. ",

      "description": "A while ago at the end of my senior year in highschool a few of my friends planned and invited me to participate in a senior prank at the school. Around 10,000 post-it notes were purchased and were to be applied on all surfaces within the main hallways of the school. So the fated night arrived. I invited my GF at the time as well. She brought a puppy she had just gotten. I let her know i thought it was silly to bring a puppy but hey everyone else there loved it and he was dubbed our crime mascot. The original plan included ~ 8 people. Word got out though and we ended up with closer to 20. The original team thought this was excellent and would speed the process along. We were wrong. All the extras set about executing their own pranks such as zip tying all the doors to the school closed, placing desks on the roof, and relocating the lunch tables to the parking lot. At this point I am feeling uneasy about all the rest off the pranks deviating from the original plan. The prank we chose was specifically non destructive and more of an annoyance. While the other things could potentially be damaging to school property.  All the activity outside the school quickly drew attention and police were dispatched before much was post-it noted. One of my friends announces the police are arriving and i reply to them and my GF LETS GO and take off running. I finally find a door that wasn't Zip Tied and make it out behind the school and escape. I then realize I am alone. I make my way to my GFs house close by to see if she made it out another exit. After waiting ~20 minutes she shows up. No one else even tried running.  The cops rounded them up gave them a stern lecture and sent them home. \n\nSo was i the asshole for being the only one that got away?",

      "description": "My mom and I have not been getting along the past year and a half. She was a really shitty mom but got a little better over the years. \n\nLast year we had a big falling out because she talks so much shit about everyone and I ended up hearing all the shit she talks about me. We havent seen each other much since then but have talked and it has been going good.\n\nSo my ex boyfriend and I had a really big fight on Friday and I ended up telling her about it. Right now we are currently broken up, but have talked but not made up and he hasnt come home since Friday night. I told her about it thinking for some reason she wouldnt tell anyone. She ended up telling her bf, my aunt, and one of my brothers that I know for sure. Probably my other brother and who ever else she talks to. \n\nWell I learned my lesson as yesterday I went over to my aunts and was going to tell her a story about Friday, but not about the fight. I started the story by saying me and EX did this activity on Friday and she said I already heard. My story wasnt about the fight but she must have thought I was going to say that. So I was annoyed last night after leaving. I left it be. Today I text my mom and say so who did you tell about my and EXs fight? She says \"just your brother\". I said \"aunt knows to does older brother know\" she said \"aunts nosey, probably not brother he hasnt said anything\" long story short I said \"i told you that thinking you werent going to tell everyone\" she says \"i am done with this conversation\" so i said im not going to Christmas. And Ill just have her bf drop them off when he goes. \n\nShe said thats fine she isnt doing Christmas anyways and that my aunt was. I said good good. She said keep the gifts. I said alrighty bye. \n\nI will be sending the gifts because the gifts were for my cousins and aunt and brothers and grandma and I want them to have them. They did nothing to me. She wont be there actual Christmas day so I am maybe going over there then and seeing my grandma who is in bad shape. I texted aunt and let her know i wasnt going. She asked why i just said because of my mom but didnt go into detail. I also told my older brother who is coming up from 3 hours away and told him the same thing, said i didnt want to discuss the fight any further. He said \"life is to short for you and mom to be petty. You only get 50 Christmas celebtrations and your wasting them.\" Then something about me and her being childish. \n\nAm I the asshole? I should not have told her but I was really upset and wanted someone to talk to. Im just so annoyed my mom and I cant talk about anything or it gets spread throughout my entire family. ",

It was a long distance relationship for the first 2 weeks everything was going well but I noticed my grades started to slip. What I did was I took 2 days **2days** just to focus on my academics. My ex on the other hand didn’t like this so she kept texting me saying “you don’t love me any more” etc. So she wouldn’t freak out I started to talk to her and focus on my academics but that means I’d call her less. Eventually her friend texted me saying something like “she’s talking to her ex and planning to get back together.” At this point I felt betrayed so I confronted her with the information I was given. I broke up with her and told her “…I need to focus on my life because it’s slipping and if I want to date someone it’s going to be in (home town)!” So she called me selfish saying I can’t dump people for personal use (reminding: she was planning to cheat on me) currently spending my 1 month with out her #YAYY🥳🥳🎉🎉",

      "description": "The title sounds bad but I do believe I was in the right for saying so.\n\nSo, my dad has been dating this woman that he met at a massage parlor (she is a massage therapist there) and she has been throwing red flags left and right. And they’ve only been dating for two weeks. \n\nRed flag #1: She told him that he is not allowed to speak to his ex wife anymore (my mom) because she is jealous and sees her as a threat. My mom remarried and would never threaten their relationship. Plus my father and mother have two children together and also have 7+ grandchildren together, so naturally they talk from time to time.\n\nRed flag #2: She limits the kind of food that my dad can eat at restaurants and at home. Now, my dad isn’t a huge guy. He is about 20 lbs overweight but overall eats very healthy and exercises regularly but he sometimes likes to treat himself to something like a cheeseburger or a couple slices of pizza. She put an end to that.\n\nRed flag #3: She told him that he needs to clean the entire house. Again, this seemed unnecessary since the house is clean with the exception of a few dishes in the sink and clothes on his bedroom floor. She spent the entire day laying in his bed while he steam cleaned the carpet in every room of the house and made everything shine. \n\nRed flag #4: This is where I put my foot down and finally spoke up. My dad came downstairs and informed me that one of our older cats will now have to live her life inside of his bedroom closet because his girlfriend thinks that would be best to keep the house clean since our cat occasionally has accidents on the carpet. \n\nI flat out told him that she’s a bitch for suggesting that and implementing so many rules within their first month of dating. My dad obviously took great offense to that because he basically worships the ground that she walks on.  We aren’t on speaking terms now.\n\nWas I the A-hole? ",

      "title": "AITA if I (19F) exclude my Sister in my personal life (23F) ?",
      "description": "Hey there! \n\nSo some backstory about my sister’s and I relationship \n-We used to be super close when she was studying abroad and had a BF at the time, she constantly called me and came to me for advice/rant about her BF.  After she came back, they had a nasty break up where he cheated on her while being in an LDR (and she was caught snooping in his emails/socials) \n\n- I’m currently in a 6 month relationship with a wonderful guy and we’re going to do LDR in 5 months so we try to spend time with each other as much as possible now, but due to circumstances I only see him on weekends and sometimes not even at all. I do prioritise my time well and I do not neglect my friends/family when I’m with him.\n\n- my Sister has grown increasingly negative about my relationship and keeps saying how LDR wouldn’t work out, and I’ve noticed her picking fights with me over my relationship for unfair reasons (eg calling me cheap for staying a night over at my bfs house when she flew for a month to see her bf specifically, saying I prioritise my Bf over her when I spend 5 days a week with her and just 1 with him) she’s been very negative and this in turn affects my relationship in very unnecessary ways as I get upset and my Bf has to console me due to her childishness.\n\n- we do have a dynamic where she’s very assertive and I’m always giving in, but recently I’ve been sticking up for myself and we’ve been having arguments when I do. it really is tiring as I realised all the things we argued on was unnecessary\n\n- She constantly asks me for updates in my love life and then the next moment shames me for it. She’ll tell me to spend time with my Bf and if I do, she’ll say that I’m neglecting her. She would encourage me on LDR and then discourage me after. She often hinders my plans or makes me feel bad for making them and this leads to me hiding things from her. She judges me for things yet is completely hypocritical etcetera. It’s very upsetting as there’s nothing I want more for us to be good again but now I rather exclude her from my personal life if she continues being so frustrating - things were never this complicated when she was overseas and now she nitpicks on everything \n\nMy question is: AITA if i start excluding her from personal details of my life? She constantly talks down to me like she wants to control my life.  I’ve started to do it as I realised my actions aren’t accountable to her, (be it my love life or aspirations) since it always ends in her saying I’m wrong and she’s right in a matter that’s my own personal life. When I refuse to tell her my plans (eg she asks about if my Bf and I have discussed LDR properly and instead of telling her I just say “nothings certain yet &amp; I don’t really wanna discuss such a private matter  w u when it concerns me and my BF”)  she’ll react negatively, blows up and says I’m snappy &amp; ungrateful to her advice (it’s not even good advice).

      "description": "So this story starts about a year ago. For clarity, we’ll refer to everyone as Andy (me), April (my SO), Leslie and Tammy. We all planned a trip to see a band we all like, which would have been about a 7 hour road trip. Leslie bought the tickets, and did not make us pay service fees (we’ve all done this before, we never make each other pay service charges). \n\nBefore the trip, Tammy started having anxieties about the whole thing. She started fights, would ignore us for days/weeks, and was weirdly passive-aggressive about where we stayed, when we would get on the road, or what we planned to do while there. The show was in Boston, and we planned to leave Friday and get home late Sunday. We only had the weekend to do stuff, so we tried to fit in things we all wanted to do, but Tammy had a long (at least week’s worth) list of things she wanted to do, on top of the concert. \n\nJust before we were supposed to leave, Tammy bought us tickets to the date of the tour in our hometown that the band had just added. She told us we all owed her the ticket charge + \\~$25 for service charges. We told her we would pay her back after the trip when we could, which we thought was fine considering Tammy had not paid Leslie back until the day before the concert. \n\nTammy refused to drive, blamed her pre-trip frustrations and anger on boy troubles, and then when we got there was MISERABLE the whole time. We went out of our way to do things she wanted (even walking the Freedom Trail in the New England downpour) and tried our best to make the trip worth it. When I asked if anyone had money to tip the maid, she yelled at me that she didn’t have any money after spending $400 on tickets for us for the second date. She also complained about where we decided to stay (an AirBnB) then when it fell through and we needed to get a hotel, said she “told us” that we should have gotten a hotel in the first place (she never met up with us for booking). \n\nThe final straw came in Salem. We (minus Tammy) wanted to go since it was the weekend before Halloween. She complained that we “only cared about Halloween” and she “wanted to see Historical things” - this was outside the Salem Town Hall. Despite this, she dropped $200 on souvenirs, and we drove home in near-silence. \n\nAfter it all, she refused to pay Leslie (who had eaten the extra cost for the hotel) for the parking, and told her she didn’t want her in her life anymore. She then told her she “knew” April and I would never pay her back. We all tried to reason with her (she’s often a lot of drama, but we always try to be supportive and steer her to better paths) and she blocked us all on social media and subtweeted about cutting “toxic people” out of her life. We told her to sell our tickets, and she told us we were basically fucking her over. \n\nTL;DR: A friend was miserable and mean to us on a trip with her, we told her we no longer wanted to go to a concert with her, she called us toxic.

      "description": "I could go on forever about this topic, but to cut it short...\n\nI'm in a program through my college that allows the students to design projects (business cards/logos/magazines/annual reports/flyers/booklets/pamphlets/anything graphic design based) for local business in the area. \n\nMost of these business are new startups, and come to us due to our good reputation and great work. So a couple months ago, we got a really big client. I mean, like a project that would bring a normal design agency thousands upon thousands of dollars. This was a big project - so, to combat this, we were paired into groups.\n\nMy group was pretty decent, although, there are always going to be issues with getting paired into groups for a large project... I'm definitely one to get everything done right away and then continuously work out the kinks along the way and afterwards. Basically, if you do your work, I'd be willing to re-work it to fit the criteria... which is basically what I did for this entire project. 28 pages in total, all needing to follow very specific guidelines for the company.\n\nNow... we sent it to the company and they LOVED IT. However, when they gave us some edits and changes they would like to see (three pages of notes, mind you), I was very upset to see that my group members downright refused to have a part in making those changes. Even going as far to make statements claiming \"well, *my name* already has all of the collective files, so he can just make the edits.\" HOW ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING OF A MINDSET. This is a massive client, and this work is absolutely astonishing for them to come to us with...\n\nNow, the asshole-ish part hasn't really started yet. It wasn't until I messaged them asking for help on the edits that it started to get ugly.  I sent a message to the entire group, and only two people responded back. We had only three more days to do the edits. There were two major edits that needed to be done; I had finished the rest. I sent a list and the pages to the rest of the group members, and informed them that there are only these TWO things that had to be done yet... two people completely ignored the messages for those three days, claiming they had no idea what I was talking about (although they had responded in the group message prior to this incident), one person responded and said they would try on the smaller of the two pieces, but quickly tried to back out, and the other person claimed that they didn't feel it needed any edits.\n\nFirst and foremost, these edits are not optional. This is a massive client TELLING us that these were changes that needed to be done. It is a done deal... got it? Well, apparently she didn't. She refused and made up excuses as to not do it. Her biggest excuse was that she was trying to sleep; the downside, was that she had three days to do the single page edit, and it was 6 p.m. at the time she had sent that message. \n\nSo finally, I got upset cause it was the last day to get the edits done, and I still hadn't heard word of either of the two changes being made... so I sent a message saying that if it didn't get done I wouldn't be taking any responsibility and that the uploads for the entire book would be in the hands of the other group members. I told them that I was upset with the lack of cooperation between the people, and that I would have rather done it solo had it been a client who would be paying us directly. The following morning, I got both of the finished pieces back via email, but they were both obviously rushed and lacking details that were specified in the guidelines. Along with that, I received a message from the female student who wanted to just sleep, that I was rude and condescending and that I don't deserve any respect. \n\nSo here lies the issue... am **I** the asshole for being upset with my group? I worked my ass off on this project and brought everything together to make sure that the client loved it... and I only lost respect from the fellow group members who did NOTHING.\n\ntl;dr - Client asked for a large project from my college graphic design class. Was grouped up with people who refused to do anything. I told them I was disgusted with their work ethic and, in turn, received half-assed work and a message saying I was rude. ",

      "description": "So sorry if this doesn't make much sense but I'm currently crying as I type this. My mom came home and we got into an argument as I had informed her prior I would be out on new years evening for a party. Well my ride there consumed alcohol that I didn't even notice until texting my friends prior to making this post and as it was nearly 4 in the morning and no one else had a car I ended up staying over and texted my mom that this event was unforseen by me. \n\nDuring the duration of the party I kept texting her to let her know I was alive as I couldn't call her due to a cold that stripped me of my voice.\n\nSo I get home and she goes off on me for leaving my diabetic 18 year old brother at home and for not asking the person who drove me what their plans were, even though I didn't realize they planned on consuming alcohol and when it reached 4 they just announced they were going to bed and the only other person that reasonably had a car left hours earlier due to having work the next day.\n\nFor some background info, my bro got diagnosed as diabetic 2 weeks ago, roughly, but it's merely symptoms of diabetes due to a pancreatic infection as the doctors put it. Still they have to treat my brother as if he has diabetes (this includes insulin shots, portion control, pills, etc). My brother is insanely capable of administering g and doing these things himself without my supervision. But my mother seems to believe that he can't and thought about pulling him from high school for some period of time because she was concerned he can't do those things by himself.\n\nEssentially she said that I was in the wrong and chalked up everything to me having a cushy life since she could simply pay my tuition and be done with me. I lashed out and dropped some emotional baggage as a result and made her more mad and said I was further in the wrong for not coming home on time, finding a ride home, or asking my ride (who also hosted the party at their place) what they were planning on doing. So AITA here or did I overreact?\n\n(I'm 21 and in the US, if that helps. I'm only at home for the holidays.)",

      "description": "Two years ago, my grandfather passed away. I was working in marketing departmen at this  small branch office of a huge company that sold soil fertilizers at the time. I could not attend the funeral since it was what we call busy month. But I promised my upset Dad that I would take a week off and visit grandpa's grave the following month. \n\nMy general manager was a tiny man with some bad tempers so I submitted my leave request when he was in a good mood. But he refused my 7 days off request and trimmed it to 4 days only. (Take it or leave it he said). I tried talking to the human resources about it since my grandpa was buried in a remote village and it would take me 48 hours to get there by bus from the nearest airport. But my manager would not approve it. \nSo I flew back home and found out there had been a fight in my family concerning the inheritance which included a house and acres of land. I needed to stay there until the problem was solved. So I called the company's human resources to ask if it's possible to get more days off at least until I was not needed to sign some papers regarding grandpa's inheritance.\n\nThe company told me it was not possible. There were only 2 options left for me. To fly back to work or to quit the job. I chose the latter since I loved my family and wanted to set things right among us. \nBut apparently the company acquired me to go through a one month notice procedure before my last day. This was not written down on the contract though. If I didn't do it, then they would not give me my last salary, bonuses and others included. This upset me since I had worked my ass off for them taking long hours into the night. And as far as this resignation procedure went at the company, nobody else had ever been forced to go through the one month procedure before. It was as if they were trying to get me in trouble or something. But since I did not want to complicate the matter because I was still focusing on my family problem as well, I opted to let it go, though still bitter about it. It was a lot of money to let go after all. \n\nA few weeks later, one of the company's clients contacted me (not knowing I had quit) regarding some products that had arrived in bad conditions, broken and dented.  The truth is, in a rush to sell them the company did not bother at all to check which products were still in good condition to send.\nBecause they needed to replace all the old ones left in the store room ASAP, which was one of the reasons why my manager wanted me to come back soon in the first place. \nThe manager was well aware of it but one of my colleagues had told me he had overheard him saying 'The shipment is to blame. Just get rid of those craps'.\n\nIn a rush of vengeance, I told the client about it. I've heard the manager has been suspended and the client has sued him and the company for it. Now that my family's problem has subsided, I feel a little pang of guilt for getting him in trouble though. AITA here?",

      "description": "This all started when my first gf ever broke up with me, this of course left me in a state of severe depression for several weeks, so my best friend seeing me like this, invites me to a party so he wouldn't go alone.\n\nHe convinced me to go and there I met some really cool people and in particular I met the girl who had invited him to the party in first place and we kicked it off from the start, dancing and singing to every song and at the end we exchanged numbers so everything was going well for me until my best friend (I'm gonna call him bestie from here on out) tells me he's had her eye on her from a year ago so I backed off and started talking just as friends with this girl.\n\nCouple of months pass, and bestie tells me he needed help with how he was going to ask her to be his gf so I helped him get everything he needed, set up the place and make sure everything went smoothly. During this time I've made a place in this girl's heart and became really close with her but keeping boundaries for I thought my bestie was right for her. \n\nSo everything went well with their relationship, until they started fighting for everything and I cannot stress this enough, EVERYTHING was a good reason to fight, and me being in the middle of the trouble I had to help bestie and his gf get everything back to normal so I helped her whenever she cried for him and encouraged him to write back, this went on and the relationship was getting nowhere, she was crying almost every day and it broke my heart and he was starting to see other people even though they were still on a relationship, so she found out sooner than later and broke up with him.\n\nThis was for the better since I haven't seen her this happy in months, we text everyday and I encourage her to go out and experience more, to be happy with other people, but this makes my bestie mad since it's not in the \"Bro's Code\" to talk to your best friend's ex, and we've had very bad arguments during this past week for this very subject.

They have 3 kids and one on the way.\n\nAnyway my youngest nephew, who's not even 3 yet, started running a fever. It consisted for a few days and finally on the 4th day of him not getting better my mother finally made a comment that she needed to take him to the doctor. I guess my SIL got him together and took him to the ER and came back with a major attitude. Finally she started going OFF on my mom that she's been talking down to her and treating her like a bad parent and this and that, which my mom doesn't at all. She defends my SIL most of the time.\n\nShe kept making comments that she shouldn't of taken her child to the doctor because: \"I'm his mom, i know this!\" And acting all high and mighty. \n\nAnyway, some intel; When i was 11 or so I broke down with a major headache. It felt like someone was literally beating my head with a hammer and i distinctively remember my mom scoffing about it, saying it was a migraine. She knew it was a migraine. It wasn't until my dad forced her to go to the ER with me that she did. I remember my mom even sitting in the waiting room with me while i threw up blood and bile, saying that it was stupid and it was just a Migraine.\nWell moral of the story is that it turned out I had an AVM which is a rare thing that would of killed me that night.\n\nAnyway i thought about this story and calmly went into the living room and said; \"Hey I have a story\" and both my brother and SIL started going off on me that I don't know shit and to stay out of it, and just being insanely aggressive towards me for even opening my mouth.\n\nSo; Am I the Asshole??

We had none in our house and decided to make an exception for a night in with a friend.\n\nI went to the store and bought, per my husband's request, a 6 pack of our friend's favorite domestic beer and a 6 pack of mixed IPAs with a couple specific brands. I'm not a fan of beer, especially IPAs, so I bought a 6 coolers for myself.\n\nAfter a few hours and drinks later (me: 2, him: 3ish), I enter the kitchen and see him with a cooler, half-gone, in hand. I got mad and we argued.\n\nHis reasoning is that, as a couple that shares everything else, gettong mad at this was petty, and he thought I wouldn't mind because I can't drink all 6 in one night anyway. My reasoning is that I specifically bought that flavor and quantity for me to enjoy; I wanted the leftovers for tomorrow night. AITA?",

      "description": "Now I know how you're expecting this to go, but I promise you it's not what you expect.\n\nSo I have a mate who I used to do everything with, we'd hang out every other night to play games and try new restaraunts etc. But maybe 2 or 3 years ago he got girlfriend who has a LOT of health issues and a daughter of her own, so his free time decreased exponentially, which is understandable, so we don't see each other near as much but I still consider him a friend. \n\nNow throughout these past few years he has missed several special occasions I have invited him too and occasionally leaves me on seen when I invite him out. We've basically become pretty distant over this, and I'll admit I'm a little bitter. \n\nSo with the lore out of the way onto the meat and potatoes. I got him a fairly nice christmas gift since I managed to find something that would be perfect for him. I knew he wouldn't be in a position to get me anything, but this was too perfect to pass up.  I have made several attempts to drop it off at his place, but every time he doesn't get back to me until it's too late. I've told him he can come get it but he hasn't. Now a few days ago I asked if I could drop it off (again) and didn't get a response until much later that night where he told me \"just drop it off with (his girlfriend), she can give it to me.\" \n\nNow for some reason this REALLY irritated me. And I fully acknowledge what I did was petty, but I brought the gift back to the store, returned it and picked up something much much smaller. \n\nNow I can say the odds are 10 to 1 that I AM the asshole but I want to be sure.",

      "description": "Throwaway bc some people in my dorm know my main acct. Formatting may be weird bc I'm on mobile.\n\n\nFor some background, I live in a fairly large dorm room. However, our actual shower/toilet area is very small. So, my roommate and I decided to get one of those extendable rod things to place in the door way of our sink area to create a kind of makeshift dressing room so we don't have to struggle to put on our underwear in our tiny bathroom. Oh, and we're both female.\n\nMy roommate recently started dating this guy, and he's in our dorm pretty much 24/7. I'm rarely in my dorm during the day so I don't care too much. He sometimes sleeps over in her bed, and again, I don't really care either way.\n\nThe only thing I ask of my roommate is that if Im showering, I prefer him to not be in our room, just because Im a fairly private person and don't feel comfortable being naked with what's basically a stranger in my room. \n\nTo her credit, she followed this for a few days, but after a while, I would come out the shower and I would notice that he had entered the room while I was showering. I approached her about it and reminded her of how I felt, and she kind of blew up at me, saying that he wasn't some perv and wasn't trying to see me naked. \n\nI was taken aback, since me and my roommate have never really argued over anything, and I didn't think that what I asked was that unreasonable.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting a guy that I don't really know be in the room as I shower?",

Recently she got a makeover as a surprise to me for our anniversary. She always knew that I had a thing for septum rings.\n\nSo she gets her septum pierced and cut off all her hair. Honestly I don't know what she wanted but she ended up getting a bowl cut which looks funny on her and her septum wasn't impressive either. \n\nI didn't respond and told her she looked good. At night she initiates sex and I'm not too excited. She keeps pestering me and asking me if it was her makeover and I eventually replied yes.

I barely know how to use the stove.\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\n\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room.

      "description": "My sister is a medical intern. Due to this, she doesn't come back until 11:30 at night. Many days, she takes up night duties as well. In my country, there's a common notion against women that they shouldn't be outside at night and they should come early. It's almost devastating that people take so much pride in misogynistic views. Even though girls study and shine in their fields, they're still taken as granted by their parents with comments like \"You're only allowed to work as much as we allow you to.\" , \"Women are weaker so they shouldn't have high hopes or freedom because they're prone to the dangers.\" \n\n\n\nYesterday, my sister came back home at 11:30 and my father went berserk. For him, she being a girl and working late hours isn't a good sign and society doesn't approve of it, so she shouldn't work late. Irrespective of the fact that it's a given schedule for her to be present at that particular time. As for my mom, she'll never go against the norms. She never accepts the possibility of a progressive generation even when we live in a city that chimes with progressiveness. So many of the girls i know or see stay late at nights in the clubs or partying with friends and their parents don't give two shits,not that going to clubs or parties is wrong but atleast they're enjoying it and not working. My sister is a very bright person,she does a lot of work as an intern and for her to be not able to work as much just because my parents don't want her to attend night duties or come late breaks her. \n\n\n\nToday i was having my breakfast when my mom suddenly starts talking about everything saying that my sister should change her behaviour and she should conform with the society. I was frustrated, it's not the first time we're talking about this. I told her that women shouldn't lose their freedom because the society doesn't approve and my father says \"If an ant says it's going to fight against an elephant, it can't. So, your sisters no different.\" I burst out at my father and argued with him, he starts telling me that this is the problem with this generation that we don't understand our faults and we don't understand how society works. \n\n\n\nPeople think so much about the society that they don't even think about their freedom. My father would rather just conform to the society than to support my sister and encourage her to learn and be established. He talks about safety, but is it her fault that we've come to such a bad time that women need to supress their freedom to work, to enjoy life. Now my father's acting like I've hurt him  and he's not even talking to me, he doesn't even care to atleast try to understand my point. Am i really the bad person here? I did what i thought was right. Ofcourse i care about my sister's safety which i why if it's too late, i tell her to book a cab or i just bring her home on my bike. ",

      "description": "Context; there's a freelancer who we hired once before last year and was hired again for these couple weeks. Lets call the freelancer \"DEBBIE\". I never interacted much with Debbie, only spoke to her once or twice; either about where certain things were (e.g. files) or general greetings (Hi, good morning). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday at lunch I basically made nachos, so a side of mince meat and veggies plus a side of corn chips. I'm eating my lunch and it so happens Debbie is sitting right next to me and she reaches for the chips, her hand right inside my bowl on the left side and hovering slightly above the chips. She asks \"Hey is it alright if I have a chip?\" I am mid way through a bite, and I'm sitting with my knees up, bowl on my knees so my face is right in front of the bowl. This makes it so her hand is right in front of my face and in my bowl at the same time, and as I swallow the bite that I was in the middle of eating, she continues, \"Well I'll just take one anyway\" \\*giggles\\*. \n\nI barely muffled a response before she picks one up and puts it in her mouth. I pause, trying to process what happened. And then I realized that this exact situation happened before, last year, when we first hired her. She took a piece of meat from my bowl, again picking at it with her hand right on top of my food and without my response, grabbed it and ate it. Just how like it happened today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like if I had managed to say no, everyone around the table would be wondering why I wouldn't share just one chip. But I was always a big eater; I always bring big lunches not so they could be shared around, but so I could feel full enough to last me through the work day. I've never asked her for a piece of her lunch. I've never as much asked her for a favour, money or anything else. And I've never seen her ask for other people's lunches.

      "description": "Little background. I'm not typically a jealous person, prefer transparency to secrecy, yadda yadda. We started dating not long after she broke up with her ex and I knew all about their connection (college love) and was cool about her taking time to fully \"let go\" as long as she was open about it. I'm on good terms with most of my exes and occasionally bump into them so it's not a big deal for me. Fast forward 4 months(January 2018) and one night she's not responding to calls or texts. I have this weird feeling about it but don't say anything. A few days later we're watching Netflix on her Mac and her text thing goes off on the computer with a text from her ex. Okay, I thought... Whatever. But she got really weird and tried to distract me mid show by kissing me as soon as the chime went off. I hate snooping but we were/are open with each other's phones and I had this nagging feeling something was off. Clicked on the thread later when she wasn't around and looked at the prior day in question and there were consecutive texts leading to midnight then stopped. I had called at 1230 and didn't hear back until almost 2am. So I went into her phone (not proud) and found a 1.5 hr conversation during the time she had said she was \"busy and didn't have her phone\". Brought it up a week later, talked about how it just seemed wrong to hide that from me because I only care if it seems intentional to be secretive about it, she half apologized and we moved on.\n\nShe was really open about their conversations for a couple weeks then stopped saying anything so I figured they must had moved on. Queue us taking a trip together in the summer and on the drive home she was asking me to go through her pictures and favorite some. In doing so I stumble on quite a few saved screenshots of their recent conversations, talking about life and happiness and their future goals and aspirations, friendly for the most part but also emotionally connected at first read. So again I go to the texts and there is nothing there. I confront her in the car right then and she says she saves all kinds of conversations, ours included (she does have some of ours) and it's not a big deal, she deleted the thread because they weren't really talking anymore. All right I guess, still kinda weird but sure, I believe her but conscious of the suspicion growing in my mind.\n\nFast forward to 1 month ago. She's showing me something in her email and her texts are pulled up in a separate window. When she minimized the browser I noticed his name in one of the top slots. She went to the bathroom and left her phone so, guiltily and hesitant I open her phone texts...nothing. I checked her computer again and there are texts from a few days before up to this day. I bring it up a couple days later and she says, \"I deleted them from my phone because I knew it'd make you upset\". This is the moment I got upset and tried to calmly explain just how suspicious that is. After talking in circles and trying to change the subject numerous times she said \"I'm sorry you saw them and it upset you\". I'm not the jealous sort, but this is undermining my trust in her. Queue to this past weekend she goes on a girls trip to the cottage her ex lives in (coincidence). Shows me their itinerary and what not, looks fun ok love you have fun bye! She calls me at midnight on Saturday and we chat about the weekend so far, then in a barely audible whisper she says, \"do you care if I go get coffee with ex\". Im shocked and just say, \"babe I don't know what you expect but I can't give you approval for that. Do what you want to do, it's fine but I'm not going to say I'm okay with it\". That was that, we hung up and didn't really talk until she got home the next day. I was waiting for her to bring it up which she never did until I breached the conversation. After several attempts asking her why she was barely whispering when asking that she said, \"cause [insert friends names] wouldn't have agreed with me going and they were in the next room\". While I did appreciate the honesty about it, I don't know what to think about the whole situation. Am I the asshole for calling her out about this? I told her it's selfish to ask me for approval and asked her to put me in her shoes doing the same thing with my ex.. she said \"it's not the same, you guys didn't date as long\" (which is true, by 6 months). Idk.\n",

      "description": "Basically what happened is about a month ago, my dad and I got in an argument and he hit me. We were arguing about a piece of fudge of his that I ate, I said “I’m glad I ate it” to purposely bug him because I was mad (not proud of it), then he hit me. He hit me on the back, pushed me into a corner, and yelled in my face. He yelled at me to “fuck off”, and keep in mind he’s 6’8. Apparently the real reason for him doing this was that a few weeks before, they were camping and so my boyfriend stayed over for the weekend without them knowing. They say this really broke their trust. \n\nNothing like that has ever happened before, and it’s really affected me. My doctor and therapist both say I’ve been traumatized. My depression and eating disorder, which were in remission, came back solely because of this, I had nightmares, and loud noises would make me freak out and I couldn’t calm down. At one point, I was scared to be in my own home. I moved things in front of the door to have a shower because I thought someone would come in and hit me. As well as this, things would happen like something would drop something near where my art teacher was standing, and my first thought was that my sweet art teacher was hitting someone. \n\nMy dad never really apologized, either. He said “I’m sorry for how this all worked out”, which in my opinion isn’t a really an apology. I also told him, through tears, that he wasn’t realizing how big of a deal what he did is, and to that he said I don’t realize how big of a deal what I did was. My mom wasn’t very supportive through all of it, and my siblings said things like “I see both sides”, and “what you said was disgusting”. I asked my mom if we were just going to brush this under the rug, and she said no, but no one did anything. My dad thinks him promising to not do it again is good enough. My mom said if he had hit her she would definitely leave, but I guess for some reason it’s okay to hit me? \n\nSo anyway, I spent thanksgiving with my boyfriend’s family (I live in Canada so this was mid October), and I want to spend Christmas with his family as well. My doctor said I’d be slighting my family, and if I want a relationship with them I shouldn’t, but I really don’t want to spend time with them like that. Also, I’m 18 if that matters. So, WIBTA?\n\nTL;DR My dad hit me, according to my doctor and therapist this literally traumatized me. Because of this and the lack of support from my family, I want to do what I did for thanksgiving and spend Christmas with my boyfriend’s family. ",

      "description": "I am in an lgbtq support group in my church. It’s very small, mostly my gay friends (females) and myself (a gay female). There is a transgender woman who joined our group, and obviously we were accepting to her and even though she is 20 years older than most of us. we are all in our early twenties and she is 41. She has only been out as transgender for a year, and she does not pass as female. She is 6 foot 4 and very strong. She wears clothes that are too small for her, to where she is quite literally bursting out of them. She is very straight forward and has an aggressive personality. Let’s call her RD. \nThe next week at church, we were in our safety group. One of the leaders passed out prayer request cards for us to write something we are struggling with and give it to someone in the group. RD wrote hers down, and gave it to my friend who we can call A. I overheard an awkward conversation between the two of them but it wasn’t until after church A told me that RD had written her phone number and a note saying “You’re cute, text me” with a winky face. RD also told me that she overheard my parents saying that her and I should date so that “The man inside of her can be released and maybe it’ll scare the gay out of me” which I know is a lie. My parents would never say that. I reached out to our leaders because I felt that it was inappropriate. They told me to reach out to RD myself. I did. \nI told her she was making us feel comfortable with the lying and the forced conversations, as well as making A feel very targeted because she was expecting an innocent prayer request, yet it turned into a cornered awkward situation. She apologized and said she did not mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable. I suggested we strictly talk at the group and not outside of it for now.. \nThe next week, A was discussing her love for poetry and writing slam poems. Days later, RD found her on Facebook and sent her a love poem. I decided that since RD wouldn’t listen to me, I would reach out to her mentor. Her mentor said she would discuss it with her.\n3 days later, A’s twin sister G told me that RD has written on her Facebook wall about how trans women are always being targeted as predators and some more unwanted nonsense in the post. I messaged RD. \nMe- I’m not looking to get into a huge argument over text because that is childish. But there are a few things that I have fact checked and know you are lying about. My parents never said those things about us dating. And you posted on G’s page. We asked you not to. \nRD- You called me a liar!! Trans women are constantly being threatened for just existing. I’m fucking done! You and the twins can go to hell!\n\ntl;dr - a trans woman joined my lgbtq group and made everyone uncomfortable so I had her leave the group. \n",

      "description": "So I went to the hairdresser today. It was the best rates hairdresser in my region and because I wanted to bleach my brown hair really light blonde or silver I thought it would be better to go to a good hairdresser then to burn my hair off my head. \n\nI looked up the prices beforehand and found that they charge 20-90€ for dye treatment. Since it isn't the first time I got my hair professionally dyed, I decided that the price was fair and I would make an appointment. My hair is really short at the moment so I thought that it would probably be not 90€ but more like 30-50. \n\nWhen I came in and explained what kind of color I wanted to do, they were really friendly and helpful and the hairdresser explained that they would turn orange if they just bleached them because my natural hair color has some warm undertones. So she recommended that she'd do a lot of highlights and they would lift evenly and not be orange or yellow. She told me that I would have to come in again and it wouldn't be perfect right away but I would soon have the color I desired. \n\nSo I agreed because I thought that it was my only option and the result would be similar to what I intended. I trusted her because she was the professional. \n\nFast forward 4 hours and I see my hair for the first time. It was not at all what I intended it to be. I (20) look like a woman that just got grey hair. Some spots are yellow some are grey and some are white - and of course there is a lot brown left. I didn't know how to react because she and her manager both recommended that technique and told me how good it looked. \n\nShe then continued to style it and give me products to try/buy that would make the hair color stay and keep the hair healthy. So I was baffled and agreed to buy them. She then told me that I should pay 230€. That's waaaaay more than I expected and I was so perplex that I just payed. \n\nWhen I came home I realised how dumb it was and I saw how bad the color looked. My boyfriend now wants to go back there and return the products and maybe try to refund me/get an explanation why it's so expensive. \n\nBut I feel like it was kind of my own fault. I obviously didn't understand the procedure completely and agreed to pay so much money. I'm also in college and that amount of money really hurts to loose. \n\nSo am I the asshole when I want my money back? ",

      "description": "We were driving. I took out my phone and she objected to me being on it while driving (And rightly so) so I put the phone down and asked her to read the message to me. She was reading wrong, (read my messages as if they were from the other person and read their messages as if they were from me) and it confused me so I told her to give me the phone back (I was going to just put it in my pocket where it belongs) and she refused due to her assumption that I was going to try to read the messages while driving. I repeated my request to give me my phone back and she held it away from me so I reach over and grabbed it and put it away. She was pissy about it and I told her if she had just listened to me i wouldn't have had to grab it from her. I told her she made a mistake by assuming the worst of me instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt. She swears up and down that she made no mistake and that she is completely innocent of any mistakes. She said I set her up to misinterpret the situation. My point is that even if did mistakenly set her up to think I would read my phone while driving, wouldn't that have no affect on weather or not she made a mistake assuming I would. Isn't that still a mistake? It's petty. It's the most petty. I still want her to admit that she made a mistake. I admit that I made a mistake by not clarifying for her but now she is still adamant that she made no mistake. She never admits fault. Not for anything. Not until after a huge fight and tears and storming off, which she is currently in the middle of, and finally calming down to realize she was mistaken. How do I get her to step back in the moment and see what's going on instead of waiting until after a huge blow up?",

      "description": "My mom lives about four hours away and is coming in town with her husband for my birthday. My mother and I have always had a strained relationship, and she is not welcome in the home I share with my sister because my sister wants nothing to do with her.\n\nI see my mom about once a month, maybe every two months if I can’t get time off to go visit her. However, when she comes into town, I am expected to drop everything and spend all my time with her. \n\nWe are supposed to be getting a bad snow storm here over the weekend, and my state is notorious for taking poor care of the roads in a snow storm. I warned her that if the roads are bad, I would not want to drive to the hotel she is staying at and spend all day in their hotel room playing card and board games. She is still planning to come out despite the snow storm, and thinks that I should be willing to drive to their hotel since it’s only a few miles away.\n\nIf somehow this storm isn’t as bad as predicted, I will spend time with her, but I also would like to see my friends that want to go out for my birthday. But she thinks I should be spending my time with her since we don’t see each other often.\n\nSo Reddit, am I just being a selfish asshole here?",

      "description": "I'm from America but live in Australia and invited my good friend and ex boyfriend out to come stay with me rent free for up to a year on a visa. For some background, he was figuring out what he wanted to do with his life and had never traveled much. I told him that he could figure out his life and study for the MCAT anywhere, so he might as well come someplace beautiful and hang out with me. We had dated very seriously for 2 years about 6 years ago and we've been very close for the past 4 years. He got excited about spending time with me and exploring Australia and agreed to come out. We were just friends at the time, but were flirting heavily. We both knew it was a temporary situation since he couldn't stay here for more than a year, so we set some ground rules. We agreed to be exclusive while he was living with me, but that it wasn't going to be a forever thing. Basically, we said that if we were sleeping together, we weren't going to pursue other people. And I told him that we could either just be friends or we could be together, but I felt uncomfortable with him flirting with and sexting other women while sleeping with me. You can see where this is going. About 6 months into his staying with me, he's on his laptop and gets a sext from some girl. I'm sitting next to him so I see it and ask about it. He slams the laptop shut and denies anything. I get suspicious and press him for more info about her. He gets angry and says to mind my own business and it doesn't involve me. So, I, very shittily, look through his facebook messages one day when he left his laptop out and see that he's been flirting with several women the entire time he's been living with me, including with a girl who flew to my city to meet up with him. So he's been lying to me for 6 months. He knew I would not want to continue sleeping with him if i knew about his side chicks. So he hid them and continued to have sex and be romantic with me. But he swears he never had sex with anyone else, even the girl who saw him here. I tell him I never want to speak to him again and ask him to leave my place. I give him 2 weeks to make other arrangements. But it's hard because I know he doesn't have a lot of money and he will have to stay at an Airbnb or cheap hotel. And he has to book a flight back to America which will be expensive. So, I feel bad. For snooping and for kicking him out. He swears he never cheated on me, it was just flirting. But he knew I would have chosen to stop sleeping with him if I knew, and I feel like that decision was taken from me. I just feel disrespected and a little violated.\n\nAlso, he never paid rent or anything and my name is the only one on the lease if that helps. He paid me 100 bucks once for all the extra utilities, but that doesn't come close to covering it. It was just a gesture since he is kind of broke. He's a good guy otherwise. He just doesn't seem to respect me very much. But am I overreacting? Am I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR: my ex boyfriend came to live with me in Australia from America. I snooped on his laptop after I saw that he received a sext and he acted shady. He's been flirting with many women. I gave him about 2 weeks to move out. He's pretty broke and it will cost him a lot to rent a place and buy a flight back to America.",

      "description": "Hi all. This is a bit more complicated than it may seem, and may be confusing for a lot of people, including me! I’ll do my best to explain, let me know if I need more clarity. Fake names, obviously.\n\nI have four best friends: Lisa, Tara, Sophie, and Jane, and the five of us are very incestuous. Our larger social circle is too, because we go to a small school and are all in a particular clique, ya know? Not many options. For example, 4/5 of us have dated Sam, and 4/5 of us have dated Bill, with only 2/5 of us not having dated both, but all of us at least one. Again, incestuous and messy but we make it work. It’s never been a problem until now.\n\nI’ve dated this one guy twice before, let’s keep calling him guy A. Lost my virginity to him, all that jazz. As of recently, I’ve started talking to him again and we decided to let loose and have a FWB sort of thing before graduation. Sidenote: Sophie and Lisa are doing the same thing with Bill- very senior thing to do, FWB triangle, right? So I figured talking to Sam again was harmless and less messy than the situation with Bill. So I went for it!\n\nOut of nowhere, this is a problem. My closest friend out of the five, Jane, is devastated. She says she’s loved him all of high school and was heartbroken the first two times we dated, but now it’s even worse for some reason. I told her that her feelings matter more than a casual relationship with a guy, and I’ll always value her more than any penis. I guess I was being deceitful here, because while I mean that, I’m continuing to see him. She cried when she heard about us going on a date, but Sam does not have any interest in her and she claims that she could never be in a relationship with him again (doubtful, but still.) \n\nSophie and Lisa both “side” with me that I’m not doing anything wrong, Tara has taken to talking shit about me, calling me horrible things (not very out of character for her, but it’s gotten so bad that teachers are noticing and talking to me about it.) I firmly believe that only Jane gets an opinion, and that Tara is out of line for being intentionally rude to me and humiliating me in public.\n\nIt’s causing more strife that I won’t get into. Me and Sam like each other, and it isn’t fair that I have to end it because Jane is jealous or sad. But it’s also not fair that I continue to see him while my friend is being hurt. It’s such a messy, gross situation and I hope a neutral party can tell me who’s being the asshole here! I don’t want to stop talking to him as it’s helping me through a breakup that really fucked me over (see my embarrassing throwaway history), but I don’t want to hurt my friend. ",

      "description": "My friends and I have a bar we always go to. Since the beginning I’ve always told which ever bartender who was there to charge my bill separately from my group. The reason I said that is because I’m the only one in the group that tips. Now, the reason I do that is because no one else wants to tip…they leave all the tip up to me. \n\nIt’s a spot that my friends and I always frequent. My bill usually comes out to $10 and I always give $35 (so they can get a $25 tip) the people I’m with, as I said, depend on me to leave the tip which I always do even though they don’t contribute to the tip. They get upset because my bill comes out lower but I’ve always said “chip in on tip for them” or “leave them something on your behalf”. \n\nMy friends never listened, so when we go to the bar no matter how many drinks I get they charge me a certain amount (usually $10.00) . For my friends they charge them everything fully. \n\nMy friends asked me to speak to the bartender about it and the bartender said to me “I look out for people that look out for me”. \n\nI said ‘cool, no problem brother’.  That to me indicates that I gave him enough tip for him to not worry about me. But my people did not tip him. And then when they got their bill in full and they started bitching at me for it. \n\nSo reddit am I the asshole for anything that went down? The most I asked from the group was a dollar a piece so we can tip him as a group and I’ll tip the rest. \n\nOne of my friends even said to me one time “ this is my money. You’re not going to tell me to tip someone if I don’t want to because it’s my money”\n\nAm I wrong for telling the bartender to give me a separate bill from my friends?\n\n\nAlso P.S I’m drunk but I hope you guys understand whhere I’m coming from and what I’m trying to say.

I went along with it because I didn't think too much of it. \nAt that point, she confessed her love to me. But obviously I found this situation way too weird and proceeded to ghost her. \nFast forward to a couple of months later, she adds me on alternative Snapchat account. After about 2 weeks of contemplation, I decided to just accept her request to see what she wants to say. \nSurprisingly she didn't talk about anything that happened thus far. I told her that I blocked her on her other accounts so why did she make a new one: apparently she had forgotten the password and it wasn't just to speak with me. \nShe then told me \"if you don't want to speak with me just tell me, when we play games I won't talk either\". At this point, I felt really bad- she was so desperate to be friends with me it seemed, saying \"I understood her \" and I'm one of her best friends. Maybe this was all just a guilt trip, but I decided to trust this person. She was a foreigner and just wanted a friend- what could be so bad about that right?

      "description": "Full disclosure, what I did today was shitty, and I think I'm the asshole. But I want to know how egrigious what I did was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work as a tub refinisher, and I'm currently just a helper. My coworker is out of town for today and tomorrow, so I was sent in to a site, to strip the paint off some tubs. Keyword being \"some.\" They expected me to not even finish one today, and the job is for multiple tubs in an apartment complex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go in, I end up getting there about an hour late (underestimated the drive) at 09:00, and get to work after talking to the client. As I'm getting my stuff set up in the vacant apartment, to gauge how long it'll take me, he says he'd rather have me start in the occupied one, since the people were asked to leave the place while I'm stripping (\"fumes\" and all that.) I agree, and haul my tools over to there and get set up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome complications arise, and I end up going until 13:30 or so. He comes in and asks if I want to start working on the vacant one. I didn't, and I said I was going to get going, since hauling my tools would take a while. He kept asking, but I repated that I was going to get going. By the time I had everything hauled into the vacant room, it was around 14:00, and I wanted to get going. He asked again, and I said I'd be here at the proper time tomorrow, explained how because I did one today, now everything was fresh in my mind and I would be faster as a result, how I'm only scheduled until 15:00, and how I wouldn't even be doing much if I stayed. He stopped asking at that point, and we said goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, yeah, I don't really have a good reason for leaving an hour early. I could have stayed and worked on stuff until it was time to go, but I didn't. \n\nI do have shallow reasons for not wanting to stay, like how his periodic checking in on me, and watching me work, made me uncomfortable, and how the vacant apartment was where he was working, but I don't really think that excuses what I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly just want to know how shitty what I did was, and if I should be concerned about it.",

      "description": "This is pretty fresh as it's basically like nuclear fall out in this ski cabin were staying at and I'm just trying to hide out. Whether or not I'm the asshole will definitely affect how I approach the weekend. There are 12 of us sharing this huge airbnb house close to a major ski resort. Some of us got here Thursday, everyone else Friday. Thursday me and this girl \"Angela\" were two of the first to arrive. I've had a FWB thing with her for almost 2 years now. We've had sex a few times but more often it's just heavy making out. We had a massive make out session on Thursday while we still had a private room. \n\n\nFriday, everyone else arrived and Angela basically kicked me out of the master bedroom because she and two other girls were going to share it. No problem. So last night everyone got really drunk and I needed to pee and the other bathroom was occupied. I knocked on Angela's door and when she heard it was me she gave me this very seductive but probably joking \"commmme in....\" and said I could use the bathroom. \n\n\nShe was sitting on the bed with this other named \"Jenny\" and it appeared to be just talking, but Jenny was in a robe. They both said hello and asked me to make sure the bedroom door was closed, so they absolutely knew I was in the room. I went to pee, but was in there for probably 15/20 minutes texting and looking at Instagram. \n\n\nI came out and they were in full on make out mode. Jenny's robe was open, Angela had her sweater and her bra pulled up over her chest and she was just in her underwear. I mean full on girl in girl make out session. Angela was on \"top\" and kind of looked over at me and smiled and I was like \"holy shit! jackpot...they must have been waiting on me!\"  \n\n\nSo I got down to my underwear, pulled them down in the front and went over and started kissing and rubbing all over Angela. The both freaked the fuck out. Like I mean FREAKED out so bad that the rest of the party came to check on them as if someone had broken in the window. They kicked me out of the room without my pants, so to the rest of the party goers I looked even worse as I'm standing there in my raggety boxer briefs while Jenny was openly crying in behind the door. \n\n\nJenny said she felt so unsafe with me in the house she went home. Angela is beyond pissed and called me an asshole among other things. The other 9 people are my close friends and there's sort of a spectrum of \"well everyone was drunk and nothing really happened\" to \"I can never trust you again and want you to leave.\" \n\n\nIt's 6:10AM as a I write this and I need to make a decision whether I should just leave for the benefit of the group or if I should try to make the best of it. \n\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "A while back, a buddy of mine (not a close friend by any means) blocked me and ignored my texts out of nowhere. Mind you, this is right after I did him a huge favor for free using my professional skills. Turns out the girl he was dating was jealous or whatever. We have never been romantically involved or even flirtatious in any way.\n\nI was totally appalled and wrote him off. Dude is in his mid-20’s, not a teenager. That’s a terrible way to treat someone who’s been nothing but kind to you. \n\nMonths and months later he reached out to say he’d “been manipulated” blah blah blah and tried to rekindle our friendship. I ignored the message. He tried again and I ignored that, too. I didn’t feel I had any obligation to respond.\n\nToday he hits me with “My dad died last night, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me”.\n\nI’ll be honest. I was totally disgusted. Leveraging your own father’s death to guilt someone you weren’t even that close to into rekindling a friendship they’ve made it abundantly clear they don’t want? But people can act oddly when grieving, I get that. Still can’t help feeling repulsed and manipulated.\n\nI have not yet replied but was thinking of simply saying that he had my condolences for his loss, but that I was uninterested in rekindling our friendship. TBH I’m in a foreign country on an emergency visit to see a dying relative of my own. As terrible as it sounds, I have no desire to listen to this guy cry about his loss right now. I feel he absolutely should be leaning on his family or closer friends at this time. \n\nI have no desire to pile hurt on a person who just lost a parent. That’s tough stuff. But I can’t help but feel really skeeved and frustrated and backed into a corner.\n\nAm I the asshole, here? ",

      "description": "So, to explain what happened. My boyfriend asked me to play this \"new\" game, and I did. I bought it, despite having limited money, got on and played with him. The first game I ever played, we played together, and I enjoyed it up until he called me a bitch jokingly, but we worked that part out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, we decided to play the game again, and without knowing, I'm against him. So the whole time, I'm asking him where he is, and what's going on and why everyone is acting funny. He just told me that they were bots. So I start going through the game, and I see him dying, and I ask where he is, and he said he's spectating me. I had NO idea he was on the enemy team trying to kill me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm standing in this one spot, and I start to freak out. I don't like when anything (not even bots) relying on me. I don't have any weapons, I'm very damaged, and I'm lost. I ask him to start playing the game with me, and that's when he says he's playing the game. I was clueless that there was a way for him to be on the enemy team, and I said \"I don't see you!\" and he runs in and attacks me, and my bots help me, continuously he says he's in the game. It didn't click until he super excitedly yelled. \"THERE! See! You just killed me! Good job baby!\" and then I realized\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't playing with him. I was playing against him, which I hate doing because he's super competitive. If we're winning, he gets pissed off and yells we need to give him a break because it's not fair. He'll leave the game entirely if he's losing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on with the first game, and I told him countless times I didn't like it, I don't know where I'm going, I'm still new to this, go easy. He would start complaining that I need to learn SOMEHOW, and that's how. I don't want to play a game against someone that's just going to try their hardest against a noob! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, he says, \"Give it a try!\" and I did, and I lost. He sat there and said I did good, I hardly got to the halfway point. I honestly wanted to cry. So, it was my turn to kill him. I didn't understand the characters, and he was just trying to make me understand. I appreciated that, but there was a hidden motive, he would ask me what character, so that he could kill me. He, of course, won that, and proceeded to the next map as the surviving few, again. I was stuck playing this shit I didn't understand. This is when he started making comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why can't you just play this?\" \"I don't get why you don't like it!\" \"Of course, why would you ever like something that isn't walking in a straight line killing things.\" \"If you don't want to play it, just leave.\" Later on, I didn't even spawn in, I sat at the beginning and let bots kill him. He decided to leave the game, not tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not enjoying playing this game mode against him? It was my second time playing it, I have a total of 94 minutes, and 150 + hours. ",

Me and B actually hit things off very well and we became good friends, arguably had a better initial connection than what I had with A.   \n\n\nA and B's relationship started getting rocky and they went through a year of getting back together and breaking up (probably like 3 times), and on the last time they broke up, I decided to sit down and have a serious talk about everything with A. A few conversations and a joint later, we were making out and exploring our sexual tension for the first time. We also cared about each other a lot, so we were exploring the possibility of a relationship; this was, however, behind friend B's back. Friend B caught wind that something was up, but didn't really say anything. Fast forward about a week later, me and A decided that a relationship couldn't be a thing and we decided to stop it. I immediately went to B and explained all the awkwardness and everything that had gone on. I recognized everything that I had done wrong and encouraged B to voice any concerns or hurts that they had, though B didn't really say much.   \n\n\nAbout 3 days after that, I left on a plane for work and wasn't going to return home for about 6 months. Once I touch ground, I get a long, cruel, delusional message from friend B saying that I was scum (among other things) and that he couldn't believe that I lied to him, even though I sat him down and told him everything. Is there something that I should've or shouldn't have done? Cos I feel like I did everything that I should have, or that I would have wanted if this had happened to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

Everything was nice and quiet over the summer. Over the last month, the neighbor who has property backing up to our yard has been making a lot of noise. They have about an acre of land that butts up to our back yard, and it appears that they have decided to turn it into a race track. They have been driving laps, and revving their engines for what feels like 15 minutes at a time straight (honestly, it's probably only 3-5). \n\nNow, none of this would be that serious of an issue, if it was happening at normal hours. They are doing all this between 8pm and like 3am, even during the week. I'm a light sleeper, so them doing all of this is waking me up, or keeping me awake. \n\nWhen we were looking at the house and property, there were no signs of them using the yard as a race track. Am I the asshole for wanting to have the cops talk to them about the noise at odd hours? We keep to ourselves, so we have never met, or even seen who these neighbors are, so I would prefer to not confront them directly. \n",

BM seemed like a nice guy at first, but now I just completely thinks he sucks. He's kinda fat and a little short but that's really not the problem. My main problem with him is his hair. His hair is disgusting. It's shoulder length and it's really messy. Like for real, it looks like he never brush them or even clean them. It's the most tangled hair i've ever seen in my life. It also looks like he has lice since he scratches his scalp really hard. We tried to tell him that his hair is kinda disgusting but he just told us that he has metal hair (he's a big fan of metal band). His hair is really not nice and he doesn't want to do anything about it.\n\nThe other problem that I have with him is his attitude. He has the \"I'm better than everybody else\" attitude. I didn't know it at first but now I know. The first day of school, I was in a class with a world map and he was looking at the map so I decided to join him to talk about the Countries and stuff like that ( I like Countries dont judge me). He was interesting and we talk a bit before the class ended, but that's when he started being kinda obsessed with me. We were almost always in the same class so he would come to my desk and talked to me, even if I already was having a conversation and it was really annoying. I'm the silent type so I'm always listening to music so people don't talk to me but he didn't get the hint. If I saw him walking towards me, I would try to join my other friend on the other side of the class so he would leave me alone, BUT HE WOULD FOLLOW ME!!!! And even if he wanted to talk to me, it would just be some awkward greetings and him just expecting me to continue talking. Like I don't want to talk to you.\n\nAlso, I love kpop. Judge me all you want, I don't care. So this one time, me and some of my friends were talking about music and BM was there and he wanted to talk, but not a normal talk, just him shitting on our music. He LOVES metal and he want everyone to know it. He literally said that \"kpop and other music isn't musically stimulating enough for him\" like bitch shut the fuck stop shitting on the things I love!\n\nAnyways, me and my friends always bitch him because we fucking hate him and I don't know if I'm the asshole for doing so even if he's kinda a bitch.",

One girl (who was apparently 11) gets close to the guy and gets shoved back. She comes at him again, and the guy punches her to the ground. The guy would later be arrested and charged with assault. \n\nNow, I'm not gonna defend the girls. They seemed like rowdy ruffians who weren't going to relent in harassing the guy, and *something* had to be done to get them to back off. I also don't think it was fair that the guy was charged but the girls, to my knowledge, got off scot-free, when they were clearly partaking in some sort of harassment.\n\nThat being said, I somewhat feel that the guy's punch was somewhat disproportionate to the situation. As someone pointed out in the comments, the guy's original shove did a relatively good job of pushing the girl back, and I feel like the guy could have just stuck to that strategy. From what I understand, punches have the potential to be devastating, causing injuries, brain damage, and so on. The fact that this guy (who by virtue of biology is likely stronger than the girls here) punched out an eleven year old just seems a little excessive. \n\nNow, I get that people do things in the heat of the moment. If my loved ones were being harassed, I'd probably wind up doing something similar. But people seem to be entirely justifying the man's actions, with some going as far to say that he did absolutely no wrong and cracking jokes about the punch, and I disagree with that. If the consensus was \"The man did something excessive to protect his family, and that's understandable in the heat of the moment,\" then I think I'd be in more agreement, but the consensus seems to be that the guy was completely justified. \n\nI've been discussing this with one or two people and have been told that by thinking the guy's actions may have been excessive, I am enabling and defending harassment. I disagree with that, but the group consensus seems to disagree with me. Am I being the asshole here, by thinking this guy went a little far in the heat of the moment? ",

I’ve asked every few weeks in person and in text with her responding ‘oh yes sorry I’ll return it soon’ without ever following through. \n\n\nI know it would be easy to just buy a new one but I didn’t want to when I knew the one I lent her was basically full. I got burnt on spring break and wanted to use it but she was out of town so I couldn’t get it back. I am really irritated at this point and have asked for it 3 times since then (about a month). \n\n\nFinally I decided to say in group message, “Hey X! Do you think you could return my aloe!!!” And she responded “Hey AnnaKTrenika I’ll get right on it!” Two days later it was on my counter. I do feel bad about calling her out in front of everyone and I know it probably made me look petty but I think if you borrow something it should be promptly returned. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I have a close friend Bob. We've been friends for almost a decade. We live in the same city now. Since we've not always been together our friend circles have evolved separately. While we live separately we meet every day after work and have dinner together (a fact most of our common friends are aware of). He introduced me recently to a childhood friend of his (John Doe) whom I've met a couple times in social gatherings. John is about to have a baby and he with his wife were planning for a baby shower and looking for venues. On Bob's idea, John and his wife visited my apartment to checkout our Clubhouse as a potential venue and decided to book it for their event. \n\nThis week I invited John to checkout the clubhouse so they can plan their event in more detail which they couldn't do the first time. John and his wife decided to come over to check it out on Tuesday. I invited them to dinner at my house which they gladly accepted. I mentioned about this invitation to Bob when I met him on Monday. Bob was non sure if he should join but I insisted he should. He did not protest my insistence. On Tuesday John decided to move the meeting to Wednesday. I mentioned this to Bob on Tuesday to which his response was not noteworthy/neutral.\n\nOn Wed when I talked to Bob, he asked if John knew Bob would be at my house for the dinner. It never occurred to me to mention this to John since I assumed he wouldn't mind if Bob was around for dinner since he is close to Bob. I also assumed he would be more comfortable if Bob was around since this would be the first time me and John (with his wife) would meet in a close setting.\n\nBob decided not to show up to the dinner because he was not comfortable with the fact that John wasn't aware that Bob would join for the dinner. We had an argument the next day about social norms in general and that if I am inviting someone for dinner they should be aware who else is around.\n\nBob's point of view:\n\n* He is not comfortable joining for dinner if the other guests are not aware he is going to be around since it feels like he is crashing a party.\n* I should not assume what people are comfortable with and make an effort to be transparent.\n\nMy point of view :\n\n* Bob and John are close and it was Bob's idea for John to checkout the clubhouse in my apartment to rent.\n* John has a general idea of Bob's routine and that we meet daily.\n* Bob had 2 days to let me know his feeling instead of throwing a tantrum on the day we were supposed to meet.\n* It's my house. I am the one inviting people for dinner. Do I really need to go into details of what social constraints people are comfortable with?\n* I think as long as I know two people are on talking terms (not even close friends) I don't really need to try and inform the details of the social setting they are getting into.\n* To top it all off, the first question John's wife asked me 10 mins after they arrived, Why's Bob not around and when would he come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I absolutely hate being late because it makes us look bad and makes my blood boil. I'm always barely on time for work because of her. I am the one who wakes up first and then wakes her up. I always wake her up 1 1/2 hours to 1 hour to give her plenty of time. Now whether or not she stays up is also a problem. Im constantly have to re wake her up and I end up yelling at her because I'll wake her up five or six times and she still won't get up and get ready. Like yesterday for example I had to work at 4 o'clock. I wake up and get her up about 11. She then tells me we have to go to the doctor. And we've had to go many times in the past and she know it takes a very long for us to get in and get our. Well we went and by the time we got there it was around 1:30-2 o'clock. Well we ended up staying until 5:30 and I was 2 hours late to work. This morning I yelled at her because we have to get a tire changed and I work at 1 o'clock and we still haven't left yet. I yelled at her and she started crying because this has become a daily occurrence. I've tried talking with her and it doesn't work. \n\nTl;Dr. My girlfriend makes us constantly late.

Throwaway acct. but here it goes.\n\nMy spouse and I currently live on our own in our house and we’re 26 years old and expecting our first child this week.\n\nMy sibling (16) is still living with our mutual parent. I have never gotten along with our mutual parent as I personally feel they’re a hypocritical pile of shit and a terrible excuse for a parent. Always on her phone, does what she wants at all times with no real thought for the kid, and basically shows no attention to the kid regardless of what the kid wants. Nothing has changed since my sibling has been there\n\nMy sibling has some mental problems (bipolar disorder, depression, and a learning disability) that mean realistically sibling should have been given more attention than a normal kid, let alone, the attention they were given\n\nSo basically, sibling got caught liking a person of the same sex a state away and my parent freaked out. Calling sibling a demonic spirit and going extremely over the top with their conservative views under attack. Parent threatening to put sibling in a group home. And sibling therefore has spiraled into a bad spot.\n\nSibling wants to live with me and realistically I know it would be in their best interest because of the situation their in. But frankly, I hate the parent, and the sibling is frankly not very well equipped to handle a job or really any legitimate task due to being taken out of school. But I really don’t want that responsibility of taking care of a child that’s not mine and everything that comes with it, on top of having my own child otw. \n\nSo I feel like garbage, because I’m sure I’m being selfish, but I also feel like it’s not my responsibility in the first place. I was hoping parent 2 would step up (parents are divorced) but I think they are in the same boat I am in (which I think is bullshit because it’s their kid).\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to put myself and my wife through taking care of my sibling on top of my own child despite the fact that my siblings mental well being would be in a much better place if I did.\n\nAlso this is my first post here so I’m sure I’m missing things that would make judgement easier, just let me know.",

Things are settled down for everyone now and I really want him back, but now they’re saying they’re too attached to let him go and they don’t think it’s fair for me to take him. \n\nThey’ve spent more time with him than I have at this point but I’m still his “person”- if I’m there, I’m the one he follows around and listens to, he gets stressed when I leave, etc... People have suggested him splitting time between us since we only live an hour away from each other, which I wouldn’t mind doing except that any time he’s stayed with me and then goes back to them, he’s standoffish with them for the first few hours and growls at them if they pick him up, which makes me think the back &amp; forth is too stressful for him to do all the time. I also think he needs classes/training for things like that growling issue, but they don’t see it as a problem because he’s generally a super friendly dog, and little.\n\nAnyway, on the one hand I do feel really horrible for wanting to take him away, and for being in a position where they needed to take him in the first place. On the other hand, I really miss my dog and I don’t think it would be a detriment to him to come back with me since I’m the one he’s still most attached to and I would be taking him to class and watching his diet more than they do (but they have a huge yard while I live in the city, and they take good care of him overall so it’s not like I’m saying they suck). \n\nI really hate that the situation is what it is and I know I’m lucky they were willing to help me with him... but I also don’t want this to mean I just don’t have a dog now and that any time I do get to see him he freaks out when I leave. \n\nAITA for wanting to take him back?",

Ive seen a suprising number of memes/jokes today about how annoying tall people in movie theaters or concert venues are, and I get it, nobody wants to be behind a giant head the whole show. But, as a 5'11\" woman, I paid for my ticket too! The groups ill be in typically choose our seats, and particularly at concerts - I want to see the stage. I have poor eyesight and dont want to miss out on what I paid for just because im tall. Over the years ive had plenty of comments and dirty looks, and while Im generally very accommodating to polite people, Im going to a show later in the week and Im dreading the 'can you scoot down?' that im sure I'll get from the row behind me.

      "description": "Okay so I've known this friend for about 3 or so years and its been more of sometimes I'm friends with him sometimes I'm not. A couple months ago he sent me what I would call a weird fetish but if he likes that I can't judge him anyways he \"accidentally\" sent me that on my phone (link to a video from Youtube I'm pretty sure its deleted) Anyways I thought it was weird and asked a couple close friends for advice and they said to not be his friend but the thing is that I always feel bad when I tell him I would like to stop being friends for a while because he gets pushed around a lot because of his past (I don't know what he did and they won't tell me)  Also he used to tell me to look at creepy things while we were at school for spring break, its an afterschool program and my parents wouldn't let me get out of it so I just went to it and there he was in some discord for hentai and porn which he would always tell me to look at while I was trying to do work the teacher assigned to us. (I was mainly just reading stories on don't sleep which definitely is not what our teacher assigned to us but still) I tried to tell him he was gonna get caught and I tried to tell him that we shouldn't be friends many times but each time I just felt too bad for him. He also talks a lot about hentai which I don't know how to feel about, I get it that I shouldn't judge him but if he doesn't want me to judge him then he shouldn't tell me about all his sexual fantasies. I was thinking about telling some people about what hes done to me. I've already told some people and they said that if I feel annoyed and he won't stop I should but I keep feeling bad for him. I'm thinking of showing ALL the proof I have of the stuff he does to me. I have text messages which he sent to me which I could easily show but a person who overheard me and my friends talking said that said that since it happened a while ago I should just forget about it but he still continues to lie. To be honest I think he lies because he has nothing interesting to say because he went to some \"party\" which he told me what happened and I realized he literally copied it from reddit. Once I was serious that if he keeps on lying to me then I would stop being his friend but he told me it was a lie. Today hes saying that its the truth and its getting really annoying. There is also this whole thing where he broke some kids phone and his parents/he refuse to pay for it so the kids friend is trying to fight him and I also know the kids friend. If he fights him he will get hurt since he can't run for long since he has asthma so that added to my guilt of thinking of not being his friend. If I do tell people then obviously I wouldn't be his friend anymore so I don't know what to do. If I'm not his friend then my friend will fight him and hurt him which I feel bad about so is there anyone who thinks I should stop being friends with him and take revenge?",

      "description": "Okay so a bit more detail on this... let’s start with who drunk me really is. I have two drunk personas:\n\n1. Touchy - I’m super affectionate but really strict on consent when I’m drunk. I won’t even hug you until I’ve asked at least 2 times if it’s okay. But I also get really horny, so I usually just rub one out if I’m not drinking with someone I’d have sex with sober. \n\n2. Crying - I cry easily when I’m drunk but that’s usually when I’m going through a rough patch.\n\nLife is pretty good so I know that he’ll probably encounter touchy drunk. And to make this very clear I do want to have sex with him, but every time we are together and get the chance I get super nervous for some reason. This usually doesn’t happen, I’m usually really comfortable with sex and initiating it is easier than boiling pasta to me. \n\nWe have had sex before, but he initiated it and it hasn’t happened since. And there’s been two or three chances in between.\n\nSo to give myself a little courage and to let drunk me do her thing, I was thinking about drinking a bit the next time we meet. Not to the level of black out drunk, I’m talking 5 shots max (I’m a big girl with a pretty okay alcohol tolerance). A lasting buzz and a boost in confidence is all I need.\n\nI’d definitely stop if he didn’t like it. It’s happened before, I didn’t purposefully get drunk that time but the person I initiated the sexual encounter with wasn’t into it and I stopped immediately.\n\nSo WIBTA If I used alcohol to help me initiate the sexual encounter?",

      "description": "So I play in a band with three other people. We’ve only been at it for about a month or two, so a lot of our songs are still being fleshed out and worked on. Due to schedule conflicts, we typically only get to practice two or three days out of a week. Initially, we practiced in the singer’s house, but moved to mine after we started getting noise complaints. \n\nToday, a person who is friends with the bass player and the drummer decided to come to practice after they invited him the previous night. They didn’t ask me before hand, but I normally have no problems with this. I invite one of my friends to come over occasionally, and he will just sit and talk without interrupting too much. \n\nBut this guy kept getting on my nerves. He started off by offering to “mix” our amps to try and get things to sound better. But really he just turned everything up and made it sound like shit. Then he kept trying to make suggestions on how the drummer should play at one part, but it didn’t sound good or make sense. He even said he could play drums, but once he tried it was obvious that he couldn’t. Ultimately he just wasted our practice time and everyone else seemed fine with it. \n\nIt was really getting on my nerves though. I’m there to practice and get better, and part of that is making the most out of the time that we have.  Eventually, we kind of gave up on practicing and started to jam a little bit. Except he had no idea how to play with other people and instead played over us. The singer and the drummer weren’t into it and started doing something else, as did I after a little while. \n\nEveryone started packing up after about an hour of non sensical jamming and started leaving. On the way out, he went to say bye and asked for my name again for literally the 10th time. I’m not the best with names, but holy fuck man. I literally told you it 15 times and it’s not even like I have a complicated or abnormal name. \n\nAt this point, I feel like inviting people to practice just isn’t productive and just ends up wasting time. But at the same time, the person that I invite occasionally always just sits and listens to the music without distracting. Im considering telling them that I don’t want any other people over unless I give the green light. I mean it’s my house, so I should be able to control who just stops by. ",

And how she doesn’t know how I can afford all these things because I say I’m “broke”. \n\nI’m not broke to the point where I don’t have any money I just have to watch what I’m spending. \n\nL just told me this today because she’s didn’t want to start drama but T basically pushed her to her limits and snapped so L decided to tell me \n\nI don’t really have a relationship with T but the fact that she is going and talking crap about my financial situations to other people isn’t really any of her business.  She also doesn’t know as much about my back ground as L does, and L is basically her only friend on campus. Her boyfriend is in the military so she really doesn’t have anyone. \n\nT is the type of person to try to instigate a situation. For an example I texted L one day while she was still in class and T looked over to her and asked her, are you not texting her back because you don’t like her or something? And L just said no I’m just paying attention to the notes. These are the type of people that make me mad because I thought we would be done with the petty bs in high school, guess not \n\nI really tried not to get pissed  off  by this but T isn’t really close to me and she doesn’t have any business asking other people about MY money that I earned in my opinion. \n\nI told L that I wanted to text her and tell her how I felt but L doesn’t want me too because she wants me to confront her in person which is also a good idea. \n\nAm I am ass hole for just wanting to put her in her place and to tell her she was wrong?\n\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I met through work. She recently broke up with me for understandable reasons. I had been thinking of breaking it off, stopped going over to her house, and stopped making too much of an effort. She (rightfully in my mind) broke up with me. Well, the next couple of weeks she would come over and play sims and drink with me until we got drunk and fucked. Also we agreed to still be \"best friends\". This happened at least three times in two weeks. We are still very good friends and work together too. Well a couple days ago the employees went out to a bar for a little r&amp;r and after the bar closed the closest 5 of us went back to one of the employees houses. Let's call this guy Rick. We all went to Rick's house late late at night. Maybe 2 or 3 in the morning.  I was getting tired and decided to uber home. The ex stopped me and asked if I was okay. I said yeah; just drank too much and am going home. She said okay and I left alone. Well the next morning she invites me to breakfast and I agree. We meet at a taco place and she reveals that she slept with Rick after I left. I tell her it's all good and she is her own person and she can do whatever she wants. Rick also asks me if its okay. Well I am extremely upset and I dont think this is okay at all. I'm mad at both parties and I don't know what to do. Am I the asshole for wanting them to cut it out, or can they date because I broke up with her? \n\nTLDR: girlfriend and I break up, she fucks one of my only co-workers/good friend. I'm upset, but should I be allowed to be? ",

      "description": "Backstory:  A couple months back I was lurking on my local communities' subreddit and was commenting on a post of someone who got a job and would be moving to the area and wanted to low down on apartments/housing/etc.  While I was lurking on that post, I immediately noticed another account that I new for sure belonged to a local friend of mine.  How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?",

She's fairly outgoing and has many friends, some of them are dudes. The thing is, I don't trust her guy friends. I know there's at least one of them that probably wants her, and as such I like to check out her guy friends, to see what they are like, and what their intentions are with her. Just to make sure they don't try to hit on her, or god forbid, actually get her to cheat or some shit.\n\nI'm not threatening, I'm just taking note of them. There was this one guy, who seemed pretty interested in her romantically, and tbh, I don't trust people like him around Jenna. I'm fine with her having lady friends, as long as they don't go too in-depth about me, and the relationship stuff, but I don't see what she's got to do with those other guys TBH.\n\nAnyway, she recently pieced together that a lot of her guy friends have the same story about me, and she got really pissed at me. She said I was \"sexist\", \"controlling\" and \"paranoid\", and needed a day or 2 alone. She's back now, and things are pretty calm, but I still think about that argument. Was she right? Am I an asshole, or controlling or whatever, for making sure her guy friends aren't up to some shit. I just don't trust them, and wanna make sure they are good guys.\n\nAITA?",

He’ll sit on the couch and play video games and he’ll only tend to her while she’s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I’m in the middle of doing something right then, he’ll ask me why I can’t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he’s watching tv and she’s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won’t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We’ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I’ve told him I can’t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI’m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn’t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what’s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he’s upset with me for involving his mother and for “taking a video out of context.” I’m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?",

We have a tradition in our house that no matter what we always go to see the birthday person and wish them HB in person.\n\nMy older sibling who I have an on/off relationship with stated that as they have taken their medication they could not come. They didn't tell me this, they relayed it to a family member.\n\nFor some context I'll refer to my sibling as M. If M is going through anything **you must drop everything and help**. If you're at work, you gotta leave, if you're ill, you gotta get better and go help.\n\nWhen it was M's step children's birthday, they demanded that I come and help with decorations and bring a gift. I had had an operation the day before and was feeling very raw. Despite this, I ran like an idiot looking for gifts that the step kids wanted as my original gift \"wasn't good enough\".\n\nWhen I did arrive, bearing in mind I worked 30 miles away from them, I got berated for being late and wet (I had ran in the rain) and getting their banister wet.\n\nThere are many examples of me having to drop everything to accommodate M.\n\nFast forward to my birthday. I did get a HB wish by text from them. They had called my folks and asked what we were eating and what cake would they be getting (I didn't know this until a week later).\n\nThe assured everyone that they would be here. I get home at 6pm, it gets to about 9.30pm and no one's home. My cousins call and explain their stuck in traffic which I totally understand.\n\nMy cousins get in and explain that M won't be coming as they've taken medication and now they have a headache. I then found out they went to see their partner instead. M has no medical conditions and has a very bad case of \"One up syndrome\". If you're ill, M is halfway through the black plague.\n\nI feel hurt and stupid for expecting anything else. I thought this time they would actually come and change.\n\nAITA for this being the last straw to keep in contact with them?",

We live rent free in a house my mom owns and she has been given a 30 day notice that she will be evicted. I know she has no where to go. I work full time and she works part time but most of her income goes to paying her student loans. Most of my friends and even some of her friends agree that I’m right to kick her out but they think that some of the neglect I’ve been showing her is not right. I’ve stopped buying groceries for 2 and am only shopping for myself now. She can afford some food but there are times when she goes to sleep hungry. I’ve also stopped giving her rides to and from work. Her job is a 25 minute walk from the house. She gets out at 11:30 pm and even when we were dating I would usually have to stay up and be tired just to go get her. There was one instance in which I refused to go get her so she walked home at night. The house is in a pretty good neighborhood with a lot of families but people still think I should’ve gone to get her. I’ve been questioning if me not caring about her makes me an asshole ( why I’m using a throwaway).

This has led to me and NF talking via Snapchat quite a bit and there is this system on Snapchat where it shows you if you are the one they talk to the most with and vice versa. So NF becomes the person that I talk the most to and BFF who previously had that position immidietly asks who it is and i tell her and she just explodes and starts crying and saying that i have replaced her which i try to tell her i have not and never will. She thinks im the asshole and has been ignoring me for a while now so AITA?",

      "description": "**TL;DR at the bottom**\n\nFor context - I had known this person since 8th grade at school. I'm [M] in second year at university now. I had never really been a close friend with them and most of our conversation was digital; we rarely hung out in person. I'll call her Jane.\n\nI'm an introverted person who will sometimes decline going out, mostly due to my anxiety, and I don't leave the house much at all except for Uni, work, or when something has been meticulously planned - while to the contrary Jane is almost never home and is very spontaneous. I had enjoyed our friendship as we had both respected each other's way of socialising. Jane respected my boundaries and never really pushed me to go out anywhere with her - although she had the offer on the table and occasionally I took it. Our friendship was mostly counselling each other whenever we needed it as well as casual chat about our lives and stuff.\n\nIn April last year I had organised with my closest 3 friends (not Jane, she doesn't socialise with them and she would likely have her own activities with her friends) to do something for New Years' Eve. I planned this so far in advance because I wanted the date to be saved and take precedence over any other plans, incl. family plans. You should understand that I am very close with these friends, we share everything, and I can't see some of them much at all due to time constraints, and one of them lives &gt;200Km away now. We had decided that NYE would be a time where it's just us and not other people, as this was a rare and special time for us all to meet up without the social anxiety of others.\n\nOn the morning of New Years' Eve, Jane messaged me and asked if I would like to go and go to [some event] with her and her friends that night. I declined citing I had my own plans. She then got mad at me for rarely going anywhere or doing anything with her (which to me seemed like a sudden change of standards in our friendship). She unfriended and blocked me. I was quite taken aback and deeply hurt by this and it bothered me for the next few days. I had been considering if I should have said something or tried to make plans, but what could I do? Around Jan 3 she tried to add me back but I blocked her because I was just sick of the guilt she was giving me and her newfound lack of respect for our differences.\n\nToday a friend of hers messaged me asking if I could add her back and discuss things. Saying that Jane \"needs me\", and saying that Jane had been having dreams where I was hurt in them. On one hand I want to see what she has to say now, but on the other hand I just don't like toxicity as it really ruins my day and I just don't have it in what seems to be my socially defective self. But is it too far to just keep her blocked now? Sure, she started it, but is that really the best excuse?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n**TL;DR,** friend blew up at me for declining spending an evening with her, because I already had plans with friends. She blocked me, and when she unblocked me a few days later I blocked her back because I just wanted the toxicity to stop. Now her friend says that she \"needs me\".",

      "description": "A few months back, a colleague and I started training in a very competitive graduate programme. While working in the same city, each of us would be based at a different centre: one at a nationally recognised institution that arguably is the more prestigious place to work and train, and one that is more peripheral and probably less attractive to employers. Because I scored marginally higher than him on the entrance exams/interviews, I had first dibs and naturally chose the superior place (the commute was also way better for me honestly). Because he already had some research links at this place, he was quite put-out to be sent to the other centre, and at times it was maybe a bit awkward between us, but I took precedence here and I figure that's just how it goes.\n\nThen, we found ourselves standing against the other to be the student leader of the academic course. In a bizarre and kind-of unprofessional arrangement, people had to verbally vote for who they wanted and explain why. I won the vote almost unanimously, and it was a bit of a cringe-a-thon basically. While we never argued or anything, it was kind of obvious that we weren't going to get on too well and generally stayed out of each other's way. He did drunkenly have a bit of a go at me in a taxi not long after, but I was drunk too and earlier that night I'd (accidentally) knocked his drink all over him and things were a bit high-strung with exams and stuff.\n\nSo skipping forward a few months. Working at this big centre, I've talked to my workmates about all this, and this enmity between me and him has kind of become a running joke. I haven't made stuff up or anything, but I've sort-of painted him as this bitter and unpleasant guy, which is only half-true really. When he came to my department for a meeting the other day pretty much everyone had lined up behind me and were definitely cold to him- not horrible, but way chillier than when they met me. He is also a really masculine, muscly Russian guy- I am a gay British guy who is arguably much more savvy about office culture and how it works. While I'd never play \"identity office politics\" or anything, I think most of the staff have judged him before meeting him, and I haven't really made any effort to stop this. \n\nThere is one job at the end of this programme, decided by the staff at my centre. Am I the asshole for cultivating a certain attitude towards this guy in my workplace to ensure I have the best shot at a job, or is this justifiably cutthroat?",

      "description": "Hello, I've been on Reddit for a while and this is a throwaway for this post.  There is a ton of backstory to understand how the dynamics of the class are set up and to understand where I fit in into all of it. You're free to skip it and just read the issue, but it might help to get some of the background. I may have gone into a little too much detail, but I'd rather give more than less so everything is clear. \n\n\\*\\*Backstory:\\*\\*  \n\nCurrently, I'm in a 7 month class for Medical Assisting. The class is full of females, low income, usually single/young moms. Now I want to preface this by saying that I'm in this class to get experience and education for a proper job while I work my way to med school. Most of these other ladies either want to stop here and just get a career to help their family or because they MAY want to go into nursing. Basically, I'm the only one in the class with a proper plan and doing more than just taking care of the house/kids as I live w/ my bf, take 12 hours of classes (college classes 11am-4pm as well as this MA class which is itself 6 hours a day, 4 days a week 530p,-11pm), and work on the weekends. I also have anxiety and depression that I am battling during all of it, hence my lack of patience for stupidity/bitchiness/drama. I know it sounds like I think I'm better than everyone, but honestly, I'm broke as fuck too. Most of these ladies at this time (they've since finished their mods and moved on and have been replaced by wonderful people) acted like they were doing God's work because they had kids. Me talking about how much work I had would be met with \"oh you just get good grades, its probably not even hard for you.\" whilst ALSO thinking that, because I talk to the teacher a lot because I'm literally suicidal that I'm getting extra help LOLOL. What a joke. So yea, I resent these bitches quite a bit for how they treated me and another student in the class. As if it's our fault that they do worse than us because they fail to put in the same amount of effort that we do. \n\nTo explain the dynamics of this class, I have to explain how the course is set up. Basically, it is a modular system. For those that haven't heard of it (I didn't when I first started), instead of setting the course/academic year off semesters or quarters, we have a grading period each month and a unit that goes with that month. There is a set order for the course and the course starts at mod #110 and goes to mod # 116 or some such, after which it starts again at 110. New students, instead of starting at the beginning of the whole course (110), usually just start at the beginning of the new mod. This means that the rest of the class could be in a completely different point in the course for themselves. Your first mod may be your classmate's third mod while for someone else, it may be their last mod. \n\nWhen I first started, there were four other students that started that mod with me and we have since become very good friends. The rest of the class had, to that point, only dealt with 1 or 2 new students. Also, I want to add that the class is \\*full\\* of Spanish-speaking, Latinas. I, myself, am south-Asian and, as such, have no comprehension of the language or the culture. I'm very quiet, keep to myself, and try to be nice to everyone. I'm not the most outgoing person ever, but I have tons of experience being the quiet, new kid and know I handle it best if I just stay out of everyone's way. This worked very well for the first 3-4 weeks (or so I thought) and I was blissfully going through class thinking all was right with the world. Since the class was full of women \\*who have children, sometimes full-grown high school-aged children\\*, I just did not think there would be any kind of drama. Also, considering I go to university, I've seen my fair share of classroom settings and, suffice it to say, I have \\*never\\* seen drama in those classes that compare to the likes of what I faced in this class. \n\nI'm not going to go too much into that as that drama involves a different person whose antics I don't even want to go into. Her name will be Grace. Just understand it was a LOT of shit-talking, lying to administrators, and dropping little firecrackers of bullshit so she could watch it explode in glee. Grace also made one of the smartest people in the class (besides me, no offense to anyone else there) her enemy by bullying her to the point of tears and causing her to have anxiety every day before class. (We'll call her Allison)Why? Because my teacher asked her to stop sharing notes with the rest of the class because they weren't doing any of their own studying and were actually just freeloading off Allison because they couldn't be bothered to put in the work themselves(they would just not show up for 2 out of the 4 days, show up the day before the test to take notes from her and leave during the dinner break. What the actual fuck?). Most people in the class thought it was Allison's decision to stop, but the teacher literally told her she would fail her if she didn't stop unfairly helping other people. My teacher made this announcement in class stating that it was her who told Allison to stop sharing notes and that was my first signal that everything wasn't as hunky dory as I expected. Cue 4 more months of bullshit between Grace and Allison during which Grace turned her target on me because I was also competing with Allison for best grades in the class. My notes are impeccable and I have a photographic memory. Also, since my full-time job is basically studying, I don't do anything else. Also, I want to go to med school, so yes. I will be working my ass off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Issue:\\*\\*  \n\nNow, since the backstory is done, I can actually go into the issue. Like I said before, most of these women have kids and are single/married. The girl I had an issue with is called Asia. She is 24 and has a 3-year-old. I am 23. So we're pretty similar in age here but with different responsibilities. My teacher sat me next to Asia so that I could help her out. I have no problem with this as long as I don't have to go too much out of my way (I have so much freaking studying to do and stayed up until 2-3am every day trying to get shit done. I was at my wit's end and had zero time to take someone under my wing). To be fair, I don't think my teacher literally expected that as she knew how crazy my schedule was. (I also actually enjoy helping my classmates and used to offer my notes of my own accord to help people out, but a bunch of the bitchy girls got miffed when I didn't have time for a few weeks and thought I was lying so I didn't have to give it to them.) So throughout the weeks, I would answer Asia's, often stupid, questions and let her know the important points I was taking in my notes. I reviewed with her on test days during the dinner hour, tested her on vocab before the quiz, helped her on her homework, etc.  I'm a strong believer in \"teach a man to fish\" rather than \"give him one\" so I tried my best to give her tips to improve her self-studying. Even so, she barely passed her classes. Not surprised, honestly. She would frequently come into class on test day telling me she \"had no time to study\" because \"took a 3-hour nap\" and only had time to get here. Like, okay, sweetie. So obviously, the end of mod comes around at one point and she realizes she is failing. She is in a very bad mood. The desks we sit at are long desks, the kind you get in computer labs in colleges. hence, if one person shakes the desk, the whole row is shaken. As I said before, my notes are impeccable. I take tons of time color-coding, writing everything out with pencil then going back and writing over it, using calligraphy for headers, etc. I use these notes all the time and I like to have something nice to look at. Asia, not understanding or caring, just started slamming shit down on the table. Like, I'm talking taking a gigantic, hardcover textbook and slamming it down on the table so everything was shaking. She took her bag and slammed that on the table too. She threw her heavy ass, full as pencil box and threw it onto the keyboard and even bumped into my right hand (dominant) whilst she was doing all this.  \n\n\\-I looked at her and asked \"Hey can you please stop slamming your stuff on the table, its shaking everything and messing up my notes.  Sorry.\" I even added a sorry in there in case I came off as demanding.  \n\n\\-This bitch didn't even look up and said: \"if you don't like it, you can move.\"  \n\n\\-I was so taken aback by her attitude, I responded \"Excuse me?\" to give her a chance to backtrack and because I genuinely didn't understand her rudeness.  \n\n\\-She was like \"You heard me.\" At this point, I was seething. As I said before, I \\*do not\\* have time for unnecessary rudeness, bullshit, or drama. NONE. Also, the fact that I was on edge all this time, my anger was always just boiling under the surface.  \n\n\\-So I coolly tell her \"If you have something else on your mind, that's fine. Don't be taking that shit out on me.\"  \n\n\\-And she was like \"This is my spot. I can do what I want. If you don't like it, move.\" There wasn't anything I was comfortable doing at that point because I knew if I opened my mouth, I would say something I regretted. So I shut up. The next day, I stay 3 rows back from her and didn't even bother to look at her when she walked in. She came up to me and apologized saying \"I don't want to have bad blood between us. We spend so many hours in this class, we don't have time for drama.\" Agreed. I was kind of done with her shit by this point; she talks about everyone behind their back and doesn't put in any effort for her work but throws a tantrum every time this is reflected in her grades. She then bitches about how Allison gets good grades (and probably how I got good grades too, lmao). Our relationship was k",

      "title": "AITA for getting too drunk and waking up my roommate who then took care of me?",
      "description": "Months back, I drank too much alcohol one night and came home to my apartment around 11pm. Obviously since I was very drunk, I don't remember too much detail from the night itself. But I was worried I was **dangerously** drunk (it's happened before), so I called my mom to see if she thought I needed to go to the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked if any of my roommates were home (one was), and to see if they were awake and what they thought. So I knocked on my roommate's door (IDK if he was asleep or not, can't remember), and he took the phone and started talking to my mom, reassuring her \"It's ok, I'm going to take care of him and make sure nothing happens, etc.\" (He's a very nice guy, sincerely.) I think he put on a movie or something and just sorta made sure I didn't choke on vomit or stop breathing or something. (Again, I don't really remember.) We had only been roommates for about a month, so we weren't childhood besties or anything, but we had gotten along swimmingly during that time and really clicked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, I woke up massively hungover and vaguely remember what happened the night before. I was late to work, but before I left I wrote him a thank you note, telling him how much I appreciate what he did, that I've been struggling really badly with alcoholism for the past 2-3 years (I'm 25, he's 29) but I'm doing a lot to get better and trying really hard to stay sober, and that I'd like to take him out to dinner or buy him an xbox game or something to repay him. I slid the note under his door and went to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the last we ever interacted really. He hasn't said a word to me or looked me in the eye in MONTHS. We used to hang out all the time. Now, whenever he is home, he always has his headphones on, cooks dinner and takes it into his room to eat, he moved the tv from the common area into his room so he can watch it in there (we bonded when we first met over liking the same movies and shows, and watched a lot office together.) I always say \"hey\" or \"What's up\" when I see him, he never responds (literally no response.) I try occasionally to make conversation, it never happens. I asked if he wanted to watch a movie, he just shook his head. The whole time I'm just thinking \"...Damn...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked him point-blank if I did anything to upset him after a few weeks of this. He said \"No.\" and went back to what he was doing. He's European so maybe it's partly a culture thing? He's a really nice guy; I know this because we were good friends when I first moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's never cool to get so drunk that you need someone to make sure you don't need hospitalization; I feel bad that I put him through that. **FULL DISCLOSURE**: As I mentioned, I've been struggling with alcoholism, along with depression, pretty badly. My dad and my brother are alcoholics (I'm told there's a family gene that makes it worse?). I was at my worst senior year of college; I had to be hospitalized four separate times after drinking too much, always by myself. The final time I was hospitalized, I was found passed out on a public sidewalk at 4pm on a Monday, woke up in the ER and was told I blew a 0.4 BAC. I went to rehab for alcohol a month later, and was sober for a few months, but I relapsed on the night of this story when I went on a date that I thought went really well but was then told she didn't really like me (or something like that). I had a moment of weakness/insecurity/shame and went to a local bar to avoid feeling my emotions. The night unfolded as you might imagine and I ended up getting drunk enough to worry seriously that I needed to go to the hospital again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than this one area of my life, which I'll admit has negatively affected many people around me the past few years (namely parents, ex-gf, and college roommates) and nearly killed me on several occasions, I try to be a really considerate person. I care \\*a lot\\* about making sure I'm treating people with kindness and consideration and respect, and that they feel comfortable around me. My past girlfriends have all told me what they really liked about me is how sweet and kind they think I am. And this roommate is also a very kind and good person. But I can tell he just fucking hates me. I'm moving out in a few months, and he's been living here for much longer than I have, so I'm just gonna bite the bullet and respect that and try to spend as much time out of the house as possible so that he doesn't have to feel uncomfortable in his own home (which he clearly is when I'm around.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDude fuckin hates me, hates when I'm around, and wants nothing to do with me and makes that clear. Is it because I'm an asshole?",

      "description": "My mum is such a wonderful person. She has been an amazing mum and a loving grandmother to my daughter. She has just turned 86years old and can no longer live where she is. With her pension she can no longer afford to keep up with the bills and she is now too frail to make it up the stairs. Even though she’ll never admit it I know that she is lonely living alone. Her only options are either a nursing home or to stay with family. \n\nMy husband, myself, and our teenage daughter live in a house that is easily big enough to fit another person in. We have a guest ensuite bedroom on the ground floor that would be perfect for my mum and her needs. I know that she would be happier living out her last years with her family. She has always been very daunted by the prospect of going into a nursing home. \n\nAfter visiting my mum one day and discovering that she was struggling, I went home and sat my husband down to talk to him about her maybe moving in with us. He listened to me and everything I had to say and then responded. His response was that we shouldn’t rule out a nursing home and we can find a really good one. I said that I really don’t think my mum would like to go in one and that’s she’d be happier with us. We have the room so I really didn’t understand his hesitance. I then asked him if there was a particular reason why he didn’t want my mum staying and he replied something on the lines of ‘this is our family home, it would be weird having another person here. Would you feel comfortable if my mum lived here?’ I then responded that if he came to me and told me his mother was struggling on her own I would be the one to offer her to move in. I then went on to say that nursing homes can be very daunting places for the elderly and how would he feel if his mum was made to go in one because I said she couldn’t live with us. \n\nMy husband is now in a strop and hasn’t spoken to me for a day. \n\nI really don’t see that I’m the asshole, but maybe I am? Maybe I was too pushy? It hurt my feelings that he was so hesitant to help my mum. It feels like it was really cold hearted of him. But maybe I just need to try and see things from his point of view? \n\nSo Reddit. AITA? ",

He was never really present during my mother's pregnancy. He couldn't be bothered to be there when I was born and he used drugs and alcohol to escape after my parents lost my brother (he was a year old and died from a faulty pacemaker). \n\nWhen I was 12 was the first time I met my biological paternal grandfather, he is amazing.  My biological dad didn't come with him and decided to call and try and talk to me, it didn't last long. \n\nThree years passed and I talked to him again over the phone this time for about an hour and a half. I spent that time telling him all the stuff he put me through and how I was better off without him. He tries to have a relationship with me, but wont make an actual effort so it's not worth my time, I have a dad(my stepdad who actually raised me and loves me). Enough background. \n\nLast week my biological father called my mom to apologize for being an awful husband and father (its part of his AA), she told him she forgave him for leaving, but the father part he would need to talk to me. My mother called and asked if I would talk to him. I got frustrated and said I was not going to be a stepping stone on his way to recover and he doesn't deserve forgiveness. She understands and told my biological father that I wasn't giving him my contact info. He was very upset and told my biological grandfather who then called me upset about the situation.  So AITA?",

Once I told my friends the car I am driving (which is not mine and I am not insured to drive) has a tow bar they started celebrating how much fun it will be going boating.

No one else has ever done it, or knows how to drive with a trailer. I am not interested in taking the risks of being the one liable for any costs or damages when I do not believe they will be willing to pay if the boat is damaged. I don't think going on the boat will make or break the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel very bad for letting them down but its just who I am for being nervous about the risks of something like this.

      "description": "Last night I made a late night run to the grocery store around 9 PM. It was snowing and the temperature at the time was below -30C with the wind chill. When I got there, there was a dog tied to a bench outside the store. \n\nI went did my shopping and came out over an hour after I went in. By now there’s was a light freezing rain. The dog was still there and shivering. It’s coat was wet and freezing to the touch and it kept whimpering. \n\nNow I know certain dogs have adapted to be used to the cold with their coats and paws better suited for the weather. And yes this dog looked like a husky which is one of those breeds. But this dog had been outside for an hour and as i said what shivering and crying so I called the police and told them the situation. They sent an officer who got there in like 5 minutes (the closest station is no joke down the road from the store so that’s why someone arrived quickly). \n\nHe had a K-9 unit type car so he put the dog up in it and we waited until the owner arrived. Apparently the owner was a worker at the store and his boss needed him to come in for a quick talk which ended up taking longer than expected. \n\nHe got his dog back and the officer left on another call. I apologized for calling the police and explained that I was just worried. He said I overreacted and should’ve just left, calling me “a nosy dick”. His dog was fine, it’s a husky mix they like the cold and it wasn’t my place to try to control how his dog should be treated.\n\nI know maybe I overreacted but I didn’t feel like I could just leave knowing the dog was under freezing rain and freezing cold to the touch and whining. I knew that dog was there for at least 60 minutes and I didn’t know if it had been a longer time. \n\nSo AITA for doing what I did? \n\n",

      "description": "So my best friend who I’ve known since primary school, let’s call him Will. Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn’t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he’d whisper to me behind that guy’s back a racial slur directed at him, so that’s pretty minor and that’s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n“their (n-word) faces made me angry”\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there’s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he’s insecure about his weight, he’s Anxious about most things, and I’m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media’s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven’t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?",

Most of my cousins are about 10 years older than me, so they got their inheritance relatively soon. However, the money for me and my sister (roughly $37 000 USD each) was put into trust for the both of us. \nMy parents divorced when I was about 8 years old. My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I remember and has never considered quitting. To my knowledge, that is one of the things that tore our family apart. \nAfter the divorce, he would rarely come to see us- only on holidays. My sister has memories of us waiting for him to come pick us up, and never showing up. To me, it just always felt as if he chose the booze over his daughters. \nI was supposed to get the inheritance when I turned 18. I was ready to go to university but couldn't get a hold of the money. He gave me around 5 000 CAD and he said he wanted to give it to us when we turned 21. When I turned 21, I brought it up and he said that he had hit some hard times and there wasn't much left.\nI know he makes decent money. He didn't pay child support for us growing up. He now lives in the country and hardly works. I will go to visit him once a year and be amicable, but I can't help but feel like he stole from my future. I am now in university, and have a large student loan and work part time as a waitress to have money to get by.\nPeople say that he is my dad and I only get one dad, but in my opinion, fathers don't steal from their kids. \nReddit, AITA for cutting my dad out of my life for spending the money in trust for me?",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my group use my alternative text after they stayed quiet?",
      "description": "\\[Sorry if anything is hard to understand. I am a native English speaker. Bear with me :D\\]\n\nSo, I am currently in a pretty annoying dilemma concerning a group project. It's a long story with many events, but I will try to sum it up. For the context, I am a Psychology Student (Master Degree) and in one of my courses, we have to do a mandatory group project. It won't be graded, but it will be used as one basis for our vocal exam at the end of the semester. I was placed in the only group of 6 and we started working on the project in November. Everyone has a Bachelor Degree in Psychology, so everyone should be about the same level.\n\nIn our first group meeting, we talk about the general construct of your project, the chapters, etc., This dude, U., votes for writing the review-section, which basically is meant to review the scientific background of the topic we are writing about. Since it is pretty new, it's the shortest and easiest of all chapters. Everyone is fine with that and we part ways, with me being in charge of the whole editing process and the online workspace we are going to use. So when I go home, I set it up. We are ready to go.\n\nStart December, U. writes an email to me, asking for feedback on his chapter, stating that he has always had issues with writing scientific texts and that his Bachelor thesis prof helped him write it. I go read his text online and, well, I'm not gonna lie, it's bad. Really bad. Not like in a \"oh you didn't get the theme, you need to reread it\", but more like a \"well, you really didn't learn how to write scientific texts, did you?\". I am not one to sugar coat stuff, so I write back quiet frankly, basically like this: \"U., I read your text. It's tue, you have a major problem with this scientific text writing-skill, but I don't have the time and experience to help you in this regard. I only can sum up again, what you have to do. \\[insert summary\\] Please go and seek professional help for this, another prof or maybe the Student Council Service.\" U. replies that he will do that.\n\nFor the whole December and the most part of January, he didn't change a thing in his text. Like, not even a letter. In group meetings, we asked him multiple times to work on his part, but he didn't. Starting Winter Break End of December, I start to get stressed. I mean, yeah, it's not gonna be marked, but it s a basis for our vocal exams. If his part is bad, our questions will be bad and I don't want that, even more because the rest of the chapters it really well written. So I write his chapter myself, as a safety measure, so that we can send mine as well if his doesn't improve. To show that our group is able to do better and that U. is just unwilling to seek professional help.\n\nCome January, 15th, our last group meeting. We talk about the chapters, final feedback, you know the drill. U.'s chapter comes up, the feedback: \"You need to work on this. This is not okay. We told you multiple times, even helped you with the content. Get your sh\\*t together.\" Deadline is set to January, 20th, for him, because his text needs major edit and exams are close and I am running low on time. The rest has a deadline until 21st, because their stuff is easy to be edited.\n\nCome 20th, he still hasn't done a thing. So I close his deadline and send my alternative text to the group. They are okay with it, saying that they want to send it in with U.'s text, so that we have 2 versions of the same end result. Still, we issue a meeting on the 22nd, yesterday, to talk about it. My expectation: they are going to tell him firmly that his behavior is unbearable. That his work is not okay, furthermore because he didn't edit a single thing. That they are going to be supportive to our shared opinion.\n\nThe reality: Silence. U. talks for the first 15 minutes of our meeting about how we are to blame that he didn't improve, that he asked for help but noone helped him. That he did his best and that he just isn't able to do better and that we have to deal with it. He won't even let other people talk properly when it's their spot. I am furious and I, for my part, tell him exactly what I think: that his behavior is sickening and that he is leeching off of the team. That I don't understand what else he expects - is he really that entitled that he thinks that someone has to basically talk him through every word he writes for his chapter? \n\nAt this point, it's apparent that U. won't listen to any feedback. He is set on his opinion. And my group? They sugar coat everything. There is no criticism. There is something like \"You should have asked us more directly\" and stuff like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn school, I learned that being silent means that you agree. That it is important to speak up against bullies, racists and the like. And I carry this with me to this day. I firmly believe that when someone behaves like shit, that you have to speak up, clearly and make a point. If you don't do that, you basically agree with what this person does.\n\nSo I am devestated. No one has guts to stand up for their opinion, our opinion, that we shared before. I am mad and feel let down. So when I go home, I start thinking: if they are okay with U.'s work, they don't need an alternative chapter, because his is okay obviously. So when I am at my pc, I withdraw my consent for using my alternative chapter. Because they obviously don't need it.\n\nNow they are nagging me for this decision, stating that we decided as a group to send in both versions. But we also decided as a group to stand up to U.'s behavior and they didn't.... Am I being an asshole?",

This is way over the budget we initially set. Or alternatively they should pay their share of the deposit (£67 per adult) and we split the rest (£210). In both of these cases I feel the cost of the holiday is much higher than planned.\n\nI personally think that they should have planned better and should still foot their share of the bill even though they can't come.

      "description": "The reason for tipping (that I've heard) is that servers/busboys/bartenders etc. are critically underpaid, so tips are how they stay afloat. That's fine, I'm all for tipping &gt;%20 on good service, especially if busy or special order or split check or whatever. Even as a broke student, I know that if I have enough money to go out, I have enough money to tip.\n\nMy question stems from a small ice cream shop in Kirkland, WA that lives under a staircase. The owner was definitely the only person working there at the time (literally a one room store), possibly the only employee, and when I bought my ice cream (affogato, which is justly priced higher than a double scoop in a cup), I didn't tip. I ate in his store while there talking to him, and we talked about his previous life as a new orleans bartender and server and the associated tip economy there. Now, as an owner of an independent store, working for himself, setting his own prices, in my opinion he's in a different segment of the restaurant world. **Am I The Asshole for not tipping on my ice cream purchase?** In a situation of a small single owner-run restaurant, is a tip expected?",

      "description": "For a little backstory(hold on, it's a looong one), I was friends for a very long time (15 years or so) with two twin girls. We grew up together basically but I always felt like i didn't belong with them. I used to be and still am a really calm person, it's hard to get on my nerves, while they were and still are (as far as i know) really vulcanic, always confrontational, always entitled to everything, they were never in the wrong,  everyone else were in debt to them because they were such amazing people.  And I must confess, at times they were the best people you could be around, they are funny af, have a bubbly personality when in  a goid mood,  but then they would remind you every time you piss them off of that time when they helped you, which in my book is the most asshole move you can go for. For example, when I had my first boyfriend, he was arrested with drug charges (yeah, he was a drug dealer) abd sentenced for 5 years in prison. Now i can't say i LOVED the guy but i thought i did at the time (i was 19) and at least i was attached to him since we were together for two years. He used to do drugs, i didn't, just wasn't my thing and i did try to make him stop using and selling (thought i'd be the one to tame the bad boy lol u know the basic story) but anyway he was busted, put in jail, i was sad, can't say devastated because i obviously wasn't that much in love but i was sad so these two girls were all supportive and shit, they would invite me to spend time with them and their boyfriends (which whom i was in pretty good relations) just so i can hear one of the girls (let's call them V&amp;D) yelling at me(when they were arguing about some random thing) that \n\nV: \"She said she's sick and tired of you because she and her bf can't have intimacy and she has to drag you everywhere with her!\" \n\nThey had this habit of throwing the other one under the bus when they were mad at eachother (don't have me started on the insults they would throw at eachother... whew!) And D didn't even try to counter that lol. I felt like a piece of shit but anyway i let that slip since i imagined that D probably wanted to have more alone time with her bf and i was there all the time (even tho they invided me).\n\nSo you get the main picture. Fast forward a year later. I found my dream man,  obviously cut ties with the drug dealer as i realised i wasn't even in love with him.  Still friends with  V&amp;D. My boyfriend worked as a mechanic, but paid poorly for the amount of work he was putting there so when he got a raise we were so happy, and I told another friend of mine(not V&amp;D but they knew eachother) that i was so proud of my bf and we were so happy.  Only to later have V tell me that she knows I talked to my other friend and told her about my bf's raise and that she and D thought that sounded like I'm a gold digger. I wasn't working at the time. I was going to courses to become a nail tech(which i am today and it's really hard to make a clientelle and make good money out of it but now i'm making almost double the normal salary) and when we went out, he wouldn't let me pay though i almost always had money from my parents. But the twins bfs were not working or having even lower paying jobs so my bf sometimes even paid for all of them (the girls weren't working either and used to give their bfs shit for not finding better jobs and having more money so idk who's a gold digger here, even though their parents are LOADED they were just stingy anyway saying they don't have money or that they had to give the money they had back to their parents lol ). \n\nAfter she told me that gold digger thing, i was stunned, i felt like i never even knew them or as if they never even met me. I cut all contact with them, didn't answer my phone, they called like crazy the first few days then stopped after seeing i will not answer anyway.  \n\n3 years passed and i got married to my now husband, the mechanic, who is the most amazing man i've ever met, and i still hold that feeling to this day. After our wedding i received a message on facebook from D but since i unfriended them both it got in as a request and me, seeing it was from her i didn't even open it. This year we had a wedding where we were the godparents (in Romania it's costumary that when you get married you have a couple, already married themselves to be considered \"spiritual parents\" and since the couple getting married were good friends of my husband, we were more than glad to accept,  as i liked them too) before Bride's bachelorette party-the planning of- , it wasn't a surprise for me to find one of the twins - D - being there, to help the bride with her planning (they are keeping contact because the groom's brother is her bf) and honestly i didn't even say hi to her, but to the others there,  and she just burried her eyes in her phone. Anyway D mentioned we should wear t-shirts to the party, you know the funny ones with \"Bride's bitches\" and tjings like that. And the others weren't really involved in this discussion so i say it's not a bad idea but someone should do this and order them online for the tshirts to  be from the same place. To my shock, D says the two of us should handle this on fb. Ofc i wasn't going to say no, I didn't want to be an a-hole so we did. That meant i had to go to her messenger and only then i read her message she sent for my wedding saying something along the lines of \"Even if we're not talking anymore, i want you to know you looked beautiful\" and things like that. Tbh, i wasn't touched. I knew their M.O. I just lied and said  that i did not know she sent me a message,  because i though she blocked me or i blocked her (idk) and then she started going on about how i hurt her and how she didn't understand why i cut all ties with them, how we used to be sisters, and asked if i missed them. To which in my head i was like \"Hell no, satan!\" But i just responded saying that it was better that way for all of us, not saying i missed them or anything (because i didn't) and she was saying how i could have had a conversation with them and tell them what went wrong between us, so they could change, and  i did feel like an asshole at that point since everybody knows me as the one who will talk everything through,  have a conversation as long as necessary to get things on the right path as much as possible, but i did not get THEM the chance.\n\n But considering all the things I mentioned, and trust me, there are more i can talk about(like how they always made jokes about me being fat even though i was at a normal weight(60 kg) while they were overweight(80 kg), and i was s bit taller than them, and i became self conscious but i never even touched the subject of weight not even jokingly because they would freak tf out. Or how they used to be late ALL THE TIME and made me wait 1hr, they would fond excuses, but when I was late, they would freak out start swearing at me), AITA for not trying to talk through the issues I had with them because i though it was pointless? Because i sometimes feel like i should have, then i remember how stressed i used to feel almost every time in their presence and how my life and self confidence improved A LOT after ignoring them. They told people (friends we had in common-some of them stopped talking to them as well because of how they behaved-)  that I was a bitch and i just used them for money(even though they never gave me money) and that I'm ungrateful for all they had helped me and God knows what more they said.\n\nSorry for the long story but it's so much to get out after years of such a \"friendship\". And i was probably their only one friend that could stand their crap since i am calm, but i ended it abruptly. \n\nAITA for not wanting to even hear them out? ",

      "description": "I fly frequently - three or more times per month - with an airline not always know for the friendliest customer service. I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I’m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn’t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I’d had a long and difficult work day and didn’t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say “thank you for telling me” and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said “it’s extremely rude to walk away from people when they’re talking to you, don’t you think?”\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I’ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don’t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the “wrong bathroom,” got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,",

Whenever I'm around Europeans, I start to feel insecure and defensive, because on some level, I know that they're better than me.

      "title": "AITA for not closing the gate to my driveway so my neighbor’s dog can’t get out?",
      "description": "The title is kind of confusing, there’s a bit of context needed here. \n\nSo to explain my living situation: I live on a small property where there is a main house, and the backyard has a few different sheds that are slowly being remodeled over time. \n\nThe front house is rented out separately from the (currently singular) remodeled shed, which is where I live. \n\nMy home is easiest accessed through a back alleyway, and as such, I have my own back driveway. There is also a front driveway. The entire property is fenced, and there is a fairly large yard.\n\nI have lived here for a year and a half now. My previous neighbors (aka the people in the house next to my shed on the property) were problematic in their own ways, but nowhere near as frustrating as my new neighbors.\n\nI was out of town for about a month in August, and when I came back, I found out I had new neighbors in the main house that came with two dogs. \n\nMind you, I had no clue they were moving in or that they had dogs. Unfortunately, they had also not been told I lived on what they understood to be “their” property, and they didn’t  know I existed until I got home from vacation. Talk about an awkward first interaction. \n\nMy landlord is definitely to blame for some of this, as she’s caused plenty of problems for me beforehand (utility payments are a whole other post I could make), and it’s on her for not communicating to them or to me that the other party lived on the property. \n\nI think this could especially be an issue if I was allergic to dogs. Luckily, I’m not.\n\nThe issue is that, having lived here for a while now, I’ve got my own way of doing things. I leave the gate open to my driveway, because there is no reason for it to be closed. My home is pretty secluded and the open gate doesn’t get in the way of my other neighbors, cars driving down the alley, etc.\n\nNow that they live here, they constantly remind me to close it or keep it closed because they don’t want their dogs to get out. I personally think this is ridiculous. I was here first, I don’t have pets, I was never notified people with pets were moving in, and now I’m supposed to do things that inconvenience me because why?\n\nEvery time I leave or come home, I’m expected to get in and out of my car multiple times to open and close the gate. I’m usually in a rush (full time student with multiple jobs), and honestly, it’s the least of my problems, and incredibly irritating.\n\nOn top of that, the dogs are not trained at all. They will constantly jump all over me, get me dirty ( I live in a cold and wet state), run outside the yard and don’t come when called, meaning I then have to waste more of my time running around and getting their dogs back in the yard.\n\nI have the sense that I’m the asshole, but also, why is it my job to take care of your dogs? Fence off a different section of the yard they can’t escape from. Train them so they’re not jumping all over me and my friends and ruining clothes with dirty paws. \n\nLet me hear your opinions. Maybe I’m being a prick and I’m just easily irritated, but I think the dogs shouldn’t be my problem and that I should be able to leave the gate open whenever, along with expect that my work clothes won’t be dirtied every time I step outside. \n",

      "description": "My husband went out of town to our home town to play a show this past weekend and he was supposed to be staying at his best friend/band mates house Friday and Saturday night. But he ended up sleeping at this very attractive single girls house Saturday night, alone. Yes, I know her and get along with her. But I only know her thru partying. And supposedly they were partying there... there was one other friend of his there. But I guess he left that night because said girl drove him to his band mates house, alone the next morning . I’m super super upset with him. We’ve been together 10 years and I’m handling this much better than a lot of people would. But he’s trying so hard to justify it and make it not a big deal... all he had to do was tell me that night that was happening and he chose to wait which I think is weird. \nPs... my dads passing from an OD is this month (12 yrs ago) but it still hurts like a son of a bitch, and he knows that. Makes it all so much worse.",

We were at a house party the other night and one of the girls had a fight with her boyfriend and went home. Me and him walked to a shop to get some food and he kissed me and told me he liked me. We were really drunk btw. I kissed him back and then stopped and said but you’re with Ellie, and he said I’d rather be with you though, and he kissed me again. I said ok, well you need to break up with her then cause I can’t do this behind her back, he said ok I will. He got out his phone and messaged her saying ‘were finished, I like someone else’. I’ve said to him that I want us to keep it a secret for a while because I don’t think it would be good if she found out yet, and he said ok. So we’re basically pretending we’re not together right now and when she asked him who he liked he said it was someone out of school. \n\nAnyway AITA for basically telling him to break up with her and now secretly dating him?

      "title": "AITA For Feeling Disrespected by a Coworkers Meme?",
      "description": "A little background: I work for a large company in an office setting. My team is 5 people in two locations with only myself and a coworker at my location in a control room with ~50 others. I have been working for a long time and am very respected for my knowledge regarding our work. My coworker was trained by me and is still being mentored when we have overlap on our shifts. \n\nMy coworker is on the same pay as me as we are covered by an enterprise agreement and there is no 'senior' position for me to move into currently. We work shifts that alternate weekly, either 4.30am-12.30pm or 12pm-8pm. My coworker has been here for about 5 months. My coworker has been viewed by management on multiple occasions to bludge through a shift on his phone. \n\nBasically our morning shift is meant to give a handover in the 30 minute overlap to the afternoon shift in order to complete work the early shift started but did not finish and to pass on important information (we support applications used in the control room so outages/issues need to be known/monitored). The handover is also meant for the afternoon shift to provide information to the morning sjfit but NOT work tasks (due to morning shift having important set work).\n\nI came into work (early shift this week) and checked our handover document and there were 4 tasks on it for me which would take about an hour. I also checked the group mailbox and the three emails I had handed over the previous afternoon were all assigned back to me. We also have a new starter who is friends with my coworker who advised that he was watching live streams for most of his shift and chatting via messenger. Admittedly in one task the coworker was asking for assistance to learn a new task so I'm happy with that but the remaining three tasks were work he could've easily done as our afternoon shift does not have an assigned workload. \n\nI messaged my coworker to let him know that the handover is only meant to be informative for the morning shift as per our process set by our manager. I mentioned that our manager has been unhappy with any deviation from process lately and was simply giving an FYI to save his skin in the future (evening shift is fairly relaxed as you need to find work if none is handed over so management tries to monitor work completed during this time).\n\nMy coworker responded with a meme of a little girl rolling her eyes with the caption \"When your coworker tries to act like your supervisor. Please Susan, act your wage\". Now this panged me pretty hard as I have been the one to train and mentor this coworker and have made a huge effort to up-skill him to handle the role which in turn can justify a pay rise for us both (change of grade/reclassify position) which he seems to want a lot.\n\nSo, AITA for feeling disrespected? I simply wrote the information in the handover document and kept my headphones on for our 30 minute overlap yesterday then left without saying a word. ",

      "description": "I (19M) have a friend the same age who I used to be inseperable with. We would do everything together and had a pretty good grouo of friends. We both had mutual crushes on each other and would go on trips together almost every week, and it would consist of getting really drunk and high, and having really funny or nice nights together. We literally never left each other’s sides.\n\nRecently, he decided to quit college and move in with his boyfriend of a year or so. His boyfriend and I have both agreed that we don’t really like each other for whatever reason but I’ve always been civil and nice to him, since it’s none of my business who he dates.\n\nThe real problem started before his boyfriend anyway. My feiend attended college outside my city, so we didn’t talk often as we both don’t really text. We would still hang out when we were both free though, and it was fine. Until he stopped seeing or talking to me altogether. He just does not answer his texts or calls and whenever I or my friends message to ask him to hang, we always get ignored because he’s with his boyfriend and his friends.\n\nThis angered me so badly and I also pretty much gave up on him too, but we bumped into each other again recently. We decided to hang out (My friend, a mutual friend, and me) and the whole time he pretty much spoke about himself and would make our mutual friend the butt of all his jokes. This is something of a running joke and our mutual friend laughs it off and doesn’t think anything of it, but that night I could tell they were getting angry and uncomfortable. They left, and I stayed as I figured that maybe being alone with him would resolve my anger and we could go back to being good friends.\n\nThen his boyfriend came home. He sat with us, which was okay since I’m good at being civil and don’t really care, but he began to get increasingly rude to my friend and I. He would make a joke, and when I would laugh he would ask what’s so funny and make things incredibly awkward. He also ignored or laughed obnoxiously at everything I said and after my friend noticing I was incredibly uncomfortable (I rarely leave my house because of my crippling anxiety and he is more than aware of this) but not defending me even slightly I just left. I haven’t messaged, phoned or even replied to his snapchats since, but I do feel really guilty about ghosting him since we were so close. Am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR - My close friend doesn’t bother to contact me anymore and his friends make it clear they dislike me, to which he doesn’t care to defend me at all.",

I know I was completely in the wrong, and that my family was  racist and disrespectful. Since then, I’ve maintained my distance from her, but I really miss her. Honestly I think she was the one before I fucked everything up. Anyways I honestly feel as though my family has changed since the incident. My second cousin (who started this mess) has promised me that he won’t joke about her race anymore since he doesn’t want to offend her. My parents have promised to keep their distance and to stop joking about her parents. However, some of my female friends are warning me against doing this, telling me that they’d refuse to go and that I would be an asshole for springing this up on her.

      "description": "For background, my brother is my roommate.   I have a high paying job and was living in a major city far from where we grew up in a rural area.  My brother was having trouble finding a job in this rural area so I told him to come live with me and sleep on my couch. He got a job very quickly and then we moved to a 2 bedroom apartment.  He makes less than I do so I let him pay 1/3 of the rent.  I pay for groceries, utilities, and 2/3 of the rent.   (Totals are $1000 vs. $2700 per month)\n\nI get along well with my brother so I like having him as a roommate.  I am fine with this arrangement in terms of money.   My brother recognizes I’m helping him live in a nice, luxury apartment for way less than it would’ve cost him.  I recognize that it’s pretty cool to have my brother as a roommate. \n\nHere’s the problem, his girlfriend moved in and she’s rude to my face and inconsiderate.  For example, she is a student still (like an older student who can’t get her shit together to finish a degree) and has a random schedule.  She has homework to do and asks me to turn off the TV because it bothers her.  She will take showers in the morning at the same time as me when I’m getting ready for work, which means there’s no hot water.   Her big plans involve going to hang out with friends.  I used to come home for lunch and watch TV for an hour.  Now when I get home at lunch she’s there and watching  something awful on my TV.  So I’ve stopped being able to go home for lunch. \n\nI finally got pissed off, listed these problems for my brother, and told him he needs to pay more rent and his girlfriend needs to chip in.  (She wasn’t there.). Later, he got mad and said I was making her feel uncomfortable with my complaints.  He also said how much more do I want? I’m kinda stuck because I have a bigger room so 1/2 split is unfair.  I’m thinking the split should be ($1600 /$2100) and then I won’t feel so awful about having to be cognizant of her schedule and comfort.  He says he can’t afford that and I’m stressing him out because he can’t find a reasonable (not awful) place for any cheaper.  \n\nI think it’s unfair his girlfriend moved herself in, makes me uncomfortable in my own house, and gets to do all that for free.  \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "(Please forgive the terrible formatting because I’m on my phone)\n\nI have been dating my GF for almost 2 years now and it has been a long distance relationship. We had a streak since the beginning of our relationship and I accidentally broke that about 2 months ago. This made her really upset since she thought that this was a bad sign. \n\n\nI have been really bad at maintaining streaks and there have been many instances where she has had to ask me to send my streaks as they were on the verge of breaking. \n\n\nRecently we’ve been having troubles since she thinks that I’ve been losing interest in her which is absolutely not true and I love her a lot. I’ve been madly in love with her for a long time(we’ve known each other for 6 years and have been best friends for most of it). There have been quite a few miscommunications which have made her believe that I’m falling out of love.\n\n\nYesterday, once again I forgot to send a snap which broke our streak of about 55 days. This has made her really upset and she is not talking to me. This has happened at a terrible time as we’re at a rough point in our relationship. I have been trying to tell her that it was just an accident and told her that she knows that I’m really bad at this. She said that I’m bad at this relationship and stopped talking to me.\n\n\nI am really confused as to what to do so I thought I’ll come here and let the people of Reddit decide if I’m in the wrong.\n\n\nSo AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So some background for what led up to this situation. My cousin is having her male friend from out of town sleepover at her place for a few days. She is also in a 1.5 year committed relationship with her boyfriend who lives apart from her. (Who recently became a friend of mine) Last night when her SO was not over she decided to bring said friend into her bed to watch movies. He fell asleep and then she fell asleep soon after. My sister tells me this saying they were cuddling also. I give her my opinion on the matter. Saying \"I would not be happy at all with my SO if he brought a gal friend into a bed to cuddle and fell asleep. In *my relationship* I'd consider it microcheating as its a form of intimacy. Intimacy I wouldn't be comfortable with my SO sharing with anyone but me. I be mad if I was her SO but my boundaries may differ and in the end it's up to him.\" As that's the case for me I wanted to know if I was overreacting and went without outting her to people asking \"if you found out your SO purposefully or accidentally was found cuddling in bed with a friend of the opposite gender or preferred gender how would you feel.\" I wanted outside perspectives to have a more informed opinion or see if it was a bigger deal than I thought. Most shared the same opinion as me. They didn't like the idea but up to SO.  I go to bed after a long day and wake up to her chewing my head off saying how dare I accuse her of cheating. That it was an accident and it's my sister's fault for not waking her up or it be a different story than it was. That as her cousin she's mad I would shit talk her. I told her I didn't shit talk just stated an opinion. That I asked others without saying her name or letting anyone know who it was about so if the overwhelming majority said it was wrong I could privately pull her aside and see her side of the story but never got the chance... Am I the Asshole for saying the situation was disrespectful and trying to get opinions in which I didn't out her?",

      "description": "So our 3yo son has one afternoon each week where he gets picked up from daycare by my Mum and spends the afternoon with her. They both love their time together each week and she's generally very helpful when we ask her to help out.\n\nMe and my partner know that they sometimes go for ice cream or he has biscuits and things while he's there, which is fine in moderation. We generally don't give him sweets or unhealthy food at home. So when he starts saying to us \"Gran gives me lollies in her car\" and things like that, we thought we'd just ask.\n\nI went to pick him up from him from her place two days ago and instead of having dinner he was having sweet biscuits. I didn't point that out but I did say, \"hey, I've been meaning to ask, but son has been saying that you give him lollies, is that the case?\".\n\nShe said no, we don't have any lollies, I wouldn't do that etc. No big deal, I said OK that's fine and things were normal after that. Kids say all sorts of things so I put it down to that.\n\nWell fast forward 24 hours and me and my partner receive this essay of a text saying things like, \"how could you do this to me, I think you need to put son in daycare full time, I can't believe you have taken away our time together, don't bother asking me to help out if he's sick, you should look at hiring a nanny\" etc. Really over the top reaction imo. It actually costs us more for him to finish early one day a week so they can have an afternoon together, but he loves his time there so everyone's happy. \n\nI seriously didn't think anything of it. As a parent I should be able to ask what my child is eating, I would have asked the same question of any of the other grandparents. He's only just turned 3 and he doesn't need to be eating sweets. My mother has just akways seem to act as they we know nothing and she knows everything about being a parent.\n\nTL;DR I asked my mother if she's been giving my son lollies and she's acting like I've barred her from ever seeing him again.

      "title": "AITA For bringing the cops?",
      "description": "TL;DR: My ex had my cats. I told him I was coming to get them and that I would bring the cops if necessary. I was aware he had drugs in the house. I learned after the fact that he also had a gun there, which he is legally not allowed to possess. I called to let him know I was on my way. He got irate and was ranting and cussing at me. I hung up on him and proceeded to show up with cops. Evidently this makes me the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my ex is psychotic. In the last 8 (of a total 15) months, he has at various times threatened me, my friends, my cats and my infant daughter in an attempt to control/coerce me into giving him information that, to the best of my knowledge, does not even exist. I didn't realize I was going to hit \"Fuck it. Done. Get out of my life.\" until the very moment it happened, and so had not properly prepared. Namely, I had left my cats at his house. Psycho has a lengthy arrest record and a tendency toward aggression and a complete lack of regard for other individuals. In the days following the breakup, our communications went something like: \"I want my cats back.\" \"Fuck you, They want to stay here.\" \"I'm coming to get them.\" \"They won't be here.\" until finally, verbatim, the message I sent was, \"Look. This is how this is going to work. I'm coming to get the cats. I'll call when I'm on my way so that you can have them ready. I'll bring the cops with me if I have to.\"  When I was on my way, I called, and he started ranting a bunch of bullshit,\"Fuck you, you're not stepping one foot in my house. Don't even pull in the drive. I'm not giving you shit. You're not taking shit from here.\" So I hung up and called police - non-emergency - to have a cop on-hand in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of an altercation. Yesterday I found out he called my mother after the cops and I had left and lied through his teeth about me. I got pissy, and reiterated my desire to **not** see him in person. He responded by getting super upset because I brought the cops to his house when he had drugs and a gun there. (He's explicitly not allowed to be in possession of a firearm, as he has two gun-related felonies under his belt.)  Apparently the existence of police in that situation warranted a response. He failed to factor in that my mother can't stand him, thinks he's a scumbag, and doesn't believe a word he says any other day of the week. (He's firmly convinced she adores him, which I think is mostly a testament to his delusional state of mind.)\n\nThere's a whole bunch of shit I'm leaving out - the manipulation, the scare-tactics, the invasions of privacy and space and boundaries, not to mention the circumstances surrounding the aforementioned threats on the lives and safety of myself and those I care most for (which is why they were the people he threatened to harm, of course.) But I feel like once I get started, this post is going to steadily devolve into me just going on this long-winded diatribe about my asshole ex, and will thus detract from it's purpose which is to find out, was I actually wrong? Given his history and the fact that I told him I was going to do a thing I then proceeded to do, was I actually the asshole for showing up, police at the ready? There are some people who have a firm, \"You don't call the cops. You don't bring cops to my door.\" mindset. And honestly, I personally have a massive bias against police. But they exist for a purpose, and while I don't really think breakup-mediation is typically something they should have to be called-upon for, I also feel like it was the least worst of a bunch of terrible options. Am I wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "You're probably already thinking \"yes\" because it's widely considered unreasonable to make that kind of ultimatum, but with context, I feel like my position will be a little more understandable.\n\nI started dating a girl in April of this year. We were both sophomores in high school at the time and we were good friends for about 3 months prior to getting together. However, we had a sort of rocky history. Long story short, in 8th grade I was a real asshole to her. We mainly spoke online and that had the effect of both shortening my fuse and taking away my filter. She had some unresolved feelings about it even going into our relationship (2 years later), which I was fully prepared to deal with.\n\n However, it was impossible to see in advance the sheer emotional toll this relationship would take on me. Every day, multiple times a day, she would find something to have an anxiety attack about, whether it was \"flashbacks\" to 8th grade or something I said or did that day. \n\nFor example, we once went out rollerskating. When it was time to go back to our friend's house, she wanted to take a picture of him using my phone. I didn't have a problem with this. However, when I looked at what she was doing after I gave it to her, I quickly noticed that she was searching through my dms on instagram. I have nothing to hide but I resented the fact that my privacy was being invaded, so instinctively I grabbed my phone out of her hands. She insisted she wasn't doing anything but I saw what I saw. \n\nShe refused to speak to me on the car ride back to our friend's house. She refused to speak to me for hours going into that night no matter how much I pleaded with her to speak to me and explain what was going on, because at the time, I had no idea why she was upset. I suspected it was because of the phone but I wasn't sure. \n\nLater, while she was using our friend's VR headset, she knowingly made her way over to me and punched me twice in the face. She still wouldn't talk to me after this. After we were finished, we went down to the basement to watch a movie. I let her pick the movie. I discreetly texted my friend to go away for a minute so I could talk to her one on one and finally figure out what was going on. \n\nHe leaves. I talk to her. She says nothing. I move over to sit on the same couch as her to get closer to her. She kicked me hard in the chest and then moved to the other couch. She still refuses to speak to me. We had approximately 30 minutes left until her mother was going to pick her up, and then we wouldn't be able to see each other for another week. (we could only hang out on weekends because I lived an hour away)\n\nWe eventually make up after I broke down into tears from pure frustration (in front of our other friend mind you, which I didn't want to do) and then she goes home. I go home as well and I text her, because we texted each other pretty much all day every day. \n\nShe spontaneously suggests that we talk about our kinks. I tepidly agree because I know I'm walking on eggshells and I don't really want to provoke any more anger from her. She starts by saying that, because of how I treated her in 8th grade, she developed a sexual affinity for psychological abuse. She said she wanted someone to \"tell her they wanted her to kill herself, then kiss her\".  I, of course, told her I wasn't comfortable doing that for her but I don't judge her for having an uncommon kink. She then has a mental breakdown because I'm \"judging\" her and \"I know you can't do that for me, my next boyfriend will.\" \n\nI spend hours into the night calming her down and reassuring her that she isn't being judged. This whole conflict is resolved at around 1:30 AM on a school night. This is an example of a more or less typical day with her. There were both worse and better days but it was generally around that level of awfulness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn August 6th, I decide to break up with her. I couldn't handle being emotionally drained every single day anymore. For the first 3 months of our 4 month relationship (which is way too fucking short to be having these kinds of problems) I was essentially a doormat for her. After the 3rd month I became more coarse and abrasive and less tolerant of her breakdowns.\n\nOne example is we were doing playground mode in fortnite. She was killing me so I was killing her back. I was laughing and I thought it was all in good fun, since, y'know, it's a fucking video game, but she hangs up on me on skype and starts telling me that she \"saw a side she hasn't seen since 8th grade\", and that she was \"scared\". I told her that she was taking the game too seriously and that she was over dramatizing me laughing and having fun. This turned into a several hour long argument.\n\nThat's the type of toxicity that happened virtually every day for the fourth month of our relationship. There were multiple occasions where I was literally driven to tears just by being in her presence and knowing the constant pain she was in, purportedly because of me. \n\nSo I broke up with her. A few weeks later, she attempts suicide. At first she says it wasn't because of me but soon after that she labeled me as the sole cause of the attempt. She had also threatened suicide to me during our relationship when she was on a vacation in Florida. She said she was on a balcony and she wanted to throw herself off, \"solely because of me.\" \n\nTo get to the point, I was perfectly fine with our mutual friend, who I will call N, maintaining his relationship with my ex. If demonizing me was how she coped, then fine. As long as she wasn't proactive about trying to ruin my reputation or get me into genuine trouble, then I wouldn't have any problems with it. \n\nRecently, my dad bought a house in my ex's town and we're moving there after Christmas break. This has absolutely nothing to do with my ex. Most of my friends live in that town because I attended school from 3rd-9th grade there. I told N to notify her because I wanted to give her time to cope before seeing my face in the hallways, since I knew that would be painful for her. \n\nShe immediately goes into a downward spiral. She's frantically posting on social media and actively trying to convince popular and influential kids at our school that I verbally abused her. She threatens to post screenshots of the alleged abuse. N saw the screenshots and said they would help my case, not hers. \n\nNow I'm not popular, but I'm relatively well known and people just by knowing me can tell I would never abuse someone the way she claims I abused her. \n\nHere's the part where my dilemma comes in. After realizing that she won't have any luck convincing people I abused her verbally, she tells her parents that I abused her physically. She claims that I left bruises on her and that she has a friend who saw the bruises. Her parents contact my father and threaten us with the prospect of filing a police report. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was perfectly comfortable allowing N and my ex to be friends before any of this happened, but the fact that she escalated it so much in such a short time (less than a week from when she found out I'm moving back) I decided I no longer wanted to share mutual friends with her. N and I have been best friends since the 6th grade. My ex and N have been friends for less than a year. \n\nI told him that, under normal circumstances, I'd have no issue with them continuing to be friends, but in light of the fact that she made an earnest attempt to sabotage my future out of spite, I was no longer comfortable with them being friends. \n\nHe told me that it wasn't my place to determine who he's friends with. I agree, but I think it says a lot about his character that he wouldn't just stop being friends with her on principle. She did, after all, threaten me and my family with legal action based on a lie. \n\nA pretty heated argument ensued. I told him he didn't understand that not only had I not abused her, but she abused me, both physically and emotionally. He told me essentially that it was my fault for not leaving the relationship sooner, that \"there was no gun to my head\".  I told him to steer clear from me and blocked him on everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** I have an ex who used to have manageable levels of craziness, but now that she learned I'm moving back into her town, she threatened to take me to court for physically abusing her (which never happened) and my best friend, despite this, refuses to cut her off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting my best friend to remain friends with my psychotic ex? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

      "description": "So I've already broken up with this girlfriend. It's been a while and I'm still kind of conflicted on one of our issues. For context, I'm 17 and she was 18. While we were dating she had a job at a local retirement home as a waitress making $12/hr, and she worked full time. Since she lived with her parents, she didn't have any bills to pay and as a result she had a lot of disposable income.\n\nI, on the other hand, had no job and didn't really want one. I liked having my free time. My mom, who I live with, was struggling with money at the time and didn't have a lot of spare income. \n\nMy ex was always bored when we hung out at her place. Normally we would just watch movies and such, but she got bored of this eventually and soon wanted to go out and do things. We went out to eat sometimes, and other times we would go play laser tag or, on one occasion, go to a local golf field which was fairly expensive. Every time we went out, I always made sure with her that she was okay with paying for me. I didn't like asking my mom for money, so I always made sure my ex was okay with paying before I asked her. \n\nRight before we broke up, we got into an argument over text where she blew up on me for not having a job and she was really getting annoyed with paying for me. She asked me why I never asked my mom, and I told her that I never asked my mom because she was always okay with paying for things and she never showed any signs of annoyance with it.\n\nHere's the part I'm worried about: She asked me why I never asked my mom and I replied by saying that I preferred to ask my ex to pay for things because she has a lot of disposable income while my mom was tight on money most of the time. She just replied with \"Wow\" and then stopped responding to my texts.\n\nWas I being an asshole by not asking my mom for money and instead relying on her to pay for things? I told her that if she wasn't okay with paying for me then there's loads of other things that we could do that's fun and free, but she just said that those were boring and she liked going out. \n\nThanks for the advice.\n\n",

      "description": "I live in Colorado, a legal state. I am a 35 year old woman. For many women, unwinding means a bottle of wine. For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.\n\nMy sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.\n\nAbout an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said \"I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things. Like ever.\n\nI panicked, she seemed fine, I called poison control and called her mom and panicked a lot more. I felt awful. It hadn't even occurred to me that this is a thing that would happen. Honestly, I did not foresee this happening. At all. Niece is completely fine, she ended up falling asleep after asking me for a grilled cheese sandwich with cut up hot dogs in it and asking if we could watch a movie. I stayed with her, kept her hydrated, etc, and apologized at least six million times to my sister, who was horrified and actually screamed at me. Once again, my niece is *fine.*\n\nEven my parents are in on it, blaming me and telling me I should have those things in a safe where no one could get to them, how could I possibly thing it was okay to have them around a child, no one should ever let their kids around me because next time I might give them a beer, etc etc. And I've been uninvited from anywhere that my niece will be, because they think somehow I planned for this to happen.\n\nI feel awful, like I've said a million times, but I really don't think I'm an asshole for this happening. I didn't do this on purpose. I have never needed to lock up my edibles before for the same reason I would never lock up a bottle of wine. When my sister called me in a panic, it wasn't like I thought \"Oh my god, I need to immediately childproof my home!\"\n\nBut am I the asshole here? Do I really deserve what's happening now?",

      "description": "  \n\nAs a bit of background, my girlfriend and I have been dating for  \\~2.5 years, and she has always been pretty insecure of her body – to the point where to took months for her to let me see her fully naked. I've always been very understanding and supportive of that, going out of my way to make her feel beautiful and comfortable in her skin and recently we even started showering together! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, about 4 months ago she got an IUD. Was totally on board, and regardless it's her body and thus her decision. Since then though, there's been two issues that I have not mentioned in hopes that they would either go away naturally or she might notice herself. Firstly, she has been spotting a LOT. Like every single time we have sex now I feel as if I am literally murderin' dat pussy. I'm probably in the minority here but I'm not particularly a big fan of blood in general and still have mental scars from an incident of going down on a girl on her period unknowingly. That's the lesser of the two issues though. She has also started to smell progressively worse down there ever since the IUD, to the point that I can often smell her outside her pants if I get too close and smells kind of like B.O mixed with urine – not exactly appealing. I do have a pretty sensitive sense of smell, but it's blatantly obvious now and shocking to me that she hasn't noticed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway last night she asked me why I haven't been going down on her lately and I felt as if I had to be honest with her about it. I made it known it wasn't towards her personally, placed the blame on the IUD and how I've noticed it only since then, and tried to play it off like it wasn't as big of a deal as I've actually been finding it. She was still extremely hurt and instantly went to the shower where I heard her crying. I felt like absolute shit for the rest of the night and was thinking I just shouldn't have said anything. This morning I heard her make an appointment to get the IUD removed. ",

They only worked with each other  for about half a year and she had stopped working with him about 2 months before he tragically died in a car wreck. \n   Now here is why I am jealous, I hardly knew the guy, met him two times, and now I'm finding out that they used to hang out all the time out side of work and talk on the phone every day. I was unaware of this and thought they were just work friends at least that's what it my girlfriend made it seem like. Tonight we went to have some drinks and on the car ride home she confided in me she was worried about going to visit his grave this year because of the nightmares she had the last time. \n  Now I'm not against her going to visit him even though he is buried 4 hours away from our home town but I just don't understand why this guy was so special to her.  We have mutual friends and I've met plenty of her work friends before but it just seems like she was hiding him from me and now she cant get over that he's gone. I confronted her about this and now I'm in the dog house, shes pissed and crying and wont talk to me a out it\n  After finding out how close of a relationship they had behind my back even after he is gone, I am still jealous and confused, aita?",

He had a girl on the side. \n\nI felt a whirlwind of emotions. I wanted to wake him up and cuss him out. But instead I got dressed and wrote a note by his bedside explaining what I found out before I left.

I have friends who snoop their boyfriends phones all the time, for no reason other than just being nosy. I’m against that. \n\nI’m glad I did it. I’m glad I didn’t live another day, another week, another 3 months with someone who was cheating on me. “Ignorance is bliss”? Fuck that.

      "description": "Both my kids go to this preschool that's at this church. Most everybody is not a member of said church, myself included. To clarify before I go any further, the preschool is a good mix of all ethnic backgrounds, no stereotyping.\n\nI like to believe in a good person and to raise my kids to be even better than myself, I have my faults. I tend to be the \"it's the principle\" type of person. With that being said, obviously no one is getting hurt by what these parents are doing but ffs they all seem privileged. I'd say (completely made up number, which I'm known for) 80% of the parents park in handicap spots while dropping off and picking up their kids. It's infuriating! I immediately think of the people who park in the fire lane at grocery stores, and then leave their grocery cart on the parking spot. Lazy fu*KS! One mother even double parks 2 cars in by literally parking in the aisle (which I'm half partial about bc she's double parking the obviously non handicap people in) but it blocks traffic. Especially since the parking lot is one way and about 63% of parents leave the lot going head on with traffic and look at me like I'm in the wrong. Out of all the people who bring their kids to this preschool, only one has a handicap sticker. The church has a daily lunch at 1pm for the congregation and that's the same tone we pick up our children so they literally are taking spots of people who actually are handicap and the parking lot is gravel. \n\nAnywho, I drop little comments just under my breath to my kids while walking past these people. See that kids, don't be like her. Or, as I'm driving while cars are driving the wrong direction, pointing to how the flow of traffic is and not slowing down because they're too stupid to follow directions. \n\nIt's hard to dislike some of these parents because some are generally nice people and so are their kids but at the same time, I think they're a-holes. \n\nI'm not naive about what constitutes as being handicap. Not everyone physically fits the bill of what the general public considers handicap but I hate giving the benefit of the doubt (1 of many faults) when so many people ignore the law.\n\nAnd yes, it's on church property so it's technically not illegal because it's out of the polices jurisdiction, but it's the principle.\n\nAlso, I have spoken to some of them and asked them why they do it or do they realize they are. I either get a look or the common, it's not hurting anyone, it's just for a minute! \n\nTldr: parents park in handicap spots &gt; I make snide remarks under my breath when I walk by them. ",

This was at a time in my life when I was really insecure and dealing with major depression. The first year of our relationship was great, but over time he started to become more and more abusive. At first it started with him being really controlling and jealous, and escalated to him choking me out one night because a guy at a bar told me “I like your band t-shirt” and apparently I said “thank you” too nicely. So after years of being abused mentally, verbally and physically, I finally snapped when I found out he cheated on me with a mutual friend’s gf and ended it for good.\n\nWe have known each other since high school, and shared many mutual friends. When it came out why I had broken up with him (abuse and cheating) he lost some of the friends from our group. We all have distanced ourselves from him because he is violent and a pathological liar, and we are done dealing with it.\n\nAbout a year after I broke up with Ryan, I started dating someone we have both known since high school. However, my current bf, we’ll call him Wes, ended his friendship with him shortly after I broke it off, claiming he never liked him anyway and this was his chance to finally cut ties with him. When Ryan found out I was dating Wes, he bombarded me with texts, claiming I was a whore, we were both traitors, and threatened to “come after me cuz he’s got guns and I know he’s not afraid to use them.” \n\nReddit please be honest, AITA and a bad person for dating someone my ex and I were both friends with at one point?",

He largely chose this after seeing my YouTube channel grow a fair amount within in the past year. But the thing is, I'm a content creator as a hobby - it gets me a little extra money at the moment and if I can make it a career eventually then cool, but I'm not counting on it and still work a day job. Joe dropped out of high school about a year ago and won't get a job because he's insistent on being a streamer. He tried to get a channel started on YouTube but gave up on that since he wasn't getting any views, so he's moved over to Twitch and has been streaming daily for the past couple months. However, he hasn't had much luck in gaining an audience. He's not the worst streamer ever, he just doesn't have a very good personality for it - he's rather shy and he'll sometimes sit there on the game menu if there's no one to talk to him (which is often) like \"um... so uh... I don't know what to do... hmm... well...\" It's awkward as fuck to watch, then usually he'll message me to join because he's terrible at interacting with the audience or coming up with something to talk about on his own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also lives with his parents and they often nag at him to get a job, they're worried he's not doing anything with his life, etc., and I'm starting to agree with them. I've tried being supportive but after his streams he'll sometimes message me being all sad going on about how no one's watching him and he doesn't know what to do because he wants to be a streamer so bad, it's his life's dream even though he just decided on this a couple months ago. It's become rather frustrating, like he expects to become an instant success overnight. Even for me, it took 5 years to get to where I am now and only recently starting growing a decent amount in the past year. I've tried telling him that maybe he needs something to fall back on, perhaps not stream every single day and instead work part-time a few days a week, but he completely refuses, says he doesn't want to neglect his channel or whatever, and if he wants to be successful he needs to put all his time and effort into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's getting to the point where I want to have a firm discussion with Joe about the realities of his \"dream\" and tell him his parents are right, and he shouldn't waste his life like this chasing something that's probably never going to happen. But at the same time I feel like crushing his dreams would also be an asshole move being his friend, especially since he looks up to me a lot and he's stated before that he aspires to be more like me. Would I be the asshole to put my foot down in this situation?",

      "description": "This one kid in my school is a really strange personality, I want to be his friend but he makes it so hard (or maybe I'm just not seeing something). I was his friend about 2 weeks ago, we got pretty close, talked on discord up to 4 hours a day, but then he stopped talking to me and started making jokes/insults (insulting my appearance etc) towards me on a group chat we are in because (I think) he didn't like the fact that the girl he has a crush on is my best friend, keep in mind I don't like her sexually at all.\n\nThey used to meet before school every morning, and the girl thought that it was a bit boring and that I should come too, so I started showing up, then one day the boy seemed very upset, we were good friends at the time before we met there every morning but after we started meeting it was not really the same. We asked the boy what was up and he said nothing, after school, he texted the girl saying that I was getting in the way and that he wanted her to himself (she told me this). I felt bad so I stopped coming but it didn't change anything.\n\n He made more and more jokes over time and eventually it got really bad. To the point where whenever I saw him typing on the group chat I knew it was going to be an edit of me or an insult towards me (about 7 out of 10 messages were about me, I am not being biest and/or exaggerating). It was like he hated me, I didn't really understand why because I wasn't even talking to him anymore, he started making jokes about how I liked the girl and how I could never get her and things like this. I never said anything insulting back, I usually told him to grow up or to stop. This wasn't really that bad just he was making people I don't even talk to or know dislike me. He knew I'd rather be his friend that argue and fight but he proceeded.\n\n A few days later we had an argument about the girl, he was saying I want to go out with her but I can't, I said that the only reason he is stressing out over me talking about this is because he likes her, I told him to stop trying to mess my relationships with other people up and to stop talking about me, at the end of the argument the majority of the people who were in the group chat agreed with me and they all told him that he needs to grow up. He only said more things after this, I started saying insults back because I was getting angry but most of the time I ignored it. I thought he was bullying me for attention or something.\n\nToday I'd had enough, he had been going with the insults about me, my parents, my personality for too long and I decided to just end it. I warned him several times prior to this that he should stop trying to put me down or I will say something about him and the girl he didn't want me to say. I didn't tell him what it was. He egged me on to do it for the whole day and so I did. I told the chat that he told the girl that I'm getting in his way and that he wants her all to himself. I feel bad, I don't think I won anything here, I'd just made things worse. AITA for telling the group chat he  said he wants the girl all to himself so that I could feel better for one day. I feel as though I just kicked a yapping dog in the face, I wanted it to shut up, but maybe I took it too far.",

I'm at university so idk I know quite a lot of my friends are a similar way, even moreso than me.\n\nIn school, I was painfully anxious and shy, as well as really skinny and an easy target. Now that I've bulked up a bit and dress better, and in a new environment at university, my confidence has shot way up.\n\nI'm just really arrogant with girls because this is how I see the best way to act is. The last 2 girls I got with, I was highly arrogant with and I pursued them because they seemed dumb and clueless (not trying to insult them, that's just how they seemed), they seemed dumb and stroked my ego, they'd say shit to me like ''You're so smart'' and ''You're so good looking'' and I'd eat that shit up, I'll say things like ''Yeah keep on going, tell me more lol'' because I'm using them to stroke my own ego. Most of this happens at parties where alcohol is involved, of course, but yeah.\n\nThree girls who knew me from high school, saw me at uni (they go same uni) and they were talking about me, they were saying ''Can you believe how arrogant throwawayfebasm has become?? Who the hell does he think he is?''.\n\nWhen I found out they said this, I feel like I took a drug. I was feeding on their negative comments, it made my ego even bigger.\n\nMy friends act similar to me but my sister (24F) has seen how I acts and she said I am being a asshole and need to stop. My mother (50F) also knows how I behave and she said I need to pack it in but my dad (52M) started laughing and said I'm a good lad, so idk what to do here, my guy friends and dad are fine with me an support me but my sister and mother don't like it, AITA?",

I wasn't too much better. \n\nHowever after the party was over (she had left about 10-20 minutes earlier as she was staying right by the venue I didn't think she'd have any trouble getting back)\n\nAs I leave the party she starts to call me asking me to pick her up, but being obnoxious/drunk about it, saying that she needs me and not giving any details, but because she sounded like she was outside I wanted to make sure she got home safe.\n\nThese calls to back and forth with her hanging up a few times in between and sending texts, eventually we meet up and I walk her back to her hotel room, she invites me in. In my head I'm thinking that \"*Okay, I'll make sure she's set to sleep*\". \n\nShe's being generally flirty, saying how comfy the bed is and how nice it would be to cuddle then says to join her in the bed, which I do (thinking back on it, being stupid).\n\nStill in my head thinking that I'm just going to leave.

Their faces were red and they had been laughing so I assumed it was a joke that I hadn't heard.\nLater that lesson I was put into group work with the mutual friend and I asked what it was about, he wouldn't say at first, so I asked again, and he told me that both X and Y were on their periods.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?

      "description": "Alright, so, this just happened. Last night, my roommate/“friend” who is male texted me “Love you Goodnight” and I thought nothing about it and replied with “Love you too bud Goodnight” and he responded the next day with “I’ll stop saying I love you since it makes you uncomfortable” and tbh it does because I don’t just say that to anyone. We’ve been living together since last March and since then he’s tried being my friend but with all the issues because of him confessing his love to me (I’m male too but he’s gay) and I shut him down on numerous occasions because I wasn’t comfortable. Like, I support LGBT but knowing that my own roommate regardless of gender or sexual orientation that I’m 10000% not interested in had said that, I just told him that I’m not into him. The entire time we’ve been living together, I just didn’t click with his vibe. We have common interests but he’s just very negative about a lot of things about himself which makes me feel bad. Not to mention he is skeptical of every guy I meet because I used to experiment with them during our friendship and excluded him. Once that was over, the assumptions never stopped. Thinking I sneak out or are talking to guys nearby like we are dating. It’s been driving me nuts. I’m only pointing out the negative things he does. He helps me with my pets, pays rent, buys gifts on holidays and cooks sometimes too. He gives me advice on my parents and relationships but when it comes to men or friendship, that’s what bothers him the most. I am very friendly with new people and he always points it out when we come back home. I’m usually all in the huggy mood with women and, because he keeps assuming I’m sleeping with any guy within a 10 mile radius, I avoid them like the plague or shut down my emotions when talking to them so he doesn’t think I’m seeing them on the side(which I’m not)ANYWAY, getting back to the I love you thing. He brought it up like an hour ago at work. “You didn’t even answer my text” and I said “Oh the “Love you thing?” Yeah, you can stop” and he just said “okay. Another thing to add to my list”. Every few minutes after that he’d mumble something like “Guess that’s another thing you’re lying about” (I kept the sexual life from him which was one of the things I lied about because it wasn’t his business) but I just kept to myself and pretended I didn’t hear it. COINCIDENTALLY, A coworker was on the phone with a guy friend and he was closing the conversation as he walked past our office to which he said “Aii Love you bo” and that triggered my friend to scoff. I’ve never said “I love you” to any of my guy friends. EVER. And It was just unorthodox to me. He left to talk to a coworker nonchalantly to see what they’d say about the situation and now it’s my turn. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole for putting him in a separate category as far as affection goes?",

      "description": "Just FYI this is a throwaway account.\n\nSo let me back it up a bit. Around 2 or so years ago, I got my first girlfriend. I really liked her and was ecstatic to be with her. It was such a new experience for someone to have feelings for me in return, and I have a lot of great memories of being with this specific girl. I look back at these memories very fondly. When she broke up with me though, I was heartbroken. It came out of nowhere and I never got a reason as to why she didn't want to be with me anymore. Fast forward to the present, and I still have feelings for her deep down. I don't know if they'll ever go away, and I think this is due to the breakup not being mutual. Anyways, my best friend recently started talking to her. For the sake of this post, let's just call this girl \"Sarah\". So my best friend started talking to Sarah. Big deal right? I didn't think anything of it at the time, and didn't even consider if they were having a romantic relationship. More and more, he started acting really distant. He would hang out with our mutual friends, but not even talk to me. Later on, he finally told me that he asked Sarah out, and she said yes. I honestly couldn't even believe him. The thing is, we've PROMISED each other that we wouldn't date each other's ex girlfriends. I've never even considered asking out any of his ex girlfriends, and for him to just go against his word, makes me feel really betrayed. Even if we didn't promise to do this sort of thing, I'd think it's a \"Bro-Code\" given, to not do this kind of shit. And I know for a fact, that the only reason he would go for Sarah, is because he is too scared to put himself out there and meet new women. I honestly feel really betrayed in this situation. I should also mention, he's thrown me and our mutual friends under the bus for girls in the past. So I don't know why I didn't see something like this coming. He knows how I felt about her, and how I feel about her today. We've been friends for much longer than both of us even knew Sarah, so it baffles me that he would just betray me like this. Am I the asshole for thinking this way? Should I just let them date and not say anything about it?",

      "description": "Oh boy, where to begin?\n\nSo, a couple of years ago, I developed a crush on this girl we'll call J. Now, things were going fine for a while, J liked me back too, so....what happened?\n\nFrankly, I had no idea.\n\nOne day, she came to school pissed. I asked here why she was angry. She wouldn't say, but I had a suspicion to why she would say this. see, the day before, we had a political discussion. We all had to give our opinion and respectfully debate with our peers. Now, I'm a hard Republican(trump, border wall, Right views)while she's a hard Democrat( patriarchy, feminist, fat acceptance, left views). This wasn't a problem until the debate, which, despite the main rule about keeping things civil, got a little heated, especially between me and her.\n\nSo jump back to the day she came to school pissed. I asked her why. She didn't respond. Now, this kept on for a MONTH. Finally, I grew a pair and decided to joke around with her. One day, when she was particularly angry, I said the following.\n\n\"Why are you so mad? Is it your time of the month?\"\n\nLet the chaos ensue.\n\nFrom that day on, she despised the ground I walked on. She would do the following\n\n- try to get me in trouble for any goddamn reason, she even lied about many things. EX: reported me for saying the N word on the day I was sick with the flu.\n\n-succesfully turned all my friends against me for a year, using the excuse that I was \"homophobic, racist, sexist etc.\" Which I am not. Disagreeing with someone over the border wall does not make me racist\n\n- got angry over the tiniest things. \nEX 1:threw a hissy fit because I took \"her\" seat on the bus(no assigned seats.) I offered to move, but she just gave me the death glare and sat somewhere else.\n\nEX 2: yelled at me because my friend left his banana peel on the table. She told me that he was my responsibility or whatever. I told her to take her complaints with him.\n\nSo much shit has happened with her, to the point where other people just don't like hanging out with her anymore. She keeps saying shit like \"Oh, finally, the people I actually care about \" to her friends. She insults them and disregards them on a day to day basis. Now, with all this happening, I apologized about the \"time of the month\" comment. three times. She didn't care. She was in it for the drama at this point. She loved drama.\n\nYou know how I know?\n\nAll of this shit happened 2-3 years ago. All of it. And she keeps bringing it up. She uses it as an excuse! She constantly brings up irrelevant shit and causes controversy just to see a bit of drama! I'm sick and tired of her,but I wonder? AITA? I don't know? Could you guys help me decide?",

      "description": "Ok so background: my dad has a seasonal job and doesn’t work during the winter time. During this time he collects unemployment checks in which he needs to either call or fill out an online form answering pretty basic questions (i.e. have you worked a temporary job? Gotten paid for work?) which basically just try to filter out whether or not you have a job during this time. My dad’s first language isn’t english so he doesn’t feel super comfortable answering automated questions on the phone, and he isn’t good with computers. I’ve done this for him in the past, gladly, because I’m usually at work or home when I do it and it’s not a very big deal. The thing is, is that you’re required to fill out this form on a specific day and between a few hours, otherwise you miss out on that biweekly paycheck. I’m going out of the country in the middle of January and my dad insists that I can call or go online to do this. I ask him why he can’t do it while I’m away (or ask his coworkers, which he has done in the past), and he asks “why can’t you just do it on the computer”. I tell him I’m not taking my laptop abroad, which then he says that my phone is a computer and I should be able to do it on there. \n\nAITA for getting annoyed at this? I’ll be out of the country celebrating a friend’s wedding. I can’t access certain government websites while abroad anyway, which I remind him of after we had this conversation. He seemed a bit sad that I got annoyed during the initial conversation. So AITA for not being overly excited to do this while I’m away? I’d only be away for a week and would be fine to do it before and after my trip. My dad getting super sad over this makes me feel like an awful child (I’m 26 btw) and that I’m not doing enough for them for just saying no (for one week!!)",

      "description": "First time poster here.\n\nThis happened this past summer. \n\nWe live in a HCOL area. Lots of wealthy/entitled people. We are not poor, but (very) far from wealthy. \n\nThe wife and I take our kids to the local public park. Now, this park is awesome and FREE. It has a huge splash park, three playgrounds, tennis courts, paved nature trails, etc.\n\nThe final cool feature it has, is a full sized carousel. This is the only thing that costs anything, besides stuff at the concession stand. It’s $5 USD per child, per ride. This is where the conflict occurs. \n\nAfter a fun morning of splash pad, my wife and I decide to get our kiddos some ice cream and then head to the carousel because you have to buy tickets at the concession stand. The carousel only runs every 15 minutes and by the time we get to the carousel people/kids are piling in. Now, my son can be picky and normally I don’t play along with his pickiness unless he’s willing to be a big kid about it. So, when we see the only seat left is a non-moving horse, intended for very small children, I ask if he would like to wait 15 minutes for the next one to get a better seat. He says yes and waits, just being a good kid, eating his ice cream and choosing the type of seat he wants. \n\nHe settles on an eagle. It’s huge and colorful and he's really excited for it. \n\nCue the Other Dad (OD). We make small talk ask our boys, who were about the same age, which animal they are going to pick. My son says the eagle, the other little boy says a lion. Cool. \n\nAt some point in our 15 minutes we talk about how our local movie theater is great because you can pick your seat ahead of time and not be at the will of the “Social Contract” of waiting in line for your turn to pick a seat. From this I get the feeling that we’re both on board with the seat choices and the way our next shared experience should go. I was wrong. \n\nAs soon as we get let into the carousel OD flat out runs right to the eagle and plops his son right on to it. \n\nI gotta be honest, I was flabbergasted. Normally, I would have just been like “oh well, dude’s a jerk” and helped my son pick another seat. I didn’t this time. I just had had a conversation with this guy. WTH?!\n\nI looked right at the guy and said “ Really?! We just talked about this” He shrugged, as if to say “tough cookies.” \n\nNope. Not good enough. \n\nNow, because of the nature of this ride the seats filled up quickly around us. I looked at him AGAIN and said “Really?” It was uncomfortable, to say the least. \n\nAfter a few VERY tense moments, he picked his kid up and moved him to another seat. And his kid started bawling his eyes out. It was bad. I felt bad. I still kind of do. \n\nI picked my son up and put him on the eagle and he thoroughly enjoyed his ride. We walked home with our ice cream cones. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTLDR;\nI made a kid cry because I made his dad give my son a seat on a carousel after we had all discussed which seats we were picking. \nI ",

      "description": "This happened last semester of college, so a 3-4 months back. I'm posting now because I only discovered this sub a couple days ago, ok story time. So every Monday Wednesday, and Friday, I had this astronomy class, and the class that was being taught right before my astronomy class was supposed to be finished at 9:50 AM each of those days, with my class starting at 10:00 AM. For countless weeks I'd been walking in a couple minutes after 9:50 and most students from the previous class would be gone or leaving, so I could sit and wait for my class to start. One day, I get to class and when I open the door, the professor from the previous class is still lecturing. I didn't want to look like an idiot, and the door was in the back so I didn't distract anybody when I entered, so I took a seat in the very back. As soon as I sat down, the professor stopped lecturing for a good 5 or so seconds and just gave me this death glare. This prompted everyone in the class to turn around and stare at me too, then he continued lecturing. This made me feel terrible, and I immediately begin questioning whether what I did or not was wrong. I checked my phone and the class was supposed to be over 3 minutes prior, so I wasn't sure whether I was wrong for \"interrupting\" or the professor was wrong for going late and making a show of my sitting down.

      "description": "So yesterday while me, my father and my brother were having dinner, we were talking about this family we knew and I mentioned that one of their kids had told me his mother is bisexual. My dad immediately asked if his mom had girlfriends from time to time or something to which I said no, they are happily married. My dad then asked why in the hell would these kids my age (all approximately 14-17) know their mother is bi. \nI, myself a bisexual person, was a little confused and I said I thought it was a normal thing to share, to which neither my father nor my brother agreed with.\n\n My father then said that in the case my mother was bi, (she is straight, so this is a hypothetical scenario) he would find it strange if she shared it with not only me and my brother, but anyone. He said he would feel insecure if his partner would tell people she’s bi (but happy with her partner and not planning on leaving him). To me it sounded like he wanted my hypothetically bi mother to pretend she’s straight just because she’s in a straight marriage, plus it also sounded like he thought a bi woman was more likely to leave him for another woman.  \n\nI was pretty upset at this point and I said to my father that I thought this statement was kind of biphobic. Now my father knows I’m bisexual myself and he’s been extremely supportive so he did not like my accusation at all. Where I meant ‘hey, this is kind of biphobic to say and it has upset me.’ He took it as ‘I think you’re a homophobe.’ And got angry in return, saying he did not deserve that.\n \nA bit of pointless discussion later I stormed off to my room as he refused to apologize, and when I said I didn’t like hearing this stuff in my own house because I hear it at school so much already, he said he would not walk on eggshells around me. I felt like I was reasonable asking him to be a little considerate, as I feel his whole standpoint kind of came from the stereotype bi people would not have ‘enough’ in one relationship.\n\nSo, AITA in this scenario? Should I have heard him out and not gotten upset or was it okay for me to be angry?",

      "description": "TL;DR best friend gets mad at me every time she sees I’m at this girls house she doesn’t like. She claims the girl stole from her when really the girl just didn’t pay her back. Aita for not seeing it the way my best friend does?\n\nAlmost two years ago before my best friend (X) and I were even close, she was good friends with this other girl (Y). Back then, I wasn’t close with either one of them, just acquaintances.\n\nThis is from X’s POV: At that time Y was going through some hardships. [I believe] she got kicked out of her familys house and was living with her boyfriend, I don’t think she had a job. X &amp; Y were hanging out and X offered Y $100 because she was behind on rent. (I can’t remember if Y asked for it or not). Y accepted it and said she would pay X back. Weeks pass and X is asking Y back for the money and Y is basically saying she doesn’t have it. Months pass, X starts getting aggressive and messaging Y’s family saying Y stole $100 from her. X starts telling everyone Y stole $100 from her. One day X runs into Y in public and starts going off about the $100. At this point X and I are very close, but she’s been getting upset with me because I’be been associating with Y lately. \n\nI only associate with Y because one of my good friends is roommates with her. Whenever I go over to see my friend she’s always around. We all drink together but most of the time there’s several people in the room and I hardly talk to her. Twice I’ve tried to talk to Y about the incident and see if I can help X out. The first time I brought it up she told me her POV which was the only reason X gave her the money was for coke. I didn’t care for the reason, I still just asked her to pay it back. She said no. Another time X was pissed at me so I messaged Y again just asking if she can at least say sorry and show remorse. Y refused.\n\nI’m kind of torn because\n1) that’s not my definition of stealing. To me, stealing is taking without permission.\n2) why would X give a person with no job $100?\n3) back then, they were all indulged in coke and loose behavior, I personally don’t take promises from anyone like that.\n4) I was taught to only make offers I can afford to lose because not everyone keeps their word of paying you back. If I have $20 i can only *afford* to give you $5, why would I give you my only $20?\n\nPersonally, I think X just needs to take this L and learn from it. It’s running on two years now. I understand it’s the principal but X has a lot of money already, she’s definitely not struggling. But then again neither is Y anymore. She still doesn’t live with her family but they’re on good terms. Y comes from an extremely wealthy family where $100 is a grain of sand to their wallet.

      "description": "AITA or is he? \n\nContext: \nmy bf's friend's mom is organizing a trip to Amsterdam for her sons friends because she lives there. She is paying for their flights and he is unsure of the boarding situation. \n\nWhen he was invited last year we talked about me going with him and paying my own way, flight, lodging,  and food.\n\n This is because our jobs, we have very little PTO which vacation, sick, and personal are all in one, and a very strict attendance policy at our jobs we cant really do much with vacation time. It's really easy to get fired because of attendance. \n\nHence we wont be able to take a real vacation together because of these trips if he goes solo. \n\nYesterday he admitted that he never told them about me coming a long because he didnt want to have the awkward conversation of asking if I could come, and didnt tell me i shouldn't come because he didnt want to hurt my feelings.\n\nThis is AFTER i used up all of my PTO and scheduled it for these trips.\n\nSome context:\n\nHe is also a groomsman in a wedding in FL that we planned on going to together. Last year he was also a groomsman for a wedding we planned on going to together but he never sent the plus 1 and by the time I grabbed it and mailed it in, it was too late and he told me he was going to stay with the guys (lengthy car ride so we were going to get a hotel together originally) so I stayed home alone, and btw it was our first anniversary, he left friday, our anniversary was Saturday (day of the wedding, which would have been ok if we were there together) sent me anniversary flowers and a bear-never did this before, and came back Sunday.\n\nThis upcoming wedding invitation did not have a plus 1 option so he was supposed to confirm with his friend that I can come.\nWhich he hasn't done. PTO already put in for this too.\n\nFor Amsterdam and Europe, for months I have been asking him to confirm dates, details, and to tell them I'm coming but paying for myself. We agreed that we were going together no matter what unless PTO got declined for me, or if I cant afford it. -which is not the case.\n\nLast night he got communication from his friends mom that she is going to order his flight ticket and confirm with him that he is coming. he failed to tell her or his friend that I am coming. \n\nLast night was when he finally admitted after I got upset that he hasn't told them I'm coming, that he felt bad and weird asking them if I can come when I wasnt invited\n ( I do not know them, he has never introduced me to his friends, we only hang out with his family, our mutual work friends, and my friends- which me hanging out with my friends without him makes him feel uncomfortable so if hes with his friends I'm alone at home ) \n\ni have one day a week when one girl-friend sleeps over on mondays because a group of friends/co workers come over for D&amp;D and she lives too far to go home later. \n\nHes been trying to get me to not have her sleepover because \"our bed\" at my place is his bed too and he doesnt like her.\n\nWe have been together for over a year, work together, and he stays at my house fri-sunday nights every week. Our weekends are always spent together unless he hangs out with his friends (not often, they live pretty far) and we hangout at work mon-thursday. \n\nI am not only upset, furious, and hurt, but this is something I have been considering breaking up over. We talked it over but reached no resolution as to if I'm going on either trip. \n\nI'm so hurt that he would rather lead me on and hurt me later and completely putting something off because he doesnt want to have an \"awkward conversation\". \n\nHe did this last year too. He went to a bachelor party in Vegas for several days with a group of guys I dont know-which I was okay with, but because he was saving up for vegas, we didnt get to go an a big trip together for vacation and i settled for a weekend camping trip a couple hours away and another weekend trip to a beach in the winter a few hours away, both trips I had to pay for just to get him to come.\n\nI am his first GF ever, hes never been in a serious relationship until me. Me:F(29) him: M(26.5)\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling upset, hurt, and potentially leave him because of this if he really does go without me?\n\n#TLDR: bf M(26.5) is going to Amsterdam and Europe- his trip being paid for by his friends mom, and Florida to be with friends. We planned for me(F 29) to go and pay for myself, but turns out he never told the people who invited him that I am going, I dont know them, and I was officially uninvited by him, because of never actually being invited by them to begin with. Am I the asshole for feeling hurt and potentially leaving him after months of talking about us going together?",

      "description": "Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "New to reddit and on mobile, I apologize. \n\n\nI had this friend in a grade lower than me. At first she was awesome and we understood each other and our problems. We were similar. Soon though, she started to morph into something I didn’t like. She would do the classic guilt trip whenever something didn’t go her way. \n\nEx: I can’t hang out with her because of a family meeting “Oh don’t be sorry. It’s not that I’m disappointed! I’m just glad that you told me.” \n\nThings like that would bug me. She’s also in the LGBTQ+ community and is trans and pan. I’m so proud of her for being open and proud but it got to be too much too often. Every ten minutes, “hey guess what! I’m trans!” And a stupid little nod. Snapchat, constantly. She would always blow up my phone too. \n\nWe were hanging out with a mutual friend at the mall and were in the apple store. I hear her tell our friend “hey make an Animoji of GotSpawnKilled” I said NO and went back to drawing on the iPads. A couple of minutes later I hear her say, “look I made one of GotSpawnKilled” I was mad, I told her to delete it and she said she would. \n\nA couple hours pass and I’m bored at home. I’m looking at Snapchat for minor entertainment and see she’s posted. “Huh, what could this be?” It’s none other that the Animoji she made of me. I’m pissed. I send a message saying, “you said you would delete it why is this on your story?” She gets all “sad” and regretful. I don’t remember much (bad memory even if this was a few days ago). Basically I get all mad that she completely disrespected me and did what I directly asked for her not to do. \n\nI go back to my day. She then sends me a snap from her story “I think I just lost the trust of one of my friends and I’m so scared that I’m going to lose her. I can only be embarrassed around her now.” Now I’m totally pissed. “See what I posted on my story for you? 🖤\n\nI start telling her that she needs to respect my boundaries and how I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks where she’s been so annoying and disrespecting me. (Taking FaceTime photos, sending me inappropriate pictures, calling my DOG homophobic, and then this) \n\nShe starts calling me two-faced and a bad person. I just tried to be honest when she wanted me to be honest with her. Now I’m the bad person?\n\n\nFeel free to completely destroy me for this 😂😂",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to visit my dad as long as he wants?",
      "description": "So my father lives across the US, and I have to visit every summer because of divorce policies or whatever the specifics are. I'm supposed to visit for ~3 weeks, because that gives time to visit him, do activites, and see extended family. Last year was my first summer visiting, and my brother came out with me, however it got all messed up.\n\nTwo days before my flight, my grandfather called my mother and let us know my dad was in jail for heroin usage after he was found passed out in the bathroom. And a lot of it; they even charged him with intent to distribute. What this meant is I spent three weeks with my brother in the state, and jumped around to different relatives because we had no stable transportation without complications.\n\nThe three weeks weren't too good; we did go to a pretty boardwalk, and stayed in an RV. We were with my grandfather, and my grandmother who isn't blood related, and she has an autistic son (~30ish M). This wouldn't have been an issue, however she never properly taught him manners, how to do self-care (showering), or anything of the sorts. For the manners problem: I wore skirts and shorts because it was summertime, and hot as hell. (I'm underage, if that helps clarify why I'm upset over this.) He peeked up my skirt as I was getting out of the car, and stared at me as I slept, and as I was getting ready for the day. He constantly stood close to me, and when I told my grandparents I was uncomfortable, they just laughed it off as 'me being rude.'\n\nAfter a week and a half of hiding in the bathroom and eating far away from her son, we finally got the chance to stay in my dad's house with his girlfriend. However, she was drinking from 10 AM to 10 PM before crashing out, and getting upset if we didn't express joy about my dad. We also got tossed to two other family members during this time. There was arguments with my whole family, and I did not have a good time at all until the end. He got out of jail in time for us to see him for about two days, and we had a barbeque and everything. That was the only fully enjoyable time I had out there.\n\nWhich brings me to the point of this post. I was out there for three weeks, and didn't enjoy it. I only want to go for two weeks this summer, given the fact last year was straight up shit and my brother won't be flying out w me this year to make things tolerable. My father is saying 'either stay out here for the whole three weeks and enjoy it, or don't see me at all.' He has been in court ordered rehab programs and everything, but I don't want to even risk the fact he might relapse once he's off the hook with the courts. Every day he talks about how I'm ungrateful, his life is shit, and he wishes he had died. I also have things here at home I need to do that can't be pushed back. AITA for not wanting to go for three weeks in fear of being dumped on distant relatives again?",

      "description": " So I always take the bus to college and usually there's the same exact people on the bus. It was back in November that this happened but I keep remembering about it. \n\n That day was pretty chilly and I had a coat on, but still felt cold. I got on the bus and got out my laptop to do my usual studies on the one hour long trip. About 10 minutes in a middle aged woman with thick clothing comes on, sits in the back ( across and two seats behind me) and opens her window. Now I don't know if this is the case for all buses or just specific to this company's bus line, but the breeze was really hitting me hard. I was cold and with almost an hour until my destination (I REALLY did not want to get sick at this point in the semester), after a bit of contemplating I got up and asked her if it's okay to close the window since it's cold. \n\n\n She at first didn't understand (or pretended not to understand) as she was an immigrant but after repeating the question she said \"no no, it's hot\". For some reason, either due to finals stress or just being cranky, I said \"It's hot you take off scarf and coat, window close\" and I just closed the window and went back to my seat. Again I'm not sure why but I just got extremely irritated at her. If you're hot take off your fucking clothes, don't open the window in the middle of november! She started trying to open the window but was struggling so I went back to my seat. After a bit she managed to open it but an older guy sitting in front of her (window extended 2 seats) closed it without saying a word. Either he was sympathetic to me or was also cold but just didn't say anything. The woman didn't open the window again.\n\n\n\n I just keep oscillating between \"c'mon man, she was an older woman, probably just wanted fresh air\" and also \"she had clothes on, she could've taken them off, and she was rude when I asked her to close it, couldn't been nice to me like I was to her when I asked to close it\" \n\n\n So reddit, was I the asshole?

We got engaged during the summer of 2k18.\n\nI study accounting and business at OSU and I have a paid internship where I have been saving money and was going to be employed after the now accountant was planned to retire this year and my salary was going to start near 65,000. 2 weeks ago we found out she was pregnant after 9 months of trying. She just told me that she wants to move to a suburb of Cincinnati to live close to her parents to help take care of the baby while I want to stay near where we are and she can find a job nearby and together we could both work and she could start her career after the baby was old enough to go to daycare or have a babysitter. Also if we do move down to Cincinatti I would make about 20 grand a year less making her parents cost us about 20,000 just to have a free babysitter when they are only an hour and a half drive away so they could visit whenever and therefore making us centrally located for my Mom/step dad and my brother only living a 15 minute drive away if we ever needed anything",

      "description": "I have a fairly common, multisyllabic first name that has A LOT of nicknames that can be made from it, and it’s common that people with this name preferred to be called by one of those nicknames, but I am vehemently not one of those people.\n\nI always introduce myself by the full length of this name. It’s important to me because my mom named me, and she fought for this name since it’s unusual to have it in my culture. She is no longer alive, so this is one of the ways I honor her memory. I’ve also always just liked it a lot; I feel like it suits me well.\n\nAnyways, a lot of times it seems, people take the liberty of changing it or shortening it without asking me, and I hate it. I feel the same feeling as nails under my skin whenever I am called by one of those names. This happens in both personal and professional settings and I always try to (politely) correct the person by saying “Excuse me, my name is XYZ, not X.” \n\nSometimes when I do it, I realize that I am interrupting what they were going to tell me right after addressing me, but I feel like it was rude of them to change my name without asking in the first place. I feel the need to correct it immediately because I don’t want it to happen again. I see sometimes that people’s face drop and they look offended, and I feel bad about that. I can see them try to back track by saying: “Oh, my cousin is named XYZ but she likes to go by X” and I truly don’t know what else to say except “I am not your cousin” and that seems to alienate people further. \n\nAITA for taking issue with this and going about it this way?",

      "description": "As per most reddit posts, this one has years of backstory but I'll do my damndest to keep under the character limit. My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "So basically my friend and her friend who I don't really know want to get an apartment for a year for college. They asked me to join (I guess to keep the rent lower, I'm not really sure) and I agreed. They have been meeting and talking about the apartment a few times but I've never been asked to join. To be fair though, I've never asked to come along. They have decided to wait until July to start trying to get an apartment somewhere because they don't want to pay a lot over the summer.  But these aren't the reasons I would be ditching, just some back story. \n\nThe main reason I would be ditching them is because I'm incredibly unhappy being in college and I want to leave. I have absolutely no careers I am passionate about right now, that I can find at least. The classes are miserable and I feel like I'm just wasting my time and money pursuing nothing I guess? I want to drop out and try to travel a bit maybe or try to get more hours at my job and save up some money, maybe take some non-school classes like sign up for an independent art class or look into trade jobs or anything that could spark some interest. \n\nI should never have agreed to an apartment with them, but it is kind of just all hitting me at once how much I dislike being here. \n\nI talked to a different friend about this and they said telling them that I didn't want to get an apartment about 4-5 months ahead of time didn't seem like enough time for them to find someone else, since they have been adamant about not wanting to rent with a stranger as a roommate. \n\nI guess I just feel really guilty about wanting to leave, but I do want to leave. I'm so unhappy here. I haven't ever talked to either of the two people I would be renting with, about how unhappy I have been either, so it will probably come as a big surprise to them. \n\nI also don't have any way to contact the third girl that was gonna be in the apartment with her. I've talked to her like two or three times and she's really more of my friends friend, so when I tell them, if I end up leaving, i would probably end up telling my friend and letting her relay the message to the other girl. I know my friend will be really angry at me for it, because (saying this in the nicest way possible) she is slightly self centered and when things don't go her way she flips. I am a bit worried about losing her friendship over this. \n\nI know this sounds probably like a huge mess but I feel lost on what to do at this point. Should I just stay and stick it out and then think about leaving next year? Or should I try to set up a time to talk to them? I don't know. Please help. ",

It feels like the latter since she routinely goes on about how she hates every part of her day or week except for when she sees me. \n\nI'd like to break it off for that reason, as well as stuff like she can be really narrow-minded, has really low confidence/keeps hating on herself, can be somewhat depressing at times - she says stuff a lot like \"there's no reason to hope for something since you're setting yourself up for disappointment anyways, so why bother\", says that seriously as if it makes total sense. Another one is \"my mother won't change her mind so why bother arguing\". The stuff she's giving up on are really important topics to argue about as well, and idk but it kind of gives me this defeatist attitude. She also is absolutely unable to have serious conversations. If I try to talk to her about this stuff she just keeps cutting me off/changes the subject/asks me to please stop/straight up walks away, cause it's \"easier not to think about it\".\n\nShe says a lot about how her ideal day would be rain, staying inside, and netflix, which sounds nice once in a while but I don't think I'd like it that often. \n\nLong story short, I'm kind of more on the optimistic side and just the whole mix of defeatist -depressing-narrow-mindedness isn't working out for me.\n\nThe thing is, I'm nowhere near a medical professional, but she seems like she's depressed or definitely has anxiety (doesn't like talking about that either). On top of that, she's super stressed about her classes this semester since she failed one of them in the fall and is retaking now. Her older sister is getting married soon we think, and she always compares herself to her sisters (complains about her family in general), and since I'm worried she depends on me for happiness, I'll break it off and she suddenly hates every part of her life, fails her classes again, basically goes downhill. \n\nI know about the whole \"it's their problem, not yours\" but I mean... These are a lot of things that can go wrong. So WIBTA if I break it off and she spirals?",

      "description": "Some backstory: I was out all day after gift-opening and wasn’t able to get a bite to eat at all, not even breakfast because there’s no food in our house(all the groceries were bought today for the dinner). I got to dinner absolutely voracious and really wanting to eat something.\n\nIt got to the point where I had to ask my mom if I could have some chips before dinner and asked if I could eat them in private so I wouldn’t be judged. She said I could have hem but I had to spend time with the family since they were in town for a limited time.\n\nWhen I got out there, everyone stared at me for a second and asked what I was doing. I explained and they all gave me a weird look before continuing conversation. I sat down and started eating, but I was super loud(fuck you crispy chips) and everyone kept giving me dirty looks. \n\nOnce dinner started, I had my first serving with everyone else, and then went to get my second serving. Only a few people went to get a second serving, but everyone was confused that I was considering how little I usually eat(in front of people, I have a bad habit of eating in bed and munching). Once I got up for a third serving, my mom said, “Honey, don’t you think that’s enough?” And I replied saying I’m really hungry. While I was in the kitchen, I heard my grandpa(who’s a hardass) say, “If he keeps doing this, he’ll turn into a fatass like you(he’s my moms FIL).” My mom said nothing him and then he said, “What? He’s already a little chubby!! If you let him keep eating like this, he’ll soon be obese.” I ran back into the living room and said some choice words to him. He got up and got in my face, but I quickly slapped him. He stumbled back and everyone was silent for a few seconds. Then, he lunged at me, but thankfully my dad stopped him. I ran upstairs and stayed there until everyone left the next morning.\n\nAITA for slapping my grandpa?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to leave a couple hours earlier from a Christmas party, to meet up with a girl i haven't seen for a long time?",
      "description": "First of all, pardon any typos or weird phrases, as english is not my first language. \n\nA couple months ago my parents \"asked\" me if i would like to come to this semi-annual Christmas party that we use to go to. The party is hosted by some friends of the family, and they tend to bring their children which are between 15-19 years old. The reason for \"asked\" being in quotes, is because they ask in a way which is like \"it would be nice if you could come, because the host specifically chose this Sunday to make sure it fit most of the teens' weekend plans\", which makes it feel more like an obligation than a choice. For the record, i am 18, and i have always been \"forced\" this way to join family-events even though i dont actually want to. I have had my quarrels with my family about stuff like this before, mostly my father which has a history of using manipulative methods of getting us, my sisters and I, to attend certain family events. They always mention in MONTHS in beforehand, and when the date finally arrives and i've made other plans, they get angry at me for not choosing family before my own life. \n\nThe problem arises when i got a message from a girl i haven't seen in a long time (she's been out of town), and she asked if i'd like to hang out this Sunday evening. We have a little thing going but nothing serious. I approached my parents and asked how long the party, which is tomorrow, would last. They said that we would probably leave around 22-23 (10-11 pm), which means the party would last 5-6 hours. I had definitely not anticipated it lasting that long, and said that i could not stay there that long because i had other plans the same evening. \n\nThey then said we talked about this several weeks, even months ago, and that i should cancel my other plans. I told them there have been no written messages regarding this party, and that i actually never agreed to joining the party, i only said that it would most likely be okay, since who even plans their weekends months beforehand at my age. They said that this is 1/365 days, and that i don't spend much time with them anymore. (I get that, but i am in the process of growing up, and would like to have my family by my side, not dragging me by my feet). \n\nI told them i did not want to spend my whole Sunday afternoon and evening, which is one of a few days without school, work, tests and exams, playing quiz and drinking eggnog. And said i would be able to stay there for three hours at most. Then they said that would barely get us through the meal, and i would miss the \"annual Christmas quiz\". They even mentioned that because i live in their house i should come to the party... (BTW, in Norway, parents are legally obligated to give their children housing and other means of living until they are done with High School (when they are approximately 19)). \n\nA couple more things to consider: 1: There have been a lot of instances at these parties, where the children my age prioritizes other things, making me be one of few people there my age. 2: I don't have a lot of free time, especially at this time of year when all the exams stack up and i'm overloaded with work. This leads to a lot of stress in my daily life, but i manage it. What i'm saying is that i'd MUCH rather like to unwind and chill in a sofa, watching some series with a girl in my arms, than to discuss what i'm gonna do with my life with my parents friends. I'm not saying i don't enjoy social gatherings, i actually love talking with people and socializing, but these parties are beginning to get more and more repetetive and dull as i'm growing older. I get the ordeal with my parents wanting to meet their friends and families, i would myself, but only if they actually were my friends as well. 3: The hosts are my step-mothers friends, which she introduced to our family, basically i have no emotional connections to them at all. \n\nI ended the conversation by saying that i would stay there through the dinner, so that the people making the food wouldn't waste the goods, and my father told me \"i should stay there as long as i dont get embarrassed leaving early\". Another of my fathers classic psychological methods of making people do what he wants :)\n\nTLDR; My parents asked me a couple months ago to join a Christmas party that is tomorrow. Back then i sad \"probably\", now new plans have come up, i try to negotiate a solution that would make both parties happy, by being there for 2-3 hours, then being able to hang with a friend of mine as well, my parents try to make me feel like shit for not wanting to stay at the party for five hours, and they are probably still pissed. \n\nAITA? \n\nIf you have any questions about details, previous occasions, my parents, or anything really, feel free to comment below. Ill be online for a couple hours :) Thanks!",

      "description": "This is going to be long and quite compicated, so please bear with me!\n\nMy best friend (we'll call him Rick) is also my fuck buddy, or was. We've been sleeping together for a few months and everything has been fine, up until today when he set some new boundaries between us that basically outlawed all forms of affection, from sex to cuddling to kissing to saying \"I love you\", basically reverting our friendship to strictly platonic. \n\nListen, this is totally fine by me. I am capable of accepting boundaries as I want to preserve our friendship. This just came as a blow to me because it was so out of the blue, and the way he delivered it was extremely hurtful. Rick knows I am quite sensitive and he was really rude when explaining why he didn't want to be with me the same way anymore (particularly because I am a naturally affectionate person, the type to say \"I love you\" to all my friends). He eventually left me sitting on my own and I was bummed out for the rest of the day.\n\nSuddenly out of the blue I got a call from my ex (we'll call him Jay). We ended things in November on good terms, and although we rarely get to see each other and aren't as close (conflicting schedules), we're still good friends and care a lot about each other. Anyway, Jay called and asked if I wanted to hang out, and I said yes.\n\nSo after I got home from work Jay came by, and one thing led to another and we had sex. I honestly didn't intend for that to happen, but I was feeling shitty about what happened with Rick and I wanted a distraction. Being with Jay felt like an incredibly natural and comforting release of all that stress and neither of us regretted it in the slightest.\n\nThe thing is, I don't know if I should tell Rick what happened. Though we're best friends, our relationship as FWBs was quite casual. He constantly reminded me that I could be with other guys if I chose and that he didn't want to be exclusive in the slightest. Later, however, he backpedaled and admitted that he was very insecure with me seeing other guys, but still gave me permission to do as I pleased. I however made it clear I was perfectly happy only sleeping with him, partly to ease his insecurities. \n\nI intend on talking to Rick tomorrow to smooth things over since we were both quite emotional today, but I don't know if I should tell him I slept with Jay. I am extremely conflicted especially since Rick has cut all sexual aspects out of our relationship, but I know this would still hurt him, especially since it was literal hours after we spoke. I basically feel like I've cheated on someone I just broke up with, which makes no sense. Am I obligated to come clean? AITA if I don't?\n\nTLDR; Hours after my best friend/fuck buddy called it quits on the sexual aspect of our relationship, I slept with my ex. Should I tell my former fuck buddy even thought it might hurt him?",

He lives at home with my mom still and doesn’t pay any rent or bills. He’s supposed to be paying for his car but really never does because he doesn’t have the money. When he does get money he blows it all on weed and food and doesn’t pay the one thing he’s asked to pay. Then when he runs out, he texts me in desperation asking if I can “just sell him a gram” for the night (I can count on one hand how many times he has paid me back when he said he would). I’ve told him before it’s annoying and asked him not to because a. I’m not a drug dealer b. I’m usually down to little more than that when he asks and c. I try to make it last as long as possible bc poor and that gram would last almost a week for me but a day for him.\nHe makes me seem like a shitty person and maybe I am but I guess that’s why I’m here.

      "description": "I’m still in high school, and our school require us to do community service to graduate. There was this opportunity to go and make beds for animals and get service hours for it. To me it sounded like a perfect opportunity to get credit while helping out animals (which I do love). So I sign the forum to go, and when we were sent a confirmation email on Thursday (opportunity was on Saturday) I said I could go again. But on Friday something personal came up and I couldn’t go anymore, so I sent an email to the person who sent the confirmation email who was also the head of the service committee telling her I couldn’t go. She sent me one back saying it’s all good.\n\nSaturday rolls around and I get a call from a friend of mine who also signed up 10 minutes before the time the event was scheduled. She was apart of the service representatives for our grade and wanted to know where I was. I told her something came up and I couldn’t make it. She responded with “And you didn’t think would be good to tell anyone?”. It was easy to tell she was annoued with me. I responded with “I told ______” (the name of the head of the service committee). She only responded with “Ok, bye bye.” In the most passive aggressive tone I think I’ve ever heard. Am I the asshole?\n\nNote: Because the reason I couldn’t come was personal, I never told either the my friend or the head of the service committee my what happened, just that something came up.",

      "description": "My friend, whom I've known for many years, has progressively gotten larger over the past few years. I have made a comment previously about his weight gain due to general worry, but I would say that it's been over a year since I've said anything else to him about it. My friend is around 6 foot 5 inches, and he's probably close to 500 pounds at this point. My partner and I live in a smaller town near the large city that he lives in. My friend doesn't know how to drive, doesn't own a car, and would rather take public transportation, which is reasonable as he lives in a great city for that. The issue lies with him riding in either of our vehicles. This wasn't always an issue, but as his weight increases, the more we are both noticing the sounds that the seat makes as he's shoving himself in the car, as well as the general lowering of the passenger side when he's inside either of our cars. It's much easier for him and us if we drive when we want to hangout as public transportation is quite slow and limiting, but we're getting to the point where we are not only worried about his health, but also worried about our vehicles. \n\nNeither my partner nor I are sure of how to address this with him, and we've even gotten to the point where we've considered renting a large SUV that can handle a person of his size, and although this wouldn't be practical, it may send a message. If we all of the sudden stop giving him rides or picking him up he'll obviously know something is wrong, but again, we would have no idea how to address this without sounding like horrible people and losing our dear friend. After the last time that we hung out my partner has now established that she would rather not have him ride in her vehicle, and I am getting to that point as well. Are we the assholes for feeling this way? ",

This is a girlfriend my grandparents (his parents) hate because when they origionally met her they were told by her dad that she was being raised to he am escort (i dont know how true this is but it did come from my grandparents straight and isnt just a family rumor). His girlfriend has always been somewhat nice to me but i only see her christmas eve and only know her through other people. Ive never really liked her because of her breaking up my aunt and uncle and being willing to cheat with a married man (not happy with my uncle about it either)\n\nNow to the question at hand. Recently my cousin had a falling out with his dad's girlfriend over a rent issue and my other cousin had an issue where the girlfriend was extremely rude to her about my cousin's new apartment. Both times my uncle did nothing to defend his own kids. \n\nThe two cousins and my aunts all said they werent coming to our christmas eve meetup bit when they found out my uncle wasnt coming they all agreed to come. Im making everyone crochet  scarves as gifts in conjunction with some giftcards my parents got them. Wibta if i didnt include scarves for them as 1) theyre being jerks to my family, 2) they arent coming and 3) i have no way of getting anything to them. They would still be getting gift cards ",

      "description": "To put a long story short, I moved to my wife's country a year ago. She works here and there but is in university. I work full time (from home, for reasons I won't get into but I'm fortunate to be able to support her in various aspects due to this). My wife also suffers from an often-debilitating mental illness, and recently lost her benefits for reasons we can't seem to get someone to explain. The long and short of it though is she has to repay her benefits for the last six months because she wasn't technically entitled to them (as per the result of her latest assessment, though this is still being contested and won't likely change because of how awful the UK's mental health services are), and unfortunately, the repayment of this (a not-insignificant amount) primarily falls to me.\n\nSomeone from the people handling her claim called yesterday, and left a vague message saying they'd call back. From experience, they never do, so like the last two times this happened, I asked her to call them, get through the identification steps, and pass the phone to me to talk on her behalf. \n\nFirst, she wasn't sure what number to call, so I Googled it. She said no, that's not it, but I recalled it being the same one we called last time, so she called another one instead. Finally, we called the one I suggested. She only got as far as a robot asking what the call was about, which I told her to say \"repayment\", and she froze, so I told her to hang up. I got a little frustrated, and told her (not yelling, but my voice was raised a tad) that she has to work with me to get this sorted and can't expect them to get back to her. I prompted her to call again, which she declined. I told her again she needed to call today, since we still are a) waiting on a reassessment and b) need to figure out if the first payment is next week or next month. She said she would just wait instead, which - to be blunt - made me angry (which isn't the hardest thing to do, but I've been in anger management for some time now, so I tried my best to keep cool). \n\nI pounded the desk and let out a sigh, and just reiterated that it was frustrating that she keeps dragging her feet on this. She says there's nothing to be angry about because she's just arranging to pay back 10/month anyway (which they said is fine but were reluctant in accepting, and pushed for it to be paid back quicker).\n\nWe haven't done much Christmas shopping, and we had to cancel a trip to see my folks back home (which I know many people will say \"oh big deal\" but I haven't seen them in a while and I was really looking forward to it). I make okay money but having this large sum of money that needs to be paid back basically in limbo is becoming a pretty sizeable burden. I reminded her that I told her what to say on the phone already, but she insisted I didn't, and when I said I did, she told me it wouldn't work.  \n\nWhile I was venting to her (in what I considered a constructive manner, if not a little loud), she shouts at me saying \"well what the fuck am I supposed to do because no one said what they wanted in the fucking message so what am I supposed to say\". I told her to get her tea and get the hell out of my office, and shut the door behind her. \n\nI'd love to take this off her plate and handle it myself, but they won't let me because the claim existed before we lived together (one of many reasons, really). So this is the only way to get information out of them. I'm doing my best to be supportive (I think I'm doing well thus far), and getting her through this. I've undertaken some of her bills in the interim (she has some savings which she's using to pay others). I know I shouldn't have lost my temper since I'm still working on determining what is and isn't justified anger with my therapist so sometimes it's tough, and I'm still not quite sure if this was worth yelling about.\n\nShe's in our room now, I'm still working, and we haven't talked since. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "About a year ago when my BF and I moved in together, I brought an old beach towel from my family’s house to our new apartment. Fast forward to this weekend where we used it at the pool and I noticed there was a hole in it (big enough to fit a fist through). I was kind of curious about it since I don’t know how it could have even ripped.\n\nThe next day when I was washing it, I was curious and asked my BF if the hole was there when I brought it to our place (I specifically worded my question in this way to avoid potentially blaming him). He said yes, I acknowledged. 10 minutes later he asked me if I was asking because I thought he ripped the towel. I replied honestly and said “No, I was just wondering”. Honestly, I could care less about the towel (or any towel for that matter) since we just use it to dry off after the pool. However, he goes on to argue with me that “If you don’t care about the hole, why would you even say anything?”. While I do somewhat agree and understand his point, I realized by his tone that he was being defensive and thought that I was trying to blame him. I answer back slightly annoyed “Look, I don’t care about the towel, I was just asking an innocent, dumb question. I'm not blaming you, I'm not trying to be passive aggressive I was just asking and now I regret it”.\n\nBut the thing is, I don’t regret asking, sometimes a dumb question is just a dumb question and nothing more. I was honestly just curious. However, he feels that I shouldn’t have even asked at all since I didn't really care in the first place and my question suggests that he caused the damage. Fwiw, even if he did rip it and didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t care, like I said, it’s just a beach towel. Who is the asshole in this situation?\n",

I then scramble to make dinner, bathtime, clean house a bit (all while trying to keep kid goes to bed at 9:30-10 (he takes long nap during the day so goes to bed late), I work on my laptop 3-4 hours, then do an hour or so of housework, go to bed at 2AM, wake up at 7.  On weekends when kid is napping, I grocery shop, balance checkbook/pay bills, do laundry, more cleaning, etc. (when kid is not napping I am playing with kid, husband does no childcare on weekends - and I'm somewhat OK with that and expect that's pretty typical of SAHPs).\n\nI'm a data scientist so have been tracking our time use informally. Husband gets approximately 52 hours of leisure time (time to do whatever he wants) a week (32 hours of this is on weekends).  I get maybe 3.5 (approx 30 minutes per day).\n\nLife is devoid of joy. I am so tired.  I know my kid won't be so much work as he gets older, but right now, it's freaking rough.  I want husband to take over making dinner at night, laundry, and dishes.  Husband says he hates doing those things, but every time I have brought this up he grudgingly does a load of laundry and that's the end of it.  I feel like I'm constantly nagging and being an asshole telling him I'm tired and need help.  AITA or is he?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My bf and I, I’ll just call J, have been together 7.5 years and living together for 7 years. We have lived several states away from his parents for about 4 years now. \n\nJ’s Mom and I DO NOT get along, she has been for horrible to me for most of J’s and I relationship. \nSome things include telling me I’m going to ruin J’s life.\nThat I am a slob. \nIn front of my mom she said I am annoying and she couldn’t stand to be around me anymore. \nI was in a serious accident and was bed ridden for months and her only concern was that I was going to be a finical burden to J and that I needed to be back at work already. \nWe used to live with J’S parents very briefly and she would go through my mail and question me about it in front of J and his dad. \nIf I had wine or a cocktail with dinner she would say I’m a sloppy drunk and going to ruin J’s reputation. \nShe has done enough horrible things to me that I could fill a novel but earlier this year she decided she wanted to make amends and apologize to me. She asked me to tell her everything she did that hurt me and once I did, she denied ever doing any of it, how people love her because she’s so nice, how my mom is a liar and she would never speak poorly of me in front of her. Anyways I didn’t accept her apology and she called J crying that it wasn’t fair that I didn’t own up to anything I’ve ever done. I refuse to talk to her now. I bit my tongue for almost 6 years for because I didn’t want it to get between Mine and J’s relationship. J knows how horrible she has been to me and feels bad he didn’t see it before and understands why I don’t want a relationship with her. \n\nI should also mention that J is an only child and she is a therapist. \n\nBefore I get to the next part J is working on a project for about 10-13 hours a day and has a deadline at the end of this month. He has been behind on texts and emails so he’ll have me go through, read them to him and I’ll type out the response for him, it’s mostly work stuff like schedules, talking with department heads etc. And then a few friends checking in on him and his mom. And I’ve seen a lot of recent texts to him from his mom. \n\nFor whatever reason J’s mom wants him to come visit THIS month even though he has arrangements to go next month for the holidays. She texts him daily and when she doesn’t reply she starts saying how frustrating it is that he can’t reply and then when he apologizes that he’s busy she’ll say something like “I’m sorry sweety I know you’re busy I just miss you so much and need to hear your voice.” The way she talks to J really creeps me out because it’s more like a girlfriend. \n\nSo his mom has been begging him to go visit them for about a month now. He hasn’t really given an answer but now she’s texting him that his dad is in really bad health and that he needs to come home right away. I think he’s having heart problems but they haven’t been to a dr yet. But she’ll say something along the lines of “You need to come home, dad isn’t doing good and is so tired all the time. And IM JUST SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU.” \nI feel bad for saying this but I think she’s trying to guilt trip him about his dad so he’ll come visit. It’s not the first time she’s been incredibly manipulative. Every holiday season she cries to him on the phone that he doesn’t spend Thanksgiving Fay or Christmas Day with them. \n\nAnyways so I’m pissed because he’s going to go see them and the only time he can go is on the weekends when they’re off. This entire month is so hectic for both of us because we’re moving, his project, we’re going on vacation and the holiday. \nThis weekend we need to start packing, organizing and donating stuff. \nMonday-Thursday I have to go out of town for work. So I don’t have much time to get it done and need his help. \nSaturday morning movers are coming. \nThe weekend after that is thanksgiving weekend which I paid someone $200 to cover for me so I could have off. We always go to get our Christmas tree which we have done every single year we’ve been together. And this year a festival falls on that weekend and we made arrangements to go to it. \nAnd the last weekend we’ll be on vacation. \n\nSo his only options are to go next weekend and I have to move by myself OR Thanksgiving weekend which will ruin the plans we already have and I wasted money getting it off. \n His mom wants him to come on Thanksgiving, she said “I’m sure catstaringatmepooo already made plans for you but maybe you can just cancel them and come home for Thanksgiving.”  \nHe already told her not on Thanksgiving and he can only come for two days but she’s talking about taking a week off for his visit and she’s booking his ticket for him.\n\nJ is going to visit them for a week and a half in about a month. \nI asked J a few nights ago if he even wants to go and he said not really but he feels bad.\n\nHis options are either I do the move alone or he leaves me by myself in a new house for Thanksgiving. Not going to lie part of me is mad because she does this shit every year. So am I the asshole for being pissed off about this? \n",

Now I feel that even though I ask her if she is hiding things from me and she says no, she has said and done that before so it’s hard o trust her. On top of that she is never willing to let me see her phone, she says it’s toxic and not a good way to be together but I always say she can do whatever she wants on my phone. I’m not sure if it truly is bad by me and toxic to see what’s on her phone or if it’s on her, any advice would be appreciated. ",

      "description": "I am going to start by saying, the following happened at the beginning of the semester.\n\nI (21F) am a young, liberally minded activist and feminist. I major in general studies and am the lead in a recruitment organization at my college. I live in a rather conservative part of the US and every so often we get people that come on campus to tell us how we are living our lives in sin. There are a few likeminded people in my organization that I was able to influence into protesting these conservatives from spreading their message of hate. The night before, I have everyone come over to my dorm to make our protest signs. As an example, we glued images of Donald Trump and plastered flames consuming him to suggest he was going to hell.\n\nOn campus, my group has been getting a lot of hate for our outward disapproval of the white, patriarchal establishment. And I’ll be honest, it hasn’t all exactly been rainbows and butterflies in adulthood for me. So, when I have someone coming on campus, which is supposed to be a place of LEARNING, I get really fired up. They are preaching these outdated messages of reap what you sow, wait until marriage, etc. This does nothing but say if you are underprivileged you deserve to be underprivileged. It felt like they were coming from such a monolithic, closed-minded perspective that I needed to physically demonstrate progressive politics.\n\nSo, I took off my shirt. Yes, I am a woman with sizeable breasts. No, I was not wearing a bra. Unfortunately, I was the only one that did this. No one else from my organization followed suit with me. Now, I did not get arrested and the university has not followed through on any legal action. If they did, guaranteed I will be reaching out to my parents to sue them for discrimination against females. However, as an unintended consequence, most of the girls from my organization have been treating me differently. They are almost being cold to me. Some have stopped showing up to our meetings all together. This is causing me to question, am I an asshole for influencing other students into attending this political event?",

      "description": "I am talking about my time in high school (Im 22 now). There was a girl in my class I didn‘t like at first but the more time I spent with her the more feelings I started to catch. Time flew by and we admitted to each other that we share the same feelings. For me actually it was clear that I wanted her to be my girlfriend and I communicated it to her and she kept me waiting.\nIn this specific time span there was a big party. On this evening she kissed another guy and a girl. I was only 16 so this was for me the most heartbreaking moment I could ever imagine. Even though we were not officially together I felt really betrayed because this is something my loyalty never would have let me do and I had no understanding for this behavior. \nNext day she apoligized blaming she was too drunk she could not handle it if I would turn my back on her. After a week I forgave her.\nShe suddenly wanted to be my girlfriend and so it happened.\nAfter just thee months she broke up with me. She told me I was too controlling. In fact I was because she kept going on these parties and get drunk and my trust was not fully recovered.\n\nOne half year later we went on a trip. Me, some classmates and her included. Our relation after the break up was „normal“. We still hang together and I had the feeling that she was still into me. Me too kinda. We all shared one room together (we were 8 ppl)\n\nAfter the first night in this city (Hamburg) I met a spanish girl. After a short while it was all clear were it was heading. Her appartment was way too far and mine was just around the corner. For me it was a very exciting moment because I was about to lose my virginity (I did not have sex with my ex). \n\nWe went to my appartment and the security let us in even though he actually wasnt allowed to let strangers in but he was aware of the situation and just winked me in. I told the spanish girl of the situation and made to hear clear that if somebody is already inside sleeping we would have to be very quite. We entered in and my ex and 2 friends of her were already sleeping. I took the girl and went with her in my bed and had sex for about a half hour. The room was very small and if they would have woke up they could easily see us. But I did not care because I really wanted to have sex with this girl. Revenge was not my goal actually but I thought cmon I have not done anything wrong to her so why should me bother this.\n\nThe spanish girl did not want to go home after the hook up and slept beside me. The very next morning I woke her up a little earlier while every one was sleeping and told to her that she has to go. Just about she was to leave my ex and her friend woke up. She was so confused and angry. I left the room with the spanish girl and I heard as soon as I closed the door „Is he fucking serious?“. Later she told me that she is really hurt of what I did and stopped talking to me for about 2 months. She said that she thought we would come back together. But we did not. ",

      "description": "My gf and I have been together for about 2 months, and this is a point of argument for us to this day. She's stunning, she takes phenomenal photos, and she loves to take them frequently.\n\nI, on the other hand, look like a sack of shit even on days when I'm looking my best. Photogenic is one of the last words anyone should use to describe me, I hate pictures and try to get them taken literally as little as I possibly can. I have severe confidence issues, and looking at photos of myself only succeeds in making me feel worse. I'm not happy with what I see in the mirror and I don't think I'll be for quite some time. In spite of all this though, my gf wants us to strike a pose at least once a day for us to get a quick pic together.  I tell her all of this, but she doesn't care,she always replies with something along the lines of that she loves me and wants to have pictures to show her friends how cute we are together.\n\nI'm not even unreasonable when it comes to pictures though. I've willingly taken pics with her the first time she asked on things loke our big dates, and a concert we went to together over winter break. It's just when we're out and about and she wants to snap a selfie of us at Walmart where I start trying to say no, because I don't there's anything I enjoy less than being in a photo. It's at the point where the woman I love has given me ultimatums to take pictures with her, and it's having a negative impact on our relationship.\n\nTL;DR I'm self conscious about my appearance and the way I look in photos, and I've grown to dread taking them. In spite of this I still talk the occasional picture with my admittedly very photigenic gf, yet it isn't enough and my desire to stay away from the camera is affecting my relationship with a girl I click with on so many levels, and disagree with on far less. AITA?",

      "description": "So, long story short, my gf has always struggled with stress, anxiety, and depression, and I don’t think I can be around it anymore.\n\nWe have been together for close to 5 years now, and this has always been an issue that I was vocal about, but my concerns seem to be falling on deaf ears. When we started dating, we were both in a really dark place emotionally, and I know that we helped pull each other up and out of the worst of it. \n\nSince then, I have continued to try to improve myself and be just less sad and mopey all the time. And it worked. I know this doesn’t work for everybody, but eventually I just decided I wasn’t going to be sad anymore and faked it one day at a time until I didn’t have to fake it anymore.\n\nBut in all this time (I’d guess the last 3 years?) she has been actively opposed to do anything that I see as proactive:\n\nStart exercising together everyday? No deal.\n\nStop going out to eat every week (often several times)? Absolutely not.\n\nGo out hiking on the weekends? Too tired.\n\nLocal band playing? They probably suck, let’s not.\n\nStop smoking so much weed everyday? But how will I be hungry?\n\nGo to a doctor and see about meds? YOU THINK I’M CRAZY AND YOU HATE ME!! (That one was a long time ago, but has prevented the subject from coming up again)\n\nThe worst thing for me is the complaining. There is always something wrong with everything. Not only does she act like nothing is ever good enough, but she acts like everything is actively getting worse just for her. I have made it very clear that I don’t want to hear her complain or whine, and she replies that “it’s something I need to do or I’ll just trap it inside and explode.”\n\nThat doesn’t seem like enough of a reason to complain about everything all the time. We moved to a city where she got a job that she really wanted and every single morning it’s “I don’t wanna go! I don’t feel good! Everything is terrible!” When in reality, she likes the job and the people she works with. On top of that, I did not want to move to this city and wanted to go somewhere else where we might both have jobs in our field, but instead she works the good job and I’m finding whatever I can around town making peanuts. \n\nOk, I feel like I’m just ranting now. \n\nMy problem is that I feel like she helped me out of depression by just being around, and she refuses to let me help her by doing the same. Am I wrong to be at my wits end about all the complaining? Am I an actual monster for no longer sympathizing with her depression? Is it wrong of me to want to just stop trying to help her because she won’t help herself?\n\nI know I’ve probably painted a much more one sided version of this than I meant to, so please feel free to ask any questions that might help. I love her and care deeply about her well being, but I feel like I’m the only one trying to do anything about it.\n\nAITAH?\n",

      "description": "I've been in Scotland for 3 months, for school, and my family came up to visit me. Our family dynamic is rocky, mostly because me and my sister are not great to my parents.\n\nWe end up at The World's End off of the Royal Mile and my sister can't get in. By this point, I would have assumed that I told her that the drinking age is 18, but apparently I hadn't, so I said so inside of the bar (we got kicked out) and she got upset and wanted to go home (most shops were closed by this point, it was coming to the end of our night). I suggested that she go home with our mom and I would have a drink with my dad. For context, the other 17 year olds I had met in Scotland were completely mature about their inability to get into bars and had adjusted accordingly. My sister instead started to reiterate that she wanted to go home and eventually started to cry. My parents, feeling guilty, suggested that we all just go home, but I insisted that we (me and my dad) stay and have a drink, in front of my sister. \n\nSaying that I wanted to stay made my sister upset, which to me seemed immature as it's just the law and back home she parties with friends anyways. I understand that it was meant to be a family thing, but I had said repeatedly that she would not be able to get into a bar, and my dad wanted to go in (seeing as the bar was connected to the Edgar Wright movie). AITA? \n",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went into my college years in a long distance relationship with someone that I had been dating for 2 years prior. It ended up not working out, and although it wasn't necessarily a messy breakup (we broke up over thanksgiving break about 3 months into college) it was definitely hard to let that go. For preface, however, the relationship was one of those types that fizzles out on one end while the other is still trying to keep it going. In out situation, she fizzled out while I put more and more effort into the relationship, so it was really hard for me to reconcile.\n\nDuring winter break about 3 weeks after thanksgiving, I ended up spending a lot of time with a friend of my ex's who was also my friend during high school, and we hooked up a couple times around Christmas and New Years.\n\nAlthough I had not spoken to my ex since the breakup, I did not think she would be extremely mad about it, judging by posts on social media with boys and her repeatedly telling my friends she was over me. Therefore, I decided to go along with it. My ex's friend and I ended up telling her about us hooking up over winter break so that the news came from us rather than from any outside sources, and she blew up.\n\nFor the record, this friend of hers was really not a close friend, they never spent time with each other outside of school. However, my ex said \"go fuck yourselves\", \"I considered you a good friend of mine\" and basically told us to fuck off. She said we \"made her look like a clown\". Although I never intended to hurt her, I don't regret the decision I consciously made.\n\nNonetheless, AITA",

      "description": "Me and my now ex had been dating for two years. We hadn’t really done much sexually because we never really had the opportunity to. \n\nHowever, we have had a few moments of blissful alone time where we could make out and such. After about the third time doing this, I decided to take it a step further and started to finger her. Neither of us had really had sexual interactions before so this was new to us. It was fun while it lasted and we were both satisfied.\n\nOne thing I did notice though was that she didn’t also touch me back. I just thought to myself that it was probably because she was nervous seeing as this was her first time in that type of situation. \n\nFast forward a bit and we’ve had occasions like this a good 3 or 4 times. I finger her, but get nothing in return.\n\nI’d finally had enough and mentioned it to her. I was nice enough about it. Just simply stating it as a fact that she’s never done much for me sexually. And I’m hit with this:\n\n“My stepdad made me give him handjobs when I was younger, so I’m not comfortable touching you.”\n\nNow we had talked about her stepfather in the past and how he had sexually abused her, but that was it. She never told me what exactly happened or how she felt about sex in general due to the experience. Despite me asking a few different times, she refused to answer. \n\nI was annoyed about this and told her that she should have told me this in the first place. And that struck a chord with her.\n\nI just don’t know what to think about this tbh.",

We are welders that produce petroleum tankers, our job includes fitting pipe, fenders, bumper, ladders, etc. BTW he was hired and had no clue how to read a tape measure, so he bought his own with the fractions printed on the tape.\n\nEven though we have perfectly good blueprints to follow, he still needs to have me check his marks before he drills into the tank rail. Which is fine, its easier to ask a stupid question, rather then have to fix a fuck up. So he has me check where he marked to drill and he was off by 1/4\", just like he was the last three measurements. \n\nI proceeded to point out his mistake and I asked if he had had his tape measure calibrated before, he says he had never thought to do such a thing. So I grabbed the tape measure and mocked up a measurement and compared it to my tape measure to show him he was off a 1/4\" every time. I tell him he may want to get it calibrated, and to go talk to our supervisor to have it checked using our \"tape recalibrater.\" So he does, and comes back and tells me the supervisor will get him a new one.\n\nI go to the supervisor and asked him \"so you're not going to calibrate his tape?\" He says, \"there...is...no such thing, ill get him a new tape! If he asks again I'll go grab my \"recalibrator\" and fix his fucking tape!\" Supervisor comes back a bit later with an 18\" ruler and checks it out using the \"bad\" tape measure and turns out the tape measure was perfectly fine. He says \"here you go sir, you're tape measure is perfectly calibrated and is working fine\" -holds out tape measure before kid grabs it- \"there is nothing wrong with this tape measure, if you are having consistant problems with where your measurement lands, it is completely an operator error, and i think someone is playing a joke on you.\"\n\n-Kid points at me across aisle- I shout out \"GOT EEEM\" everyone laughs, who witnessed this calibration fiasco. Kid was not entertained, didnt even crack a smile for falling for a joke and proceeded to pout the rest of day. I caught up to him and said hey it's all in good fun don't take it so serious around here. It is now the next day at lunch time and he hasnt said more than 4 words to me, AITA?\n\nour supervisor is not a hardass, and wasnt too annoyed by this whole distraction, so its not like the kid got scolded, he just got embarrassed and is super butthurt about it towards me.",

      "description": "So my friend and I had a bit of a falling out and it is kinda my fault. We have a relationship where we both support each other and come to the other when we need someone to talk to. \n\nThree weeks ago I was enjoying myself with a buddy I haven't seen since high school. Some beverages were consumed and during that night and apparently she reached out to me with something and I replied with a thumbs up picture (on Snapchat). I don't recall what she said and I didn't know I did this until she told me. To this day I don't know what she said. Since then we haven't talked much and when I reached out to her she left me on read. I stopped reaching out because I was dealing with my own stuff. She left me a message asking how I was doing after I lost my best friend from elementary school and  she also admitted \"that we haven't been talking and it was her fault.\" (Direct quote from the message). When I asked her about it she said she's going through a rough time and didn't want to add to my rough time. I asked about her rough time and she just said she  was just going through a rough time. Which meant she didn't want to talk about it.\n\nFast forward another couple weeks, she makes a passive aggressive comment about me but not even to me. I confronted her about and asked what was going on. It took a lot of effort to get the conversation going but she finally admitted what was bothering her. Since the night with my buddy she said I have been dismissive of her.  I immediantly apologized and said I didn't realize how I was making her feel. I admitted to be a total ass. I told her I still value our friendship and I understand her frustration with me. I've tried reaching out since then to patch things up but we haven't had a conversation. I understand she may need \nspace and I'm willing to give her it. \n\nHowever, we had previously planned on me driving 10+ hours to come visit her. We haven't discussed me not going, but as it gets closer I am feeling less up to the drive. If we're not talking anymore I don't want to spend the time and money to make that drive.

      "description": "I've recently been to a family dinner at a restaurant. It was to celebrate my 8 year old cousin's birthday and there were only 9 people in total. I despise all family events and my family knows that. I always get bored, since I don't have anyone to talk to (I'm 16 and the cousin in question is the oldest other child, the rest are adults that talk about the colour of rugs they prefer...) and I'm frowned upon when I use my phone. \n\nI was only informed about the dinner the day before (as my cousin's actual birthday is in two weeks, I wasn't expecting it).  The restaurant we went to was moderately priced, but the waiting times for the dishes were pretty long. In the end I managed to wait for the main course, and I never get dessert anyways. It was a painful 2,5 hours and I've been desperatelly trying to entertain myself during most of it (maybe half an hour was actuall eating). During the whole dinner, I've been moaning to my mom about how I dislike being there and whether I could leave. She always told me to just grin and bear it. When my family started to order desserts, I finally snapped and told her I'm going home. I thanked and said my good byes and went to the bus stop.\n\nI'm not worried about dissappointing my cousin since he wasn't very happy about being there either, he'd rather go to some fun place and not a boring restaurant. My mom is pretty understanding and just shrugged about the whole thing but my aunt (cousin's in question's mom) and grandma (aunts and my moms mom) are easy to be annoyed and pout. They're really the only 2 people that actually enjoyed the dinner.\n\nAITA for not waiting another 1-1,5 hours of complete boredom, which would satisfy my maternal grandmother and aunt?",

      "description": "I agreed to take care of a good friend's cats while they are on vacation. We agreed on $15 a day for 2 weeks to change the food and water, deal with the litterbox, and socialize a bit. I have done this before while working for a cat rehabilitation organization, but I still wanted some details on where stuff was and how they wanted it done in particular. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day they left, I went to do my rounds and walked into a home unprepared for departure. There was raw food and open containers in the fridge, litter from the box everywhere (and more poop in there than 10 hours worth, which was much appreciated). Windows were unlocked and open. Now I was told to get the mail and deal with one of those fancy amazon tvs too (I had to set up the settings and reprogram it every day). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I talked to them and cleaned up the fridge and floor. After a few days, more issues arose. The thermostat needed to be adjusted but they didn't tell me where it was or how to use it; I needed to vacuum up glass, but the vacuum was so filthy I needed to clean it myself or it wouldn't work; their mailbox ends up with a lot of their neighbor's mail so it needs to be sorted through and returned, but I had to repeatedly ask for names and info to know what to keep and where to put it all the while being told to just hang on to it because it happens all the time. And their stove and oven is potentially leaking gas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend is claiming that there was no way they could have anticipated these issues, and that the stuff like cleaning and mail sorting is \"my choice\" and I didn't/don't \"have to do all that\", but it is stuff that SHOULD be done or should have been done before they left, if they had cared enough to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for asking for $20 a day instead of $15 due to having to deal with all these extra issues and jobs?",

      "description": "to start, I go to musicals and plays very often. my family has season tickets that we buy each year so we're able to see all the shows that come. the tickets for this season is in the same row every time. \n\nbehind us, there is a family with a severely autistic child (not child, he's in his 20s) who makes noises the entire time, kicks everyone's seat, screams, and tries to sing along with the songs by going \"BLEHBLEHBLEH\". as well as this, the parents talk throughout the entire play to their son and what's happening, very, very loudly. even if we ask them to stop, they won't. it's disturbing everyone that sits remotely near them because they're so loud. someone from across the theatre last night actually shushed them very loudly. not only does he try and sing along, he also makes very loud farting noises with his mouth. \n\nnow onto the \"service dog\". I like dogs. I'd be fine with watching the play with the dog behind me, the dog is very cute. but their service dog is very fake. she growls at everyone walking by, will not listen to commands (i.e. yesterday the mom told the dog to sit, she didn't, the mom had to push the dogs butt on the floor), has a visbily fake service dog vest ordered from eBay, and is disruptive. the dog is also seperated from the autistic kid (we asked questions about the dog, the dog is the autistic kids), which is NEVER supposed to happen. the handeler and the dog should never be seperated (I'm getting a service dog soon, so I know this). we asked about the tasks and the lady froze up. she got really anxious and just said \"she alerts me when something is going to happen\" (the point of a service dog is to provide independence for the handler, so this contradicts) then quickly shut off the conversation. there's a lot more with the dog, but I'll stop there. \n\nI feel bad because the autistic guy clearly enjoys coming to these, but the entire family is super disruptive to everyone at the theatre. Hamilton is the play after next, and I don't want to deal with them at Hamilton especially :(",

      "description": "When I met my boyfriend he has already made plans to go to Japan with his two best mates. Although I really wanted to tag along, they wanted this to be a “boys trip” so I didn’t. When they came back, I asked my boyfriend if we could go next time as a couple and he said yes. We have had many discussions since then about where we should go and stay etc.\n\nFast forward a year, my boyfriend and his friends  started to talk about Japan sporadically and made many jokes about wanting to go back to Japan again.\n\nI really want to go just with him as a couple because I don’t have anything in common with his friends and the three of them would pretty much just ignore me if we went together. Plus I wouldn’t get to make any major decisions about the trip. So I made up my mind and told him that I don’t want them to come along. But if he wants to go with them he is welcome to do so, but I won’t be joining them. He then got a bit mad at me because “it sounded like I was accusing him of wanting to go with his friends”.\n\nToday my boyfriend got a bit drunk and told me about his true feelings. It turns out that he really wants his friends to tag along and he is willing to make specific rules so that I get to decide where I want to go. But I know they won’t hold up once we get there. I told him again that if he wants to go with them then I won’t come because I don’t want to feel left out on a group trip, and I would be okay with it. However he really wants me to come as well.\n\nBasically I gave him an ultimatum choosing between me and his friends because I don’t want to travel with his friends. I’m really sad and confused by how insistent he is about including his mates on our trip. \n\n AITA here for not wanting his friends to tag along with us?\n",

      "description": "To give a little context, I'm a sole receiver at a retail store, with has a pretty big warehouse to keep organized. I've worked here for a year and found a bunch of really annoying things going on.   \n\nWe are big on recycling here and besides the basic cardboard/paper/plastic, we recycle toners/ink, writing instruments, battery, and electronic waste (E-waste). Because I'm responsible for the warehouse, I'm responsible for things going out - like garbage and recycling. I'm pretty OCD so when our own employees don't follow our recycling policy, I kind of lose it... everytime. I will come back the next day and there will be shopping carts full of E-waste right next to the bins where you need to throw them into. I will find bags of batteries on tables instead of inside  their designated boxes at the FRONT of the store. They will leave carts full of toner and ink beside the boxes they should be putting them into. The list goes on. \n\nI should note that I'm not a confrontation person, I'll just suck it up and clean up after people. But after a year of the same nonsensical laziness, I couldn't be passive anymore. I first started posting notes around where the recycling spots are, but that doesn't seem to stop people. I've talked to management countless times and they say they will deal with it, but never do. I know there are some serious flaws in training here, but that's a whole other story.\n\nToday I had enough. We had a few extra defective large white boards so I wrote some \"rules of the warehouse\" and crammed as much info I could on it. One guy walked by and was like \"LOL, You're pissed eh???\". I nonchalantly said, \"no I just need to make things clear\", although I am a bit pissed. \n\nI could understand if people think I'm petty, but I'm just looking for people's perspective. Am I an asshole or just trying to do my part for the environment? Should I expect anything more from retail life?\n\n TL;DR: Tired of cleaning up after people, I leave a bunch of notes and a huge list of rules about recycling. ",

      "description": "Ill try and keep this concise but it needs a little background info. Im 27 now, ive been working since I was 16. I got my first job in a kitchen, and have stuck with it and until recently was working in some great places. I realized 2 years ago that there was no way in hell I wanted to do this for the rest of my life and made plans to go back to school. After saving, getting my money in order im starting school in September! However, my recent kitchen things went south pretty fast, wont go into details but I was let go and wasn't thrilled about the circumstances.\n\nSo now my family and girlfriend have just assumed im bored all the time and started volunteering me for random shit. Babysitting, Dogsitting, taxi service, grocery man and handyman have all become my new jobs. At first I didnt mind but im getting more and more fed up with it. Im a big gamer, built myself a sweet PC a few months ago, but I never really had tons of time for it. Sure maybe I just want to play Resident Evil 2 for 10 hours in a day, but considering this is my first vacation ever, I think I should be allowed. However they are just start getting kinda mean if I bring up what I was doing or wanted to do with my day, saying I need to act like an adult. Im starting to believe them, I guess it is acting like a teenager but I never really got to do it and just want to chill the hell out for a little bit. I cant tell if im the asshole because they make me feel like im avoiding adult life, but as far as im concerned my bills are all paid, there is no financial burden with this and I dont live with my girlfriend so just leave me alone with my tendies for a few days. So AITA?",

      "description": "I thought today was going to be productive in my relationship with my ex-wife and our co-parenting, because we were going to have a joint birthday party for our 3 year old son (it was rescheduled from last month due to weather)\n\nMy ex called me about 8am saying that our 3 year old son had thrown up (he had been sick on Thursday/Friday as well).  She said that I needed to pick him up and watch him while she took my 6 year old to the party with all the other kids.  I got offended and replied why aren’t you the one that staying home?  Ex responded that she done everything for the party and couldn’t believe I had the audacity to even suggest that.  I don’t deny that she scheduled the party and got the cake, but the cost was always agreed to be 50/50 and if she asked me to do one of those tasks I would have.  I was about to start a spin class so I told her I would call her back afterwards, party because I didn’t want to get into it by just reacting.  According to her I hung up on her.  In all honesty time was short, it was 8am and the party started at 9:50.  The venu was non-refundable.\n\nWhen I called back she had already decided that she would stay home with our son and I would go to the party.  Since I had also thought about the situation, I explained that I’d be happy to stay with him, but she said no.  She then yelled at me (in front of our 6 year old) about how she shouldn’t have to pay me child support, and that she’s working too much right now so I should have the kids more days on top of the extra days I have (right now it’s a 60/40, but most of the year it’s 50/50). \n\nI went to the party and afterwards I picked up my 3 year old.  Fast forward to after dinner she asked how or son was doing.  I told her he had thrown up again, but he was in good spirits.  (It’s day 5, so he has to be through this already, RIGHT?!).  I told her if he ate and was normal tomorrow am I was going to send him to daycare.  She then proceeded to tell me he shouldn’t go to day care tomorrow and if I did take him she was going to tell the daycare he was sick today - which either makes me look bad or I have to deal with leaving work to pick him up,  To prevent some reddit hate, I had already decided to keep my son home.\n\nShe called and I did not answer and she directly texted me “so then you’ll keep him home”, to which I have not responded.  I can’t think of any response I give that won’t just play into her trying to push me around and be aggressive towards me.  AITA?  I”m hoping to wake up tomorrow with some reddit induced clairvoyance on if I should tell the ex that my son is staying home, or just continue to not engage.\n\nTLDR: It’s a pain in the ass to share kids with an ex-husband or ex-wife.  It sucks being forever linked to someone you weren’t meant to be with.\n",

      "description": "Last December I purchased a few items online and wasn't able to ship them to my place at the time however I asked my Aunt if she would receive the items for me and ship them to me when I was ready. Skip to early last month I tell her to post my stuff and I'd pay for shipping and handling when I go collect it. I never asked to pay for anything which she didn't. After she ships it she calls me to tell me that she sent some extra stuff to help me 'set up'. I said it was fine once everything fits in the box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkip to me going to pick up my box and low and behold it's not one but THREE boxes. Here I was expecting a $60-80 shipping fee and I got slapped with bill over $300. So I immediately called her asked her what was all this stuff and she said she sent me sheet sets, curtains and shower curtains among other stuff. Well I immediately got mad because I never asked her for any of these things and I said as much. I went off about the bill and said it was not fair to put me in that situation. She then had the gall to say that it didn't matter because she was shipping my things so I would have had to pay the money anyway. She got even angrier at me and said that she would never do any more 'favours' for me again and that I was an ungrateful brat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant thing to note is that the things she sent most of them were used (Things she probably used once or twice and then choked it away in a cupboard.) My opinion is that she used this opportunity to de-clutter her closets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here or should I be appreciative? ",

      "description": "Necessary background info, please read all of it before passing judgement\n\n- I live in an area of unincorporated Los Angeles County (California), which means the legal maximum number of dogs is 4 per household/property unless its a business/rescue operation kinda deal\n\n- The neighbor lives on around a half acre of land, the dogs have plenty of room to run around it, no obvious health hazard, all seem well fed but not fat. Its 3 large dogs (Shepheard mixes) and 4 small dogs (2 chihuahua mixes, 2 or 3 fluffy thing mixes). \n\n- Its not even the number of dogs that gets me. The problem is they have inadequate fencing made of vertical steel slats, so that the bigger dogs are well contained, but the small little yappy fluffy shit heads can walk right through onto the street and harass people walking by, wander into peoples front yards and bark at them, or in an extreme case, slip through a gap in the neighbors across the street's fence, and get in a fight with their 2 german shepherds. I managed to break it up and the little yapper ran back through both fences home, but i haven't seen it since, which was 2 weeks ago, and is why I say they have 2 or 3 fluffy dogs.\n\nMy main worry is if I called animal control to report the issue about the improper fencing allowing the dumb little shits out, animal control would get angry about the 7+ dogs and make the neighbor get rid of some, which is the thing that I might be an asshole for.",

I paid Olivia back ASAP and then Olivia asked me if I could pay for Judy’s trip cause she knows I have a decent savings account... she said Judy could pay me back later. The trip is 1500 dollars. I’m kind of pissed. Judy shouldn’t have gone if she couldn’t afford it upfront and since I have a savings account I apparently am automatically supposed to be able to pay.... I feel it should be their problem. Problem is that I live in Judy’s apartment and pay her rent monthly so I feel I can’t tell her much. I have a savings but most is in a CD account. I had to move and pay for that. Pay for expensive contacts and glasses this month cause I have shitty vision too. Like 1500 for that because my vision is so poor and I need special glasses. \n\n\nOur texts: \n\nOlivia: Okay. Hey can you pay me for violets part of the trip. And she’ll pay you back in a month or two. I don’t have the means for waiting that long, but I know you have a savings account. LOL. So I asked if I can ask you to pay me and she can pay you back and she said well if you have the means for it. \n\nMe: Honestly it’s not my responsibility.\n\nOlivia: I don’t know what made you upset or triggered last night, but when your friends (Violet or I) ask you for help, you don’t need to be insensitive or rude or mean about it. \n\nMe: It’s not my responsibility to pay. I paid my portion. Y’all should have discussed this before. I wasn’t rude. I literally told you it’s not my responsibility. What’s actually insensitive is you assuming that I’ll just fork out that much money to y’all when literally this is not my problem at all. Y’all should have talked about it. And for you approach me so nonchalantly about it and say “lol” when you’re asking me for over a grand to help you out with a problem that y’all should have discussed and I have no part in honestly pissed me off. \n\nOlivia: OK, Vanessa.

      "description": "I met a girl at an event a few weeks ago, and we really hit it off right away. We exchanged numbers and continued chatting, and within a few days decided we'd go out sometime soon. Since she lives sort of far away, though, we decided to meet up whenever is next convenient.\n\nHowever, over the next few weeks as we continue talking she began to become sort of clingy, saying things that I feel should only be said to someone in a relationship, such as \"I really need you right now.\" I asked her if we could slow down, and she said yes and apologized.\n\nA few days later, she mentioned that her last SO up and left her and she was worried I would too, especially since her and I don't live near each other. I told her I was sorry she felt that way but I wasn't comfortable talking hypotheticals about a relationship that doesn't even exist yet (as we haven't even gone on a first date), and that maybe it's better if we don't talk until a few days before we actually meet up (in a few weeks from now).\n\nShe seemed miffed but said yes and we left it at that. I know she feels like she messed up and made herself look like an idiot in front of me, and I like her a lot, but I just feel like she and I weren't moving at the same pace and I feel this is a way of getting her to slow down to my speed. Maybe I shouldn't have even been texting her before the first date, but we were speaking the entire event and it just seemed like a natural continuation of that event.\n\nSo, AITA for asking if we could not talk until we get closer to the date of our first date?",

      "description": "I met her two years ago in an art school. We've been together all the time since then. But due to my insecurities, I am jealous of her, let me explain.\n\nFirstly,her art has always been better than mine. I can tolerate that, I don't mind. I actually really love her art, the problem is when she actually failed at something (because yeah, she doesn't do everything perfectly) and I actually do better for once but she still gets a better grade... \n\nI also envy her personality, it's weird cause at the same time people can hate her because she can be quite agressive and all but people also love her cause she is funny. Like, she is really funny. She can talk to anyone, and as a shy person who'd like to get along with more people I really envy her. That's the reason why teachers love her even though she gets shit grades in any option that isn't artistic and is loud. I have shit grades too but I'm shy and not funny so obviously teachers don't give a fuck about me. \n\nLately, she's been talking to my crush, not often, but they tease each other from times to times and you have no idea how jealous I feel. He doesn't even look at me, he barely aknowledges my existence but he teases her and is playful with her. It makes me feel so bad. \n\nAnd there are other small things, some feeling I get from time to time. \n\nI despise myself for feeling like that, but I can't help it, I'm just too insecure. I love all of what I said about her but at the same time it makes me feel bad. \n\n\nSo, AITH? ",

      "description": "Title sounds weird but the story may help. \n\nSo a couple weeks back one of my friend's girlfriend (we'll call her Grace) came up to me and started to talk to me.\n\nGrace talked about why I haven't asked my friend out (we'll call her Miranda). I told her that she wasn't my type. \n\nMiranda was...a weird girl. Some days she'll come to school normal, but some days she'll come mad or sad (probably over an argument over siblings or parents). She's violent too. She got into a fight last year and got ISS (in school suspension) for 2 days. For her close friends (like me) she'll \"playfully\" hurt them. She would sometimes punch me, kick me, etc. aswell as to others. She also uses foul language most of the time too. She gives out hints that she may likes me (ex. getting too close to me, asking for hugs and if I decline she'll get pissed, etc.)\n\nThat was the reason why Miranda wasn't my type, and why I would never go out with her because she's a foul human being. But you see, I can be nice sometimes so I didn't say all of that to Grace. I told her that her emotions can be mixed up. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's when I said where she'll sometimes be happy, sad, or mad. Forgot to mention that this can change anytime throughout the day.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure Miranda heard what I said, so she was pretty sad for a few days. I avoided her most of the time, and focused on my other friends. Her friends (only like 2 of them) kept saying over and over to say sorry to her. I didn't want to. Why? She's sensitive. When she says something rude to me I could give no shits. But when I say something rude, she'll start complaining how rude I am and shit. It gets annoying which is why I usually act passive towards her.\n\nI forgot what happened later, but here's the aftermath:\nWe started to eachother like before. I try to avoid her sometimes, but when I have no one else to talk to she's the only option.\n\nMiranda ended up being alone for Valentine's Day since I didn't bother to ask her out. I got a very sweet girlfriend and we hung out that time.\n\nYesterday she asked if I don't want to hang out with her anymore since I avoid her most of the time. I didn't answer the question because I don't want to make this situation worse.\n\n\nWhile writing this story, it looks like I was an asshole at some parts but was mostly Miranda that was the asshole. Let me see what you guys think.",

      "description": "I've been a cannabis grower for years in California. When I first started to sell to shops, it was always common to look at the other growers products, and one grower always produced quality that was so much better than the rest of the growers. It turned out the producer had a Ph.D in botany and started growing cannabis with high CO2 saturation levels, well before it was an industry standard.   \n\n\nAs a fellow producer, his product was the only product I was willing to spend money on, as I have more than enough at my own place. As the cannabis industry has matured, his product always has been one step ahead. I've only talked with him a handful of times over the past decade, mostly trouble shooting or trying to get tips here and there, but the last time I talked to him was shortly after all the [cannabis raids](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article207911324.html) in California last year. Many growers were getting nervous as the regulations were changing people who lagged behind were being raided left and right. When I brought it up to him, he was extra somber and told me he's had quite a few friends that got arrested in that specific sting. As realization dawned on me, I asked him if he was connected with the syndicate.  He admitted to such, stating they covered his education and other things. He sells enough of his stuff stateside just to cover local bills, but the bulk of his supply goes back to mainland China.   \n\n\nHis product is amazing, and over the years even my business wasn't always completely on the up and up. So whenever he finishes curing the specific strains my wife and I love, I get a call stating my delivery is on its way. I feel bad knowing I am purchasing from a crime syndicate that more than likely uses that income on more nefarious things other than cannabis and psychedelics.  I've also upgraded over the years, moving from purchasing an Oz here and there from him, to now purchasing about a pound a month. His is the only cannabis I'll buy to resell, as it never has any issues selling out and making more than its money back. So I've contributed a substantial amount over the years.   \n\n\nCurrently, I'm still purchasing from him every month. I've actually been purchasing more as the likelihood of him being raided appears to be higher than it was prior. Does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "We (2 F) just got a new housemate a few days ago and I'm already wishing we hadn't chosen him. \n\nSo, we have a 10 month old baby who crawls everywhere and has her fingers in everything. Our new housemate, G, is a super lovely guy but A. He doesn't wash his hands after going to the toilet (something I've tried hinting at to avoid addressing it directly) and B. He spent 45 minutes in the bathroom trimming goodness knows what hair on his body (I saw him doing his belly &amp; later he closed the door which can only mean pubes, right..?). I left before he finished, and when I got back (He wasn't in) I wanted to do the baby night routine when I found his hair everywhere!! On toothbrushes, contact lens cases, mouth guard etc. When I saw loads floating in baby's bath, I lost it and texted him. I was frank but nice (I asked a friend). While I was at it I mentioned the hand washing. He is also a smoker despite us clearly stating non-smokers only. (He told me he assumed outside is ok. No, it's not, man!) I THINK he now vapes in his room (which I'm not happy about) but he says it's without the nicotine. Either way, his room smells stuffy already. (It drafts into the hall.) Oh, and I also went on a cleaning spree after this and I found parts of the toilet full of pee spray. I'm seriously grossed out. But he is a nice lad! (I haven't talked to him yet because he's still not home but I intend to in the morning. I talked to him about the smoking and he said \"I'll stop. Dont worry.\" But I know from someone who saw him the next day that he had a cigarette.)\n\nAnyway, WIBTA if I give him his notice already? Would that be unfair? Or should I give him a chance and see if he betters himself? ",

This bumps up the price to a total of about $300 for two tickets.\n\nNow, since we broke up she has repeatedly told me that she no longer wants the tickets, until last night when she was out having drinks with our colleagues (we work together. Don’t shit where you eat, folks!) and she suddenly texts me that she now wants the tickets to sell them to our colleague.\n\nI told her no, saying that my Christmas gift to her was to see Postie live, not a bunch of money.\n\nShe can still go see the concert if she want’s to, I’ll gladly pay for her ticket and sell mine to whoever she chooses to bring along. I just think it’s kind of a dick move to text me asking for the tickets to sell them now that she’s seen a chance at some easy money.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is a repost, I changed the typo in my title and cleared up some stuff in the story my friend mentioned didn't make sense. The title is a little biased, he's not the only one in the wrong, that's why I'm posting this here.\n\nI started dating my (ex?)bf February of last year. He was a senior at the time and I was a junior. \n\nWe dated throughout the summer and everything was pretty good, besides some petty couple's fights that would happen.\n\nThis was until about August when the fights started getting worse. It wasn't specifically one person's fault I think both of us could have done better. Later in the month he told me he wanted to join the Army.\n\nNow, at first I flipped absolute shit. I started fights constantly and was upset all the time because he was going to be in basic for almost the entirety of my Senior year. After a little while I calmed down a bit, and so did most of our arguments.\n\nHe was set to ship off to basic September 17. I think it was September 14 we ended up getting in a really petty fight and he came over and broke up with me, I think more because of the accumulation of arguments than that specific one.\n\nNow at this point a lot had been going on but I had missed my period for a whole month now, but I didn't think much of it because I had just gotten the implant, but my friend convinced me to take a test. Bingo. I was pregnant. Apparently there was a loophole that you had to wait a week if you didn't get it on the last day of your period.\n\nI ended up telling him, and I had the test and everything to prove it was real. Now, personally, I'm really pro life, and even though I was 17 I wanted to keep  it, and so did he. He said he wanted to stay broken up for basic, but wanted to get back together after. I agree.\n\nAbout two weeks after he left, I'm doing his streaks on Snapchat and this random girl hits me up and asks what he's been writing to me about (all sweet stuff about how he'd make it right after basic). Turns out the day after he found out I was pregnant he went over to her house to make out and told her he wanted to marry her. I'm pretty pissed, not because he did it, technically we we're broken up, but because he was playing both of us.\n\nLong story short about a month later after she completely shut him down after she found out, we got back together. Right before this had happened however, I had miscarried, but he knew it wasn't just me faking it bc I had gotten an ultrasound at my baby Dr's a week or two before.\n\nI turned 18 in November, but besides that no more eventful things happened. Now of course I wasn't great but everything went well from that point on, and he came home for holiday block leave. He ended up proposing to me on Christmas, and wanted to get married over leave, which is two weeks long. I ended up agreeing, but unfortunately did so too late, we didn't have time to do even a courthouse wedding. We agreed to do it once he came back after graduation to get his stuff (the reason why we were rushing so much was because in the military you have to get married to be able to live together).\n\nThe Wednesday after he left he borrowed his friends phone, because he had somehow snuck it past the drill sergeants. He logged into snap to tell me how excited he was and everything seeing is his graduation is on January 31st. The real problem started this last Saturday when I confirmed my airline tickets to his base and back, and my 4 day hotel stay, both of which were with his parents, as my mother couldn't go. This ended up costing about 800 dollars.\n\nNow everyone at basic regularly gets their phone every Sunday. He missed the first Sunday after leave ended which is understandable. He ends up texting me this past Sunday, which caught me off guard, as it was about an hour after he usually had gotten his phone before.\n\nHe said he had an important topic, and proceeded to tell me that we moved to fast, which I can completely understand, but then pretty much said that we shouldn't have gotten back together after our breakup.\n\nNow the only logical explanation I have is that he talked to his dad before me, and told him we were engaged. This is because he always got his phone on the hour, but this time he didn't text me until about 15 after. Now the problem with his dad, is that even though we used to get along, after the whole pregnancy thing, he was convinced that I was a terrible person, telling my bf that I cheated on him, that the baby wasn't his, that it wasn't a miscarriage, it was an abortion, which literally anyone who knows me knows how strongly I feel against that, and also that I was apparently cheating on him after he left for basic too.\n\nWhen he was back for leave, his dad came up with this huge speech about how I'm manipulating him and how I'm never allowed at his house again, which is why we spent so much time at his mom's when he was home.\n\nAt this point I'm 800 bucks down if I don't get some more information by next Saturday (I was supposed to leave next Tuesday) so I ended up posting on here too get other people's opinions. \n\nAITA for being pissed? Or even the asshole if it seems like I caused the situation?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that with the whole engagement meant that I was prepping to move down to Texas, where he's getting stationed after basic. I have about two weeks left of online classes and was starting to pack up for the move.",

      "description": "I’m going to keep this ambiguous as possible for legal reasons. Also I don’t have the immediate leverage to get someone to lose their license but it’s been a dispute in my family that irritates me to no end. \n\nI had an immediate family member suffer a life-ending injury from a mistake made by a doctor. There is proof of this in writing. The day of the incident someone in my family (who wasn’t the patient) noted the doctor was late, and seemingly stressed so they mentioned to postpone the procedure. Doctor goes ahead with procedure, fuckup happens and now legal case ensues. After the incident it took years to get records of what actually happened, and the hospital was being very tight lipped about everything in the immediate aftermath. \n\nThe same family member who expressed concern to the doctor now keeps saying they don’t want to be vindictive and don’t want this doctor to lose their livelihood. I wholly disagree, as their mistake was clear negligence and cost me and my family someone I loved and will never get back, when it was a simple procedure that should have gone through with minimal fuckups. My deceased family member had a good chance of increased life expectancy after the procedure. I don’t want to entertain the chance they can destroy someone’s life and family like this again. The person who disagrees with me is the front of the legal case, and refuses my opinion entirely, under the guise of “good catholic faith” \n\nAITA for wanting justice or being too “vindictive” about what happened?

And we kinda hit it off.\n\nHe likes anime, I like anime and we are both artist. (Him more than me)\n\nHe asked for my number after 5 classes. We start talking and I started to like him.\n\nHe liked me too. But, I am currently waiting for someone and I told him this when he confessed.\n\nEver since he confessed, he's been texting me \"I want to live with you forever\" and \"joke about calling me girlfriend.\n\nI was fine with this ,but I asked him not to tell anyone about us, as drama spreads around our school like wildfire.\n\n5 days after I told him this, I found out our class, his best friend, AND his other classmates found out about us.\n\nNow, he is VERY sensitive, and I love that but I have to watch what I say to him. You will soon find out why.\n\nSo I confronted him about this and he said that he was talking about me in another class.\n\nHe said he was sorry and we moved on. But I found out the hard way that he is not boyfriend material.\n\n(Not wanting to release his family dynamic...I'll just give a slight insight) He does not have a male role model in his life and tells me whenever I make him upset that I'm lucky for having one. \n\nOr say that I;m going to cut myself. I was scared to cut him off because I thought he would, in fact do it...\n\nHe told me that he loved me even though I said I'm waiting and even asked can't I just move in with the both of you!\n\nI told him, firmly, \"we can't be together. We can only be friends\" He did the toxic cycle of \"I'm going to cut myself\" and \"You're so lucky you have a dad\" for awhile.\n\n(There is another story about him in between these two events and belongs on AITA. Ask if you want that story)\n\nBut a few days later, he is in love with my best friend. I want to prevent her from being with him. AITA? Please tell me.",

      "description": "Seriously, I need to know. Part of me feels like I'm being unreasonable, but the other part feels I'm completely justified.\n\nMy bf likes to drink. When he does drink, he does it to get drunk. He's not the \"drink a couple beers or glass of wine\" type of guy, but a \"drink a whole six-pack or twelve pack and want more\" type. He doesn't drink often, once a week, sometimes twice, but I don't like it, moreso since our baby was born in August. When he drinks, he becomes unpredictable, and I never know whether I'm gonna get the nice guy, or the irrational, aggressive guy. He isn't physically abusive, just overthinks shit, becomes nitpicky, paranoid, says weird or mean things.. I become riddled with anxiety whenever he gets booze, to the point where now I just avoid him completely when he drinks. I'll take the baby and sleep in another room so I don't have to worry. He will stay up all night, then sleep all day the next. \n\nWhat bothers me most is how, when he wants to drink, he seems to \"need\" it. He always asks my permission to drink, but even if I tell him \"no, don't drink\", he just gives me the cold shoulder til I say \"fine, okay\". Now I just tell him he can do whatever he wants, he's an adult, but I'm not gonna pretend to be okay with it. I tell him how it makes me feel, but he will still go and get the booze. He seems to prioritize drinking over my feelings. I don't even know if I'm right to be feeling as shitty as I do when he drinks, I try to be okay with it, but I'm just not and can't fight the impending doom feeling that I get when he does it. He's even gone as far as to say I don't love him as much as I say I do if I'm not okay with him being a drinker. He's happy with me and my faults, so why can't I be happy with his?\n\nI feel extra shitty because he says he wants to drink on Christmas Eve. It's our baby's first Christmas so I don't want to spend it being scared, upset, or sleeping in another room to avoid him. I want him to be sober, watch Christmas movies together, and not have him acting resentful towards me for not being \"allowed\" to drink when he wants. He feels I'm infringing on his right as an adult to do whatever he wants. I like drinking too sometimes, but I don't like getting drunk often and when I drink I just wanna have fun, joke around, laugh, but I feel like it's never like that with him. \n\nAm I being an asshole? Because I feel like an asshole for not being okay with his drinking. ",

      "description": "I live with a roommate who I was friends with before I moved in with them, which was the first problem-I know that you're not supposed to move in with your friends but I thought maybe this time it would be ok. The entire time that we've lived together they've had an issue with blowing up (throwing things, yelling, anger issues) that I didn't realize they had before. I have mental health issues but I'm going to therapy for them and trying to work through the trauma that caused them. They're on full time disability for unfortunate physical health situations.  They don't make a lot of money, under 1k a year. I work 35-45 hour weeks, sometimes night shifts, and am trying to save up enough money to go back to school but my sanity level is getting pretty worn out because I feel like I'm constantly on edge waiting for my friend to have one of their blow ups. Even when there isn't a blow up they never have an actually *good* day, due to their health conditions they're very isolated and always in a negative mood.\n\n After nine months of this I realized I wanted out and want to get my own place. It's bad for my mental health to live here. Now I don't make a lot but I think I can manage to find a place in the three months remaining on our lease. I brought it up to my friend and they had a blow up. A major one, I almost called the cops, had to leave the house because I didn't feel safe. After a couple days we talked rationally and they think that they will be homeless if I move out because they don't make much money and are scared to live with other people who don't know about their mental or physical conditions.\n\nAm I the asshole for still wanting to move out? I'm exhausted and I feel like the boundaries we've started trying to put in place so we have space from each other are too little too late. I really don't want to end up making my roommate homeless and I'm feeling a lot of guilt right now.",

      "description": "Let us start this post with a bit of context:\n\nI have terrible eczema. Just terrible. On terrible days, my skin will crack to the point where I will bleed or see the exposed flesh **inside** my fingers.\n\nAs part of my diagnosis over the years, I've done allergy tests and have been told my various doctors to avoid pets and swimming pools. Officially according to the results, I'm not allergic to dogs, but I'm allergic to cats, dust, and various types of pollen.\n\nYesterday, we went to my best friends place and his SO has a dog so the dog was running around all over the place. Trying to be respectful, I maintained a good distance from the dog and avoided sitting on any cloth furniture. He has been my best friend for over half my life, so I made the concession to go to his place to have a nice social outing with a larger group of friends.\n\nMy SO was on the couch with a few other friends playing with the dog. My SO picks up the dog, pets it, lets it lie all over her body and lick her all over her hands and face.\n\nWhen it's time to leave, I tell her we should swing by her place so she can take a shower because she has been frolicking with the dog. She looks at me offended like I told her she was obese to her within earshot of all her friends. She says no and that I'm overreacting.\n\nOur friends, who are WebMD doctors say allergy tests are really bad and that I'm being an asshole and overreacting about the dog. I understand people love dogs, but these owners aren't exactly the cleanest people. The dog has a piss pad at the door. It obviously doesn't clean itself afterwards and then rubs itself all along the furniture and people. It sheds like no other dog I've seen. I don't think my friend has any \"black\" clothing left. Am I being too anal about this?\n\nTLDR: I have terrible eczema and everyone + my SO thinks I'm the asshole when my SO frolicked with a hairy dog and I asked her to take a shower before going to my place.",

But me being the polyamorous person I am I ended up ending things because she is monogamous. Well it’s now two months later and she’s thinking about dating this guy Mathew. Now I’ve known Mathew since before I knew Rachel. And Mathew has known for a while that Rachel is very special to me. And Rachel has talked to me about them wanting to see where they could go, but Mathew hasn’t. And I respect the shit out of Mathew, he’s a fantastic guy that always is thinking about others. He’s very generous and altruistic and I know he cares and respects me the same. But the fact that he hasn’t made an attempt to talk to me about wanting to date the girl that I care very much about is irking me beyond belief. I feel disrespected and ignored and like I don’t matter to Mathew at all. I am not very much upset or jealous at Rachel wanting to be with someone else, that’s understandable. But I would like to be in the loop. These are two people that I care about greatly and I think they care about me the same. I’m just here steaming and I don’t know what to do because if I talk to Mathew first it wouldnt be him genuinely talking to me about it before going for it. What irks me even more is that his ex, who he’s been apart from for a month, has been shooting me some signs and I’ve been ignoring them because of how much I respect Mathew. And here he is doing the opposite to me. So fun AITA?",

      "description": "My wife, \"Viv\", works two days a week in education. I work full time. I have flexible hours within certain limits. Two years ago when she was applying we discussed it and decided that we could make two days a week work for us. Since our kids aren't in school or daycare yet, I've been using my off day to care for them while she works, and her mom comes to care for them on the other day. So far so good.\n\nEvery month I have to change my work schedule to accommodate hers. Every month there's at least one meeting that's outside her regular hours which requires me to change my whole work schedule to provide care for our kids. I love my kids, and I don't mind caring for them — I'm their dad, after all, it's in the job description! — bit I hate having to move meetings and deadlines around. I feel like her boss is a shit communicator and shittier planner who cannot seem to schedule these \"all hands on deck\" meetings until the last minute. Then Viv comes home saying it was pointless and that an email would have done the job nicely.\n\nBut when I've discussed it with Viv I feel like an asshole. It has been over a year now; I know how disorganized her boss is and it doesn't usually affect me a whole lot. And I want Viv to work if she wants to. Of all the jobs she's had while we have been together this one seems to be the best one for her in terms of work stress and ability to do what she wants in her time off. So I feel bad that I haven't adjusted. \n\nAm I the asshole? And if so, how can I adjust my attitude? ",

We messaged back and forth for a while, he said he compares everyone to me, that I was his best, etc. \n\nWhile we were together, I was the star student at school - popular, smart, all that jazz.

Meanwhile, since he's gone to college abroad he isn't aware of my breakdown lol.\n\nI really don't want to meet him in this state or at least until I get a grasp of my life. I'm embarrassed and don't want him to think, \"good riddance!\" (He's a pretty great guy with a great heart but still) I've been ignoring his messages on social media.

But this is the most recent.\n\n\nSo this motherfucker got a $1100 Ticket for driving on a Suspended plate and no registration. I found out because we haven’t heard from him and he wasn’t answering his phone so I googled his ass and his name came up on the County court website. I managed to get ahold of him and he assured me that he would show up.\n\nA month later my grandmother gets a letter stating that because he missed his court date his license was suspended and was given until the end of the month to pay or a bench warrant would be issued.\n\nI wanted his ass to go to jail. But my grandma wants to pay the ticket. And she needs help. My help. I’m sick and fucking tired of playing little big brother and spending my god damned money on him. I’ve been working 2-3 16 hour days for over time to try and build up my emergency fund FOR ME and now I got to use some of my pay to help this son of a bitch. \n\nI don’t know if he would actually go to jail or community service but I think it would be best for him to be an adult and take responsibility. He was unemployed for over a year because he’s fucking lazy and smokes too much weed, and has no idea about how to be an adult. Instead of going to the fucking court he decided to get high and sleep all day.\nAnd just let the fucking thing be.\n\nSo now I got to drive my ass to my grandmothers pick his ass up and go to the fucking court.

They've had issues from the very beginning of the relationship but lately it's seems like it's getting worse. She constantly comes to me and our other friends crying about things this boy said to her/did to her/ the way he treats her. Some of these things I would describe as borderline emotional abusive.\n\nI tried being very supportive at first but at this point it's been so long the only advice I can really give her is to walk away from the relationship, and we've offered to help her with that/help her get help. She basically flat out states she isn't willing to do this or even willing to see this boy less. In addition, 90% of the time after we're done listening to her and trying to provide support, she goes straight to this boys house.\n\nI basically told my friend that until she's willing to do something about it, I can't hear about it anymore. It's emotionally tolling on me to see my friend in pain and not be able to do anything about it.  However, she has basically told my other friends that I'm isolating her and making the situation worse.\n\nAITA for telling her not to come to me until she's willing to change?

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to hang out with a guy I met in the first week of college?",
      "description": "For context: I graduated high school last year and am currently in the process of finishing up my first semester of college at a small liberal-arts type school (just in case that matters).\n\nI’ve written everything as objectively as I can here.\n\nWhen I arrived at college, one of the first people I met was a guy (let’s call him K) who lived in the room next to me (our rooms are separated by a bathroom). We hit it off pretty well, as we had similar interests and he seemed to be a super nice guy. We hung out almost every day for the first month to month and a half of school. However, as I got to know K, I started to like him less and less. There were red flags here and there that sort of threw me off— being weirdly rude to people for seemingly no reason, being very imposing and controlling in the way he talks and portrays himself, stuff like that. I didn’t think of it much at the time, I just sort of assumed it was his was of adjusting to college life.\n\nThen some bigger incidents took place. There are a few of these that I would rather not go into publicly because they’re pretty questionable and I want to protect his privacy, but if you need to, PM me and I’ll explain them. Still, I didn’t pay them a whole lot of attention, because most people make mistakes when they first move to college.\n\nOne incident sort of made me realize that it wasn’t just adjusting to college. One night (while he was a little drunk) a girl we were hanging out with told him that there was a guy living downstairs (who he hadn’t met) who didn’t like him. While this really shouldn’t have been brought up in the first place, it was and K went low-key apeshit. He started yelling about how it's not fair to judge someone you don’t know and how you can’t form opinions on people if you’ve never met them. He then proceeded to call this guy a fucktard.\n\nAt this point I was starting to realize that maybe I didn’t want to be spending as much time as I had been with this guy. Not wanting to make a big deal about it, I was just planning on not hanging out with him as much, until we either ended up not really talking anymore, or he settled in. While I don’t think this would’ve been an issue, I then found out that he had labeled me as his “best friend.” While he had made a couple comments about this before, I always thought he was joking, because I had literally met him less then a month before, which, in my mind, is not even close to knowing someone long enough to call them your “best friend.” I wasn’t entirely sure what to do, so I vaguely continued on with my plan of not hanging out with him as much.\n\nThat Friday night I was in another friend's room with some people from our hall, having not invited K as we were all a little fed up and wanted a break. Allegedly, he walked past this room, heard us in there and sort of lost it. He texted me and asked if I thought he was annoying. When I responded, I essentially responded with the blunt truth; I didn’t think he was annoying, but he was being extremely childish, immature, and frankly unpleasant, and I didn’t want to continue hanging out if he was going to continue with this behavior. This caused some drama, including K cutting off a lot of the friends he had made in college (and even one he knew from back home) purely because they were either “involved in the Xrazil situation” or continued to talk to me. After this blew over, I thought the whole situation would also just blow over, but boy was I wrong. \n\nOver thanksgiving break I happened to be in the same area as K’s friend from back home that he had cut off, and she invited me over to her house to hang after thanksgiving dinner. I think it’s important to note that K’s friend and I are purely friends, I have no interest of pursuing anything sexual or romantic with her. Nevertheless, K found out that I was at her house on thanksgiving and sent her an extremely rude and provocative message. While again, I won’t explicitly repeat it as I want to protect his privacy, it was implying that K’s friend and I were hooking up, which is not true at all. I offered to explain to K that we’re not involved, but K’s friend said to just leave it be, so I did.\n\nYET AGAIN, I wrongly assumed this would be the end of it. Our school hosted a dance-like event last weekend and K happened to show up about half an hour after I did. While on his way to say hi to someone next to me, he gave me what I can only describe as a “friendly bro greeting,” where he essentially just punched me in the chest. In fact, at first I thought he legitimately just punched me and continued on his way, because there was some force behind it, but the more I think about it the more I think he was just trying to say hi. Either way it made me pretty uncomfortable, so I ended up leaving pretty early.\n\nYesterday I heard from a friend who’s on a sports team with K that he was telling some teammates about a kid on his floor who “screwed him over,” clearly referencing me. I then heard from this same friend that K wanted me to know I “drove a splinter through his heart that he could never fix” and that he’s “happy to rekindle the friendship as soon as I apologize for what I did to him.” While I’ll be the first person to tell you that I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have, this whole notion that I “screwed him over” makes no sense to me. I never told anyone to stop hanging out with him, and I would never do that. I’m a firm believer in being friends with whoever you want to be friends with, whether other people like them or not. Additionally, the idea of apologizing to him for not wanting to hang out also confuses me, because I still don’t want to hang out with him.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? Or did I just handle a situation poorly?\n\nAnd yes, I do understand that this ALL sounds very childish in terms of drama, but nevertheless I've found myself involved in it so would like some objective input from reddit. \n\nTLDR: Met a guy at the start of my freshman year of college and hung out with him until he started rubbing me the wrong way. Now he’s telling people that I “screwed him over” and that I should apologize to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for calling my Dad at 12AM to settle a dispute with my stepdad?",
      "description": "Background Info: I am 16 years old and I mostly live with my Mom and my Stepdad and every now and then go to my Dad's house. For the most part, I always tend to get into arguments with my stepdad at least once a month over something dumb.  I never really liked him all too much as he always finds a way to ruin something good\n\nWell today's argument was over the matters of my wisdom teeth removal. The argument was over the fact that I should go to sleep in five minutes ( The time was 12AM during Spring Break) to be well-rested for the removal of my wisdom teeth. I was playing video games with my friends on PS4 so you could imagine I got very defensive leading to me threatening to call my Dad.\n\nFlashback to earlier today and I was eating my last crunchy meal with my Dad before I get my wisdom teeth removed. He said along the lines of that I should play video games and stay up so I would sleep off the pain from the wisdom teeth removal.\n\n I called my Dad on my phone to settle the dispute and I realized the time was 12 AM and I suddenly felt very guilty for waking up my Dad to settle such a stupid dispute with my Stepdad. \n\nI got what I wanted in the end( stay up granted that I get 8 hours of sleep as the surgery is not till 1PM ) but at the expense of my Father's sleep and bitterness with my Stepdad\n\nAITA for waking up my Dad? \n\nP.S. Sorry for any grammar mistakes this was really rushed as this dispute with my Stepdad just happened and I wanted to type this out as fast as possible to get input and advice.",

So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don’t allow anyone who hasn’t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don’t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn’t need to be updated so they don’t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think?

      "description": "My office is a cubicle farm, and my cubicle is on the edge of my work group's zone.  My neighbor who is not my coworker is \"Joanne\", and she's a very nice woman as far as I can tell.\n\nLike many cubicle farms, the unspoken rule seems to be that you ignore anything you hear that isn't directed at you.  However, you still can hear...and I've heard Joanne talking to people on the phone (presumably family members, based on context) about a problem her college-aged son is going through.  Very specifically, he has tried to drop a semester for medical reasons, was denied, appealed, and then was denied again.  The medical drop is under particular circumstances which aren't important to the question.\n\nNow, four years ago I got a retroactive medical drop from the same university in the same circumstances, and based on the details of what I can overhear, this person is going about the documentation and appeal process *all wrong*, and based on my experience I can give some advice on how to restructure it and some additional types of documentation to pursue that would drastically improve the chances of a future appeal being accepted.  This coworker seems nice, and I hate to have someone with a failed semester on their record just because they don't know how to document.  On the other hand, the circumstances are potentially very embarrassing to my coworker, and I don't want to make her uncomfortable or upset.\n\nWIBTA for trying to pass her advice?  Is there a way I can pass her advice that would minimize the level of assholery?",

I wasn’t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI’ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it’s my choice and I don’t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  ",

      "description": "Background: My parents are divorced and have been for many years. I’m a Freshman in high school and I live with my Mom, Step Dad, my brother, and my sister. I am the oldest sibling. The three of us go to the Other House during the weekends. At the Other House there are my two step brothers, though they may or may not be there depending on the day.\n\n  I hate it at the Other House. The parents argue every other week (It used to be every week). If any of the children are being chewed out anything we say is wrong or is arsenal for them to use.\n\n  For example: My bio dad would demand to know why the kitchen wasn’t mopped when they left us home. One of my step brothers said that we had moved the carpet back to where it belonged before we went downstairs. Bio dad sternly said “We? We who? Be specific!” Then my step brother said that it was him, my brother, and me. Then, later on in the “conversation” step bro says that we were all on a game downstairs. That’s when bio dad asked “Why did you say ‘we’ are you trying to get everyone else in trouble too?” I said quickly, “You told him to be specific, sir.” I was terrified to say the least. He said, “I wasn’t talking to you!”\n\n  There have been multiple times where I have almost cried because of these “conversations” and if any of us were to cry in front of the parents we would get yelled at more. Thus causing whoever cried to be more frightened and it becomes a cycle.\n\n  Months later I gave bio dad a phone he had given me because of all of the restrictions they had recently put on it for “my safety.” Mom offered to get me a phone and I accepted because I knew she wouldn’t look through it whenever she wanted and would stop me from getting sites like Reddit. The Other House wouldn’t allow me these sites because I could message other people. The next weekend I went over there they (bio dad and step mom) kept forcing me to tell them why I would do that to them and “Why didn’t you ask us to lessen the restrictions.” Yes, I did try but the response was always something like “You aren’t on your phone much, so it shouldn’t effect you.” \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanted to never see them again when I get out of high school?",
